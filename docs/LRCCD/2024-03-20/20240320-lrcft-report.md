Thank you, President Haynes, trustees, and Chancellor King.

Our LRCFT Executive Board voted recently to provide $1000 to each of the 5 affinity-based student graduations in May.

We also funded Integration Bees for students at 2 of the Los Rios campuses.

On March 7, Los Rios students and faculty, including student trustee Jay Doherty, took part in The March in March for affordable and accessible higher education. The event was organized by the CFT. Over 500 students from colleges throughout the state marched across Tower Bridge and rallied at the Capitol. Major news outlets covered the event. We also want to thank trustee Kelly Wilkerson for attending. As usual, the students drove the movement and will organize the event next year. CFT created a video of the march:

The LRCFT continues to campaign for our endorsed candidates in the mayor, city council, and Assembly races after the March primary. We congratulate Maggie Krell, Florence Cofer, Roger Dickinson, and Eric Guerra for their electoral success.

During our spring break, Los Rios faculty attended a three-day CFT Higher Education conference in Sacramento. The event coincided with the legislative conference of the California Labor Federation. We met with members of the state assembly and senate to discuss new higher education bills sponsored by the CFT.

Congratulations to Dr. Angelo Williams for being named as one of the Sacramento Beeâ€™s Equity Lab and Nehemiah Emerging Leaders Program (NELP) to honor Top 20 Black change makers in Sacramento. He is being honored for being an "innovative problem-

"solvers and a leader who not only seek solutions but change cultures to help others find a path to improving lives." Angelo, wears many hats -- in addition to being the Chief Deputy Director for First 5 California, also works as an adjunct faculty member in Sacramento City College's Sociology Department. He is also a former member of the LRCFT Executive Board. This Friday, he will be honored at The Unity Changemakers Event being held at Sacramento State.

In closing, we are currently making plans for participating in the Cesar Chavez day march, the largest annual labor event in Sacramento. The LRCFT is a major sponsor as we have done in the past. Conversing with Los Rios students and the community is a highlight of the event.

Thank you!
