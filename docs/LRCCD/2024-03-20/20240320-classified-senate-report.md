![LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT CLASSIFIED SENATE](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=LOS+RIOS+COMMUNITY+COLLEGE+DISTRICT+CLASSIFIED+SENATE)

**Board of Trustees Report – March 2021**

**SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE**  
Kevin Williams, Classified Senate President

SCC Classified Senate will begin their nomination and Election Process to fill the two Senate Seats that will be vacated at the end of this senate year. That being the President, and Vice President. Elections are plan to be concluded in April, and the new officers announced in May.

SCC Classified Senate will host a Classified Retreat this year. This event will take place in person, and it will serve as a day of professional development. Topics will include stress reduction, a presentation of campus IT services and training for Service Central, and a presentation by SCC Caring Campus. It is scheduled to take place May 22nd.

The SCC Classified Professions would like me to express how important Caring Campus is to our college’s community. It allows us to be more connected to each other and have much needed support to better serve our students. They would also like me to iterate that it is essentially important that the Classified voices be provided professional development time, and time for participatory governance to support student success efforts.

Classified Moral is a little low at the moment, and the upcoming budget decrease that the district is facing has many worried. They also feel that major decisions within Los Rios, but outside of the campuses get made without getting input from classified professionals. It often feels that they find out after decisions are made and this makes it difficult for collegiate and collaborative work environments.

Thank you for your time.
