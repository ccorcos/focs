# Workforce Challenges in Sacramento

- Sacramento is facing a labor force shortage - there are more jobs (1.2M) than workers (1.1M).
- Compared to the state, Sacramento has a lower workforce participation rate.
- Nearly 75% of unemployed residents are prime working-age. Sacramento’s Black, Native, Hispanic and male residents are over-represented in unemployment.
- While there is significant demand for jobs at every educational level, wages are higher for jobs that require more training and education than a high school diploma.

# Career Education: Opportunities for Improvement

- While CE programs generally match the diversity of our student body, some programs fall short in this area.
- Female students are over-represented in programs that lead to lower-wage careers.

**Call to Action:** We must ensure that African American students have access to and successfully complete high-wage CE programs.
