Los Rios Community College District Indigenous Land Acknowledgment Statement  
In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our four colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

## Recommendation for Adoption by the Board of Trustees

**Mar 20, 2024**

## COURSE PROPOSALS

### Course Deletions

**Folsom Lake College**

1. **CISW 320 Introduction to Web Development (3.00 units)**  
   **Justification:** This course has not been offered in a long time, and no longer meets student needs.

2. **CISW 400 Client-side Web Scripting (4.00 units)**  
   **Justification:** This course has not been offered in a long time, and no longer meets student needs.

### New to District Courses

**American River College**

1. **FT 100: Fire Service Conditioning and Fire Academy Preparation (2.50 units)**  
   **Prerequisite:** None.  
   **20 hours lecture, 100 hours laboratory**  
   This course covers strength training, flexibility and overall physical conditioning to prepare a student to take the Candidate Physical Ability Test. Additional topics include personal skills development, lifestyle modifications, and firefighting equipment familiarization.  
   **Justification:** This course will provide a foundation for recruits who wish to enter the fire academy by providing physical training, equipment familiarization, and skill preparation.

2. **INDIS 355 United Kingdom Life and Culture in Study Abroad (3.00 units)**  
   **Prerequisite:** None.  
   **Enrollment Limitation:** The student must complete the pre-enrollment process into the Los Rios Community College District Study Abroad program as required by the American Institute for Foreign Studies (AIFS).  
   **54.00 hours lecture**  

15
<!-- Page 16 -->
![HOME](https://losrios.edu)

This course is designed to allow students to acquire a level of global competence with an emphasis on United Kingdom life and culture while enrolled in the Los Rios Study Abroad program. Global competence is a continuing process of acquiring specific economic, historical, and geo-political knowledge, which supports the intercultural communication skills and authentic lived experiences that allow a person to function in another culture and result in attitudes of cultural appreciation and interdependence. While participating in a specific Study Abroad program the student will have opportunities to study and generally survey the host country's historical, cultural, and geopolitical influences, as well as the societal structures, to develop an understanding and appreciation of the host culture as different from U. S. American culture. Students may find information about the pre-enrollment meetings at the Study Abroad website, located at https://losrios.edu/academics/programs-and-majors/los-rios-study-abroad.

**Justification:** This course is a required course for students enrolled and participating in the Los Rios Community College District's "Study Abroad Program" in the United Kingdom.

### 3. MATH 309 Calculus Concepts for non-STEM Majors (3.00 units)

**Prerequisite:** Through the Los Rios Placement Process or successful completion of Algebra II/Integrated Math 3 or Intermediate Algebra.

54.00 hours lecture

This course presents the basic concepts and applications of calculus without the technicalities of engineering-level courses, providing a perspective on the foundational tools of our high-tech society. Topics include finding slopes, speeds, areas, volumes, and optimal values.

**Justification:** Non-STEM majors are offered few opportunities to learn about calculus, one of the primary tools used to build our contemporary high-tech society. However, the essential concepts and applications of calculus are readily accessible with a minimum of technicalities for those who wish to broaden their horizons by becoming acquainted with the basic ideas.

### Cosumnes River College

1. **CMT 335 Project Management II (3.00 units)**

**Prerequisite:** CMT 334 with a grade of "C" or better.

54.00 hours lecture

This course covers the diverse roles and responsibilities of a project manager. Students will learn how to communicate and coordinate with the construction team using contextual learning applications in combination with scenario-based exercises. Critical thinking skills, contingency planning, schedule and budget management, and team coordination management skills are all developed while managing a mock project.

**Justification:** The class takes the skills learned in CMT 334 Project Management I and implements it into a "real world" based scenario practice. Students work on a mock project and experience the different roles and responsibilities of team members that might interact on a construction project.

# PROGRAM PROPOSALS

## New Programs

### American River College

1. **Liberal Studies for Elementary Teacher Education**

   This is a multidisciplinary program designed for students planning to teach in the elementary school setting. The coursework provides students with foundational knowledge necessary for transfer to a teacher preparation program at a four-year college or university and career success as educators, including courses covering pedagogy, professional knowledge, and discipline specific subject matter. Further education at the university level will be necessary to fulfill the requirements for a teaching credential authorizing service in California public schools. Required preparation for a bachelor’s degree in this major can vary widely, so it is critical that students planning to transfer to a four-year college or university meet with a counselor.

   **Justification:** This degree was developed as a better articulated path for future educators planning to attend CSUS for a Liberal Studies degree. CSUS was selected because, to the best of our ability to tell (without a usable degree path), 84% of our students completing ECE 350/ENGED 324 (the core elementary teacher education course) transferred to CSUS. The current ADT does not articulate well for these students, so a different program path was needed.

2. **Mental Behavioral Health**

   The Apprenticeship certificate program in Mental Behavioral Health centers around the specific skills and abilities necessary to provide comprehensive mental behavioral health counseling. Course work includes chemical dependency, abnormal behavior, co-occurring disorders, confidentiality, professional ethics, diversity, managing crises, and client screening, education, and counseling. Upon completion of the certificate students will be equipped for entry level counseling and case management positions in behavioral health programs that treat individuals with persistent mental illness.

   **Justification:** The Apprenticeship certificate program in Mental Behavioral Health centers around the specific skills and abilities necessary to provide comprehensive mental behavioral health counseling. Course work includes chemical dependency, abnormal behavior, co-occurring disorders, confidentiality, professional ethics, diversity, managing crises, and client screening, education, and counseling. This non-traditional apprenticeship program is being created to address the staffing shortages in our community and has been promoted and greatly wanted by industry partners.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT
**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** March 20, 2024

---

**SUBJECT:** LRSA Salary Schedule Revision, 2023-2024  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

---

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item J  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
Los Rios created a Mental Health Clinician Supervisor job description in August 2023 at a pay range of 22V in the hopes of hiring four supervisors under this new job description. Mental health is a critical issue for our students, and as such, this position is responsible for supervising, coordinating, and performing a variety of mental health services, including but not limited to assessment and evaluation, individual/group therapy, personal and crisis intervention, mental health emergency triage and response, case management, coordination and connection with college and community resources, faculty and staff consultations, and coordinate/develop workshops and outreach activities. The educational requirements are a Master’s degree and a State of California certificate or license to practice therapy.

In September 2023, November 2023, and February 2024 four positions were posted at the salary range of 22V. All three searches failed as the selected candidates declined the offers of employment due to salary placement not being competitive in the current market for licensed therapists. In March 2024, the range will be increased to 26V, pending Board approval, in the hopes of finding four candidates.

The District proposes to increase the pay from Range 22V (Annual Salary $79,466-$100,550) to Range 26V (Annual Salary $92,964-$117,629).

---

**STATUS:**  
Effective March 20, 2024, the proposed Interim 2023-2024 LRSA Salary Schedule would be modified as reflected in the attachment.

---

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the revised Interim 2023-2024 LRSA Salary Schedule with the classification changes.

**STATUS:**  
Katie was born in Salinas, CA where she attended Hartnell College and in 1984 she obtained a General Education associate degree. Katie then transferred to UC Berkeley and graduated in 1986 with a degree in Business Administration – Accounting and she relocated to Sacramento.

Katie has worked as a full-time employee within the Los Rios Community College District since 1994. She started working in the District Fiscal Operations unit as an Account Clerk III on April 18, 1994. Katie’s supervisor when she started in the District Office was Theresa Matista, and upon Theresa’s promotion, Katie next reported to Carrie Bray, General Accounting Supervisor. She worked at DO Fiscal Operations for four years before successfully applying for the CRC Administrative Services Analyst position in 1998. When Katie started at CRC in 1998, her supervisor was Kathleen Kirkland who soon promoted to the VPA position at Folsom Lake College. Upon Kathleen Kirkland’s departure, Katie applied and was selected by former CRC VPA Chris Brown as the new CRC Business Services Office Supervisor in November 1998.

Katie has worked for LRCCD for almost 30 years – 25 of those years in the CRC Business Office. Over her LRCCD career Katie has supported the college/district and supported her colleagues and students. Colleagues in the BSO commented “ever since I started working here in the BSO, I have been impressed with Katie’s work ethic and the professional, yet very pleasant, office atmosphere she has created and maintains. Katie makes sure that the faculty, staff, and students are being served by our office efficiently and thoroughly. Although she is very busy with her duties, she is approachable and gracious. Katie touches base with us as BSO employees often, asking how we are doing (both with work and in our personal lives) and is very considerate and thoughtful in making sure that we are doing ok and in replying to time needed for medical or personal matters.”

Colleagues in Admissions and Records commented “it’s hard to believe that it’s been over two decades since we first crossed paths…processing transcript payments to working together over budgets, with EOPS, CARE, foster youth services, NAHER, Puente and most recently TRIO SSS, it’s been quite the journey, filled with growth, and cherished memories. I remember the days of typewriters and NCR forms, where precision was paramount, and any errors meant additional costs. Katie’s guidance and expertise in navigating budgetary matters was the artery in helping me understand the intricacies of the business office (blanket orders, requisitions, campus-based vs DO Blanket orders, various accounts, journal and budget entrees, new hires, payroll, etc.) and how it supports the institution and all operational programming of categorical and affinity programs, we could not operate without working together. Your mantra of "do it right the first time, and you won’t waste an NCR form" has stuck with me throughout my career, instilling in me a commitment to accuracy and attention to detail. You and your team have been the backbone of Cosumnes River College, tirelessly ensuring that everything runs smoothly behind the scenes.”

In addition to the examples cited above Katie works to ensure classified professionals are equipped with the resources and tools necessary to successfully navigate the college business/district processes. She spearheads training on business office processes and she relies upon individuals she has trained throughout the college to train new CRC classified professionals. Recently, Katie led online training with three CRC classified professionals and representatives from DO Fiscal which covered a range of business process and which is now immortalized in the BSO website for anyone to view.

Finally, Katie has served as the Classified Tri-Chair for the CRC Resources Committee since 2017-18. The Tri-Chair model means designated Administrative, Classified, and Faculty employees lead college wide participatory governance committees to empower their respective constituencies and duties. The tri-chair model is unique to CRC and strives to provide increased transparency and encourages greater collaboration between and among organizational units or committees with overlapping responsibilities. Katie has supported the Resource Committee through her role in the business office - her insight and observations related to resource allocations; expenditure guidelines and historical deployments of resources has been invaluable.

CRC is lucky to have Katie DeLeon as part of our team and it is our honor to nominate her for the California Community College District Classified Employee of the Year for 2024.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees endorse the nomination of Katie DeLeon, of Cosumnes River College, for the 2024 California Community Colleges Classified Employee of the Year Award.

**BACKGROUND:**  
The Student Health & Wellness Centers on all four college campuses provide students with on-campus and in-person access to a host of free physical and mental health services. Among the many services provided is the delivery of free teletherapy services, aimed at providing accessible virtual teletherapy daily, including evenings and weekends. A teletherapy provider allows our Student Health & Wellness Centers to expand mental health services beyond the traditional school day, ensuring we provide equitable access to mental health care for all our students, whether they are taking classes in-person or virtually and during the day or evening.

The District issued RFP 24006 for Teletherapy for students. Five responsive proposals were received. The selected vendor BetterMynd provides responsive pricing based on the number of teletherapy sessions purchased, with the ability to roll-over unused sessions into following years. The estimated annual spend will not exceed $267,500 and may be lower, based on utilization in prior years. The contract term will be effective for an initial term of one year with the District’s option to renew annually for a total contract period of three years or rebid.
