# March 2024

## District Academic Senate (DAS) President, Alisa Shubb, Reports

- At the March 5th meeting the DAS passed a resolution supporting accounting of instructional items removed, ordered, and replaced under the Moratorium on Use of Human Remains (final page of this report). This resolution also addresses items that have been removed from instructional use that are outside the scope of the Moratorium.
  - **Explanation:** The Moratorium supported by the District Academic Senate on Oct 3, 2023 prohibited, among other things, the “use or creation of images and reproductions of Native American human remains and cultural items under the control of the Los Rios Community College District”. However, subsequent consultation with tribal leadership revealed that the intent was to remove all reproductions of Native American human remains. This discrepancy has led to controversial removal of certain items from instructional use.
  - The Moratorium is to remain in effect until the District “adopts a policy concerning the matters addressed in the moratorium”.
  - A Senate-led Moratorium Advisory Task Force will shortly be providing DAS with recommendations for District Policy on these matters with two key areas of focus:
    - Use of human remains
    - Use of reproductions of human remains
  - DAS will make formal recommendations for District Policy related to the matters described in the moratorium after considering the recommendations of the task force. Our goal is to have a recommendation on both of these keys areas by the end of the semester.
  - Once DAS has made formal recommendations the process of drafting policy will begin and will go through the regular shared governance processes.

- DAS continues to solicit input and discuss LRCCD General Education & graduation requirement revisions needed to align with new Title 5 requirements. There is widespread support for allowing students the option of using a transfer GE pattern (CalGETC beginning Fall 2025) for local degrees. Our goal again is to have a formal recommendation by the end of this semester, which will allow time to revise policy and regulation 7241 - Graduation Requirements.

- DAS is working with our faculty co-chair on the District Educational Technology Committee (DETC), Morgan Murphy, to explore options for online proctoring tools.

- DAS is continuing to work with our PREP standing committee to address concerns that PREP program administration is circumventing collegial consultation processes.

### ARC Academic Senate President, Brian Knirk, Reports:
- The ARC Senate has:
  - Approved a critical hire for our nursing department
  - Approved the Charter of a Davies Hall Project Team under the Student Success Council to provide recommendations regarding utilization of new portables for displaced divisions with an emphasis on data and student success.
  - Approved changes to help improve program pathways mapping to better serve our students.

### CRC Academic Senate President, Jacob Velasquez, Reports:
- No report

### FLC Academic Senate President, Eric Wada, Reports:
- Our review of the Los Rios general education pattern included a presentation to the Student Senate overviewing the District Curriculum Coordinating Committee’s recommendations and inviting student feedback on the recommendations.
- We recently held elections for area representatives on the Academic Senate.
  - The consensus view on the state budget is that next year we will have a deficit. The Senate has grown interested in understanding how budgeting decisions are made both at the district level and local level; this includes an interest in understanding how general fund and other fund dollars are allocated to the district and distributed to colleges. Other interests include how the increased apportionment for dual enrollment and PREP students is being allocated to support those programs. Finally, there are interests in understanding how the district reserves have changed over the years, and how those reserves might be used if there is a shortage of funding in the near future.

### SCC Academic Senate President (Interim), Amy Strimling, Reports:
- SCC has completed the election process for new Senate Officers as well as Senators to begin in Fall 2024. The new officers will be Amy Strimling, President, Ilana Johnson, Vice President, and Nadine Kirkpatrick, Secretary.
  - The Senate will continue to discuss the proposed changes to the GE pattern.

![Request for District Accounting of Items Removed, Ordered, and Replaced under the Moratorium on the Use of Human Remains Resolution](https://example.com/image.png)

**Request for District Accounting of Items Removed, Ordered, and Replaced under the Moratorium on the Use of Human Remains Resolution**

Adopted by the Los Rios District Academic Senate March 5, 2024

**WHEREAS**, Absence of appropriate instructional materials inhibits students in their ability to achieve student learning objectives and jeopardizes course articulation;

**WHEREAS**, Many items that were removed were outside the scope of the Los Rios Moratorium on the Use of Human Remains, Native American Cultural Items, Images, and Reproductions of Native American Human Remains and Cultural Items (hereafter: ‘the moratorium’) and hence were removed without proper authority;

**WHEREAS**, District administration has expressed a commitment to replacing any items removed under the moratorium deemed necessary for achieving the learning outcomes of a course as per faculty expertise;

**WHEREAS**, Faculty discipline experts have requested that the items removed without proper authority be returned, and “[f]aculty members have the principle right and responsibility to determine the methods of instruction [and] the planning and presentation of course materials [...] in their assignment in accordance with the approved curriculum and course outline and the educational mission of the District in accordance with state laws and regulations” (Article 17.2 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement);

**WHEREAS**, Access to appropriate instructional materials concerns curriculum and student preparation and success, which are academic and professional matters for which the Los Rios Board of Trustees (or designee) must rely primarily on the advice and judgment of the Academic Senate, in accord with Section 2.7 of Los Rios Board Policy 3412;

**RESOLVED**, The District Academic Senate recommends:

1) for each item removed within the scope of the moratorium, the District replace each item via replacement order and delivery immediately or as soon as possible, and

2) for each item removed beyond the scope of the moratorium, the District replace each item via return immediately or as soon as possible.

And

**RESOLVED**, The District Academic Senate recommends the District work to immediately put in place a system for tracking at each college::

1) each item that has been removed from instructional use and which department it came from, accurately distinguishing those that were removed with proper authority from those that were not,

2) when each item replaced via return was actually returned, including the discipline faculty with whom the return was confirmed, the date the item was returned, the location to which it was returned, and documentation of any justification that was required proper to its return,
<!-- Page 4 -->
3) when each item replaced via replacement order was actually ordered, including the discipline (top code) for which it was ordered, discipline faculty who selected the replacement and placed the order, the date the order was placed, the vendor used, and documentation of any justification that was required prior to placing the order,  
4) when the replacement item became available for instructional use,  
5) confirmation from discipline faculty that the replacement item received was in good condition and of adequate quality to meet the learning outcomes;  
And  
RESOLVED, The District Academic Senate requests this list be updated and shared in real time with the DAS and LRCFT leadership.
