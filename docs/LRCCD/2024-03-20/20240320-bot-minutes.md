Board Report #4, an overview of the top 30 Career Technical Education (CTE) programs in Los Rios.

B. Sacramento City College’s Mechanical Electrical Technology Program: An Example of Career Education Programming at Work

Sacramento City College faculty, managers, and students highlighted the opportunities afforded to students via the Mechanical Electrical Technology Program, which provides courses in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and refrigerating systems.

6. BOARD MEMBER REPORTS

President Haynes read the following statement on behalf of the Board of Trustees in response to the recent Votes of No Confidence in Chancellor King:

As part of my Board Report tonight, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Los Rios Board of Trustees regarding the recent Resolutions of No Confidence in Chancellor King passed by Los Rios Academic Senates. Given the public nature of this critique of Chancellor King’s performance, we are taking the unusual step of making this public response.

We note that the past several years have been incredibly challenging for our district, as they have been for every community college district - and institution of higher education - in the State of California. In spite of the challenges placed upon us by many factors beyond our control, Chancellor King has led, and continues to ably lead our district. Our district continues to maintain a solid fiduciary and operational infrastructure, access to our colleges is growing and nearing pre-pandemic levels, our colleges were all recently successfully reaccredited, and Los Rios is widely considered among the leaders in some of the most innovative work happening around our state with student success initiatives.

Further, we appreciate that, in his efforts to guide our district through very challenging times and improve outcomes for students, Chancellor King has had to make a number of very difficult decisions. Chancellor King and his team have also demonstrated a consistent willingness to meet and engage with the Academic Senate, and other critical stakeholders, on contentious decisions.

The Board continues to have confidence in Chancellor King and his leadership team and for that reason, the Board has taken action to provide Chancellor King with a 4 percent raise, effective immediately.

7. FUTURE AGENDA ITEMS

No future agenda items were requested.
