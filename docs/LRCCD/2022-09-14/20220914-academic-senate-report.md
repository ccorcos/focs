- The Academic Senate and Academic Senate Committees are resuming the important work to support student success and work towards improving equitable access and outcomes. Notable examples include our Ethnic Studies faculty, Articulation Officer, and Curriculum Committee worked over the summer to quickly revise and resubmit courses to gain CSU-GE approval; Math faculty continue to innovate by designing curriculum to meet AB 705 requirements with the goal removing or minimizing disproportionate impact on students of color (particularly those pursuing Business and Science majors), we have appointed a Rising Scholars faculty coordinator to be ready for a fall start, work continues in designing and adopting Open Educational Resources (OER) in classes, and Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Anti-racism, and Accessibility is centered in our Senate and Senate Committee discussions.
- We are looking forward to being engaged in the processes to find administrators who are both effective practitioners of collegial consultation and equity champions for the regular Vice President of Administration, Vice President of Student Services, and College President positions.
