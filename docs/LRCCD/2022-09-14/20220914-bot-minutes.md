Chancellor's Report:  
ARC: ARC Vice President of Instruction Frank Kobayashi is one of only 31 leaders selected nationwide for the 2022-23 class of the Aspen Institute College Excellence Program Rising Presidents Fellowship. This program, delivered in collaboration with the Stanford Educational Leadership Initiative, prepares the next generation of community college presidents to transform institutions to achieve higher and more equitable levels of student success. The fellows, selected through a competitive process, will work closely with highly accomplished community college presidents, Aspen leaders, and Stanford University faculty over ten months to learn from field-leading research, define and assess student success at their colleges, and clarify their visions for excellent and equitable outcomes for students while in college and after they graduate. Rising Presidents Fellows aspire to enter a college presidency within five years of completing the fellowship. As fellows, they join a network of over 300 forward-thinking peers—122 of whom are sitting college presidents—who are applying grounded and innovative strategies to meet student success challenges in their colleges.

CRC: CRC has been granted just under $3 million for the Learning-Aligned Employment Program (LAEP) to help our students defray the cost of education. This program offers eligible CRC students the opportunity to earn money working in educationally-beneficial positions related to their area of study. The goal is to bridge the gap between college and career for our students. The College will work to implement and streamline this process for our eligible students and employers.
