# CLASSIFIED SENATE

## SEPTEMBER BOARD OF TRUSTEES REPORT

### American River College
**Jessica Pressley - Classified Senate President**  
This year, the senate will focus on reframing our vision, mission and goals in a way that will focus on the value the Classified Professionals hold at our campus. This process will consist of focus groups and surveys and really taking a look at how Classified Professionals play such a vital role in our students' college experience and how we can continue to grow those relationships. It is clear that the past couple of years have been tough for both our students and staff, with that in consideration it will be my goal as well as my fellow Classified Professional leaders to provide a space and a voice for all of those on our campus and rebuild our community.

We had a very successful turn out for our WOW (Week of Welcome) event, which had several events each day to help welcome our students back. Such as a de-stress event, field day with our athletics department, and a red carpet with a backdrop for pictures. We will be offering active shooter training as well for all Classified Professional employees. The date is still pending.

### Cosumnes River College
**Tiffany Clark - Classified Senate President**  
The Senate will hold its first meeting of the 22/23 academic year this week on Wednesday, September 14th. The Senate did host an open forum with CRC administrators, college president Dr. Ed Bush and all Vice Presidents, on August 4th. The purpose of the forum was to give the classified professionals an opportunity to ask questions, share concerns and give feedback on any topics top of mind for them. Out of that forum the Senate has implemented three practices of note; quarterly meetings with the Vice President of Administration, union share outs as a standing agenda item for all Senate meetings, and an ongoing opportunity for members to share concerns, ask questions and provide feedback anonymously if they so choose.

The semester has gotten off to a great start. While the data tells us that enrollment is down, there was definitely a new, extremely welcome, "buzz" on campus as hundreds of students have returned to receive in-person services and take classes on ground for the fall term.

### Folsom Lake College
**Karla Lozano - Classified Senate President**  
The semester started off with a Caring Campus “First Week Greeting” for students coming to campus at all three sites. September will kick-off Fall 2022 Racial Justice Book Circle with Classified staff facilitating and participating. We will read and discuss Shawn A. Ginwright’s book *The Four Pivots: Reimagining Justice, Reimagining Ourselves*. The Classified Senate is in the process of holding elections for the Senate Vice President, and Senate Area 2 positions. Classified staff recently had a chance to participate in a Town Hall meeting to provide feedback regarding the FLC Presidential Search process.

# Sacramento City College

**Kevin Williams - Classified Senate President**

The SCC Senate held its last meeting on September the 8th. In the meeting the Classified Senate conditionally approved the Accreditation Core Inquiries Response with a deadline of September 14th.

The SCC Senate officers and Senators held their Senate Planning Retreat on September 10th. Many goals were set during this retreat, but a main goal of increasing classified participation in Senate was prevalent. Many ideas were shared including monthly events and more classified recognition and appreciation.

SCC Classified Senate will be hosting 4CS for their board meeting on September 23rd & 24th. The Board will meet with the Senate Officers, and President of the campus during their visit.
