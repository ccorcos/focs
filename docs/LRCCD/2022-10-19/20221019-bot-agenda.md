### Los Rios Community College District Indigenous Land Acknowledgment Statement

In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our four colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

**Chancellor's Report:**  
ARC: ARC Vice President of Instruction Frank Kobayashi is one of only 31 leaders selected nationwide for the 2022-23 class of the Aspen Institute College Excellence Program Rising Presidents Fellowship. This program, delivered in collaboration with the Stanford Educational Leadership Initiative, prepares the next generation of community college presidents to transform institutions to achieve higher and more equitable levels of student success. The fellows, selected through a competitive process, will work closely with highly accomplished community college presidents, Aspen leaders, and Stanford University faculty over ten months to learn from field-leading research, define and assess student success at their colleges, and clarify their visions for excellent and equitable outcomes for students while in college and after they graduate. Rising Presidents Fellows aspire to enter a college presidency within five years of completing the fellowship. As fellows, they join a network of over 300 forward-thinking peers—122 of whom are sitting college presidents—who are applying grounded and innovative strategies to meet student success challenges in their colleges.

CRC: CRC has been granted just under $3 million for the Learning-Aligned Employment Program (LAEP) to help our students defray the cost of education. This program offers eligible CRC students the opportunity to earn money working in educationally-beneficial positions related to their area of study. The goal is to bridge the gap between college and career for our students. The College will work to implement and streamline this process for our eligible students and employers.

<!-- Page 19 -->
2. GERON 305 Introduction to Geropsychology and the Aging Brain (3.00 units)

**Prerequisite:** None.

**Advisory:** Eligible for ENGRD 310 or ENGRD 312 AND ENGWR 300; OR ESLW 340.

**54.00 hours lecture**

This course introduces foundation theories and constructs of gerontology and psychology to examine the aging-related biopsychosocial changes that influence how mature and older adults feel about themselves, how they process information, and how they encode memories about what they experience and learn. Special emphasis is placed on psychological differences between aging cohorts based on psychosocial factors present during the decade of birth and earlier stages of life, gender/sex and race/ethnicity, the social determinants of health, bias development, prejudice and discrimination, and racism, ableism, sexism, and ageism. Topics include psychological theories, models, and constructs that have practical application during interactions with older people; stages of life and phases of aging; aging-related changes (senescence) and the psychological impact of those changes; how illnesses, diseases, and disabilities complicate aging; the anatomy of the central and peripheral nervous systems; and models of sensorineural processing and learning/memory. Case studies are utilized to explore older adult health and mental health, personality and communication behaviors, environmental factors, and the impact of the social determinants of health on overall well-being, quality of life, and aging outcomes. This course is not open to students who have completed PSYC 375.

**Justification:** This new course is needed to replace a shared course with SCC GERON 302 Psychology of Aging: Adult Development and Aging. Approximately 40% of the GERON 302 course topics were redundant with GERON 303 Introduction to Social Gerontology. Those topics were replaced with multicultural topics from a psychological perspective. All topics, SLOs, and SLO-related assignment mapping to the gerontological competencies per our 2018 accreditation are completed through this revision. The topic details in this outline ensure consistency of instruction and provide the framework for use of instructor-provided materials. GERON 305 will replace GERON 302 in all ARC gerontology programs.

3. PSYC 375 Introduction to Geropsychology and the Aging Brain (3.00 units)

**Prerequisite:** None.

**Advisory:** Eligible for ENGRD 310 or ENGRD 312 AND ENGWR 300; OR ESLW 340.

1. **CISD 307 Introduction to Machine Learning (3.00 units)**

   **Prerequisite:** CISD 300 and CISP 407 with grades of "C" or better

   **54.00 hours lecture**

   This course introduces students to the basics of machine learning (ML). Topics include understanding the mathematics behind artificial intelligence (AI), and realizing the difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Students will be taught different methods to overcome variance and bias.

   **Justification:** This introduction of Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence focused on building systems that can learn from historical data, identify patterns, and make logical decisions with little to no human intervention. It is a data analysis method that automates the building of analytical models through using data that encompasses diverse forms of digital information including numbers, words, clicks, and images.

---

**Additional Course Information:**

- **PSYC 375** will replace **PSYC 374** in all ARC gerontology programs.
- This new course is needed to replace a shared course with SCC, **PSYC 374 Psychology of Aging: Adult Development and Aging**. Approximately 40% of the PSYC 374 course topics were redundant with **GERON 303 Introduction to Social Gerontology**. Those topics were replaced with multicultural topics from a psychological perspective. All topics, SLOs, and SLO-related assignment mapping to the gerontological competencies per our 2018 accreditation are completed through this revision.

# PROGRAM PROPOSALS

## Program Deletion(s)

### Folsom Lake College
1. **Business: General Transfer**  
   **Justification:** To delete a redundant program per recommendation of counseling. The department will still offer the ADT in Business as well as the Business AA for non-transfer students. The proposed deletion is a program that is used infrequently and can be easily replaced by the remaining programs.

### Sacramento City College
1. **Family and Consumer Science**  
   **Justification:** The FCS program is being deleted at Sacramento City College as the programs have become more defined in departments that better serve the needs of students as students are no longer seeking this degree.

**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION**  
**INFORMATION**  

**BACKGROUND:**  
The Education Code regulates the procedures by which a Community College District can dispose of real and personal property. Education Code section 81452 provides that the governing board may, by unanimous vote, dispose of items valued at $5,000 or less by private sale without advertising or selling the items at public auction. The District has held previous auctions, but they have generally cost more than they have netted for the District.  

**STATUS:**  
The District has a quantity of surplus materials that needs to be disposed of, such as outdated desks and computers. The District has located a scrap dealer who will take selected surplus items for recycling. Any items remaining will be disposed.  

The surplus items to be recycled or disposed of are either irreparable, obsolete, in poor condition or not needed for district/college operations and include the following: 1 card reader; 12 computers; 3 iMac’s; 4 laptops; 1 Macbook Pro; 3 monitors and 1 switch.  

These items have a value of less than $5,000.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the disposal of the listed items per Education Code section 81452.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** October 19, 2021  

**SUBJECT:** Motion Directing the Chancellor to Maintain, Enhance, or Discontinue the Los Rios Covid Vaccine Requirement Established by Resolution 2021-18  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item A  
**RECOMMENDED BY:** Brian King, Chancellor  
**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
On August 3, 2021, the Board of Trustees held a special meeting where it adopted Resolution 2021-18, directing the Chancellor to develop and implement a COVID vaccine requirement to increase vaccination rates for students, faculty, and staff.  

On October 8, 2022, the Board of Trustees held an open and public Board retreat to discuss the successful implementation of the Los Rios vaccination requirement, the current state of public health guidance, data related to vaccination rates, and the impacts of the Los Rios vaccination mandate. At the October 8, 2022 Board retreat, individual members of the Board expressed various perspectives on the Los Rios vaccination requirement, from a desire to implement a booster requirement to a desire to discontinue the vaccination requirement entirely. One or more members of the Board of Trustees asked for an action item as soon as possible to allow the Board an opportunity to revisit or modify the existing Los Rios vaccination requirement.  

**STATUS:**  
This action item provides the Board with an opportunity to provide direction related to the future of the Los Rios vaccine requirement. Specifically, the Board may discuss and adopt a motion directing the Chancellor to maintain, enhance, modify, or discontinue the Los Rios Covid vaccine requirement established by Resolution 2021-18.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees consider and adopt a motion directing the Chancellor to maintain, enhance, modify, or discontinue the Los Rios Covid vaccine requirement. A motion adopted by the Board may include, but is not limited to, the following options:  

1. **Motion to Discontinue Vax Requirement as Soon as Practicable:** That the Board of Trustees directs the Chancellor and/or designee to take any and all actions necessary to discontinue the COVID-19 vaccine requirement established by Resolution 2021-18 for District employees, students, and others who access District facilities at any district location as soon as practicable.

3. Motion to Maintain the Existing Vax Requirement: That the Board of Trustees directs the Chancellor and/or designee to continue the COVID-19 vaccine requirement established by Resolution 2021-18 and maintain the status quo for District employees, students, and others who access District facilities at any district location unless or until directed otherwise by the Board.

4. Motion to Implement a Booster Requirement: That the Board of Trustees directs the Chancellor and/or designee to continue the COVID-19 vaccine requirement established by Resolution 2021-18 and further directs the Chancellor and/or designee to take any and all actions necessary to implement a booster requirement for District employees, students, and others who access District facilities at any district location effective [insert desired future date].
