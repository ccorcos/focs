He also commended the colleges on a successful accreditation process with only two very minor recommendations!  

The written report below was provided to the Board electronically:  

**ARC:** At a special ceremony on October 7, Assemblymembers Kevin McCarty and Ken Cooley presented the ARC Veterans Resource Center with a $2.5 million check allocated from the 2022 California State Budget. The funds will be used to expand and remodel the center to help improve the experience of Veterans at ARC. The college thanks Assemblymembers McCarty and Cooley for their advocacy on behalf of our students.  

**CRC:** CRC is one of only 22 California community colleges recognized as a 2022 Champion of Higher Education for Excellence in Transfer by the Campaign for College Opportunity. This recognition positions CRC among a select group leading the state in supporting the transfer goals of students.  

The 22 community colleges are recognized for significantly increasing the number of students earning an Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT), an instrumental pathway that has streamlined the transfer process. Eight CSU campuses are also being recognized for enrolling ADT-earning students on an ADT-guaranteed pathway. Additionally, several of the college and university honorees are excelling in closing equity gaps for Latino/Hispanic and Black/African American transfer students via the ADT.  

All honorees will be recognized at the 2022 Champions of Higher Education for Excellence in Transfer celebration on November 1, 2022.

Ourselves. FLC launched the college-wide equity-focused book club in Fall 2020 with its first selection of How to Be an Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi following the tragic murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor which sparked protests across the country and a call to address systemic racism in America and institute change. In Fall 2021, the college opened the virtual book club to welcome members from across the district. This semester’s Book Circle participants include representation from the Board of Trustees, the Chancellor’s Executive Staff, college leadership, faculty, staff, and administrators. Special thanks to the Book Circle Planning Group – Amy Brinkley, Kellie Butler, Lindsey Campbell, Victoire Chozeh, Nino Conley, and Tony Humphreys – for their efforts as we continue our college and district’s commitment to cultivating a culture of anti-racism on our campuses.
