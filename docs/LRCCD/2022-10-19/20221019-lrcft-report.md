**LRCC report to the LRCCD Board of Trustees**  
**October 19, 2022**

The LRCFT looks forward to opening full negotiations with the district next semester. We are currently putting together our negotiating team.

The LRCFT is taking part this week in the Los Rios Undocumented Student Action Week.

LRCFT leadership joined Yuba cc faculty at their district’s trustees meeting last week to discuss PT faculty access to health care, which is part of the $200 million augmentation provided by the legislature. Yuba does not provide PT faculty with any health care options. Los Rios ranks in the top 4 districts in the state in terms of providing high quality access to health care for PT faculty.

The LRCFT PAFC is meeting with our local endorsed candidates to provide any last-minute assistance for the November general election. The races include the Sacramento City Council, Sacramento Board of Supervisors, State Senate, State Assembly races, and the LRCCD trustee races.

The LRCFT PAFC recently voted to take a “no” position on Measure O, the local measure regarding the unhoused in Sacramento.

The LRCFT PAFC also provided a contribution to Proposition O, the SF parcel tax measure designed to help offset the recent 40% reduction in staffing at SF CC.

The LRCFT recently attended our CFT state council meeting where PT health care remained in focus.

The LRCFT is attending a working lunch on Oct. 21 with district employees who attended the All-African Diaspora Educators Summit at the University of Cape Coast in Ghana.

The LRCFT is attending the West Sacramento Día de Los Muertos event on Oct. 30 sponsored by the Latino Information and Resource Center.

The LRCFT is also taking part in labor education outreach to students through a program sponsored by the Sacramento Central Labor Council and the California Department of Industrial Relations. The Worker Education and Union Visibility Outreach Project will take place on all four campuses and will include classroom visits, tabling, and participation in career and job fairs on the campuses.

This semester in November the LRCFT is also holding internal elections for campus representative, Secretary/Treasurer, and LRCFT President positions.

The LRCFT is also expanding our stewards’ programs and membership meetings on the four campuses.

The LRCFT will take part in an equity-based retreat in January.

Thank you,

Jason Newman  
LRCFT President
