Los Rios Community College District Indigenous Land Acknowledgment Statement  
In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our four colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.  

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

3. **FITNS 413 Okinawan Kobudo I (1.00 unit)**

**Sacramento City College**

1. DDSN 321 Print and Multimedia Publication Design I (3.00 units)  
   **Justification:** As part of program review we are deleting this series of courses (321, 322, 323). These courses were offered in partnership with the Journalism department as part of the production process of the print version of the student newspaper, which is no longer produced. The courses have not been offered in over 5 years and there is no expectation to do so in the future.

2. DDSN 322 Print and Multimedia Publication Design II (3.00 units)  
   **Justification:** As part of program review we are deleting this series of courses (321, 322, 323).

<!-- Page 25 -->
5. **MET 391 Mechanical Systems Commissioning (2.50 units)**  
   **Justification:** In light of our recent decision to remove the Commercial Building Energy Auditing and Commissioning Specialist certificate due to limited interest and industry alignment, we're also discontinuing the MET 39x series of courses tied explicitly to this certificate. This move ensures our curriculum remains relevant and meets the evolving needs of students and the industry.

This move ensures our curriculum remains relevant and meets the evolving needs of students and the industry.

10. **POLS 303 Politics of Africa (3.00 units)**  
    **Justification:** This course is never offered because of very low enrollment. As an upper division course at the CSU and UC, they generally want students to take it there anyway.
<!-- Page 26 -->
11. **POLS 312 Politics of the Middle East (3.00 units)**  
   **Justification:** This course is never offered because of very low enrollment. As an upper division course at the CSU and UC, they generally want students to take it there anyway.

PROGRAM PROPOSALS

Program Deletion(s)

American River College

1. **Elementary Teacher Education**

   **Justification:** During the process of revising their core curricula, the Math department eliminated MATH 311, which was the only math course at ARC that met the C-ID for the math requirement for the Elementary Education AA-T. In discussing how best to address this issue with the ARC articulation officer, we discovered that the AA-T does not serve our students well. The AA-T was designed for students who are planning to transfer to a four-year university into a Liberal Studies program (or similar) before completing their credential to teach elementary school students. However, the AA-T includes many requirements that are not needed or not part of the Liberal Studies programs students are transferring into. For this reason, most students do not work toward this degree, and counselors do not recommend it for future elementary school teachers. Since its creation in 2014, only 2 students have attained the degree. We would like to delete the AA-T and work on a local AA that better aligns with the programs students will transfer into at four-year schools.

Folsom Lake College

1. **Business Information Worker I**

   **Justification:** This certificate has been replaced with the Business Information Professional (BIP) I certificate. BIP I is now cataloged.

Sacramento City College

1. **Commercial Building Energy Auditing and Commissioning Specialist**

   **Justification:** We've decided to remove the Commercial Building Energy Auditing and Commissioning Specialist certificate from our program due to limited interest from both students and local employers. Even when considering a revised version, the industry expressed a preference for licensed engineers and engineering companies to handle these tasks.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** December 13, 2023  

**SUBJECT:** Student, Special Rate, Temporary Interpreter & Temporary Classified Salary Schedules  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item I  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  
**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
The District salary schedule for Student Help employees needs to be improved to reflect the increase in the minimum wage to $16.00 per hour, which takes effect on January 1, 2024. In addition, the District's Temporary Classified Salary Schedules were reviewed to ensure that all classifications were above the minimum wage. The District has historically tied the Temporary Classified Schedule to a % of the Step 1 rate for regular classifications. In the interest of attracting and retaining a qualified temporary work force, this benchmark will remain at 80%. The LRCEA and SEIU units received improvements effective for fiscal year 2024, so maintaining this benchmark will cause an improvement to the temporary classified schedules. The Special Rate and Temporary Interpreter rates are generally set relative to the market rate for some of the classifications. The timing of these salary schedule improvements will occur at the start of the pay period in which the minimum wage increase becomes effective, which is December 25, 2023.  

**STATUS:**  
The Student Help schedule will be increased to the minimum wage of $16.00 per hour, effective December 25, 2023. Student help employees are not subject to OASDI and therefore the net wage for student employees is slightly higher than employment in the private sector. For temporary classified employment, the minimum hourly wage is set at $16.85 to offset the OASDI deduction. With the exception of some lower compensated ranges, the other ranges on the Clerical/Paraprofessional and Maintenance/Service schedules will be set at the benchmark of 80% of step 1 for the regular classifications. Ranges 12 through 21 of the Clerical/Paraprofessional schedule will be slightly different due to the compressing impact that the minimum wage has on these lower compensated ranges. These ranges will be set at increments of $0.20 apart, with ranges 22 and above keeping the 80% benchmark mentioned prior. The hourly rates for classified temporary employment of the Special Rate and Interpreter Temporary schedules are set as described above with a minimum hourly rate of $16.85.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the salary schedules for Student Help/College Work Study employees, Clerical/Paraprofessional temporary classified employees, Maintenance/Service temporary classified employees, Special Rate temporary classified employees, and Temporary Interpreter temporary classified employees effective December 25, 2023.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** December 13, 2023

| **SUBJECT:** | Initial Collective Bargaining Proposals – SEIU 2024-27 | **ATTACHMENT:** Yes | **ENCLOSURE:** None |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **AGENDA ITEM:** | Collective Bargaining Item A | **TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:** | |

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
Pursuant to Government Code Section 3547, et seq., all initial proposals of exclusive representatives of recognized employee groups and of the District are required to be presented at a public meeting of the District.

The Board and representatives of the Service Employees International Union, Local 1021 (SEIU) have agreed to engage in an interest–based collaborative approach to negotiations. The collective bargaining agreement with SEIU expires on June 30, 2024. The parties wish to commence negotiations as soon as possible, with the goal of attempting to reach agreement as early as possible before the contract expires.

As part of the model of negotiations, the parties will identify their respective interests. The theory is that it is easier to reconcile interests than positions. Reconciling interests, rather than positions, affords both parties an opportunity to be heard throughout the negotiation process. Therefore, the initial proposals will be framed as interests as much as possible.

Consistent with the applicable code sections, the public has a right to be informed of those areas that the parties will be negotiating and to invite public comment at a meeting of the public school employer.

**STATUS:**  
See attached list of interests identified by SEIU and the list of interests identified by the LRCCD team.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that a public hearing be scheduled at the January 2024 Board Meeting to allow for public input regarding the initial collective bargaining proposals submitted by the District and SEIU.

**CONSENT/ROUTINE**  
**FIRST READING**  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION** X  
**INFORMATION**  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
Per Education Code § 84040, the governing board of each community college district shall provide for an annual audit of all funds, books, and accounts of the district in accordance with regulations of the Board of Governors. The audit shall be made by certified public accountants licensed by the California Board of Accountancy. The audit consists of the examination of the District’s financial statements, a review of the systems of internal accounting controls, and a review of state and federal compliance areas mandated by the Federal Single Audit Act and the State Audit Manual. Pursuant to Title 5 CCR § 59106, each district governing board shall review the annual audit at a public meeting and submit the audit report to the California Community College Chancellor’s Office.

**SUBJECT:** 2023-24 Program Development Funds  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item B  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
Program Development Funds, also referred to as PDF or 20% funds, are the District’s discretionary funds for allocation to continuing and one-time-only purposes. The funds are comprised of both prior and current year resources per established formulas. Schedule I summarizes the funds available for the 2023-24 allocation. The overall guidelines for PDF allocations are: 1) to be responsive to the District/Colleges’ planning process and related goals and objectives; 2) to address any current or future emphases directed by the Governing Board; 3) to fund mandates or new costs imposed upon the District; 4) to balance the distribution across District-wide needs; and 5) to maintain the District’s conservative fiscal practices.

A key factor in the distribution of the funds is matching the type of resource (continuing or one-time-only) to the nature of the allocation. The type of revenue establishes or limits the type of expenditure that can be funded.

For 2023-24, the District has $6.4 million to allocate toward continuing costs, which includes funding from the Student Centered Funding Formula, plus the change in estimate to PDF in 2022-23. These estimates are consistent with those contained in the Adopted Budget approved at the September 2023 board meeting. If the funding formula yields additional on-going resources in 2023-24, those will be included in the 2024-25 Program Development Funds allocation.

The District also has $37.9 million available for one-time general-purpose of which $12.5 million is allocated towards College Capital Outlay Projects.

---

**STATUS:**  
The proposed allocations contained in Schedule II are organized by the goals outlined in the District’s Strategic Plan. Of note, these allocations have been focused on maintaining core elements of the District’s services operations and include minimal new items of expenditure this year. Strategy A focuses on establishing pathways for access and success. Strategy B emphasizes equitable academic achievement. Strategy C centers on improving teaching and learning opportunities. Strategy D focuses on creating an outstanding working and learning environment.

The District Budget Committee has reviewed the resources and allocations schedules. The formal approval of the allocations will take place in February when the first budget revision for 2023-24 is brought to the Board.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the proposals contained in the Program Development Funds effective January 1, 2024.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** December 13, 2023  

**SUBJECT:** Public Hearing: College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) Memorandum of Understanding: Stockton Unified School District  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item D  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Albert Garcia, Sacramento College President  
**FIRST READING**  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION** X  
**INFORMATION**  

**BACKGROUND:**  
With the passage of Assembly Bill 102, California community college districts are authorized to enter into a College and Career Access Pathways Partnership with a high school district to expand opportunities for high school students to take college courses during the regular school day and for community colleges to claim apportionment. To go forward with this program, the law requires community college districts and high school districts to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding approved by the governing boards of both the community college district and the high school district.  

**STATUS:**  
The proposed College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is between the Los Rios Community College District and Stockton Unified School District. There are no significant differences between this MOU and our standard CCAP MOU template. The purpose of the MOU is to offer and expand dual enrollment opportunities for students who may not already be college bound or who are underrepresented in higher education, with the goal of developing seamless pathways from high school to community college. Beginning Spring 2024, classes will be offered to High School students attending Stockton Unified School District High Schools. At the completion of these classes, students will earn credit toward multiple degree or certificate programs within their relevant college’s catalog.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees conduct a public hearing; adopt the proposed CCAP MOU between the Los Rios Community College District and Stockton Unified School District and authorize the Chancellor or his designee(s) to execute the MOU and any future augmentations, amendments, renewals, extensions, or other modifications to the MOU.

![San Joaquin Delta College Letter](https://www.sjdc.edu/images/letter.png)

May 18, 2023  
Los Rios Community College District (LRCCD)  
Jamey Nye  
Deputy Chancellor  

Re: Out of Service Area Dual Enrollment Agreement  

Dear LRCCD,  

California Education Code, section 76004(e), states that “a community college district shall not enter into a CCAP partnership with a school district within the service area of another community college district, except where an agreement exists, or is established, between those community college districts authorizing that CCAP partnership.”  

This letter confirms that San Joaquin Delta College agrees to the CCAP partnership between Sacramento City College (SCC) and Stockton Unified School District where students in San Joaquin Delta College service area will be served in the following program and terms:  

- Railroads Operations Program beginning fall 2023  

San Joaquin Delta College retains the right to offer courses in the railroad’s operations program during any subsequent term, provided a 30-day written notice is submitted to LRCCD by Delta College with the intent to launch this program. If unable to offer courses and LRCCD is interested in serving students in San Joaquin Delta College service area, any future CCAP agreements will be authorized by a subsequent agreement with updated courses and timelines.  

Sincerely,  

DocuSigned by:  
Charles Braden  
D79207819747428.  
Dr. Charles “Kale” Braden,  
Assistant Superintendent/Vice President of Instruction

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** December 13, 2023  

**SUBJECT:** Public Hearing: College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) Memorandum of Understanding: Placer Union High School District  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item E  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Art Pimentel,  
Folsom Lake College President  
**FIRST READING**  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION** X  
**INFORMATION**  

**BACKGROUND:**  
With the passage of Assembly Bill 102, California community college districts are authorized to enter into a College and Career Access Pathways Partnership with a high school district to expand opportunities for high school students to take college courses during the regular school day and for community colleges to claim apportionment. To go forward with this program, the law requires community college districts and high school districts to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding approved by the governing boards of both the community college district and the high school district.  

**STATUS:**  
The proposed College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is between the Los Rios Community College District and Placer Union High School District. There are no significant differences between this MOU and our standard CCAP MOU template. The purpose of the MOU is to offer and expand dual enrollment opportunities for students who may not already be college bound or who are underrepresented in higher education, with the goal of developing seamless pathways from high school to community college. Beginning Spring 2024, classes will be offered to High School students attending Del Oro High School. At the completion of these classes, students will earn credit toward multiple degree or certificate programs within their relevant college’s catalog.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees conduct a public hearing; adopt the proposed CCAP MOU between the Los Rios Community College District and Placer Union High School District and authorize the Chancellor or his designee(s) to execute the MOU and any future augmentations, amendments, renewals, extensions, or other modifications to the MOU.

Hi, Jamey—hope you are well. Sean O’Neil has been in conversation with Nigel Haikins-Appiah, Sierra’s Dual Enrollment Program Director, and I understand that Placer Union High School District has approached Sac City about offering a section of what we call Health Science 7, Emergency Medical Responder, for the Spring 2024 semester. We have a robust dual enrollment program with PUHSD but are unable to staff the additional section they have requested. This email confirms that Sierra College agrees to the CCAP partnership between Sacramento City College/LRCCD and PUHSD, through which students in the Sierra College service area will be served in the following program and terms:

- **Class:** Health Science 7 - Emergency Medical Responder (LRCCD equivalent)
- **Pathway:** Sports Medicine
- **Duration:** Spring semester 2024

Please let me know if you need anything additional from me. Thank you!

Best,  
Rebecca
