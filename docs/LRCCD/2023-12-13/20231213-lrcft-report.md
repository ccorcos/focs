![LRCFT Report to the Los Rios Board of Trustees Dec. 13, 2023](attachment://LRCFT_Report_to_the_Los_Rios_Board_of_Trustees_Dec_13_2023.png)

Last week, the LRCFT held a membership appreciation holiday party for 100 faculty and guests at Track 7 Brewery near SCC.

LRCFT members were proud to support La Familia Counseling Center's Posada de Navidena. Each holiday season, La Familia supports hundreds of families with toys, gifts, warm clothes, and other necessities. LRCFT faculty and staff delivered $800 in toys and $400 in gift cards; many other members opted to sponsor families and make donations online. We also thank the SCC RASA/ASHE center for sharing their space and wrapping gifts with us.

The LRCFT also contributed to the SCLC’s annual Operation X mas Basket to provide toys to children in need.

We participated in the CA. Labor Federation’s recent preprimary convention. The body endorsed all three Democratic candidates in the CA. US Senate race.

The LRCFT joined the SCLC recently to interview Sac. County DA Thien Ho. The conversation focused on Ho’s recent lawsuit against the city over unhoused policies.

The LRCFT PAFC over the next two months will interview candidates for the Sacramento City Council district 6 race. We recently endorsed Roger Dickinson for district 2. We are also door knocking and phone banking for our endorsed candidates, Paula Villescaz, running for Assembly district 6, and Flo Cofer, running for Sacramento mayor.

The LRCFT held elections in November for the college president position. Three new presidents were elected: Kalinda Jones (FLC), Bill Miller (SCC), and Art Jenkins (ARC).

I want to thank the outgoing presidents, Oranit Limmaneeprasert, James Telles, and Belinda Lum for their outstanding and steadfast efforts over the past five years serving our membership.

The LRCFT is taking an active role in helping to sponsor the upcoming The March in March student march and rally at the state capitol scheduled for March 7. This event will bring thirty buses of community college students from around the state to the capital for a march in support of affordable and accessible higher education. The CFT is a major sponsor of the event.

We continue to meet with our SCTA union counterparts to assist LRCCD in reaching a final agreement with Sac Unified regarding dual enrollment. I am pleased to see the partnership building between SCTA and Sac Unified.

The LRCFT continues to value the importance of the district’s PREP program. Our faculty value teaching in the state prison system. We look forward to future conversations with the district in the hope of expanding faculty participation.

The LRCFT has met several times with the District over the past two weeks to negotiate faculty compensation for work associated with the Davies Hall closure and Moratorium on the use of human remains. I am happy to report that the negotiations were smooth and productive.

As we head into the holidays, the LRCFT is making plans to participate in MLK day activities in mid-January. As usual, the LRCFT endorsed several organizations involved in the event.

In closing, the LRCFT participated in the Sac. St. Strike last week. Sac. St. professors are seeking the same improvements to their contract as Los Rios faculty sought in recent years. I spoke at the rally and reminded the crowd that LRCCD and the LRCFT recently were able to negotiate these gains into our contract. LRCFT’s partnership with our district continues to serve as a model for other education-based labor unions in our community.

Thank you!

Jason Newman  
LRCFT President
