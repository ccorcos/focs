**Independent Auditor’s Report**

Governing Board and Citizens Oversight Committee  
Los Rios Community College District  
Sacramento, California  

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements**

**Opinion**

We have audited the financial statements of the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) of Los Rios Community College District (the District), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, as listed in the table of contents.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) of the Los Rios Community College District, as of June 30, 2023, and the changes in its financial position for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (Government Auditing Standards). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the District, and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**Emphasis of Matter**

As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements present only the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M), and do not purport to, and do not, present fairly the financial position of the District, as of June 30, 2023, the changes in its financial position for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

![Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Responsibilities+of+Management+for+the+Financial+Statements)

**Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards, we will:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

![Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards](attachment://image.png)

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated November 30, 2023 on our consideration of the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) of the District’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

**Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

The accounting policies of the Los Rios Community College District’s (the District) General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The District’s General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) accounts for financial transactions in accordance with the policies and procedures of the California Community Colleges Budget and Accounting Manual.

**Financial Reporting Entity**

The financial statements include only the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund of the District used to account for Measure M projects. This Fund was established to account for the expenditures of general obligation bonds issued under General Obligation Bonds Election of 2008. The authorized issuance amount of the bonds is $475,000,000. Through June 30, 2023, bonds totaling $465,000,000 have been issued.

These financial statements are not intended to present fairly the financial position and results of operations of the Los Rios Community College District in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Fund Accounting**

The operations of the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) are accounted for in a separate set of self-balancing accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund balance, revenues, and expenditures. Resources are allocated to and accounted for in the fund based upon the purpose for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled.

**Basis of Accounting**

The General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) is accounted for using a flow of current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. With this measurement focus, only current assets and current liabilities generally are included on the balance sheet. The statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balance reports on the sources (revenues and other financing sources) and uses (expenditures and other financing uses) of current financial resources.

**Budgets and Budgetary Accounting**

Annual budgets are adopted on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for all governmental funds. The District’s governing board adopts an operating budget no later than July 1 in accordance with State law. A public hearing must be conducted to receive comments prior to adoption. The District’s governing board satisfied these requirements. The Board revises this budget during the year to give consideration to unanticipated revenue and expenditures primarily resulting from events unknown at the time of budget adoption. The District employs budget control by minor object and by individual appropriation accounts. Expenditures cannot legally exceed appropriations by major object account.

## Encumbrances

The District utilizes an encumbrance accounting system under which purchase orders, contracts and other commitments for the expenditure of monies are recorded in order to reserve that portion of the applicable appropriation. Encumbrances are liquidated when the commitments are paid, and all outstanding encumbrances lapse at June 30.

## Fund Balance

As of June 30, 2023, the fund balance is classified as follows:

- **Restricted** – amounts that can be spent only for specific purposes because of constitutional provisions or enabling legislation or because of constraints that are externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or the laws or regulations of other governments.

## Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and those differences could be material.

## Note 2 - Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments

### Policies and Practices

The District is authorized under California Government Code to make direct investments in local agency bonds, notes, or warrants within the State; U.S. Treasury instrument; registered State warrants or treasury notes; securities of the U.S. Government, or its agencies; bankers acceptances; commercial paper; certificates of deposit placed with commercial banks and/or savings and loan companies; repurchase or reverse repurchase agreement; medium term corporate notes; shares of beneficial interest issued by diversified management companies, certificates of participation, obligations with first priority security, and collateralized mortgage obligations.

## Investment in County Treasury

The District is considered to be an involuntary participant in an external investment pool as the District is required to deposit all receipts and collections of monies with their County Treasurer (Education Code Section 41001). The fair value of the District’s investment in the pool is reported in the accounting financial statement at amounts based upon the District’s pro-rata share of the fair value provided by the County Treasurer for the entire portfolio (in relation to the amortized cost of that portfolio). The balance available for withdrawal is based on the accounting records maintained by the County Treasurer, which is recorded on the amortized cost basis. Positions in the investment pool are not required to be categorized within the fair market hierarchy.

### General Authorizations

The District’s investment policy follows State code to limit its credit, interest rate, and concentration of credit risks. California Government Code Section 53601 reduces credit risk by limiting investments in commercial paper to “prime” quality of the highest ranking or of the highest letter and numerical rating as provided by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, and limits investments in medium-term notes to a rating of A or better. Individual securities must be backed by the federal government or rated AAA, AA, or A by Standard & Poor’s or Aaa, Aa, or A by Moody’s indices. Section 53061 reduces interest rate risk by limiting investments to maturities of five years, unless the District Board has granted express authority to make that investment no less than three months prior to the investment. Section 53601 and 53635 reduces concentration credit risk by limiting the concentration of an investment in a single issuer to less than 5% of its total investment balance.

### Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Generally, the longer the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value is to changes in market interest rates. The District does not have a formal investment policy that limits investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. The District manages its exposure to interest rate risk by investing in the County treasury pool and government-sponsored enterprise notes.

### Segmented Time Distribution

Information about the sensitivity of the fair values of the investments to market interest rate fluctuations is provided by the following schedule that shows the distribution of the investments by maturity:

| Investment Type                     | Fair Value      | Maturity in Years |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
|                                     |                 | 1-5               | >5                |
| Government-sponsored enterprise notes | $ 101,037,555   | $ 101,037,555     | $ -               |
| County Treasury pool                | $ 48,723,688    | $ 48,723,688      | $ -               |
| **Total**                           | **$ 149,761,243** | **$ 149,761,243** | **$ -**           |
<!-- Page 12 -->

**Credit Risk**

Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment. This is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The Sacramento County Treasury Investment Pool is not required to be rated.

| Investment Type                       | Fair Value     | Credit Rating |
|---------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Government-sponsored enterprise notes  | $ 101,037,555  | AAA           |
| County Treasury pool                  | $ 48,723,688   | Not rated     |
| **Total**                             | **$ 149,761,243** |               |

**Concentrations**

The investment policy contains no limitation on the amount that can be invested in any one issuer beyond the amount stipulated by the California Government Code.

**Custodial Credit Risk – Deposits**

This is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the District’s deposits may not be returned to it. The District does not have a policy for custodial credit risk for deposits. However, the California Government Code requires that a financial institution secure deposits made by State or local governmental units by pledging securities in an undivided collateral pool held by a depository regulated under state law (unless so waived by the governmental unit). The market value of the pledged securities in the collateral pool must equal at least 110% of the total amount deposited by the public agency. California law also allows financial institutions to secure public deposits by pledging first trust deed mortgage notes having a value of 150% of the secured public deposits and letters of credit issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco having a value of 105% of the secured deposits. As of June 30, 2023, the District’s bank balances for the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) were fully insured.

**Note 3 - Fair Value Measurements**

The District categorizes the fair value measurements of its investments based on the hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value hierarchy, which has three levels, is based on the valuation inputs used to measure an asset’s fair value. The following provides a summary of the hierarchy used to measure fair value:

- **Level 1** - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the District has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 1 assets may include debt and equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market and that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets.
<!-- Page 13 -->
![Los Rios Community College District General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) Notes to Financial Statements June 30, 2023](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Los+Rios+Community+College+District+General+Obligation+Bond+Construction+Fund+%28Measure+M%29+Notes+to+Financial+Statements+June+30%2C+2023)

Level 2 - Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable, such as interest rates and curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities, and credit spreads. For financial reporting purposes, if an asset has a specified term, a Level 2 input is required to be observable for substantially the full term of the asset.

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs should be developed using the best information available under the circumstances, which might include the District’s own data. The District should adjust that data if reasonably available information indicates that other market participants would use different data or certain circumstances specific to the District are not available to other market participants.

The District's fair value measurements are as follows at June 30, 2023:

| Investment Type               | Fair Value | Level 1 Inputs | Level 2 Inputs | Level 3 Inputs |
|-------------------------------|------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Government-sponsored enterprise notes | $ 101,037,555 | $ 101,037,555 | $ -            | $ -            |

All assets have been valued using a market approach, which uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or group of assets.

**Note 4 - Commitments and Contingencies**

**Litigation**

The District is involved in various litigation arising from the normal course of business. In the opinion of management and legal counsel, the disposition of all litigation pending is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the overall financial position of the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) at June 30, 2023.

Independent Auditor’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards

Governing Board and Citizens Oversight Committee  
Los Rios Community College District  
Sacramento, California  

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (Government Auditing Standards), the financial statements of the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) of the Los Rios Community College District (the District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated November 30, 2023.

**Emphasis of Matter**  
As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements present only the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M), and do not purport to, and do not, present fairly the financial position of the District, as of June 30, 2023, the changes in its financial position for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

**Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting**  
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the District’s General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified.

**Report on Compliance and Other Matters**

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) of the District’s financial statements are free of material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

**Purpose of this Report**

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

**Independent Auditor’s Report on Performance**

**Governing Board and Citizens Oversight Committee**  
Los Rios Community College District  
Sacramento, California  

We were engaged to conduct a performance audit of the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) of the Los Rios Community College District (the District) for the year ended June 30, 2023.

We conducted this performance audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

**Audit Authority/Purpose**

The Measure M Bonds were issued pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the State of California (the State), including the provisions of Chapters 1 and 1.5 of Part 10 of the California Education Code, and other applicable provisions of law.

The District received authorization at an election held in November 2008, to issue bonds of the District in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $475,000,000, to finance specific construction and renovation projects approved by eligible voters within the District. The proposition required approval by at least 55% of the votes cast by eligible voters within the District (the 2008 Authorization).

**Purpose**

The purpose of the Bond is as follows, as described in the ballot language for Measure M:  
“… to improve student academic performance by building classrooms, facilities and labs throughout the district including for teacher green technologies; nursing and health care programs; architecture, engineering and construction management; computer sciences; early childhood development; and fire and policy public safety programs at the American River, Cosumnes River, El Dorado, Folsom, and Sacramento City College campuses.”

**Authority**

On November 7, 2000, California voters approved Proposition 39, the Smaller Classes, Safer Schools and Financial Accountability Act. Proposition 39 amended portions of the California Constitution to provide for the issuance of general obligation bonds by the District, “for the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, including the furnishing and equipping of school facilities, or the acquisition or lease of rental property for school facilities”, upon approval by 55% of the electorate. In addition to reducing the approval threshold from two-thirds to 55%, Proposition 39 and the enacting legislation (AB 1908 and AB 2659) requires the following accountability measures as codified in Education Code sections 15278-15282:

1. Requires that the proceeds from the sale of the bonds be used only for the purposes specified in Article XIII A, Section 1(b)(3)(C) of the California Constitution, and not for any other purpose, including teacher and administrator salaries and other district operating expenses.

2. The District must list the specific facilities projects to be funded in the ballot measure and must certify that the governing board has evaluated safety and information technology needs in developing the project list.

3. Requires the District to appoint a citizen’s oversight committee.

4. Requires the District to conduct an annual independent financial audit and performance audit in accordance with the Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States of the bond proceeds until all of the proceeds have been expended.

5. Requires the District to conduct an annual independent performance audit to ensure that the funds have been expended only on the specific projects listed.

**Objectives of the Audit**

Our audit was limited to the objectives listed within the report which includes determining the District’s compliance with the performance requirements as referred to in Proposition 39 and outlined in Article XIII A, Section 1(b)(3)(C) of the California Constitution. Management is responsible for the District’s compliance with those requirements.

1. Determine whether expenditures charged to the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund have been made in accordance with the bond project list approved by the voters through the approval of Measure M.

2. Determine whether salary transactions, charged to the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund were in support of Measure M and not for District general administration or operations.

**Scope of the Audit**

The scope of our performance audit covered the period of July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023. The population of expenditures tested included all object and project codes associated with the bond projects. The propriety of expenditures for capital projects and maintenance projects funded through other State or local funding sources, other than proceeds of the bonds, were not included within the scope of the audit. Expenditures incurred subsequent to June 30, 2023, were not reviewed or included within the scope of our audit or in this report.

In planning and performing our performance audit, we obtained an understanding of the District’s internal control in order to determine if the internal controls were adequate to help ensure the District’s compliance with the requirements of Proposition 39 and outlined in Article XIII A, Section 1(b)(3)(C) of the California Constitution, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to you.

**Methodology**

We obtained the general ledger and the project expenditure reports prepared by the District for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 for the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M). Within the fiscal year audited, we obtained the actual invoices, purchase orders, and other supporting documentation for a sample of expenditures to ensure compliance with the requirements of Article XIII A, Section 1(b)(3)(C) of the California Constitution and Measure M as to the approved bond projects list. We performed the following procedures:

1. We identified expenditures and projects charged to the general obligation bond proceeds by obtaining the general ledger and project listing.

2. We selected a sample of expenditures using the following criteria:
   a) We considered all expenditures recorded in all object codes.
   b) We considered all expenditures recorded in all projects that were funded from July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023 from Measure M bond proceeds.
   c) We selected all expenditures that were individually significant expenditures. Individually significant expenditures were identified based on our assessment of materiality.
   d) For all items below the individually significant threshold identified in item 2c, judgmentally selected expenditures based on risk assessment and consideration of coverage of all object codes, including transfers out, and projects for period starting July 1, 2022 and ending June 30, 2023.

3. Our sample included transactions totaling $17,894,303. This represents 74% of the total expenditures of $24,054,030.

4. We reviewed the actual invoices and other supporting documentation to determine that:
   a) Expenditures were supported by invoices with evidence of proper approval and documentation of receiving goods or services.
   b) Expenditures were supported by proper bid documentation, as applicable.

c) Expenditures were expended in accordance with voter-approved bond project list.  
d) Bond proceeds were not used for salaries of administrators or other operating expenses of the District.

5. We determined that the District has met the compliance requirement of Measure M if the following conditions were met:  
a) Supporting documents for expenditures were aligned with the voter-approved bond project list.  
b) Expenditures were not used for salaries of administrators or other operating expenses of the District.

The results of our tests indicated that the District expended General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) funds only for the specific projects approved by the voters, in accordance with Proposition 39 and outlined in Article XIII A, Section 1(b)(3)(C) of the California Constitution.

Audit Results

The results of our tests indicated that, in all significant respects, the District has properly accounted for the expenditures held in the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) and that such expenditures were made for authorized Bond projects.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of the District, Governing Board, and Citizens Oversight Committee, and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.
