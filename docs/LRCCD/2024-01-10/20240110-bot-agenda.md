### Help Us Help You
Los Rios Community College District strives to make reasonable accommodations in all of its programs, services and activities for all qualified individuals with disabilities. Notification (568-3039) 48 hours in advance will enable the District to make arrangements to ensure meeting accessibility. The District will swiftly resolve those requests consistent with the ADA and resolving any doubt in favor of accessibility.

In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our four colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

**BACKGROUND:**  
The Education Code regulates the procedures by which a Community College District can dispose of real and personal property. Education Code section 81452 provides that the governing board may, by unanimous vote, dispose of items valued at $5,000 or less by private sale without advertising or selling the items at public auction. The District has held previous auctions, but they have generally cost more than they have netted for the District.

**STATUS:**  
The District has a quantity of surplus materials that needs to be disposed of, such as outdated desks and computers. The District has located a scrap dealer who will take selected surplus items for recycling. Any items remaining will be disposed.

The surplus items to be recycled or disposed of are either irreparable, obsolete, in poor condition or not needed for district/college operations and include the following: 15 computers and 9 monitors.

These items have a value of less than $5,000.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the disposal of the listed items per Education Code section 81452.

This Statement of Legislative Principles is adopted by the Board of Trustees for the Los Rios Community College District on behalf of itself and its four separately accredited Colleges (American River College, Cosumnes River College, Folsom Lake College and Sacramento City College) under Board Policy P-3115. This Statement is intended to support the District’s Strategic Goals: to establish effective pathways that optimize student access and success; to ensure equitable academic achievement across all racial, ethnic, socioeconomic and gender groups; to provide exemplary teaching and learning opportunities; to lead the region in workforce development; and to foster an outstanding working and learning environment.

This Statement of Legislative Principles provides guidelines for the Chancellor when addressing matters before the California Legislature and Congress, and constitutes the core principles guiding the development of the District’s position on legislation.

The District shall not support or oppose legislation unless the outcome will have a significant effect on the District, its students or its employees. The District will remain neutral on most matters affecting local collective bargaining. However, the District will take appropriate positions where that legislation will have a material impact on the District. The District will remain neutral on matters affecting only another single district or small group of district(s), except where policy precedents, or resource allocations, have the significant potential of affecting the Los Rios Community College District or the California Community College System generally. Where issues are raised in the budget process, the District shall seek legislative support or opposition in accordance with the principles established in this document. Where legislation is likely to impede the policy principles set forth, the District is likely to oppose that legislation unless there are significant countervailing reasons.

The Board of Trustees’ Legislative Principles align with the District’s Vision, Mission, Values, Goals and Strategies, as enumerated in the District’s Strategic Plan, as follows, but do not reflect every strategy under each goal area. The District will support those legislative efforts enumerated under each Goal.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** January 10, 2024

**SUBJECT:** Retiree Health Benefit Contribution (Policies 5165, 6622, and 9414)  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  
**CONSENT/ROUTINE**  
**FIRST READING**  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION** X  
**INFORMATION**  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
Currently, one thousand fifty (1050) District retirees receive a monthly District contribution for post-employment (retiree) healthcare premiums. Eligibility requirements for the District contribution varies depending upon if the former employee: a) retired between 1969 and 1978 and qualifies for the District monthly contribution pursuant to Board Policies (pre-collective bargaining); or b) retired under a particular collective bargaining contract which states the District contribution level and provisions for subsequent increases. Changes to the District contribution level for all retirees is subject to Governing Board action per Board Policies 5165 (Certificated Employees), 6622 (Classified Employees), or 9414 (Management/Confidential Employees).

**STATUS:**  
Consistent with Board policies, any change to the District contribution for retirees' healthcare premiums is reviewed biannually by the Board and is subject to the District's ability to fund the increase.

The last adjustment was effective July 1, 2021, with an increase of $28, to the current monthly contribution of $334. From the date of the last adjustment, the total monthly healthcare premiums (healthcare plan premiums plus Medicare premiums) for the majority of our retirees increased from $399 at July 1, 2021 to $425.91 at January 1, 2024. As of January 1, 2024, premiums will change on an annual basis each January.

The District proactively funds and manages the retiree health benefit program to ensure a viable benefit for current and future employees. In 1985, the District began setting-aside funds for the program and, in 2007, the District formally established the Los Rios Community College District Retiree Health Benefits Trust (Trust) to irrevocably designate assets to fund the total retiree healthcare benefit obligation (obligation).

The recommendation is to increase the monthly District contribution by $33 to $367 effective February 1, 2024.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve an increase to the District contribution for retirees’ healthcare premiums by $33 per month, from $334 to $367, effective February 1, 2024. The attached Board Policies 5165, 6622 and 9414 are revised to reflect the proposed change in rates and substance.
