ARC Classified Senate promoted our spring recess Professional Development opportunities April 12th and 13th via zoom. Senate members and Classified Professionals benefited from training on Trauma Informed Care from Dr. Tiffany Mimms, a Google Drive Plus workshop from our resident ITC expert Dr. Alice Deili, QPR Suicide Prevention with our licensed health and wellness center staff, and an open discussion on caring for classified colleagues during our April Senate meeting.

Nominations for Senate elections are taking place now and will close April 22nd. We have several Officer and Senator positions open. Results plan to be announced at an early May Senate meeting May 4th. We will celebrate Classified Appreciation Day with a lunch hosted by our managers May 11th. Finally, our Classified Professionals are volunteering and gearing up to help with our May 18th in person commencement before ramping up for summer terms and fall planning.

Our Classified Professionals Institute was held on Friday, April 1st. The keynote speaker was Lasana Hotep with the topic, “Fight, Flight or Freeze: Institutionalizing Equity in Our Colleges.” The event was well-attended with just over 40 Classified Professionals present for this virtual event, and a recording of the event will be available on our Professional Development website for those who were unable to attend. On May 5th we will celebrate and recognize the accomplishments of our colleagues and enjoy fellowshipping with each other at our annual Classified Appreciation event.

April’s Classified Senate meeting was delayed a week because of spring break, and will be held April 20th. As we continue to be committed to the hard work of equity, moving forward, each meeting agenda will have an equity-related discussion item. There will be no May meeting as we will gather together on May 5th and many of us are busy preparing for the end of the term and the graduation ceremony.

**Kevin G. Williams, Classified Senate President**

At SCC we have passed a new Classified Senate Constitution, and Bylaws. This change makes all Officer and Senator seats two-year terms. We have an alternating election schedule to prevent all Officers/Senators being replaced at the same time. We have opened nominations for the positions, with the President, Vice President, and half the Senators being nominated for a two-year term. The Secretary, Treasurer, and rest of the Senators elected for a 1-year term. In the future all elections will follow the Bylaws and be for two-year terms. Nominations will close on April 22nd, and then elections will begin shortly after.

SCC held its Classified Retreat on April 12th via zoom. Its theme was “Returning to the Table.” Workshops focused on mental/physical health and wellness, destressing, and communication methods. The retreat was a rousing success and received great support from Administrators, supervisors, and faculty members.
