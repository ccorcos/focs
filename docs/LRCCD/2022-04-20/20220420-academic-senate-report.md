**LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT**  
**DISTRICT ACADEMIC SENATE**  

**Academic Senate Reports to the LRCCD Board of Trustees**  
Respectfully submitted by the Academic Senate Presidents  
April 20, 2022  

**District Academic Senate (DAS) Response to BFSA:**  

At the April 5, 2022 DAS meeting, the DAS discussed the BFSA demands outlined in a March 2022 letter and the BFSA recommendations outlined in an August 2020 letter to the LRCCD. We are specifically reviewing the documents for areas where the demands and recommendations overlap academic senate purview (“10+1”). Discussions and actions will be ongoing.  

The two senate-led district committees, District Curriculum Coordinating Committee (DCCC) and District Equity and Student Success Committee (DESSC), have been asked to review the two documents and report back to the DAS regarding their discussion and any actions taken.  

The Senate-Union Joint Issues Committee (SUIJC) has also met and communicated about items from the documents which overlap academic senate and bargaining unit purview and will be meeting again on April 25th to continue the dialog.  

While the DAS has been discussing and acting on many things related to Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Anti-Racism, and Accessibility (IDEAA), the DAS is very aware that more work needs to be done. The DAS is committed to continuing dialogue and taking action on IDEAA work.  

Some highlights of IDEAA work of the DAS from 2020-2022:  
- The District Academic Senate (DAS) and the Los Rios College Federation of Teachers (LRCFT) hosted two “Antiracist Practices” sessions, summer 2020.  
- Lasana Hotep and Cynthia Olivo joined the fall 2020 DAS Retreat to introduce themselves and talk about their work with Los Rios. They left the DAS with the following questions for reflection:  
  - How does my own social location (race/class/gender/religion) shape my mindset about the practices that I act out?  
  - What more is it that I need to know about culture, power, and difference? Where do I learn this information?  

California Title § 553200 “10+1” 1. Curriculum, including establishing prerequisites 2. Degree and certificate requirements 3. Grading policies 4. Educational program development 5. Standards or policies regarding student preparation and success 6. College governance structures, as related to faculty roles 7. Faculty roles and involvement in the accreditation process 8. Policies for faculty professional development activities 9. Processes for program review 10. Processes for institutional planning and budget development 11. Other academic and professional matters as mutually agreed upon.

**CRC Academic Senate President, Scott Crosier, Reports:**

- The CRC Academic Senate has reviewed both letters from the BFSA and are working on continuing to foster an environment where individual faculty members, the Senate, and CRC as a community show support for all of our students, especially those who have been traditionally marginalized.
  - During this discussion, and many other related discussions, senators and chairs have been encouraged to introspect on their own personal practices, as well as what we can do as a senate and as individual committees.
    - As a senate, we have had a series of robust discussions related to understanding diversity, equity, and anti-racism.
    - Our curriculum committee has developed equitable practices in curriculum and syllabus development.
- The CRC Community continued to work on the We Won’t Fall Taskforce, in which we are exploring and working to eradicate any barriers to our racially marginalized population.
- The CRC Senate is also drafting a letter of support for our DSPS students and the efforts that we as faculty can do to provide accessible materials for all of our students.

**FLC Academic Senate President, Eric Wada, Reports:**

The visit occurred in March 2022. The next steps are that the Senate and college administration will work on ways to ensure that there is a common understanding of the meaning of collegial consultation.

**SCC Academic Senate President, Lori Petite, Reports:**

This paper came to our senate as a discussion item in a recent meeting. We anticipate we may have an approved copy to share with the Board next month.
- In light of the recent threats against ARC’s College President, and the subsequent list of demands by the Black Faculty and Staff Association (BFSA), Dr. Debra Crumpton provided an information item to our senate before Spring Break regarding the BFSA demands and status of the District's response. We urge the Board to ensure that an effective, meaningful, and timely response is provided to our BFSA colleagues and our colleges at large.

**Los Rios CCD Academic Senate Call to Action**

Approved Tuesday November 17, 2020

The four Los Rios Colleges and the District Academic Senate support the Academic Senate of California Community Colleges (ASCCC) Fall 2019 Plenary Resolution “Support Infusing Anti-Racism/No Hate Education in Community Colleges”. Specifically, to the following Resolved statements from that resolution:
1. denounce racism for its negative psychological, social, educational, and economic effects on human development throughout the lifespan;
2. take steps to not only strive for a greater knowledge about and the celebration of diversity but also to support deeper training that reveals the inherent racism embedded in societal institutions in the United States, including the educational system, and asks individuals to examine their personal role in the support of racist structures and the commitment to work to dismantle structural racism; and
3. infuse Anti- Racism/No Hate Education in all its activities and professional development opportunities to the degree that doing so is feasible.

To achieve this, our Academic Senates are committed to:
1. Include a discussion of anti-racism/no-hate education on agendas. Remembering that we do not have to have an answer to start a conversation.
2. Prioritize culturally responsive curricular redesign with our curriculum committees.
3. Acknowledge, without assigning blame, that the structure of our colleges houses the biases and prejudices of their founding times. Those biases have privileged some and disadvantaged others, particularly African American and LatinX communities.
4. Prioritize the evaluation of hiring and evaluation processes with an equity lens.
5. Request services from the ASCCC about any of these topics if needed.
6. Evaluate our academic senates and find the voices among our faculties missing in governance. Find ways to empower those voices.
7. Work with our administrations, classified professional colleagues, and students to find constructive ways students can express themselves about structural and historical biases that exist.
