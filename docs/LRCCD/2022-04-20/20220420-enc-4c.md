The Bonds will be issued under the provisions of the provisions of Articles 9 and 11 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the Government Code of the State of California, and the Bond Resolution.

## Description of the Bonds

The Bonds mature in the years and in the amounts and bear interest at the rates per annum all as set forth on the inside cover page hereof. Interest shall be computed based on a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. The Bonds will be issued in book-entry form only, and will initially be issued and registered in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee for DTC. Purchasers will not receive physical certificates representing their interest in the Bonds. See “Book-Entry Only System” below and “APPENDIX F – DTC and the Book-Entry Only System.”

The Bonds will be issued in the denomination of $5,000 principal amount each or any integral multiple thereof. Interest on the Bonds is payable semiannually on each February 1 and August 1, commencing August 1, 2022 (each, an “Interest Payment Date”). Each Bond will bear interest from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date of registration and authentication thereof unless (i) it is authenticated as of an Interest Payment Date, in which event it will bear interest from such date, or (ii) it is authenticated prior to an Interest Payment Date and after the close of business on the 15th calendar day of the month preceding the Interest Payment Date (each, a “Record Date”), in which event it will bear interest from the date, or (iii) it is authenticated prior to July 15, 2022, in which event it will bear interest from the date of delivery thereof identified in the cover page. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if interest on any Bond is in default at the time of authentication thereof, such Bond will bear interest from the Interest Payment Date to which interest has previously been paid or made available for payment thereon. Payments of principal of and interest on the Bonds will be paid by the Paying Agent to DTC for subsequent disbursement to DTC Participants who will remit such payments to the beneficial owners of the Bonds.

See the maturity schedules on the inside cover page of this Official Statement and “DEBT SERVICE SCHEDULES” herein.

## Book-Entry Only System

The Bonds will be issued in book-entry form only and will be initially issued and registered in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”). Purchasers of the Bonds (the “Beneficial Owners”) will not receive physical certificates representing their interest in the Bonds. Payments of principal of and interest on the Bonds will be paid by the County of Sacramento, Director of Finance, Sacramento, California (the “Paying Agent”) to DTC for subsequent disbursement to DTC Participants which will remit such payments to the Beneficial Owners of the Bonds.

As long as DTC’s book-entry method is used for the Bonds, the Paying Agent will send any notice of prepayment or other notices to owners only to DTC. Any failure of DTC to advise any DTC Participant, or of any DTC Participant to notify any Beneficial Owner, of any such notice and its content or effect will not affect the validity or sufficiency of the proceedings relating to the

prepayment of the Bonds called for prepayment or of any other action premised on such notice. See “APPENDIX F - DTC AND THE BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM.”

The Paying Agent, the District, and the Underwriters of the Bonds have no responsibility or liability for payments made on account of beneficial ownership or any aspects of the records relating thereto, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to beneficial ownership, of interests in the Bonds.

No Optional Redemption*

The Bonds are not subject to optional redemption prior to maturity.

Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption*

The Bonds maturing on August 1, 20__, and August 1, 20__ (the “Term Bonds”), are subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption on August 1 of each year in accordance with the schedules set forth below. The Term Bonds so called for mandatory sinking fund redemption will be redeemed in the sinking fund payments amounts and on the dates set forth below, without premium.

| Redemption Date (August 1) | Sinking Fund Redemption |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|

If any Term Bonds are redeemed pursuant to the optional redemption provisions described above, the total amount of all future sinking fund payments with respect to such Term Bonds shall be reduced by the aggregate principal amount of such Term Bonds so redeemed, to be allocated among such payments on a pro rata basis in integral multiples of $5,000 principal amount (or on such other basis as the District may determine) as set forth in written notice given by the District to the Paying Agent.

Notice of Redemption

The Paying Agent will cause notice of any redemption to be mailed, first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 20 days but not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, to the respective owners of any Bonds designated for redemption, at their addresses appearing on the registration books maintained by the Paying Agent. Such notice may be a conditional notice of redemption and subject to rescission as set forth below. Such notice shall state the redemption date and the redemption price and, if less than all of the then outstanding Bonds are to be called for redemption, shall designate the serial numbers of the Bonds to be redeemed by giving the individual number of each Bond or by stating that all Bonds between two stated numbers, both inclusive, or by stating that all of the Bonds of one or more maturities have been called for redemption, and shall require that such Bonds be then surrendered at the office of the

cancellation at the office of the Paying Agent, accompanied by delivery of a written instrument of transfer in a form approved by the Paying Agent, duly executed.

No exchanges of Bonds shall be required to be made (a) fifteen days prior to an Interest Payment Date or the date established by the Paying Agent for selection of Bonds for redemption until the close of business on the Interest Payment Date or day on which the applicable notice of redemption is given or (b) with respect to a Bond after such Bond has been selected or called for redemption in whole or in part.

## Defeasance

The Bonds may be paid by the District, in whole or in part, in any one or more of the following ways:

(a) by paying or causing to be paid the principal or redemption price of and interest on such Bonds, as and when the same become due and payable;

(b) by irrevocably depositing, in trust, at or before maturity, money or securities in the necessary amount (as provided in the Bond Resolution) to pay or redeem such Bonds; or

(c) by delivering such Bonds to the Paying Agent for cancellation by it.

Whenever in the Bond Resolution it is provided or permitted that there be deposited with or held in trust by the Paying Agent money or securities in the necessary amount to pay or redeem any Bonds, the money or securities to be deposited or held may be held by the Paying Agent or by any other fiduciary. Such money or securities may include money or securities held by the Paying Agent in the funds and accounts established under the Bond Resolution and will be:

(i) lawful money of the United States of America in an amount equal to the principal amount of such Bonds and all unpaid interest thereon to maturity, except that, in the case of Bonds which are to be redeemed prior to maturity and in respect of which notice of such redemption is given as provided in the Bond Resolution or provision satisfactory to the Paying Agent is made for the giving of such notice, the amount to be deposited or held will be the principal amount or redemption price of such Bonds and all unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date; or

(ii) Federal Securities (not callable by the issuer thereof prior to maturity) the principal of and interest on which when due, in the opinion of a certified public accountant delivered to the County and the District, will provide money sufficient to pay the principal or redemption price of and all unpaid interest to maturity, or to the redemption date, as the case may be, on the Bonds to be paid or redeemed, as such principal or redemption price and interest become due, provided that, in the case of Bonds which are to be redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption is given as provided in the Bond Resolution or provision satisfactory to the Paying Agent is made for the giving of such notice.

Upon the deposit, in trust, at or before maturity, of money or Federal Securities in the necessary amount (as described above) to pay or redeem any outstanding Bond (whether upon
<!-- Page 16 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)  

or prior to its maturity or the redemption date of such Bond), provided that, if such Bond is to be redeemed prior to maturity, notice of such redemption has been given as provided in the Bond Resolution or provision satisfactory to the Paying Agent has been made for the giving of such notice, then all liability of the District in respect of such Bond will cease and be completely discharged, except only that thereafter the owner thereof will be entitled only to payment of the principal of and interest on such Bond by the District, and the District will remain liable for such payment, but only out of such money or securities deposited with the Paying Agent for such payment.

As defined in the Bond Resolution, the term “Federal Securities” means (a) any direct general non-callable obligations of the United States of America, including obligations issued or held in book entry form on the books of the Department of the Treasury of the United States of America; (b) any obligations the timely payment of principal of and interest on which are directly or indirectly guaranteed by the United States of America or which are secured by obligations described in the preceding clause (a); (c) the interest component of Resolution Funding Corporation strips which have been stripped by request to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in book-entry form; (d) pre-refunded municipal bonds rated in the highest rating category by any Rating Agency; and (e) bonds, debentures, notes or other evidence of indebtedness issued or guaranteed by any of the following federal agencies: (i) direct obligations or fully guaranteed certificates of beneficial ownership of the U.S. Export-Import Bank; (ii) certificates of beneficial ownership of the Farmers Home Administration; (iii) participation certificates of the General Services Administration; (iv) Federal Financing Bank bonds and debentures; (v) guaranteed Title XI financings of the U.S. Maritime Administration; (vi) project notes, local authority bonds, new communities debentures and U.S. public housing notes and bonds of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; and (vii) obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB).

# SECURITY FOR THE BONDS

## Ad Valorem Property Taxes

### Bonds Payable from Ad Valorem Property Taxes
The Bonds are general obligations of the District, payable solely from ad valorem property taxes levied on taxable property in the District and collected by the Counties. The Counties are empowered and are obligated to annually levy ad valorem property taxes for the payment by the District of the Bonds and the interest thereon upon all property within the District subject to taxation by the District, without limitation of rate or amount (except certain personal property which is taxable at limited rates).

### Other Bonds Payable from Ad Valorem Property Taxes
The District has a number of general obligation bond issues outstanding which are payable from ad valorem property taxes on a parity basis. In addition to the general obligation bonds issued by the District, there is other debt issued by entities with jurisdiction in the District, which is payable from ad valorem property taxes levied on parcels in the District. See “PROPERTY TAXATION – Tax Rates” and “- Direct and Overlapping Debt” below.

### Levy and Collection
The Counties will levy and collect such ad valorem property taxes in such amounts and at such times as is necessary to ensure the timely payment by the District of debt service. Such taxes, when collected, will be deposited into a debt service fund for the Bonds, which is maintained by the County and which is irrevocably pledged by the District for the payment by it of principal of and interest on the Bonds when due.

District property taxes are assessed and collected by the Counties in the same manner and at the same time, and in the same installments as other ad valorem property taxes on real property, and will have the same priority, become delinquent at the same times and in the same proportionate amounts, and bear the same proportionate penalties and interest after delinquency, as do the other ad valorem property taxes on real property.

### Statutory Lien on Ad Valorem Property Tax Revenues
Pursuant to Senate Bill 222 effective January 1, 2016, voter approved general obligation bonds which are secured by ad valorem property tax collections, including the Bonds, are secured by a statutory lien on revenues received pursuant to the levy and collection of the property tax imposed to service those bonds. Said lien attaches automatically and is valid and binding from the time the bonds are executed and delivered. The lien is enforceable against the District, its successors, transferees, and creditors, and all others asserting rights therein, irrespective of whether those parties have notice of the lien and without the need for any further act.

### Annual Tax Rates
The amount of the annual ad valorem property tax levied by the Counties for the District to repay the Bonds will be determined by the relationship between the assessed valuation of taxable property in the District and the amount of debt service due on the Bonds. Fluctuations in the annual debt service on the Bonds and the assessed value of taxable property in the District may cause the annual tax rate to fluctuate.

Economic and other factors beyond the District's control, such as economic recession, deflation of property values, a relocation out of the District or financial difficulty or bankruptcy by one or more major property taxpayers, or the complete or partial destruction of taxable property caused by, among other eventualities, earthquake, flood, fire, outbreak of disease or other natural disaster or man-made disaster, could cause a reduction in the assessed value within the District and necessitate a corresponding increase in the annual tax rate. See “PROPERTY TAXATION”
<!-- Page 20 -->
- Assessed Valuations – Factors Relating to Increases/Decreases in Assessed Value.” See also below under the heading “--Disclosure Relating to COVID-19.”

## Debt Service Fund

Pursuant to the Bond Resolution, the County will establish a Debt Service Fund, into which will be deposited all taxes levied by the Counties for the payment by the District of the principal of and interest on the Bonds. The Debt Service Fund is pledged by the District for the payment by it of the principal of and interest and premium (if any) on the Bonds when and as the same become due. The County will receive the tax proceeds collected by the Counties and will deposit said amounts into the Debt Service Fund, and will transfer amounts in the Debt Service Fund to the Paying Agent to the extent necessary to enable the District to pay the principal of and interest and premium (if any) on the Bonds as the same becomes due and payable.

## Not a County Obligation

No part of any fund or account of the Counties are pledged or obligated to the payment of the Bonds. The Bonds are payable solely from the proceeds of an ad valorem property tax levied and collected by the Counties, for the payment by the District of principal of and interest on the Bonds. Although the Counties are obligated to collect the ad valorem property tax for the payment of the Bonds, the Bonds are not a debt (or a pledge of the full faith and credit) of the Counties.

## Disclosure Relating to COVID-19

### Background

The outbreak of COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”), which was first detected in China and spread throughout the world, including the United States, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, a national emergency by President Trump and a state of emergency by the Governor of the State (the “Governor”) in March 2020. Since said declarations, tremendous volatility in the financial markets occurred, and nations have taken actions to curb the spread including stay at home orders and other actions which have unknown long-term impacts including on worldwide and local economies. As of this date, several vaccines have been provided approval, most on an emergency basis, by federal health authorities and are widely available.

### Federal Response

President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency on March 13, 2020 made available more than $50 billion in federal resources to combat the spread of the virus. A multi-billion-dollar relief package was signed into law by President Trump on March 18, 2020, providing for Medicaid expansion, unemployment benefits and paid emergency leave during the crisis. In addition, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate to nearly zero, introduced a large bond-buying program and established emergency lending programs to banks and money market mutual funds.

On March 27, 2020, the United States Congress passed a $2 trillion relief package, being the largest national stimulus bill in history, referred to as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The package provided direct payments to taxpayers, jobless benefits, assistance to hospitals and healthcare systems, $367 billion for loans to small businesses, a $500 billion fund to assist distressed large businesses, including approximately $30 billion for emergency grants to educational institutions and local educational agencies. This funding allocation included approximately $13.5 billion in formula funding to make grants available to each state’s educational agency in order to facilitate K-12 schools’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

-13-
<!-- Page 21 -->
On April 9, 2020, the Federal Reserve took actions aimed at providing up to $2.3 trillion in loans to support the national economy, including supplying liquidity to participating financial institutions in the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), purchasing up to $600 billion in loans through the Main Street Lending Program and offering up to $500 billion in lending to states and municipalities.

On April 24, 2020, an additional $484 billion federal aid package was signed, providing additional funding for the PPP, the SBA disaster assistance loans and grant program, hospital grants and funding for a COVID-19 testing program.

On December 27, 2020, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (the “CRRSA Act”), an additional $900 billion federal relief package intended to follow and expand on provisions of the CARES Act. The measure includes another round of direct stimulus payments to individuals and families, extended unemployment benefits, expanded the PPP, and provided approximately $82 billion in supplemental aid to support the educational needs of states, school districts, and institutions of higher education, among other stimulus measures.

On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the “ARP Act”), a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus plan that provided another round of stimulus checks to individuals and families, extended federal supplemental unemployment benefits, provided more funding for state and local governments, expanded subsidies for healthcare insurance, and provided additional funding for COVID-19 testing, vaccination, and treatment, among several other provisions that affect many industries, businesses, and individuals. With respect to educational agencies, grants of $125.8 billion are being provided to states to support statewide and local funding for elementary and secondary schools and public postsecondary institutions. Funding can be used for a number of education-related expenses, including inspecting and improving school facilities to ensure adequate air quality, providing mental health services, reducing class sizes, implementing social distancing guidelines, and purchasing personal protective equipment. At least 20% of the funding will have to be used to address learning loss, including through summer learning or enrichment, after-school programs, or extended-day or extended-year programs. States that receive the grants cannot reduce their spending levels on education as a proportion of their budgets during fiscal 2022 or 2023, compared with the average level from fiscal 2017 through 2019.

**State Response.** At the State level, on March 15, 2020, the Governor ordered the closing of California bars and nightclubs, the cancellation of gatherings of more than 250. On March 16, 2020, the State legislature passed $1.1 billion in general purpose spending authority providing emergency funds to respond to the pandemic. On March 19, 2020, the Governor issued a statewide blanket shelter-in-place order, ordering all California residents to stay home except for certain essential purposes. The restrictions initially began to be rolled back in May 2020 in accordance with State and local guidelines. Thereafter, on August 28, 2020, the Governor released a system entitled “Blueprint for a Safer California” (the “State Blueprint”) aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19. The State Blueprint placed the State’s 58 counties into four color-coded tiers generally based on test positivity and adjusted case rate in the county. Each tier imposed restrictions on certain activities to reduce the spread. The tier system was ultimately terminated on June 15, 2021, following significant reductions in positivity and hospitalizations due to the availability of effective COVID-19 vaccines.
<!-- Page 22 -->
On February 23, 2021, the Governor signed legislation providing $7.6 billion in State funding aimed at helping individuals and businesses that were not included in federal aid. It includes sending a $600 rebate to low-income, disabled and undocumented persons when 2020 taxes are filed, $2 billion in grants to help small business, $35 million for food and diaper banks and $400 million in subsidies for childcare providers. It also reverses cuts made last summer to public universities and State courts when the State had projected a record-breaking budget deficit.

Notwithstanding that several vaccines have been approved for public use with respect to COVID-19, the spread of COVID-19 and related variants is ongoing, and future actions to reduce its spread and its impact on global and local economies are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Additional information with respect to events surrounding the outbreak of COVID-19 and responses thereto can be found on State and local government websites, including but not limited to: the Governor's office (http://www.gov.ca.gov) and the California Department of Public Health (https://covid19.ca.gov/). The District has not incorporated by reference the information on such websites, and the District does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy of the information on such websites.

**Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic on Global and Local Economies Cannot be Predicted; Potential Declines in State and Local Revenues.** The COVID-19 public health emergency has altered the behavior of businesses and people in a manner that will have negative impacts on global and local economies. Although the State made historic levels of funding available for education in the 2021-22 State budget, the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Statewide and other economies is unknown and the District cannot predict the short or long term impacts the COVID-19 pandemic might have on District operations and finances, and local property values. For more detail regarding the District's current budget, and related reports and outlooks, see Appendix A under the heading “STATE FUNDING OF EDUCATION; RECENT STATE BUDGETS.”

**Impacts of COVID-19 Emergency Uncertain.** The possible impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic might have on the District’s finances, programs, credit ratings on its debt obligations, local property values and the economy in general are uncertain at this time. In addition, there may be unknown consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, which the District is unable to predict.

**General Obligation Bonds Secured by Ad Valorem Property Tax Revenues.** Notwithstanding the impacts the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the economy in the State, the County and the District or on the District’s general purpose revenues, the Bonds described herein are voter-approved general obligations of the District payable solely from the levy and collection of ad valorem property taxes, unlimited as to rate or amount, and are not payable from the general fund of the District. The District cannot predict the impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic might have on local property values or tax collections. See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Ad Valorem Property Taxes” and “PROPERTY TAXATION – Teeter Plan; Tax Levies and Delinquencies” herein.

# PROPERTY TAXATION

## Property Tax Collection Procedures

Generally. In California, property which is subject to ad valorem property taxes is classified as “secured” or “unsecured.” The “secured roll” is that part of the assessment roll containing state assessed public utilities’ property and real property, the taxes on which create a lien on such property sufficient, in the opinion of the county assessor, to secure payment of the taxes. A tax levied on unsecured property does not become a lien against such unsecured property but may become a lien on certain other property owned by the taxpayer. Every tax which becomes a lien on secured property has priority over all other liens arising pursuant to State law on such secured property, regardless of the time of the creation of the other liens. Secured and unsecured property are entered separately on the assessment roll maintained by the county assessor. The method of collecting delinquent taxes is substantially different for the two classifications of property.

Property taxes on the secured roll are due in two installments, on November 1 and February 1 of each fiscal year. If unpaid, such taxes become delinquent after December 10 and April 10, respectively, and a 10% penalty attaches to any delinquent payment. In addition, property on the secured roll with respect to which taxes are delinquent is declared tax defaulted on or about June 30 of the fiscal year. Such property may thereafter be redeemed by payment of the delinquent taxes and a delinquency penalty, plus a redemption penalty of 1-1/2% per month to the time of redemption. If taxes are unpaid for a period of five years or more, the property is subject to sale by the County.

Property taxes are levied for each fiscal year on taxable real and personal property situated in the taxing jurisdiction as of the preceding January 1. A bill enacted in 1983, SB813 (Statutes of 1983, Chapter 498), however, provided for the supplemental assessment and taxation of property as of the occurrence of a change of ownership or completion of new construction. Thus, this legislation eliminated delays in the realization of increased property taxes from new assessments. As amended, SB813 provided increased revenue to taxing jurisdictions to the extent that supplemental assessments of new construction or changes of ownership occur subsequent to the January 1 lien date and result in increased assessed value.

Property taxes on the unsecured roll are due on the January 1 lien date and become delinquent, if unpaid on the following August 31. A 10% penalty is also attached to delinquent taxes in respect of property on the unsecured roll, and further, an additional penalty of 1-1/2% per month accrues with respect to such taxes beginning the first day of the third month following the delinquency date. The taxing authority has four ways of collecting unsecured personal property taxes: (1) a civil action against the taxpayer; (2) filing a certificate in the office of the superior court clerk specifying certain facts in order to obtain a judgment lien on certain property of the taxpayer; (3) filing a certificate of delinquency for record in the county recorder’s office, in order to obtain a lien on certain property of the taxpayer; and (4) seizure and sale of personal property, improvements or possessory interests belonging or assessed to the assessee. The exclusive means of enforcing the payment of delinquent taxes in respect of property on the secured roll is the sale of the property securing the taxes for the amount of taxes which are delinquent.

## Disclaimer Regarding Property Tax Collection Procedures

The property tax collection procedures described above are subject to amendment based on legislation or executive order which may be enacted by the State legislature or declared by the Governor from time to time. 

-16-
<!-- Page 24 -->
The District cannot predict whether future amendments or orders will occur, and what impact, if any, said future amendments or orders could have on the procedures relating to the levy and collection of property taxes, and related interest and penalties.

## Taxation of State-Assessed Utility Property

The State Constitution provides that most classes of property owned or used by regulated utilities be assessed by the State Board of Equalization (“SBE”) and taxed locally. Property valued by the SBE as an operating unit in a primary function of the utility taxpayer is known as “unitary property,” a concept designed to permit assessment of the utility as a going concern rather than assessment of each individual element of real and personal property owned by the utility taxpayer. State-assessed unitary and “operating nonunitary” property (which excludes nonunitary property of regulated railways) is allocated to the counties based on the situs of the various components of the unitary property. Except for unitary property of regulated railways and certain other excepted property, all unitary and operating nonunitary property is taxed at special county-wide rates and tax proceeds are distributed to taxing jurisdictions according to statutory formulae generally based on the distribution of taxes in the prior year.

## Factors Relating to Increases/Decreases in Assessed Value
As indicated in the previous table, assessed valuations are subject to change in each year. Increases or decreases in assessed valuation result from a variety of factors including but not limited to general economic conditions, supply and demand for real property in the area, government regulations such as zoning, and man-made or natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods and drought. Seismic activity is also a risk in the region where the District is located.

The State has experienced drought conditions in recent years, including a period of drought followed by record-level precipitation in late 2016 and early 2017 which resulted in related severe flooding and mudslides in certain regions. As of March 29, 2022, the U.S. Drought Monitor indicates that the State is classified as experiencing mostly severe to extreme drought conditions, with the County in the severe drought category. During 2021, Governor Newsom proclaimed a drought state of emergency for all counties in the State, culminating with his October 19, 2021 proclamation, urging Californians to step up their water conservation efforts. In January 2022, the State Water Board adopted emergency regulations aimed at saving water and raising drought awareness, with prohibitions focused on reducing outdoor water use, enforceable by local authorities.

## Reassessments and Appeals of Assessed Value

Reassessment or appeals of assessed values could adversely impact property tax revenues within the District.

Appeals may be based on Proposition 8 of November 1978, which requires that for each January 1 lien date, the taxable value of real property must be the lesser of its base year value, annually adjusted by the inflation factor pursuant to Article XIII A of the State Constitution, or its full cash value, taking into account reductions in value due to damage, destruction, depreciation, obsolescence, removal of property or other factors causing a decline in value. See “CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS – Article XIII A of the California Constitution” in APPENDIX A.

Under California law, property owners may apply for a Proposition 8 reduction of their property tax assessment by filing a written application, in form prescribed by the State Board of Equalization, with the County board of equalization or assessment appeals board. In most cases, the appeal is filed because the applicant believes that present market conditions (such as

### Teeter Plan; Property Tax Collections

The Boards of Supervisors of the Counties have adopted the Alternative Method of Distribution of Tax Levies and Collections and of Tax Sale Proceeds (the “Teeter Plan”), as provided for in Section 4701 et seq. of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. Under the Teeter Plan, each entity levying property taxes in a County may draw on the amount of uncollected secured taxes credited to its fund, in the same manner as if the amount credited had been collected. However, as a result of such participation, it is not entitled to delinquency penalties or interest.

Each of the Counties includes in its Teeter Plan the one percent general fund apportionment, and the District participates in each of the Teeter Plans with respect to its share of the one percent general fund apportionment. Sacramento County, Yolo County and Solano County include the District’s ad valorem property tax levies in its Teeter Plan as well. Placer County and El Dorado County do not include the District’s ad valorem levies for general obligation bonds in its Teeter Plans, so the District is subject to delinquencies in those Counties, and entitled to penalties and interest.

Under the statute creating the Teeter Plan, a Board of Supervisors can under certain circumstances terminate the Teeter Plan in part or in its entirety with respect to an entire County and, in addition, a Board of Supervisors can terminate the Teeter Plan with respect to the District if the delinquency rate for all ad valorem property taxes levied within the District in any year exceeds 3%. In the event that a Teeter Plan were terminated, the receipt of the levy of ad valorem.

The District cannot provide any assurances that the Counties will continue to maintain the Teeter Plan described above or will have sufficient funds available to distribute the full amount of the District’s share of property tax collections to the District. The ability of the County to maintain the Teeter Plan may depend on its financial resources and may be affected by future property tax delinquencies. Property tax delinquencies may be impacted by economic and other factors beyond the District’s or the County’s control, including the ability or willingness of property owners to pay property taxes during an economic recession or depression. An economic recession or depression could be caused by many factors outside the control of the District, including high interest rates, reduced consumer confidence, reduced real wages or reduced economic activity as a result of the spread of COVID-19 or other outbreak of disease or natural or manmade disaster.

# Major Taxpayers

The following table shows the 20 largest owners of secured taxable property in the District as determined by secured assessed valuation.

The more property (by assessed value) which is owned by a single taxpayer in the District, the greater the amount of tax collections that are exposed to weaknesses in the taxpayer's financial situation and ability or willingness to pay property taxes. Each taxpayer listed below is a unique name listed on the tax rolls. The District cannot determine from County assessment records whether individual persons, corporations or other organizations are liable for tax payments with respect to multiple properties held in various names that in aggregate may be larger than is suggested by the table below.

# Direct and Overlapping Debt

Set forth below is a direct and overlapping debt report (the “Debt Report”) prepared by California Municipal Statistics, Inc. The Debt Report is included for general information purposes only. The District has not reviewed the Debt Report for completeness or accuracy and makes no representation in connection therewith.

The Debt Report generally includes long-term obligations sold in the public credit markets by public agencies whose boundaries overlap the boundaries of the District in whole or in part. Such long-term obligations generally are not payable from revenues of the District (except as indicated) nor are they necessarily obligations secured by land within the District. In many cases, long-term obligations issued by a public agency are payable only from the general fund or other revenues of such public agency.

# TAX MATTERS

## Tax Exemption

**Federal Tax Status.** In the opinion of Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, San Francisco, California, Bond Counsel, subject, however to the qualifications set forth below, under existing law, the interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and such interest is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax.

The opinions set forth in the preceding paragraph are subject to the condition that the District comply with all requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Tax Code") that must be satisfied subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that the interest thereon be, and continue to be, excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The District has made certain representations and covenants in order to comply with each such requirement. Inaccuracy of those representations, or failure to comply with certain of those covenants, may cause the inclusion of such interest in gross income for federal income tax purposes, which may be retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds.

**Tax Treatment of Original Issue Discount and Premium – Bonds.** If the initial offering price to the public at which a Bond is sold is less than the amount payable at maturity thereof, then such difference constitutes "original issue discount" for purposes of federal income taxes and State of California personal income taxes. If the initial offering price to the public at which a Bond is sold is greater than the amount payable at maturity thereof, then such difference constitutes "original issue premium" for purposes of federal income taxes and State of California personal income taxes. De minimis original issue discount and original issue premium are disregarded.

Under the Tax Code, original issue discount is treated as interest excluded from federal gross income and exempt from State of California personal income taxes to the extent properly allocable to each owner thereof subject to the limitations described in the first paragraph of this section. The original issue discount accrues over the term to maturity of the Bond on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded on each interest or principal payment date (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). The amount of original issue discount accruing during each period is added to the adjusted basis of such Bonds to determine taxable gain upon disposition (including sale, redemption, or payment on maturity) of such Bond. The Tax Code contains certain provisions relating to the accrual of original issue discount in the case of purchasers of the Bonds who purchase the Bonds after the initial offering of a substantial amount of such maturity. Owners of such Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of purchasers who do not purchase in the original offering to the public at the first price at which a substantial amount of such Bonds is sold to the public.

Under the Tax Code, original issue premium is amortized on an annual basis over the term of the Bond (said term being the shorter of the Bond's maturity date or its call date). The amount of original issue premium amortized each year reduces the adjusted basis of the owner of the Bond for purposes of determining taxable gain or loss upon disposition. The amount of original issue premium on a Bond is amortized each year over the term to maturity of the Bond on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded on each interest or principal payment date (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). Amortized Bond premium is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. Owners of premium Bonds, including purchasers

-28-

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

who do not purchase in the original offering, should consult their own tax advisors with respect to State of California personal income tax and federal income tax consequences of owning such Bonds.

**California Tax Status.** In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Bonds is exempt from California personal income taxes.

**Other Tax Considerations**

Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Tax Code or court decisions may cause interest on the Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal income taxation or may cause the interest on the Bonds to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or cause the Bonds to not be “qualified tax-exempt obligations,” or otherwise prevent beneficial owners from realizing the full current benefit of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals, clarification of the Tax Code or court decisions may also affect the market price for, or marketability of, the Bonds, as applicable. It cannot be predicted whether or in what form any such proposal might be enacted or whether, if enacted, such legislation would apply to bonds issued prior to enactment.

The opinions expressed by Bond Counsel are based upon existing legislation and regulations as interpreted by relevant judicial and regulatory authorities as of the date of such opinion, and Bond Counsel has expressed no opinion with respect to any proposed legislation or as to the treatment of interest on the Bonds, or as to the consequences of owning or receiving interest on the Bonds, as of any future date. Prospective purchasers of the Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding any pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

Owners of the Bonds should also be aware that the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds may have federal or state tax consequences other than as described above. Other than as expressly described above, Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding other federal or state tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds, the ownership, sale or disposition of the Bonds, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on the Bonds.

**Form of Opinion**

A copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is attached hereto as Appendix D.

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=CERTAIN+LEGAL+MATTERS)

**CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS**

**Legality for Investment**

Under provisions of the California Financial Code, the Bonds are legal investments for commercial banks in California to the extent that the Bonds, in the informed opinion of the bank, are prudent for the investment of funds of depositors, and under provisions of the California Government Code, the Bonds are eligible to secure deposits of public moneys in California.

**Absence of Material Litigation**

No litigation is pending or threatened concerning the validity of the Bonds, and a certificate to that effect will be furnished to purchasers at the time of the original delivery of the Bonds. The District is not aware of any litigation pending or threatened that (i) questions the political existence of the District, (ii) contests the District's ability to receive ad valorem property taxes or to collect other revenues or (iii) contests the District's ability to issue and retire the Bonds.

The District is subject to lawsuits and claims that arise in the regular course of operating a public school district. In the opinion of the District, the aggregate amount of the uninsured liabilities of the District under these lawsuits and claims will not materially affect the financial position or operations of the District. The District cannot predict what litigation, if any, could arise as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Compensation of Certain Professionals**

Payment of the fees and expenses of Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, San Francisco, California as Bond Counsel and Disclosure Counsel to the District, ________, California, as Underwriter’s Counsel, and Dale Scott & Company, Inc., as Municipal Advisor to the District, is contingent upon issuance of the Bonds.

**CONTINUING DISCLOSURE**

The District will execute Continuing Disclosure Certificates in connection with the issuance of the Bonds in substantially the form attached hereto as APPENDIX E. The District has covenanted therein, for the benefit of holders and beneficial owners of the Bonds to provide certain financial information and operating data relating to the District to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (an “Annual Report”) not later than nine months after the end of the District's fiscal year (which currently would be March 31), commencing March 31, 2023 with the report for the 2021-22 Fiscal Year, and to provide notices of the occurrence of certain enumerated events. Such notices will be filed by the District with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the “MSRB”). The specific nature of the information to be contained in an Annual Report or the notices of enumerated events is set forth in “APPENDIX E – FORM OF CONTINUING DISCLOSURE CERTIFICATE.” These covenants have been made in order to assist the Underwriters of the Bonds in complying with S.E.C. Rule 15c2-12(b)(5) (the “Rule”).

The District has existing disclosure undertakings that have been made pursuant to the Rule in connection with the issuance of the District's outstanding general obligation bonds and other indebtedness (see information in APPENDIX A under the heading “DISTRICT FINANCIAL”).

INFORMATION – Long-Term Indebtedness”). A review of the District’s prior undertakings and filings made in the previous five years has been undertaken. One instance of material noncompliance has been identified which is that notice of the District’s S&P rating upgrade which occurred on November 28, 2017 was filed more than ten days late on January 23, 2018.

In order to assist in future timely compliance with its disclosure undertakings for its outstanding obligations and the Bonds, the District has contracted with Dale Scott & Company, Inc. to serve as dissemination agent for the Bonds and the outstanding obligations of the District.

Neither the County nor any other entity other than the District shall have any obligation or incur any liability whatsoever with respect to the performance of the District’s duties regarding continuing disclosure.

RATINGS

S&P Global Ratings, a business unit of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”), has assigned a rating of “___” to the Bonds and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) has assigned a rating of “___” to the Bonds.

Such ratings reflect only the views of S&P and Moody’s, respectively, and an explanation of the significance of such ratings may be obtained only from S&P and Moody’s. The District has provided certain additional information and materials to S&P and Moody’s (some of which does not appear in this Official Statement because it is not material for purposes of making an investment decision). There is no assurance that such ratings will continue for any given period of time or that the ratings will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely by S&P or Moody’s, if in the judgment of such rating agency, circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision or withdrawal of such rating may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Bonds.

UNDERWRITING

___________ (the “Underwriter”), has agreed to purchase the Bonds pursuant to a bond purchase agreement for the Bonds (the “Bond Purchase Agreement”). The Underwriter has agreed to purchase the Bonds at a price of $__________ (representing the principal amount of the Bonds of $__________, plus net original issue premium of $__________, less an underwriter’s discount of $__________).

The Bond Purchase Agreement provides that the Underwriter will purchase all of the Bonds (if any are purchased) and provide that the Underwriter’s obligation to purchase is subject to certain terms and conditions, including the approval of certain legal matters by counsel.

The Underwriter may offer and sell Bonds to certain securities dealers and others at prices lower than the offering prices stated on the inside cover page hereof. The offering prices may be changed by the Underwriter.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the number of FTEs. The District is undertaking outreach to recent high school graduates and others to help address recent declines.

## District’s Response to COVID-19 Pandemic

To reduce the potential for community transmission of COVID-19 and in accordance with all official recommendations, guidelines and mandates, the District generally closed its campuses and facilities in March 2020. The reopening of the colleges commenced thereafter in accordance with all requirements of State and local authorities. [At this time in the 2021-22 fiscal year, the District offers in-person and online classes, and has made adjustments to its spaces and offices in accordance with all applicable mandates and other guidelines].

The District has received and/or been allocated funding from federal and State sources in the combined total amount of approximately $226 million in one-time mitigation funding from combined State and federal programs to address expenses arising from the COVID pandemic. These funds have and will be spent in accordance with applicable guidelines.

Enrollment in Community Colleges in California and nationally is down significantly, despite efforts made to keep students in classes with the sudden transition to online education. Technology and funding were distributed to students in an effort to keep them engaged. The District suffered a decrease of over 10%. Ongoing efforts are being made to boost enrollment.

# DISTRICT FINANCIAL INFORMATION

## Funding of Community College Districts in California

### Major Revenues
California community college districts (other than community-supported districts, as described below) receive, on average, approximately 52% of their funds from the State, approximately 44% from local sources, and approximately 4% from federal sources. State funds include general apportionment, categorical funds, capital construction, the lottery, and other minor sources. Local sources include property taxes, student fees, and miscellaneous sources.

### Student-Centered Funding Formula
The Student-Centered Funding Formula (“SCFF”) which commenced in 2018-19 is the formula currently used to allocate state general apportionment funding to California's community colleges. SCFF retained the Basic Allocation previously established under Senate Bill 361 (“SB 361”) in the 2006-07 fiscal year, but at significantly reduced rates. However, SCFF funds community college districts for outcomes and demographics, providing an incentive to improve students' success, especially students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The SCFF allocations for the fiscal year 2020-2021 and their respective weightings consist of:

1. a base allocation (70%) consistent with the SB 361 formula of: (a) not less than $4,367 per credit FTES; (b) a uniform rate of $2,626 per noncredit FTES; and (c) $3,092 per FTES for the instructional category known as “career development and college preparation,” all subject to cost of living adjustments;

2. a supplemental allocation (20%) based on the number of students who receive a California Promise Grant, Pell Grant or are non-resident students that qualify for in-state tuition; and

3. a student success allocation (10%) which will allocate funds for outcomes related to completion of associate degree transfers, associate degrees and bachelor’s degrees, credit certificates, completion of transfer-level math and English within the first academic year of enrollment, transfer to four-year universities, completion of nine or more career technical education units and attainment of a regional living wage.

### Hold Harmless Provision
During the three years of implementation of SCFF, no community college district will receive less funding than it received in 2017-18, and each district will receive an increase to reflect a cost-of-living adjustment. The formula includes a “stability” provision that delays any decrease in revenue by one year. The hold harmless provision has been extended by three years, through 2024-25, and districts will receive at least their 2017-18 funding, with a cost-of-living adjustment each year.

### Advisory Committees
Two advisory committees will be established reporting to the Chancellor’s Office and the Legislature.

## District Accounting Practices
For financial reporting purposes, the District is considered a special-purpose government engaged only in business-type activities. Accordingly, the District's financial statements have been prepared using the economic focus and accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual

A-6
<!-- Page 46 -->
basis, revenues are recognized when earned, and expenses are recorded when an obligation has been incurred. All significant interfund transactions are eliminated. The budgetary and financial accounts of the District are recorded and maintained in accordance with the Budget and Accounting Manual issued by the Chancellor's Office of the California Community College. For more information on the District's accounting policies, see Note 2 of "APPENDIX B - FISCAL YEAR 2020-21 AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" attached hereto.

The District's Audited Financial Statements for fiscal year 2020-21 were prepared by Eide Bailly, LLP, San Ramon, California and are attached as APPENDIX B. Audited financial statements for the District for prior fiscal years are on file with the District and available for public inspection at the Chancellor’s Office.

The District considers its audited financial statements to be public information, and accordingly, no consent has been sought or obtained from the auditor in connection with the inclusion of such statements in this Official Statement. The auditor has made no representation in connection with inclusion of the audit in this Official Statement.

# District Budget

The District is required by provisions of the State Education Code to maintain a balanced budget each year, where the sum of expenditures plus the ending fund balance cannot exceed revenues plus the carry-over fund balance from the previous year. The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges imposes a uniform budgeting format for all California community college districts. Under current law, the District Board of Trustees approves a tentative budget by July 1 and an adopted budget by September 15 of each fiscal year. The presentation of the District’s audits as summarized in the previous section is used only for this District’s external audit. The District manages its funds in a different format, including with respect to its budgets and unaudited actuals. The following table shows the District’s adopted general fund budget for fiscal year 2021-22.

![General Fund Reserves](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=General+Fund+Reserves)

**General Fund Reserves**

The California Community College Chancellor’s Office recommends a prudent general fund unrestricted reserve of at least five percent of expenditures. Districts falling below the five percent may be subject to fiscal monitoring by the Chancellor’s Office. In addition, the District Board Policies require that the District maintain a five percent uncommitted contingency reserve.

**District Retirement Systems**

Qualified employees of the District are covered under multiple-employer defined benefit pension plans maintained by agencies of the State. Certificated employees are members of the State Teachers’ Retirement System (“STRS”) and classified employees are members of the Public Employees’ Retirement System (“PERS”). Both STRS and PERS are operated on a Statewide basis. The information set forth below regarding the STRS and PERS programs, other than the information provided by the District regarding its annual contributions thereto, has been obtained from publicly available sources which are believed to be reliable but are not guaranteed as to accuracy or completeness, and should not be construed as a representation by either the District or the Underwriter.

**Implementation of GASB Nos. 68 and 71.** Commencing with fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, the District implemented the provisions of GASB Statement Nos. 68 and 71 which require certain new pension disclosures in the notes to its audited financial statements commencing with the audit for fiscal year 2014-15. Statement No. 68 generally requires the District to recognize its proportionate share of the unfunded pension obligation for STRS and PERS by recognizing a net pension liability measured as of a date (the measurement date) no earlier than the end of its prior fiscal year.

**STRS.** All full-time certificated employees participate in STRS, a cost-sharing, multiple-employer contributory public employee retirement system. STRS provides retirement, disability and survivor benefits to plan members and beneficiaries under a defined benefit program. Benefit provisions and contribution amounts are established by State statutes, as legislatively amended. The program is funded through a combination of investment earnings and statutorily set contributions from three sources: employees, employers and the State. The District’s employer contributions to STRS for recent fiscal years are set forth in the following table.

Prior to fiscal year 2014-15, employee, employer and State contribution rates did not vary annually to account for funding shortfalls or surpluses in the STRS plan. School districts were required to contribute by statute 8.25% of eligible salary expenditures and participants contributed 8% of their respective salaries. However, in September 2013, STRS projected that the STRS Defined Benefit Program would be depleted in 31 years assuming contribution rates at that time continued and other actuarial assumptions were realized. This shortfall resulted from the combination of insufficient investment returns and the State’s adoption of its fiscal year 2014-15 Budget, the Governor signed into law Assembly Bill 1469 (“AB 1469”). AB 1469 seeks to fully fund the unfunded actuarial obligation with respect to service credited to members of the STRS Defined Benefit Program before July 1, 2014 (the “2014 Liability”) within 32 years by increasing member, K-14 school district and State contributions to STRS. Under AB 1469, K-14 school districts’ contribution rates increased from fiscal years 2014-15 through 2020-21 as shown in the following table, along with projections for the employer rates for fiscal years 2021-22 through 2023-24.

The STRS unfunded liability, on a market value of assets basis, was approximately $105.875 billion as of June 30, 2020.

**PERS.** All full-time and some part-time classified employees participate in PERS, an agent multiple-employer contributory public employee retirement system that acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating public entities within the State. PERS provides retirement, disability, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. The District is part of a cost-sharing pool within PERS known as the "Schools Pool." Benefit provisions are established by State statutes, as legislatively amended. Contributions to PERS are made by employers and employees. Each fiscal year, the District is required to contribute an amount based on an actuarially determined employer rate. The District's employer contributions to PERS for recent fiscal years are set forth in the following table.

The PERS program has experienced an unfunded liability in recent years. The PERS unfunded liability, on a market value of assets basis, was approximately $32.7 billion as of June 30, 2020 (the date of the last actuarial valuation). To address this issue, the PERS board has taken a number of actions. In April 2013, for example, the PERS board approved changes to the PERS amortization and smoothing policy intended to reduce volatility in employer contribution rates. In addition, in April 2014, PERS set new contribution rates, reflecting new demographic assumptions and other changes in actuarial assumptions. In November 2015, PERS adopted a risk mitigation policy intended to incrementally lower the discount rate (the assumed rate of investment return) in years of good investment returns, help pay down the pension fund's unfunded liability, and provide greater predictability and less volatility in contribution rates for employers. In December 2016, PERS voted to lower its discount rate from the current 7.5% to 7.0% over three years according to the following schedule.

## PERS DISCOUNT RATE
### Fiscal Years 2018-19 through 2020-21

| Fiscal Year | Amount   |
|-------------|----------|
| 2018-19     | 7.375%   |
| 2019-20     | 7.250%   |
| 2020-21     | 7.000%   |

Source: PERS.

The new rates and underlying assumptions, which are aimed at eliminating the unfunded liability of PERS in approximately 30 years, was implemented for school districts beginning in fiscal year 2016-17, with the costs spread over 20 years and the increases phased in over the first five years. The discount rate was automatically lowered in July 2021 from 7.0% to 6.8% due to the investment return for fiscal year 2020-21. On November 15, 2021, the PERS Board voted to keep the discount rate at 6.8%.

## California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013

On September 12, 2012, the Governor signed into law the California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (“PEPRA”), which impacted various aspects of public retirement systems in the State, including the STRS and PERS programs. In general, PEPRA (i) increased the retirement age for public employees depending on job function, (ii) capped the annual pension benefit payouts for public employees hired after January 1, 2013, (iii) required public employees hired after January 1, 2013 to pay at least 50% of the costs of their pension benefits (as described in more detail below), (iv) required final compensation for public employees hired after January 1, 2013 to be determined based on the highest average annual pensionable compensation earned over a period of at least 36 consecutive months, and (v) attempted to address other perceived abuses in the public retirement systems in the State. PEPRA applies to all public employee retirement systems in the State, except the retirement systems of the University of California, and charter cities and charter counties whose pension plans are not governed by State law. PEPRA’s provisions went into effect on January 1, 2013 with respect to new State, school, and city and local agency employees hired on or after that date; existing employees who are members of employee associations, including employee associations of the District, have a five-year window to negotiate compliance with PEPRA through collective bargaining.

PERS has predicted that the impact of PEPRA on employees and employers, including the District and other employers in the PERS system, will vary, based on each employer’s current level of benefits. As a result of the implementation of PEPRA, new members must pay at least 50% of the normal costs of the plan, which can fluctuate from year to year. To the extent that the new formulas lower retirement benefits, employer contribution rates could decrease over time as current employees retire and employees subject to the new formulas make up a larger percentage of the workforce. This change would, in some circumstances, result in a lower retirement benefit for employees than they currently earn.

With respect to the STRS pension program, employees hired after January 1, 2013 will pay the greater of either (1) fifty percent of the normal cost of their retirement plan, rounded to the nearest one-quarter percent, or (2) the contribution rate paid by then-current members (i.e., employees in the STRS plan as of January 1, 2013). The member contribution rate could be increased from this level through collective bargaining or may be adjusted based on other factors. Employers will pay at least the normal cost rate, after subtracting the member’s contribution.

and may be amended by the Board and by contractual agreement with employee groups. The District's OPEB Plan members are not required to contribute to the OPEB Plan. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the District contributed $3,888,649 to the OPEB Trust of which $3,526,109, was used for current benefit payments.

**Actuarial Assumptions.** The District's total OPEB asset 239 was measured as of June 1, 2019 and was determined by an actuarial valuation using the following actuarial assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement, unless otherwise specified: discount rate 5.00%, general inflation 2.75%, salary increases 3.25% (since benefits do not depend on salary, this is used only to allocate the costs of benefits between service years), long -term return on assets 5.00% (net of OPEB Plan investment expense; includes inflation), and healthcare cost trend rates 5.00% to 7.00% (Assumed to start at 7.00% and grade down to 5.00% for years 2024 and thereafter). Mortality for certified and classified employees were based on a PERS 2017 Study and a STRS 2016 Study. The MacLeod Watts Scale 2018 is applied generationally for mortality improvement, from 2015 for PERS members and from 2016 for STRS members.

**Rate of Return.** The long-term expected rate of return on the OPEB Plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of the OPEB Plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighing the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and added expected inflation. Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the target asset allocation as of June 30, 2021 are summarized in the following table:

**Long-Term Rate of Return of OPEB Trust**

| Asset Class   | Long Term Expected real rate of return |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| Equities      | 9.24%                                  |
| Fixed Income  | 2.88%                                  |

*Source: Los Rios Community College District 2020-21 Audited Financial Statement.*

**Discount Rate.** The discount rate used to measure the total OPEB liability was 5.00%. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that the District continues to make regular, sufficient contributions to the OPEB Trust in order to prefund the total OPEB liability. Based on those assumptions, the OPEB Plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current OPEB Plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on OPEB Plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total OPEB liability.

**Changes in Net OPEB Asset of the District.** The changes in net OPEB asset of the District as of June 30, 2021, are shown in the following table:

**Sensitivity of the net OPEB asset to changes in the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rates.** The net OPEB asset is based on the actuary report that relies on estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Particularly, changes in the discount and healthcare cost rates used can have significant impacts on the resulting actuarially determined net OPEB asset. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.

For more information regarding the District’s OPEB and assumptions used in its most recent actuarial study, see Note 9 of Appendix B to the Official Statement.

*Certain maturities to be refunded with the proceeds of the Bonds described in this Official Statement.*

## State Lease Revenue Bonds

The State Public Works Board (the "Public Works Board") has issued lease revenue bonds for the purpose of funding certain facilities, including facilities of the District. These bonds are special obligations of the Public Works Board payable from State general fund revenues appropriated to the Board of Governors of the California community colleges, which makes provision in the annual budget of the State for the servicing of such bonds. In the event that the State could not pay the semi-annual installment payment due with respect to such bonds, the District would be responsible for the payments attributable to the District facilities financed with these proceeds. The Public Works Board leases the facilities to the District, and at maturity, title will vest in the District. The following facility that was constructed under the provisions described above and have minimum annual payments remaining at June 30, 2021 are as follows:

| Facility                              | Lease Term | Proceeds from State | Funding Year | Minimum Annual Payments |
|---------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Folsom Lake College Instructional Facilities IB | 2005-2030  | $36,841,000         | 2001-02      | $809,709 to $2,499,000  |

**STATE FUNDING OF EDUCATION AND RECENT STATE BUDGETS**

**General.** The State requires that from all State revenues there first shall be set apart the moneys to be applied for support of the public school system and public institutions of higher education. Public school districts in California are dependent on revenues from the State for a large portion of their operating budgets. California school districts receive an average of about 55% of their operating revenues from various State sources. The primary source of funding for school districts are revenues under the LCFF, which are a combination of State funds and local property taxes (see “DISTRICT FINANCIAL INFORMATION - Education Funding Generally” above). State funds typically make up the majority of a district’s LCFF allocation, although Basic Aid school districts derive most of their revenues from local property taxes. School districts also receive substantial funding from the State for various categorical programs.

The availability of State funds for public education is a function of constitutional provisions affecting school district revenues and expenditures (see “CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS” below), the condition of the State economy (which affects total revenue available to the State general fund), and the annual State budget process. Decreases in State revenues may significantly affect appropriations made by the legislature to school districts.

As described below in the summaries of State budgeting documents, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a material impact on State revenues and appropriations.

The following information concerning the State’s budgets for the current and most recent preceding years has been compiled from publicly-available information provided by the State. Neither the District, the Underwriters or the County is responsible for the information relating to the State’s budgets provided in this section. Further information is available from the Public Finance Division of the State Treasurer's Office.

**The Budget Process.** The State’s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. The annual budget is proposed by the Governor by January 10 of each year for the next fiscal year (the “Governor’s Budget”). Under State law, the annual proposed Governor’s Budget cannot provide for projected expenditures in excess of projected revenues and balances available from prior fiscal years. Following the submission of the Governor’s Budget, the Legislature takes up the proposal.

A-20
<!-- Page 60 -->
Under the State Constitution, money may be drawn from the State Treasury only through an appropriation made by law. The primary source of the annual expenditure authorizations is the Budget Act as approved by the Legislature and signed by the Governor. The Budget Act must be approved by a majority vote of each house of the Legislature. The Governor may reduce or eliminate specific line items in the Budget Act or any other appropriations bill without vetoing the entire bill. Such individual line-item vetoes are subject to override by a two-thirds majority vote of each house of the Legislature.

Appropriations also may be included in legislation other than the Budget Act. Bills containing appropriations (including for K-14 education) must be approved by a majority vote in each house of the Legislature, unless such appropriations require tax increases, in which case they must be approved by a two-thirds vote of each house of the Legislature and be signed by the Governor. Continuing appropriations, available without regard to fiscal year, may also be provided by statute or the State Constitution.

Funds necessary to meet an appropriation need not be in the State Treasury at the time such appropriation is enacted; revenues may be appropriated in anticipation of their receipt.

### Recent State Budgets

Certain information about the State budgeting process and the State budget (the “State Budget”) is available through several State of California sources. A convenient source of information is the State’s website, where recent official statements for State bonds are posted.

### Prior Years’ Budgeting Techniques

Declining revenues and fiscal difficulties which arose in the State commencing in fiscal year 2008-09 led the State to undertake a number of budgeting strategies, which had subsequent impacts on local agencies within the State. These techniques included the issuance of IOUs in lieu of warrants (checks), the enactment of statutes deferring amounts owed to public schools until a later date in the fiscal year or even into the following fiscal year (known as statutory deferrals), trigger reductions, which were budget cutting measures which were implemented or could have been implemented if certain State budgeting goals were not met, and the dissolution of local redevelopment agencies in part to make available

**2013-14 State Budget: Significant Change in Education Funding.** As described previously herein, the 2013-14 State Budget and its related implementing legislation enacted significant reforms to the State’s system of K-12 education finance with the enactment of the LCFF. Significant reforms such as the LCFF and other changes in law may have significant impacts on the District's finances.

**The 2021-22 State Budget**

On June 14, 2021 the State Legislature adopted the 2021-22 State Budget Act bill (the “2021-22 State Budget Act”), and on June 28, 2021 adopted certain changes and associated trailer bills. On July 12, 2021, the Governor signed the 2021-22 State Budget Act (as enacted, the “2021-22 State Budget”), a historic $262.6 billion spending plan fueled by a $76 billion state surplus and $27 billion in aid from the federal government. The following is drawn from the Department of Finance (“DOF”) summary of the 2021-22 State Budget.

The 2021-22 State Budget indicates that revenues are up significantly from the forecast included in the Governor's proposed State budget for fiscal year 2021-22, resulting in a large budgetary surplus. This is a result of strong cash trends, two major federal relief bills since the beginning of 2021, continued stock market appreciation, and a significantly upgraded economic forecast from the prior fiscal year. The 2021-22 State Budget also reports that the State has received approximately $25 billion in federal COVID-19 stimulus funding for State programs. Although the 2021-22 State Budget acknowledges that building reserves and paying down debts are critical, the 2021-22 State Budget allocates approximately 86% of discretionary funds to one-time spending. The multi-year forecast reflects a budget roughly in balance, although the 2021-22 State Budget assumes that risks remain to the economic forecast, including a stock market decline that could reduce State revenues.

For fiscal year 2020-21, the 2021-22 State Budget projects total general fund revenues and transfers of $188.8 billion and authorizes expenditures of $166.1 billion. The State is projected to end the 2020-21 fiscal year with total available reserves of $39.8 billion, including $25.1 billion in the traditional general fund reserve, $12.3 billion in the State’s Budget Stabilization Account (“BSA”), $1.9 billion in the Public School System Stabilization Account (“PSSSA”) and $450 million in the Safety Net Reserve Fund. For fiscal year 2021-22, the 2021-22 State Budget projects total general fund revenues and transfers of $175.3 billion and authorizes expenditures of $196.4 billion. The State is projected to end the 2021-22 fiscal year with total available reserves of $25.2 billion, including $4 billion in the traditional general fund reserve, $15.8 billion in the BSA, $4.5 billion in the PSSSA and $900 million in the Safety Net Reserve Fund. The balance in the PSSSA in fiscal year 2021-22 is projected to trigger school district reserve caps under Education Code Section 42127.01 beginning in fiscal year 2022-23.

The 2021-22 State Budget sets the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee for fiscal year 2021-22 at $93.7 billion. This results in per-pupil funding of $13,976 from Proposition 98 funding, growing to $21,555 when accounting for all funding sources. The Proposed 2021-22 State Budget also makes retroactive increases to the minimum funding guarantee in fiscal years 2019-20 and 2020-21, setting them at $79.3 billion and $93.4 billion, respectively. Collectively, this represents a three-year increase in the minimum funding guarantee of $47 billion from the level projected by the 2020-21 State budget.

Other significant features relating to K-12 school district funding include the following:

- **Local Control Funding Formula** – The 2021-22 State Budget funds a compounded COLA of 4.05%, representing an adjustment of 2.31% allocable to fiscal year 2020-21 and a fiscal year 2021-22 adjustment of 1.7%. Additionally, to assist local educational agencies address ongoing fiscal pressures, the 2021-22 State Budget also includes $520 million in Proposition 98 funding to provide a 1% increase in LCFF base funding. This discretionary increase, when combined with the compounded COLA, results in a 5.07% growth in LCFF funding over 2020-21 levels. In addition, to increase the number of adults providing direct services to students on school campuses, the 2021-22 State Budget includes an ongoing increase to the LCFF Concentration Grant of $1.1 billion, an increase from 50% to 65%. See “DISTRICT FINANCIAL INFORMATION - Education Funding Generally” herein. Local educational agencies that are recipients of these funds will be required to demonstrate in their LCAPs how these funds are used to increase the number of certificated and classified staff on their campuses, including school counselors, nurses, teachers, paraprofessionals, custodial staff, and other student support providers.

- **Deferrals** – The State budget for fiscal year 2020-21 deferred approximately $1.9 billion in K-12 apportionments in fiscal year 2019-20, growing to more than $11 billion in fiscal year 2020-21. The 2021-22 State Budget eliminates in its entirety all K-12 deferrals in fiscal year 2021-22.

- **Universal Transitional Kindergarten** – The 2021-22 State Budget includes a series of provisions intended to incrementally establish a universal transitional kindergarten for four-year-old children. Full implementation is expected by fiscal year 2025-26. Local educational agencies will be able to use fiscal year 2021-22 for planning and infrastructure development. The 2021-22 State Budget indicates that the costs to the State general fund of the plan are projected to be approximately $600 million in fiscal year 2022-23, growing to approximately $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2025-26. The 2021-22 State Budget includes $200 million in one-time Proposition 98 funding for planning and implementation grants for all local educational agencies, and $100 million in one-time Proposition 98 funding to train and increase the number of early childhood educators. To build on and enhance the quality of the existing transitional kindergarten program, the 2021-22 State Budget also proposes new ongoing Proposition 98 funding beginning in fiscal year 2022-23 to provide one additional certificated or classified staff person in each transitional kindergarten classroom, reducing adult-to-child ratios from 1:24 to 1:12.

- **Student Supports** – $3 billion, available over several years, to expand and strengthen the implementation and use of community school models in communities with high levels of poverty. Community schools typically integrate health, mental health and other services for students and families and provide these services directly on school campuses. In addition, the 2021-22 State Budget provides $547.5 million in one-time Proposition 98 funding to assist high school students, particularly those that are eligible for free and/or reduced priced meals, English learners or foster youth, to graduate having completed certain classes required for admission to the California State University and University of California systems.

A-23
<!-- Page 63 -->
- **County Offices of Education.** In recognition of the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth in foster care, the 2021-22 State Budget provides $30 million in one-time Proposition 98 funding to county offices of education to work with local partners to coordinate and provide direct services to these students.

- **Expanded Learning Time** – $1.8 billion of Proposition 98 funding as part of a multi-year plan to implement expanded-day, full-year instruction and enrichment for all elementary school students, with a focus on local educational agencies with the highest concentrations of low-income students, English language learners, and youth in foster care. Pursuant to this plan, all local educational agencies will receive funding for expanded learning opportunities based on their number of low-income students, English language learners, and youth in foster care, with local educational agencies with the highest concentrations of these students receiving a higher funding rate. All local educational agencies will be required to offer expanded learning opportunities to the students generating the funding, with the local educational agencies receiving the higher funding rate required to offer expanded learning opportunities to all students. Students will have access to no-cost after school and summer programs, which when combined with regular instructional time, is expected to provide these students with the opportunity for nine hours of developmentally appropriate academics and enrichment activities per instructional day and for six weeks each summer. Additionally, these programs will be required to maintain adult-to-student ratios of no less than 1:10 for transitional kindergarten and kindergarten students and 1:20 for students in first through sixth grades.

- **Educator Preparation, Retention and Training** – $2.9 billion to support a variety of initiatives intended to further expand the state’s educator preparation and training infrastructure, including meeting the needs of early childhood educators.

- **Nutrition** – $54 million in additional Proposition 98 funding to reimburse all meals served to students, including those who would not normally qualify for reimbursement under the State’s existing meal program. Beginning in fiscal year 2022-23, all public schools will be required to provide two free meals per day to any student who requests one, regardless of income eligibility. Further, all schools eligible for the federal universal meals provision program will be required to apply for it, and the State will cover any remaining unreimbursed costs up to the federal per-meal rate, at an estimated annual cost of $650 million in Proposition 98 funding. Additionally, the 2021-22 State Budget provides $150 million in one-time Proposition 98 funding for school districts to upgrade kitchen infrastructure and equipment, and to provide training to food service employees.

- **Remote Learning** – The 2021-22 State Budget requires that all districts return to full-time in-person instruction for the 2021-22 school year. Consistent with all school years prior to fiscal year 2020-21, this mode of instruction will be the default for all students, and generally one of only two ways in which local educational agencies can earn State apportionment funding in fiscal year 2021-22. However, to give families a high-quality option for non-classroom based instruction, and to provide local educational agencies with an option to generate state funding by serving students outside the classroom in response to parent requests, the Budget requires school districts and county offices of education to provide students with an independent study option and includes a series of improvements to the state’s existing independent study programs.

A-24
<!-- Page 64 -->
- **Special Education** – $1.7 billion to invest in and improve instruction and services for students with disabilities to provide, among other things, learning recovery support, an increase in the State-wide base funding rate for special education funding, a 4.05% COLA to State special education funding, and early intervention services for preschool-aged children.

- **Career Technical Education (“CTE”)** – An increase of $150 million in ongoing Proposition 98 funding to augment opportunities for local educational agencies to participate in the CTE Incentive Grant Program. The 2021-22 State Budget also provides an increase of $86.4 million in one-time Proposition 98 funding for CTE regional occupational centers or programs operated by joint powers authorities to address costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

### The 2022-23 Proposed State Budget

On January 10, 2022, the Governor outlined his proposed budget for fiscal year 2022-23 to the State legislature (the “2022-23 Proposed State Budget”). The State has a projected surplus of $45.7 billion, which includes $20.6 billion in General Fund for discretionary purposes, $16.1 billion in additional Proposition 98 for K-14 education, and $9 billion in reserve deposits and supplemental pension payments. The 2022-23 Proposed State Budget allocates 86% of the discretionary surplus to one-time investments, and is projected to be structurally balanced in fiscal year 2025-26, the last year in the multi-year forecast.

The 2022-23 Proposed State Budget reflects $34.6 billion in budgetary reserves. The Rainy Day Fund is now at the constitutional maximum (10% of General Fund revenues) requiring $2.4 billion to be dedicated for infrastructure investments in 2022-23. The 2022-23 Proposed State Budget accelerates the paydown of State retirement liabilities as required by Proposition 2, with $3.9 billion in additional payments in 2022-23 and nearly $8.4 billion projected to be paid over the next three years. In addition, the 2022-23 Proposed State Budget projects the State Appropriations Limit or "Gann Limit" will likely be exceeded in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 fiscal years, and as such any funds above this limit are constitutionally required to be allocated evenly between schools and a tax refund. An updated calculation of this limit, and proposals to address it, will be included in the May Revision.

### Highlights of the 2022-23 Proposed State Budget are:

- To address COVID-19, a request for early action to allocate an additional $1.4 billion for the remainder of the 2021-22 fiscal year, and reflects $1.3 billion for 2022-23 to continue COVID-19 efforts in the 2022-23 fiscal year.

- To permanently expand the State's ability to protect public health and address social determinants of health, includes $300 million General Fund for the Department of Public Health and local health jurisdictions and also includes major ongoing investments to modernize public health data systems that have been critical during the COVID-19 pandemic.

- $2 billion General Fund over two years to provide incentives for long-duration-storage projects, renewable hydrogen, and industrial decarbonization, including in the food processing sector.

- $1.5 billion over two years to accelerate the development of affordable housing.

- $30 million to create the Office of Health Care Affordability, charged with increasing the transparency of pricing, developing specific cost targets for different sectors of the health care industry, and imposing financial consequences for entities failing to meet these targets.

- $2 billion General Fund over two years to continue the State’s efforts to address homelessness by investing in behavioral health housing and encampment cleanup grants.

- $285 million General Fund over three years for grants to bolster local law enforcement response to organized retail theft crime, as well as to assist local prosecutors in holding perpetrators accountable and $18 million General Fund over three years for the Attorney General to prosecute organized retail theft crimes.

- $5 million ongoing General Fund for the Attorney General to continue leading anti-crime task forces throughout the State.

The next step in the 2022-23 State budget process is the Governor’s May Revise, which updates the Governor’s economic and revenue outlook and revises, supplements or withdraws initiatives included in the proposed budget.

**Disclaimer Regarding State Budgets**

The execution of State budgets, including proposed budgets, may be affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to: (i) shifts in costs from the federal government to the State, (ii) national, State and international economic conditions, (iii) litigation risks associated with proposed spending reductions, (iv) rising health care costs and/or other unfunded liabilities, such as pension or OPEB, and (v) numerous other factors, all or any of which could cause the revenue and spending projections included in such budgets to be unattainable. The District cannot predict the impact that the 2020-21 State Budget or subsequent State Budgets, will have on its own finances and operations. However, the Bonds are secured by ad valorem property taxes levied and collected on taxable property in the District, without limit as to rate or amount, and are not secured by a pledge of revenues of the District or its general fund.

The State has not entered into any contractual commitments with the District, the County, the Underwriter or the Owners of the Bonds to provide State Budget information to the District or the owners of the Bonds. Although they believe the sources of information listed below are

**Availability of State Budgets**

The complete adopted State budgets and related information are available from the California Department of Finance website at www.ebudget.ca.gov. Impartial analyses of these documents are published by the LAO and can be accessed at www.lao.ca.gov/budget. The District can take no responsibility for the continued accuracy of internet addresses referenced herein or for the accuracy, completeness or timeliness of information posted on these sites, and such information is not incorporated in this Official Statement by these references. The information referred to above should not be relied upon when making an investment decision with respect to the Bonds.

**Uncertainty Regarding Future State Budgets**

The District cannot predict what actions will be taken in future years by the State legislature or the Governor to address the State’s current or future revenues and expenditures or possible future budget deficits. Future State Budgets will be affected by national and State economic conditions and other factors over which the District has no control. The District cannot predict what impact any future budget proposals will have on the financial condition of the District. To the extent that the State Budget process results in reduced revenues to the District, the District will be required to make adjustments to its own budgets.

**Legal Challenges to State Funding of Education**

The application of Proposition 98 and other statutory regulations has been the subject of various legal challenges in the past. The District cannot predict if or when there will be changes to education funding or legal challenges which may arise relating thereto.

# CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS

Principal and interest on the Bonds are payable from the proceeds of an ad valorem property tax levied by the County for the payment thereof. Articles XIII A, XIII B, XIII C, and XIII D of the State Constitution, Propositions 62, 98, 111 and 218, and certain other provisions of law discussed below, are included in this section to describe the potential effect of these Constitutional and statutory measures on the ability of the District to levy taxes and spend tax proceeds for operating and other purposes, and it should not be inferred from the inclusion of such materials that these laws impose any limitation on the ability of the District to levy taxes for payment of the Bonds. The tax levied by the County for payment of the Bonds was approved by the District's voters in compliance with Article XIII A and all applicable laws.

## Constitutionally Required Funding of Education

The State Constitution requires that from all State revenues, there shall be first set apart the moneys to be applied by the State for the support of the public school system and public institutions of higher education. School districts receive a significant portion of their funding from State appropriations. As a result, decreases and increases in State revenues can significantly affect appropriations made by the State Legislature to school districts.

## Article XIII A of the California Constitution

### Basic Property Tax Levy

On June 6, 1978, California voters approved Proposition 13 (“Proposition 13”), which added Article XIII A to the State Constitution (“Article XIII A”). Article XIII A limits the amount of any ad valorem property tax on real property to 1% of the full cash value thereof, except that additional ad valorem property taxes may be levied to pay off debt service on (i) indebtedness approved by the voters prior to July 1, 1978, (ii) (as a result of an amendment to Article XIII A approved by State voters on June 3, 1986) on bonded indebtedness for the acquisition or improvement of real property which has been approved on or after July 1, 1978 by two-thirds of the voters on such indebtedness, and (iii) (as a result of an amendment to Article XIII A approved by State voters on November 7, 2000) bonded indebtedness incurred by a school district or community college district for the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation or replacement of school facilities or the acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities, approved by 55% of the voters of the district, but only if certain accountability measures are included in the proposition. The tax for the payment of the Bonds falls within the exception described in (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence. Article XIII A defines full cash value to mean “the county assessor’s valuation of real property as shown on the 1975-76 tax bill under full cash value, or thereafter, the appraised value of real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership have occurred after the 1975 assessment”. This full cash value may be increased at a rate not to exceed 2% per year to account for inflation.

Article XIII A has subsequently been amended to permit reduction of the “full cash value” base in the event of declining property values caused by damage, destruction or other factors, to provide that there would be no increase in the “full cash value” base in the event of reconstruction of property damaged or destroyed in a disaster and in other minor or technical ways.

Both the United States Supreme Court and the California State Supreme Court have upheld the general validity of Article XIII A.

A-29
<!-- Page 69 -->
![Legislation Implementing Article XIII A](https://example.com/image.png)

**Legislation Implementing Article XIII A.** Legislation has been enacted and amended a number of times since 1978 to implement Article XIII A. Under current law, local agencies are no longer permitted to levy directly any property tax (except to pay voter-approved indebtedness). The 1% property tax is automatically levied by the county and distributed according to a formula among taxing agencies. The formula apportions the tax roughly in proportion to the relative shares of taxes levied prior to 1979.

Increases of assessed valuation resulting from reappraisals of property due to new construction, change in ownership or from the annual adjustment not to exceed 2% are allocated among the various jurisdictions in the “taxing area” based upon their respective “situs.” Any such allocation made to a local agency continues as part of its allocation in future years.

**Inflationary Adjustment of Assessed Valuation.** As described above, the assessed value of a property may be increased at a rate not to exceed 2% per year to account for inflation. On December 27, 2001, the Orange County Superior Court, in County of Orange v. Orange County Assessment Appeals Board No. 3, held that where a home’s taxable value did not increase for two years, due to a flat real estate market, the Orange County assessor violated the 2% inflation adjustment provision of Article XIII A, when the assessor tried to “recapture” the tax value of the property by increasing its assessed value by 4% in a single year. The assessors in most California counties, including the Counties, use a similar methodology in raising the taxable values of property beyond 2% in a single year. The SBE has approved this methodology for increasing assessed values. On appeal, the Appellate Court held that the trial court erred in ruling that assessments are always limited to no more than 2% of the previous year’s assessment. On May 10, 2004 a petition for review was filed with the California Supreme Court. The petition has been denied by the California Supreme Court. As a result of this ruling, the “recapture” provision described above may continue to be employed in determining the full cash value of property for property tax purposes.

**Split Roll Property Tax Ballot Measure.** On October 15, 2018, a proposed ballot initiative became eligible for the November 2020 Statewide ballot (the “2020 Ballot Measure”). If approved by a majority of voters casting a ballot at the November 2020 Statewide election, the 2020 Ballot Measure would amend Article XIII A such that the “full cash value” of commercial and industrial property that is not zoned for commercial agricultural production, for each lien date, would be equal to the fair market value of that property. If passed, the 2020 Ballot Measure would not affect the “full cash value” of residential property or real property used for commercial agricultural production, which would continue to be subject to annual increases not to exceed 2%. After compensating the State General Fund for resulting reductions in State personal income tax and corporate tax revenues, and compensating cities, counties and special districts for the cost of implementing the 2020 Ballot Measure, approximately 40% of the remaining additional tax revenues generated as a result of the 2020 Ballot Measure would be deposited into a fund created pursuant to the 2020 Ballot Measure called the Local School and Community College Property Tax Fund, with such funds being used to supplement, and not replace, existing funding that school districts and community college districts receive under the State’s constitutional minimum funding requirement. The District cannot predict whether the 2020 Ballot Measure will appear on the Statewide ballot at the November 2020 election or, if it does, whether the 2020 Ballot Measure will be approved by a majority of voters casting a ballot. If approved, the District cannot make any assurance as to what effect the implementation of the 2020 Ballot Measure will have on District revenues or the assessed valuation of real property in the District.

# Article XIIIIB of the California Constitution

Article XIII B (“Article XIII B”) of the State Constitution, as subsequently amended by Propositions 98 and 111, respectively, limits the annual appropriations of the State and of any city, county, school district, authority or other political subdivision of the State to the level of appropriations of the particular governmental entity for the prior fiscal year, as adjusted for changes in the cost of living and in population and for transfers in the financial responsibility for providing services and for certain declared emergencies. For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 1990, the appropriations limit of each entity of government shall be the appropriations limit for the 1986-87 fiscal year adjusted for the changes made from that fiscal year under the provisions of Article XIII B, as amended.

The appropriations of an entity of local government subject to Article XIII B limitations include the proceeds of taxes levied by or for that entity and the proceeds of certain state subventions to that entity. “Proceeds of taxes” include, but are not limited to, all tax revenues and the proceeds to the entity from (a) regulatory licenses, user charges and user fees (but only to the extent that these proceeds exceed the reasonable costs in providing the regulation, product or service), and (b) the investment of tax revenues.

Appropriations subject to limitation do not include (a) refunds of taxes, (b) appropriations for debt service, (c) appropriations required to comply with certain mandates of the courts or the federal government, (d) appropriations of certain special districts, (e) appropriations for all qualified capital outlay projects as defined by the legislature, (f) appropriations derived from certain fuel and vehicle taxes and (g) appropriations derived from certain taxes on tobacco products.

Article XIII B includes a requirement that all revenues received by an entity of government other than the State in a fiscal year and in the fiscal year immediately following it in excess of the amount permitted to be appropriated during that fiscal year and the fiscal year immediately following it shall be returned by a revision of tax rates or fee schedules within the next two subsequent fiscal years. However, in the event that a school district’s revenues exceed its spending limit, the district may in any fiscal year increase its appropriations limit to equal its spending by borrowing appropriations limit from the State.

Article XIII B also includes a requirement that 50% of all revenues received by the State in a fiscal year and in the fiscal year immediately following it in excess of the amount permitted to be appropriated during that fiscal year and the fiscal year immediately following it shall be transferred and allocated to the State School Fund under Section 8.5 of Article XVI of the State Constitution.

## Unitary Property

Some amount of property tax revenue of the District is derived from utility property which is considered part of a utility system with components located in many taxing jurisdictions (“unitary property”). Under the State Constitution, such property is assessed by the SBE as part of a “going concern” rather than as individual pieces of real or personal property. State-assessed unitary and certain other property is allocated to the counties by SBE, taxed at special countywide rates, and the tax revenues distributed to taxing jurisdictions (including the District) according to statutory formulae generally based on the distribution of taxes in the prior year.

# Articles XIIIC and XIIID of the California Constitution

On November 5, 1996, the voters of the State of California approved Proposition 218, popularly known as the “Right to Vote on Taxes Act.” Proposition 218 added to the California Constitution Articles XIIIC and XIIID (respectively, “Article XIIIC” and “Article XIIID”), which contain a number of provisions affecting the ability of local agencies, including school districts, to levy and collect both existing and future taxes, assessments, fees and charges.

According to the “Title and Summary” of Proposition 218 prepared by the California Attorney General, Proposition 218 limits “the authority of local governments to impose taxes and property-related assessments, fees and charges.” Among other things, Article XIIIC establishes that every tax is either a “general tax” (imposed for general governmental purposes) or a “special tax” (imposed for specific purposes), prohibits special purpose government agencies such as school districts from levying general taxes, and prohibits any local agency from imposing, extending or increasing any special tax beyond its maximum authorized rate without a two-thirds vote; and also provides that the initiative power will not be limited in matters of reducing or repealing local taxes, assessments, fees and charges. Article XIIIC further provides that no tax may be assessed on property other than ad valorem property taxes imposed in accordance with Articles XIII and XIIIA of the California Constitution and special taxes approved by a two-thirds vote under Article XIIIA, Section 4.

On November 2, 2010, Proposition 26 was approved by State voters, which amended Article XIIIC to expand the definition of “tax” to include “any levy, charge, or exaction of any kind imposed by a local government” except the following: (1) a charge imposed for a specific benefit conferred on the payor or privilege granted to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of conferring the benefit or granting the privilege; (2) a charge imposed for a specific government service or product provided directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of providing the service or product; (3) a charge imposed for the reasonable regulatory costs to a local government for issuing licenses and permits, performing investigations, inspections, and audits, enforcing agricultural marketing orders, and the administrative enforcement and adjudication thereof; (4) a charge imposed for entrance to or use of local government property, or the purchase, rental, or lease of local government property; (5) a fine, penalty, or other monetary charge imposed by the judicial branch of government or a local government, as a result of a violation of law; (6) a charge imposed as a condition of property development; and (7) assessments and property-related fees imposed in accordance with the provisions of Article XIIID. Proposition 26 provides that the local government bears the burden of proving by a

![Proposition 98 and Proposition 111](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Proposition+98+and+Proposition+111)

**Proposition 98**

On November 8, 1988, California voters approved Proposition 98, a combined initiative constitutional amendment and statute called the “Classroom Instructional Improvement and Accountability Act” (the “Accountability Act”). Certain provisions of the Accountability Act have, however, been modified by Proposition 111, discussed below, the provisions of which became effective on July 1, 1990. The Accountability Act changes State funding of public education below the university level and the operation of the State’s appropriations limit. The Accountability Act guarantees State funding for K-12 school districts and community college districts (hereinafter referred to collectively as “K-14 school districts”) at a level equal to the greater of (a) the same percentage of general fund revenues as the percentage appropriated to such districts in 1986-87, and (b) the amount actually appropriated to such districts from the general fund in the previous fiscal year, adjusted for increases in enrollment and changes in the cost of living. The Accountability Act permits the Legislature to suspend this formula for a one-year period.

The Accountability Act also changes how tax revenues in excess of the State appropriations limit are distributed. Any excess State tax revenues up to a specified amount would, instead of being returned to taxpayers, be transferred to K-14 school districts. Any such transfer to K-14 school districts would be excluded from the appropriations limit for K-14 districts and the K-14 school district appropriations limit for the next year would automatically be increased by the amount of such transfer. These additional moneys would then be the base funding calculation for K-14 school districts for subsequent years, creating further pressure on other portions of the State budget, particularly if revenues decline in a year following a transfer. The maximum amount of excess tax revenues which could be transferred to K-14 school districts is 4% of the minimum State spending for education mandated by the Accountability Act.

**Proposition 111**

On June 5, 1990, the voters approved Proposition 111 (Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 1) called the “Traffic Congestion Relief and Spending Limit Act of 1990” (“Proposition 111”) which further modified Article XIII B and Sections 8 and 8.5 of Article XVI of the State Constitution with respect to appropriations limitations and school funding priority and allocation.

The most significant provisions of Proposition 111 are summarized as follows:

**Annual Adjustments to Spending Limit.** The annual adjustments to the Article XIII B spending limit were liberalized to be more closely linked to the rate of economic growth. Instead of being tied to the Consumer Price Index, the “change in the cost of living” is now measured by the change in California per capita personal income. The definition of “change in population” specifies that a portion of the State’s spending limit is to be adjusted to reflect changes in school attendance.

**Treatment of Excess Tax Revenues.** “Excess” tax revenues with respect to Article XIII B are now determined based on a two-year cycle, so that the State can avoid having to return to taxpayers excess tax revenues in one year if its appropriations in the next fiscal year are under its limit. In addition, the Proposition 98 provision regarding excess tax revenues was modified. After any two-year period, if there are excess State tax revenues, 50% of the excess are to be transferred to K-14 school districts with the balance returned to taxpayers; under prior law, 100% of excess State tax revenues went to K-14 school districts, but only up to a maximum of 4% of
<!-- Page 73 -->

the school's minimum funding level. Also, reversing prior law, any excess State tax revenues transferred to K-14 school districts are not built into the school districts' base expenditures for calculating their entitlement for State aid in the next year, and the State's appropriations limit is not to be increased by this amount.

**Exclusions from Spending Limit.** Two exceptions were added to the calculation of appropriations which are subject to the Article XIIIB spending limit. First, there are excluded all appropriations for “qualified capital outlay projects” as defined by the Legislature. Second, there are excluded any increases in gasoline taxes above the 1990 level (then nine cents per gallon), sales and use taxes on such increment in gasoline taxes, and increases in receipts from vehicle weight fees above the levels in effect on January 1, 1990. These latter provisions were necessary to make effective the transportation funding package approved by the Legislature and the Governor, which expected to raise over $15 billion in additional taxes from 1990 through 2000 to fund transportation programs.

**Recalculation of Appropriations Limit.** The Article XIIIB appropriations limit for each unit of government, including the State, is to be recalculated beginning in fiscal year 1990-91. It is based on the actual limit for fiscal year 1986-87, adjusted forward to 1990-91 as if Proposition 111 had been in effect.

**School Funding Guarantee.** There is a complex adjustment in the formula enacted in Proposition 98 which guarantees K-14 school districts a certain amount of State general fund revenues. Under prior law, K-14 school districts were guaranteed the greater of (1) 40.9% of State general fund revenues (the “first test”) or (2) the amount appropriated in the prior year adjusted for changes in the cost of living (indicated in Article XIIIB by reference to per capita personal income) and enrollment (the “second test”). Under Proposition 111, schools will receive the greater of (1) the first test, (2) the second test, or (3) a third test, which will replace the second test in any year when growth in per capita State general fund revenues from the prior year is less than the annual growth in California per capita personal income (the “third test”). Under the third test, schools will receive the amount appropriated in the prior year adjusted for change in enrollment and per capita State general fund revenues, plus an additional small adjustment factor. If the third test is used in any year, the difference between the third test and the second test will become a “credit” to schools which will be paid in future years when State general fund revenue growth exceeds personal income growth.

**Proposition 39**  
On November 7, 2000, California voters approved an amendment (commonly known as “Proposition 39”) to the California Constitution. This amendment (1) allows school facilities bond measures to be approved by 55% (rather than two-thirds) of the voters in local elections and permits property taxes to exceed the current 1% limit in order to repay the bonds and (2) changes existing statutory law regarding charter school facilities. Constitutional amendments may be changed only with another statewide vote. The statutory provisions could be changed by a majority vote of both houses of the Legislature and approval by the Governor, but only for the purposes of the proposition. The local school jurisdictions affected by Proposition 39 are K-12 school districts including the District, community college districts, and county offices of education. As noted above, the California Constitution previously limited property taxes to 1% of the value of property. Prior to the approval of Proposition 39, property taxes could only exceed this limit to pay for (1) any local government debts approved by the voters prior to July 1, 1978 or (2) bonds to acquire or improve real property that receive two-thirds voter approval after July 1, 1978.

The 55% vote requirement authorized by Proposition 39 applies only if the local bond measure presented to the voters includes: (1) a requirement that the bond funds can be used only for construction, rehabilitation, equipping of school facilities, or the acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities; (2) a specific list of school projects to be funded and certification that the school board has evaluated safety, class size reduction, and information technology needs in developing the list; and (3) a requirement that the school board conduct annual, independent financial and performance audits until all bond funds have been spent to ensure that the bond funds have been used only for the projects listed in the measure. Legislation approved in June 2000 places certain limitations on local school bonds to be approved by 55% of the voters. These provisions require that the tax rate levied as the result of any single election be no more than $60 (for a unified school district), $30 (for an elementary school district or high school district), or $25 (for a community college district), per $100,000 of taxable property value. These requirements are not part of Proposition 39 and can be changed with a majority vote of both houses of the Legislature and approval by the Governor.

**Proposition 1A and Proposition 22**

On November 2, 2004, California voters approved Proposition 1A, which amended the State constitution to significantly reduce the State's authority over major local government revenue sources. Under Proposition 1A, the State cannot (i) reduce local sales tax rates or alter the method of allocating the revenue generated by such taxes, (ii) shift property taxes from local governments to schools or community colleges, (iii) change how property tax revenues are shared among local governments without two-thirds approval of both houses of the State Legislature or replacement funding. Under Proposition 1A, beginning in 2008-09, the State may shift to schools and community colleges a limited amount of local government property tax revenue if certain conditions are met, including: (i) a proclamation by the Governor that the shift is needed due to a severe financial hardship of the State, and (ii) approval of the shift by the State Legislature with a two-thirds vote of both houses. Under such a shift, the State must repay local governments for their property tax losses, with interest, within three years. Proposition 1A does allow the State to approve voluntary exchanges of local sales tax and property tax revenues among local governments within a county. Proposition 1A also amended the State Constitution to require the State to suspend certain state laws creating mandates in any year that the State does not fully reimburse local governments for their costs to comply with the mandates. This provision does not apply to mandates relating to schools or community colleges or to those mandates relating to employee rights.

Proposition 22, a constitutional initiative entitled the “Local Taxpayer, Public Safety, and Transportation Protection Act of 2010,” approved on November 2, 2010, superseded many of the provisions of Proposition 1A. This initiative amends the State constitution to prohibit the legislature from diverting or shifting revenues that are dedicated to funding services provided by local government or funds dedicated to transportation improvement projects and services. Under this proposition, the State is not allowed to take revenue derived from locally imposed taxes, such as hotel taxes, parcel taxes, utility taxes and sales taxes, and local public transit and transportation funds. Further, in the event that a local governmental agency sues the State alleging a violation of these provisions and wins, then the State must automatically appropriate the funds needed to pay that local government. This Proposition was intended to, among other things, stabilize local government revenue sources by restricting the State’s control over local property taxes. Proposition 22 did not prevent the California State Legislature from dissolving State.

**Proposition 30 and Proposition 55**

The Guaranteed Local Public Safety Funding, Initiative Constitutional Amendment (also known as “Proposition 30”), temporarily increased the State Sales and Use Tax and personal income tax rates on higher incomes. Proposition 30 temporarily imposed an additional tax on all retailers, at the rate of 0.25% of gross receipts from the sale of all tangible personal property sold in the State from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016. Proposition 30 also imposed an additional excise tax on the storage, use, or other consumption in the State of tangible personal property purchased from a retailer on and after January 1, 2013 and before January 1, 2017. This excise tax was levied at a rate of 0.25% of the sales price of the property so purchased. For personal income taxes imposed beginning in the taxable year commencing January 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2018, Proposition 30 increases the marginal personal income tax rate by: (i) 1% for taxable income over $250,000 but less than $300,000 for single filers (over $500,000 but less than $600,000 for joint filers), (ii) 2% for taxable income over $300,000 but less than $500,000 for single filers (over $600,000 but less than $1,000,000 for joint filers), and (iii) 3% for taxable income over $500,000 for single filers (over $1,000,000 for joint filers). Proposition 30 (described below) extended said increases to personal income rates through the end of 2030.

The revenues generated from the temporary tax increases will be included in the calculation of the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee for school districts and community college districts. See “Proposition 98” and “Proposition 111” above. From an accounting perspective, the revenues generated from the temporary tax increases will be deposited into the State account created pursuant to Proposition 30 called the Education Protection Account (the “EPA”). Pursuant to Proposition 30, funds in the EPA will be allocated quarterly, with 89% of such funds provided to schools districts and 11% provided to community college districts. The funds will be distributed to school districts and community college districts in the same manner as existing unrestricted per-student funding, except that no school district will receive less than $200 per unit of Average Daily Attendance (ADA) and no community college district will receive less than $100 per full time equivalent student. The governing board of each school district and community college district is granted sole authority to determine how the monies received from the EPA are spent, provided that, the appropriate governing board is required to make these spending determinations in open session at a public meeting and such local governing boards are prohibited from using any funds from the EPA for salaries or benefits of administrators or any other administrative costs.

The California Children’s Education and Health Care Protection Act of 2016, also known as Proposition 55, was a proposed constitutional amendment initiative that was approved on the November 8, 2016 general election ballot in California. Proposition 55 extends the increases to personal income tax rates for high-income taxpayers that were approved as part of Proposition 30 through 2030, instead of the scheduled expiration date of December 31, 2018. Tax revenue received under Proposition 55 is to be allocated 89% to K-12 schools and 11% to community colleges. Proposition 55 did not extend the sales tax increases of Proposition 30.

![California Senate Bill 222](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=California+Senate+Bill+222)

California Senate Bill 222  
Senate Bill 222 (“SB 222”) was signed by the California Governor on July 13, 2015 and became effective on January 1, 2016. SB 222 amended Section 15251 of the California Education Code and added Section 52515 to the California Government Code to provide that voter approved general obligation bonds which are secured by ad valorem property tax collections such as the Bonds are secured by a statutory lien on all revenues received pursuant to the levy and collection of the property tax imposed to service those bonds. Said lien shall attach automatically and is valid and binding from the time the bonds are executed and delivered. The lien is enforceable against the issuer, its successors, transferees, and creditors, and all others asserting rights therein, irrespective of whether those parties have notice of the lien and without the need for any further act. The effect of SB 222 is the treatment of general obligation bonds as secured debt in bankruptcy due to the existence of a statutory lien.

Proposition 19  
On November 3, 2020, State voters approved Proposition 19, a legislatively referred constitutional amendment (“Proposition 19”), which amends Article XIII A (i) expand as of April 1, 2021 special rules that govern the transfer of a residential property’s tax base value to a replacement residence for homeowners that are over the age of 55, severely disabled, or whose property has been impacted by wildfire or natural disaster, when they buy a different home anywhere within the State, (ii) narrows as of February 16, 2021 existing special rules for the valuation of inherited real property due to a transfer between family members, and (iii) allocates most resulting State revenues and savings (if any) to fire protection services and reimbursing local governments for tax-related changes. The District cannot predict whether the implementation of Proposition 19 will increase, decrease or have no overall impact on the District’s assessed values.

Future Initiatives  
Article XIII A, Article XIII B, Article XIII C and Article XIII D of the California Constitution and Propositions 98, 111, 22, 1A, 26, 30, 39 and 55 were each adopted as measures that qualified for the ballot under the State’s initiative process. From time to time other initiative measures could be adopted further affecting District revenues or the District’s ability to expend revenues. The nature and impact of these measures cannot be anticipated by the District.

The District's service area includes most of Sacramento County and portions of El Dorado, Yolo, Solano and Placer counties (each, a “County”; collectively, the “Counties”). The following information concerning the Counties is included only for the purpose of supplying general information regarding the area of the District. The Bonds are not a debt of the Counties, the State of California (the “State”) or any of its political subdivisions (other than the District), and neither the Counties, the State nor any of its political subdivisions (other than the District) is liable therefor.

The historical data and results presented in the tables that follow may differ materially from future results as a result of economic or other factors. For more information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, see “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Disclosure Relating to COVID-19” herein. See also references to COVID-19 in the section entitled “PROPERTY TAXATION”, and in APPENDIX A under the heading “DISTRICT GENERAL INFORMATION” and “STATE FUNDING OF EDUCATION; RECENT STATE BUDGETS.”

### Sacramento County
Sacramento County was incorporated in 1850 as one of the original 27 counties of the State. Sacramento County's largest city, the City of Sacramento, is the seat of government for the State and also serves as the county seat. Sacramento became the State Capital in 1854. Sacramento County is included in the Sacramento-Roseville-Arden-Arcade Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”).

Sacramento County encompasses approximately 994 square miles in the middle of the 400-mile long Central Valley, which is California's prime agricultural region. Sacramento County is bordered by Contra Costa and San Joaquin Counties on the south, Amador and El Dorado Counties on the east, Placer and Sutter Counties on the north, and Yolo and Solano Counties on the west. Sacramento County extends from the low delta lands between the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers north to about ten miles beyond the State Capitol and east to the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The southernmost portion of Sacramento County has direct access to the San Francisco Bay.

### El Dorado County
El Dorado County, located in east-central California, encompasses 1,805 square miles of rolling hills and mountainous terrain. El Dorado County's western boundary contains part of Folsom Lake, and the eastern boundary is the California-Nevada State line. El Dorado County is topographically divided into two zones. The northeast corner of El Dorado County is in the Lake Tahoe basin, while the remainder of El Dorado County is in the “western slope,” the area west of Echo Summit. This landscape invites residents and tourists alike to enjoy outdoor recreation activities year-round. There are two municipalities within El Dorado County. The largest city in the County is South Lake Tahoe, with a 2021 population estimate of 23,398. The City of Placerville, the County seat, is located 45 miles northeast of Sacramento. El Dorado County is also included in the Sacramento-Roseville-Arden-Arcade MSA.

### Yolo County
Yolo County is located in northern California, north of Sacramento and Solano Counties, and east of Napa County. Agriculture is Yolo County's primary industry. The eastern two-thirds of Yolo County consists of nearly level alluvial fans, flat plains, and basins, while the western third is largely composed of rolling terraces and steep uplands used for dry-

# Effective Buying Income

"Effective Buying Income" is defined as personal income less personal tax and nontax payments, a number often referred to as "disposable" or "after-tax" income. Personal income is the aggregate of wages and salaries, other labor-related income (such as employer contributions to private pension funds), proprietor’s income, rental income (which includes imputed rental income of owner-occupants of non-farm dwellings), dividends paid by corporations, interest income from all sources, and transfer payments (such as pensions and welfare assistance). Deducted from this total are personal taxes (federal, state and local), nontax payments (fines, fees, penalties, etc.) and personal contributions to social insurance. According to U.S. government definitions, the resultant figure is commonly known as "disposable personal income."

The following table summarizes the total effective buying income for the Counties, the State, and the United States for the period 2018 through 2022.

## PROPOSED FORM OF OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL

[LETTERHEAD OF JONES HALL]

[Closing Date]

Board of Trustees  
Los Rios Community College District  
1919 Spanos Court  
Sacramento, California 95825  

**OPINION:** $________ Los Rios Community College District  
(Sacramento County, California)  
2022 Refunding General Obligation Bonds  

Members of the Board of Trustees:

We have acted as bond counsel to the Los Rios Community College District (the “District”) in connection with the issuance by the District of $________ principal amount of Los Rios Community College District (Sacramento County, California) 2022 Refunding General Obligation Bonds, dated the date hereof (the “Bonds”), under the provisions of Articles 9 and 11 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the California Government Code, commencing with Section 53550 of said Code (the “Act”), and a resolution adopted by the Board of Trustees of the District (the “Board”) on April 20, 2022 (the “Bond Resolution”). We have examined the law and such certified proceedings and other papers as we deemed necessary to render this opinion.

As to questions of fact material to our opinion, we have relied upon representations of the Board contained in the Resolution and in the certified proceedings and other certifications and opinions furnished to us, without undertaking to verify such facts by independent investigation.

Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion, under existing law, as follows:

1. The District is duly established and validly existing as a unified school district with the power to issue the Bonds and to perform its obligations under the Bond Resolution.

2. The Bond Resolution has been duly adopted by the Board and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the District enforceable against the District in accordance with its terms.

3. The Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the District and are valid and binding general obligations of the District, and the Boards of Supervisors of Sacramento County, El Dorado County, Yolo County, Solano County and Placer County are obligated under  

D-1
<!-- Page 89 -->
the laws of the State of California to cause to be levied a tax without limit as to rate or amount upon the taxable property in the District for the payment when due of the principal of and interest on the Bonds.

4. The interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax. The opinions set forth in the preceding sentence are subject to the condition that the District comply with all requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, that must be satisfied subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that the interest thereon be, and continue to be, excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The District has made certain representations and covenants in order to comply with each requirement. Inaccuracy of those representations, or failure to comply with certain of those covenants, may cause the inclusion of such interest in gross income for federal income tax purposes, which may be retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds.

5. The interest on the Bonds is exempt from personal income taxation imposed by the State of California.

We express no opinion regarding any other tax consequences arising with respect to the ownership, sale or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds.

The rights of the owners of the Bonds and the enforceability thereof are limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and by equitable principles, whether considered and applied in equity or at law.

This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to revise or supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances that may hereafter come to our attention, or any changes in law that may hereafter occur.

Respectfully submitted,

A Professional Law Corporation

form, the reasons for the amendment and the impact of the change in the type of operating data or financial information being provided.

If an amendment is made to the undertaking specifying the accounting principles to be followed in preparing financial statements, the annual financial information for the year in which the change is made shall present a comparison between the financial statements or information prepared on the basis of the new accounting principles and those prepared on the basis of the former accounting principles. The comparison shall include a qualitative discussion of the differences in the accounting principles and the impact of the change in the accounting principles on the presentation of the financial information, in order to provide information to investors to enable them to evaluate the ability of the District to meet its obligations.

If the District chooses to include any information in any Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event in addition to that which is specifically required by this Disclosure Certificate, the District shall have no obligation under this Disclosure Certificate to update such information or include it in any future Annual Report or notice of occurrence of a Listed Event.

**Section 11. Default.** If the District fails to comply with any provision of this Disclosure Certificate, the Participating Underwriter or any holder or beneficial owner of the Bonds may take such actions as may be necessary and appropriate, including seeking mandate or specific performance by court order, to cause the District to comply with its obligations under this Disclosure Certificate. A default under this Disclosure Certificate shall not be deemed an Event of Default under the Resolutions, and the sole remedy under this Disclosure Certificate in the event of any failure of the District to comply with this Disclosure Certificate shall be an action to compel performance.

**Section 12. Duties, Immunities and Liabilities of Dissemination Agent.**

(a) The Dissemination Agent shall have only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Disclosure Certificate, and the District agrees to indemnify and save the Dissemination Agent, its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless against any loss, expense and liabilities which they may incur arising out of or in the exercise or performance of its powers and duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) of defending against any claim of liability, but excluding liabilities due to the Dissemination Agent's negligence or willful misconduct. The Dissemination Agent will have no duty or obligation to review any information provided to it by the District hereunder, and shall not be deemed to be acting in any fiduciary capacity for the District, the Bondholders or any other party.

## DTC AND THE BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM

The following description of the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), the procedures and record keeping with respect to beneficial ownership interests in the Bonds, payment of principal, interest and other payments on the Bonds to DTC Participants or Beneficial Owners, confirmation and transfer of beneficial ownership interest in the Bonds and other related transactions by and between DTC, the DTC Participants and the Beneficial Owners is based solely on information provided by DTC. Accordingly, no representations can be made concerning these matters and neither the DTC Participants nor the Beneficial Owners should rely on the foregoing information with respect to such matters, but should instead confirm the same with DTC or the DTC Participants, as the case may be.

Neither the District nor the Paying Agent take any responsibility for the information contained in this Section.

No assurances can be given that DTC, DTC Participants or Indirect Participants will distribute to the Beneficial Owners (a) payments of interest, principal or premium, if any, with respect to the Bonds, (b) Bonds representing ownership interest in or other confirmation or ownership interest in the Bonds, or (c) redemption or other notices sent to DTC or Cede & Co., its nominee, as the registered owner of the Bonds, or that they will so do on a timely basis, or that DTC, DTC Participants or DTC Indirect Participants will act in the manner described in this APPENDIX. The current "Rules" applicable to DTC are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the current "Procedures" of DTC to be followed in dealing with DTC Participants are on file with DTC.

1. The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the securities (in this APPENDIX, the "Bonds"). The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC's partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Bond will be issued for each maturity of the Bonds, in the aggregate principal amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC. If, however, the aggregate principal amount of any maturity exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each $500 million of principal amount and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of this issue.

2. DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a "banking organization" within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a "clearing corporation" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a "clearing agency" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants ("Direct Participants") deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned

**F-2**

1. **Subsidary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”)**. DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com. The information contained on this Internet site is not incorporated herein by reference.

2. **Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system** must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Bond (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive Bonds representing their ownership interests in Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.

3. **To facilitate subsequent transfers**, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. and such name may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

4. **Conveyance of notices and other communications** by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to take certain steps to augment transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Bond documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request that copies of the notices be provided directly to them.

5. **Redemption notices** will be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within an issue are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such issue to be redeemed.

6. **Neither DTC nor Cede & Co.** (nor such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to District as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting.

**8.** Redemption proceeds, distributions, and interest payments on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts, upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from District or Paying Agent on payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC nor its nominee, Paying Agent, or District, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of District or Paying Agent, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.

**9.** DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Bonds at any time by giving reasonable notice to District or Paying Agent. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor securities depository is not obtained, Bonds are required to be printed and delivered to DTC.

**10.** The District may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Bond certificates will be printed and delivered to DTC.

**11.** The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that District believes to be reliable, but District takes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.
