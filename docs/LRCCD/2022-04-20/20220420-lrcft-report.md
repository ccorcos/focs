Although this past semester was challenging because of the pandemic, Los Rios faculty continue to work diligently to help students complete the semester successfully.

The LRCFT participated as a major sponsor of the Cesar Chavez March in Sacramento on March 26. We will also take part in Sacramentoâ€™s annual May Day celebration on May 1 of labor and working people.

The LRCFT PAFC continues to interview candidates for various political office in the Sacramento region, including the Yolo Co. DA race, Sacramento City Council, Sacramento Office of Public Education, and state Senate District 6. We are also canvassing for candidates endorsed by the LRCFT.

The LRCFT exec. board along with faculty in Los Rios and throughout the state will attend the CFT Part Time Faculty conference in Sacramento on May 1 and 2. We will lobby legislators to improve part time faculty access to medical care, job security, and pay parity.

The LRCFT and Los Rios faculty have been testifying in the legislature lately regarding several bills, including AB 1705.

We will also attend the annual California Labor Federation election primary and lobbying event on May 15 and 16 in Sacramento.

The LRCFT will be hosting trustee Dustin Johnson at our next meeting and will reach out to trustee John Knight to attend one of our board meetings this semester as well.
