**Board Meeting (circle one):**  
September  October  November  December  February  March  **April**  May  

**Report provided by ASO Student Senate President/Representative:** ARC Senate President, Stacey Burrows  

Below is a list of highlighted activities, accomplishments and events at each of the colleges within the Los Rios District. This report is to be used as a guide for the Student Advisory Committee representative and the Student Trustee in providing the monthly LRCCD student report at the LRCCD Board of Trustee (BoT) meetings. Only the information on this report will be used. Not all areas need to be completed; rather, this is a guide on topics to consider. Approved/signed college reports are due to the Student Trustee one week prior to each scheduled BOT meeting. The Student Trustee in consultation with the SAC Advisor will compile these submissions for one comprehensive report which is due to District Advisor, Dr. Ortiz-Mercado, the designated student speaker, and SAC Advisor by noon the Friday before the BOT meeting. Late submissions/unauthorized reports will not be presented at the BOT meeting. All reports are enlisted here within the Google Drive Direct Link: [SAC April Reports](#)
