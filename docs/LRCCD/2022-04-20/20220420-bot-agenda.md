**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
The Los Rios Classified Employees Association (LRCEA) salary schedule needs to be improved to reflect an increase for the Police Communication Dispatcher position. The District and LRCEA have a shared interest in recruiting and maintaining qualified Police Communication Dispatchers. A market compensation analysis for the Police Communication Dispatcher position was performed, and it was determined that salary schedules were not in line with comparable markets.

**STATUS:**  
Effective May 1, 2022, the salary range for the Police Communication Dispatcher on the LRCEA interim salary schedule would be increased to bring those schedules in line with those comparable markets. Similarly, effective April 25, 2022, the salary range on the Special Rate – Temporary Classified Employees salary schedule would also be increased.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the revised Interim 2021-2022 LRCEA salary schedule and the Salary Schedule for Special Rate - Temporary Classified Employees schedule with these improvements. The effective date for the changes to the regular, permanent salary schedule is May 1, 2022 and for the temporary classified salary schedule is April 25, 2022.

Sabbatical/professional development leave recommendations are presented to the Board in April and November of each year.

The criteria for leaves, as stated in the LRCFT agreement are as follows:  
1. Retraining of applicant to allow for future new assignment(s) in a needed area as determined by College and District priorities.  
2. Studies, projects or activities that provide staff with opportunities to upgrade academic, technical, and vocational skills and knowledge for current or future assignments.  
3. Studies, projects, or activities for the improvement of curriculum, educational delivery systems, student personnel services, or other support services.  
4. Studies, projects, or activities for development or revision of certificate or degree programs.  
5. Studies, projects, or activities related to feasibility or revision of new or existing programs.  
6. Studies, projects, or activities for the enhancement of student access and success at the course, program or institutional levels.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**

“Closing Equity Gaps in Sociology 321 & Sociology 300: Using Individual Course Level Data Inquiry Culturally Responsive Teaching and Rigor for Student Success”  
**Proposal:** In the Center for Urban Education (CUE) materials on Educational Equity, the focus is on inquiry and developing as a “best practitioner” rather than on tools or best practices. Since each educator brings different identifies and strengths in relation to their student population and has the agency to question and change the structures in which they operate, CUE emphasizes best practitioners who are evidence based, race conscious, institutionally focused, systemically aware, and equity advancing. With this frame in mind, using an inquiry model informed by the professor’s own course level disproportionate impact data, this proposal focuses on assessing culturally responsive and race conscious teaching and leaning and implementing interpersonal and course level changes that are best suited based on the students enrolled in the courses and relational positionality.

**Proposal:** Through professional development activities and colleagues, the professor recognizes the need to learn more effective ways of building, sustaining, and teaching relationship and connection in the classroom. This proposal will serve to allow the professor an opportunity to investigate the whys and hows of building equitable relationship and connection in the multidisciplinary college classroom.

By adopting the resources created in this project, instructors will be able to offer Math 300 as part of the Zero Textbook Cost (ZTC) program at ARC.

10% Fall 2022 .100 FTE  
“Guided Pathways Milestone Certificates for Multilingual Speakers”  
Proposal: This proposal continues work already underway for the past two semesters focused on creating joint certificates with various departments. These certificates acknowledge the large number of ESL students and their milestone achievements on their rigorous path towards obtaining high level proficiency in academic English language skills and knowledge in introductory courses in a particular discipline. Four certificates have already been approved and this semester’s work focuses on additional certificates including a “Health Sciences” certificate that will include collaborating with faculty in Nursing, Paramedic, Health Interpreting, and Respiratory Care.  

Jennifer Neale  
Natural Resources Professor  
20% Fall 2022 .100 FTE  
“Upgrading the California Naturalist Certification Program”  
Proposal: This proposal focuses on updating the California Naturalist (Cal Nat) certification. This opportunity is made available to students enrolled in the professor’s field-focused lecture-lab courses in Natural Resources and Biology that have a strong focus on California’s natural history. Students have additional responsibilities and activities and develop and implement a capstone project. The certification updating will focus on five key areas: field and virtual field experiences/activities; curricular update/improvement; citizen science materials and activities; whole-class Cal Nat projects and individual student capstone projects. These updating efforts are needed to effectively respond to challenging and changing conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic and wildfires, address critical environmental concerns such as climate change and environmental justice; and to meet the increased demand in the state for Cal Nat certification in our region.

My proposed work addresses the impact of COVID-19 on student career trainings, professional development needs such as updates to telehealth practices and technical and vocation skills needed to address impacts of COVID-19. These updates will provide students with improved employment skills, which will allow long-term success in the field of Social Work and Human Services. In addition, students need professional training opportunities and certification in topics such as mandated reporting, being cultural brokers, mental health first aide, and community defined practices for BIPOC (black, indigenous, and people of color) and historically underserved communities.

**“Support for Aligning Math or Statistics Classes with CVC-OEI”**  
**Proposal:** This project involves the applicant coaching other members of his department through making their online math courses CVC-OEI compliant. Doing so provides a unique challenge for math instructors with the formulas and graphs and other images required in these courses, and the applicant himself spent numerous hours working through the challenges and researching apps and other programs necessary to make the course accessible. By providing coaching to interested faculty, he would be able to minimize the amount of time spent by each instructor and provide support with the technology and research required. At the time of proposal, there are three interested faculty members, and the applicant's plan is to spend approximately 8 hours per week coaching these faculty, meeting with them weekly to help with content, as well as working on technology and researching issues that arise outside of the weekly meetings.

may convince more faculty to adopt zero-cost options for students rather than requiring them to purchase textbooks that cost over $120 for a typical textbook. The project will involve learning ADAPT, writing content, working with the district to adopt the platform, seeking feedback from students and colleagues, and training others to use the platform..

### 2020–2021 SABBATICAL AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT LEAVE – REVISIONS

The following is a rescind from the 2020-21 Sabbatical and Professional Development Leaves approved by the Board of Trustees on November 18, 2020.

**American River College**  

**Type B Leave Time**  
The employee is rescinding his request for the following sabbatical leave.

**Erik Haarala, ESL**  
**“Technology Skills Course for English Language Learners”**  
Type B – 20% Spring 2021  
.100 Annual FTE  

The purpose of this proposal is the development of a college course designed for English Language Learners (ELLs) in which technology for college and online study are the main focus. Developing this course and the related materials will allow the English Language Learners to become more competent in the use of technology. This will allow them to move through the ESL sequence of courses and gain the language and sociocultural skills necessary to be successful in other college programs. The end result will be increased overall enrollment and a narrowing of the equity gap per the college’s mission.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** April 20, 2022  

**SUBJECT:** Resolution No. 2022-06: 2022 Refunding General Obligation Bonds (Refinancing of Measure A, 2012 Refunding Bond)  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** POS  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item C  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Mario Rodriguez, Vice Chancellor Finance and Administration  
**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  

**ACTION** X  
**INFORMATION**  

**BACKGROUND:**  
In March 2002, District voters approved Measure A, a $265 million general obligation bond authorization for the construction and modernization of District facilities. Under Measure A, the District issued $27.5 million in August 2002 (Series A); $65 million in April 2004 (Series B); $70 million in July 2006 (Series C); $55 million in August 2009 (Series D); $20 million in June 2013 (Series E) and $27.5 million in February 2018 (Series F). In addition, the District has undertaken six separate refinancings (referred to as “refundings” in the bond market) to reduce interest costs. Series A, B, C and D have been fully refunded with total taxpayer net present value (NPV) savings of $22 million. By continuing with the steps required to undertake the refunding of its 2012 General Obligation Refunding bonds, the District provides itself with the option of obtaining additional significant taxpayer savings.

**STATUS:**  
The 2012 General Obligation Refunding Bonds were issued in March 2012 with a true interest cost of 3.189% and an optional redemption provision allowing the bonds to be refinanced on or after August 1, 2022. The impending redemption date coupled with the low current interest rate environment present an opportunity to refund the 2012 Bonds by issuing 2022 Refunding General Obligation Bonds in the amount not to exceed $35 million. The projected net taxpayer savings of the refunding is approximately $4.2 million with a NPV savings of $3.7 million. The projected savings as a percentage of the refunded bonds is over 10%. Typically, a NPV savings of 5% is the threshold used to determine if a refunding is worthwhile. The projected savings are net of all costs of issuance including financial advisory, legal, rating, and underwriting fees.

While the above projections are based on current market interest rates, the amount of savings ultimately generated by the refunding will depend on bond market conditions on the day of the refunding bond sale.

The sale of the refunding bonds will use a negotiated sale process with the Underwriter of the bonds. The Underwriter will be designated by the Chancellor based upon proposals received by the District and upon consultation with the Municipal Advisor. As with other issuances, the District retains the guidance of a fiduciary agent that protects the interests of the electorate of 69.

the District. A copy of the Preliminary Official Statement, which will be updated following the sale to the Official Statement, is also included in the information presented to the Board.

RECOMMENDATION:  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve Resolution No 2022-06 authorizing the issuance and sale of the 2022 Refunding General Obligation Bonds in the maximum principal amount of $35,000,000 to refund outstanding 2012 General Obligation Refunding Bonds and approving related documents and official actions, including the Preliminary Official Statement relating to the refunding bonds.

![ARTICLE II TERMS OF REFUNDING BONDS](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=ARTICLE+II+TERMS+OF+REFUNDING+BONDS)

**Section 2.01. Authorization.** The Board hereby determines that the prudent management of the fiscal affairs of the District requires that it issue the Refunding Bonds under the provisions of the Bond Law without submitting the question of the issuance of the Refunding Bonds to a vote of the qualified electors of the District. To that end, the Board hereby authorizes the issuance of the Refunding Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $35,000,000, subject to the terms of the Bond Law and this Resolution, for the purpose of providing funds to refinance the Refunded 2012 Bonds.

This Resolution constitutes a continuing agreement between the District and the Owners of all of the Outstanding Refunding Bonds to secure the full and final payment of principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds, subject to the covenants, agreements, provisions and conditions herein contained. The Refunding Bonds shall be designated the “Los Rios Community College District (Sacramento County, California) 2022 Refunding General Obligation Bonds”.

As provided in Section 53552 of the Bond Law, the Refunding Bonds shall not be issued unless the total net interest cost to maturity on the Refunding Bonds plus the principal amount of the Refunding Bonds is less than the total net interest cost to maturity on the Refunded 2012 Bonds plus the principal amount of the Refunded 2012 Bonds. Before issuing the Refunding Bonds, the District shall receive confirmation from the Municipal Advisor or the Underwriter that the requirements of Section 53552 of the Bond Law have been satisfied.

**Section 2.02. Terms of Refunding Bonds.**

(a) **Terms of Refunding Bonds.** The Refunding Bonds shall be issued as fully registered bonds, without coupons, in the form of current interest bonds in the denomination of $5,000 each or any integral multiple thereof. The Refunding Bonds shall be lettered and numbered as the Paying Agent may prescribe, and shall be dated as of the Closing Date.

Interest on the Refunding Bonds shall be payable semiannually on each Interest Payment Date. Each Refunding Bond shall bear interest from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date of registration and authentication thereof unless (i) it is authenticated on or before an Interest Payment Date and after the close of business on the preceding Record Date, in which event it shall bear interest from such Interest Payment Date, or (ii) it is authenticated prior to the first Record Date, in which event it shall bear interest from the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if interest on any Refunding Bond is in default at the time of authentication thereof, such Refunding Bond shall bear interest from

the Interest Payment Date to which interest has previously been paid or made available for payment thereon.

(b) Maturities; Basis of Interest Calculation. The Refunding Bonds shall mature on August 1 in the years and in the amounts, and shall bear interest at the rates, as determined upon the sale thereof as provided in the Bond Purchase Agreement. The limits relating to the maximum maturity and interest rates prescribed by the Bond Law and the Board shall be set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement. Interest on the Refunding Bonds shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

(c) CUSIP Identification Numbers. CUSIP identification numbers shall be printed on the Refunding Bonds, but such numbers do not constitute a part of the contract evidenced by the Refunding Bonds and any error or omission with respect thereto will not constitute cause for refusal of any purchaser to accept delivery of and pay for the Refunding Bonds. Any failure by the District to use CUSIP numbers in any notice to Owners of the Refunding Bonds will not constitute an event of default or any violation of the District's contract with the Owners and will not impair the effectiveness of any such notice.

(d) Payment. Interest on the Refunding Bonds (including the final interest payment upon maturity or redemption) shall be payable by check, draft or wire of the Paying Agent made to the Owner thereof (which shall be DTC so long as the Refunding Bonds are held in the book-entry system of DTC) at such Owner's address as it appears on the Registration Books at the close of business on the preceding Record Date; except that at the written request of the Owner of at least $1,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Refunding Bonds, which written request is on file with the Paying Agent as of any Record Date, interest on any Refunding Bonds will be paid on the succeeding Interest Payment Date to such account as will be specified in such written request. Principal of the Refunding Bonds shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America upon presentation and surrender at the Office of the Paying Agent. The provisions of this Section relating to the payment of the Refunding Bonds shall be subject in all respects to the provisions of Section 2.09 so long as the Refunding Bonds are held in the book-entry system of DTC.

(b) Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption. If and as determined upon the sale of the Refunding Bonds, any maturity of Refunding Bonds shall be designated as Term Bonds which are subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption on August 1 in each of the years as determined upon the sale of the Refunding Bonds, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed (without premium), together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption. If some but not all of the Term Bonds have been redeemed under the preceding subsection (a) of this Section, the aggregate principal amount of such Term Bonds to be redeemed in each year under this subsection (b) will be reduced in integral multiples of $5,000, as designated in written a Written Request of the District filed with the Paying Agent.

(c) Selection of Refunding Bonds for Redemption. Whenever less than all of the Outstanding Refunding Bonds of any one maturity designated for redemption, the Paying Agent shall select the Outstanding Refunding Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed by lot in any manner deemed fair by the Paying Agent. For purposes of such selection, each Refunding Bond will be deemed to consist of individual Refunding Bonds of $5,000 denominations, which may be separately redeemed.

(d) Redemption Procedure. The Paying Agent shall give notice of any redemption to be given at least 20 days but not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption, to (i) to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and (ii) to the respective Owners of any Refunding Bonds designated for redemption, at their addresses appearing on the Registration Books. Such notice shall not be a condition precedent to such redemption and failure to give or to receive any such notice shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of such Refunding Bonds. In addition, the Paying Agent shall give notice of redemption to each of the Securities Depositories.

Such notice shall (i) state the redemption date and the redemption price, (ii) if less than all of the then Outstanding Refunding Bonds are to be called for redemption, designate the serial numbers of the Refunding Bonds to be redeemed by giving the individual number of each Refunding Bond or by stating that all Refunding Bonds between two stated numbers, both inclusive, or by stating that all of the Refunding Bonds of one or more maturities have been called for redemption, (iii) require that such Refunding Bonds be then surrendered at the Office of the Paying Agent for redemption at the applicable redemption price, and (iv) state that further interest on such Refunding Bonds will not accrue from and after the redemption date. Any notice of optional redemption of the Refunding Bonds may state that it is conditional, in which case it shall make reference to the right of the District to rescind the notice as set forth in subsection (e) of this Section.

Upon surrender of Refunding Bonds redeemed in part only, the District shall execute and the Paying Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the Owner, at the expense of the District, a new Refunding Bond or Bonds, of the same maturity, of

authorized denominations in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Refunding Bond or Bonds.

From and after the date fixed for redemption, if notice of such redemption has been duly given and funds available for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds so called for redemption have been duly provided, such Refunding Bonds so called will cease to be entitled to any benefit under this Resolution other than the right to receive payment of the redemption price, and no interest will accrue thereon on or after the redemption date specified in such notice.

Any notice of redemption shall be cancelled and annulled if for any reason funds will not be or are not available on the date fixed for redemption for the payment in full of the Refunding Bonds then called for redemption. The District and the Paying Agent shall have no liability to the Refunding Bond Owners or any other party related to or arising from such rescission of redemption. The Paying Agent shall give notice of such rescission of redemption to the respective Owners of the Refunding Bonds designated for redemption, at their addresses appearing on the Registration Books, and to the Securities Depositories and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.

Paying Agent and the District may treat DTC (or its nominee) as the sole and exclusive owner of the Refunding Bonds registered in its name for all purposes of this Resolution, and neither the Paying Agent nor the District shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. The Paying Agent and the District shall not have any responsibility or obligation to any Depository System Participant, any person claiming a beneficial ownership interest in the Refunding Bonds under or through DTC or a Depository System Participant, or any other person which is not shown on the register of the District as being an owner, with respect to the accuracy of any records maintained by DTC or any Depository System Participant or the payment by DTC or any Depository System Participant by DTC or any Depository System Participant of any amount in respect of the principal or interest with respect to the Refunding Bonds.

Except under the conditions noted below, no person other than DTC shall receive a Refunding Bond. Upon delivery by DTC to the District of written notice to the effect that DTC has determined to substitute a new nominee in place of Cede & Co., the term “Cede & Co.” in this Resolution shall refer to such new nominee of DTC.

If the District determines that it is in the best interest of the beneficial owners that they be able to obtain Refunding Bonds and delivers a written certificate to DTC and the District to that effect, DTC shall notify the Depository System Participants of the availability through DTC of Refunding Bonds. In such event, the District shall issue, transfer and exchange Refunding Bonds as requested by DTC and any other owners in appropriate amounts. DTC may determine to discontinue providing its services with respect to the Refunding Bonds at any time by giving notice to the District and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances (if there is no successor securities depository), the District shall be obligated to deliver Refunding Bonds as described in this Resolution. Whenever DTC requests the District to do so, the District will cooperate with DTC in taking appropriate action after reasonable notice to (a) make available one or more separate Refunding Bonds evidencing the Refunding Bonds to any Depository System Participant having Refunding Bonds credited to its DTC account or (b) arrange for another securities depository to maintain custody of certificates evidencing the Refunding Bonds.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Resolution to the contrary, so long as any Refunding Bond is registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC, all payments with respect to the principal and interest with respect to such Refunding Bond shall be made and given, respectively, to DTC as provided as in the representation letter delivered on the date of issuance of the Refunding Bonds.

**ARTICLE III**

**SALE OF REFUNDING BONDS; APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS**

**Section 3.01. Sale of Refunding Bonds.** Pursuant to Section 53583 of the Bond Law, the Board hereby authorizes the negotiated sale of the Refunding Bonds to an underwriting firm, investment banking firm or other financial institution which is designated by the Chancellor to serve as the Underwriter, based upon proposals received by the District and upon consultation with the Municipal Advisor. The Refunding Bonds shall be sold pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement in substantially the form on file with the Secretary to the Board with such changes therein, deletions therefrom and modifications thereto as a District Representative may approve, such approval to be conclusively evidenced by the execution and delivery of the Bond Purchase Agreement. The Underwriter’s discount shall not exceed 0.40% of the par amount of the Refunding Bonds, and the Refunding Bonds shall be sold at interest rates which ensure that the debt service savings requirement set forth in Section 53552 of the Bond Law are met. The Board hereby authorizes a District Representative to execute and deliver the final form of the Bond Purchase Agreement in the name and on behalf of the District.

In accordance with Section 53555 of the Bond Law, the Board has determined to authorize the sale of the Refunding Bonds at a negotiated sale because (i) a negotiated sale provides more flexibility to revise the financing structure of the Refunding Bonds in a volatile municipal bond market, (ii) the Underwriter is familiar with the financial and operating conditions of the District and the overall requirements of its financing plan, and (iii) a negotiated sale permits the Refunding Bonds to be sold on an expedited time schedule.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any of the terms of the Refunding Bonds may be established or modified under the Bond Purchase Agreement. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between this Resolution and the Bond Purchase Agreement relating to the terms of the Refunding Bonds, the provisions of the Bond Purchase Agreement shall be controlling.

**Section 3.02. Approval of Official Statement.** The Board hereby approves and deems final within the meaning of Rule 15c2-12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Preliminary Official Statement describing the Refunding Bonds in the form on file with the Secretary to the Board, which shall be utilized in connection with the sale of the Refunding Bonds under Section 3.01. A District Representative is hereby individually authorized, at the request of the Underwriter, to execute an appropriate certificate affirming the Board’s determination that the Preliminary Official Statement has been deemed nearly final within the meaning of such Rule. Distribution of the Preliminary Official Statement by the Underwriter to prospective purchasers of the Refunding Bonds is hereby approved. A District Representative is hereby authorized to execute and deliver the final form of the Bond Purchase Agreement in the name and on behalf of the District.

This Bond is one of a series of $___________ of Bonds issued for the purpose of raising money to refinance outstanding general obligation bond indebtedness of the District, issued under a resolution of the Board of Trustees of the District adopted on April 20, 2022 (the “Bond Resolution”). This Bond and the issue of which this Bond is a part are payable as to both principal and interest from the proceeds of the levy of ad valorem taxes on all property subject to such taxes in the District, which taxes are unlimited as to rate or amount.

The principal of and interest on this Bond does not constitute a debt of the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions other than the District, or any of the officers, agents and employees thereof, and neither the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions, nor any of the officers, agents and employees thereof shall be liable thereon. In no event shall the principal of and interest on this Bond be payable out of any funds or properties of the District other than ad valorem taxes levied upon all taxable property in the District.

The Bonds of this issue are issuable only as fully registered Bonds in the denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. This Bond is exchangeable and transferable for Bonds of other authorized denominations at the principal corporate trust office of the Paying Agent, by the Registered Owner or by a person legally empowered to do so, upon presentation and surrender hereof to the Paying Agent, together with a request for exchange or an assignment signed by the Registered Owner or by a person legally empowered to do so, in a form satisfactory to the Paying Agent, all subject to the terms, limitations and conditions provided in the Bond Resolution. Any tax or governmental charges shall be paid by the transferor. The District and the Paying Agent may deem and treat the Registered Owner as the absolute owner of this Bond for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of principal or interest and for all other purposes, and neither the District nor the Paying Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

[if applicable:] The Bonds maturing on and before August 1, 20__, are not subject to optional redemption before their respective stated maturities. The Bonds maturing on and after August 1, 20__, are subject to redemption at the A-2 102

option of the District on August 1, 20__, and on any date thereafter, at a redemption price equal to ___% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed together with interest accruing thereon to the redemption date, without premium.

*[if applicable:] The Bonds maturing on August 1 in each of the years ____ and ____ are Term Bonds which are subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption on August 1 in each of the years and in the respective principal amounts as set forth in the following tables, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed (without premium), together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption. If some but not all of the Term Bonds have been redeemed under the preceding paragraph, the aggregate principal amount of Term Bonds to be redeemed under this paragraph will be reduced as designated in written notice filed by the District with the Paying Agent. 

**Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption of Bonds Maturing on August 1, ____**

| Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Date (August 1) | Principal Amount To Be Redeemed |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
|                                                    |                                  |

The Paying Agent shall give notice of the redemption of the Bonds at the expense of the District. Such notice shall specify: (a) that the Bonds or a designated portion thereof are to be redeemed, (b) the numbers and CUSIP numbers of the Bonds to be redeemed, (c) the date of notice and the date of redemption, (d) the place or places where the redemption will be made, and (e) descriptive information regarding the Bonds including the dated date, interest rate and stated maturity date. Such notice shall further state that on the specified date there shall become due and payable upon each Bond to be redeemed, the portion of the principal amount of such Bond to be redeemed, together with interest accrued to such date, and that from and after such date interest with respect thereto shall cease to accrue and be payable.

Notice of redemption shall be given to the registered owner of the Bonds, to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and to the District and the respective Owners of any Bonds designated for redemption at their addresses appearing on the Bond registration books, in every case at least 20 days, but not more than 60 days, before the redemption date; provided that neither failure to receive such notice nor any defect in any notice shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for the redemption of such Bonds.

Neither the District nor the Paying Agent will be required: (a) to issue or transfer any Bond during a period beginning with the opening of business on the 

A-3  
103
<!-- Page 104 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
15th calendar day next preceding either any Interest Payment Date or any date of selection of any Bond to be redeemed and ending with the close of business on the Interest Payment Date or a day on which the applicable notice of redemption is given, or (b) to transfer any Bond which has been selected or called for redemption in whole or in part.

Reference is made to the Bond Resolution for a more complete description of the provisions, among others, with respect to the nature and extent of the security for the Bonds of this series, the rights, duties and obligations of the District, the Paying Agent and the Registered Owners, and the terms and conditions upon which the Bonds are issued and secured. The owner of this Bond assents, by acceptance hereof, to all of the provisions of the Bond Resolution.

Unless this Bond is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation (“DTC”), to the Trustee for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any Bond issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.

It is certified, recited and declared that all acts and conditions required by the Constitution and laws of the State of California to exist, to be performed or to have been met precedent to and in the issuing of the Bonds in order to make them legal, valid and binding general obligations of the District, have been performed and have been met in regular and due form as required by law; that payment in full for the Bonds has been received; that no statutory or constitutional limitation on indebtedness or taxation has been exceeded in issuing the Bonds; and that due provision has been made for levying and collecting ad valorem property taxes on all of the taxable property within the District in an amount sufficient to pay principal and interest when due, and for levying such taxes the full faith and credit of the District are hereby pledged.

This Bond shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose and shall not be entitled to any security or benefit under the Bond Resolution (described on the reverse hereof) until the Certificate of Authentication below has been manually signed by the Paying Agent.
