### Major Issues and Activities
**What are the major issues and activities that should be considered by the CCCT Board and the League in the next two years?**  
The CCCT/League should focus on expanding opportunities and access for all students thru DEIA. The current emphasis on student completion should not deter us from advocating non-traditional pathways to success. We should also work to strengthen our strategic partnerships to ensure adequate funding for student access and success.

---

### Contribution
**How do you feel you can contribute in these areas?**  
I have always worked to help California students achieve their goals no matter the venue. I have been successful in establishing relationships to help forge successful pathways via support programs, CTE and Industry partners, athletics, as well as Middle School-to-High School-to-Community College-to-University/Career pipelines.

Educational leadership also requires being proactive in the political arena. Maintaining active partnerships with our leaders in Sacramento is very important. Continuing to work with the community colleges about issues surrounding COVID and virtual learning is necessary to maximize the students' ability to access educational success.  

**How do you feel you can contribute in these areas? (Please use 50 words or less. Any portion of the statement beyond this limit will not be included.)**  
Being knowledgeable about issues affecting community college students on and off campus is vital to having an effective and productive learning environment. How the students are affected by housing and food insecurity among the lack of other vital necessities are issues that should be presented to the legislature regularly.

**What are the major issues and activities that should be considered by the CCCT Board and the League in the next two years? (Please use 50 words or less. Any portion of the statement beyond this limit will not be included.)**  
Major issues include limited student engagement hands-on learning within the classroom and professor/educator execution methods. Increasing student learning successfulness by bringing innovative and interactive classroom activities paired with soft skill education. We need sporadic in-person evaluations of the educators during classroom sessions to measure teaching/facilitating curriculum on higher levels.  

**How do you feel you can contribute in these areas? (Please use 50 words or less. Any portion of the statement beyond this limit will not be included.)**  
Make myself available to assist with developing innovative activities such as the Jigsaw technique, where students in small groups separate various topics of research while developing cooperative learning; inquiry-based learning, where students research in class, develop questions, and present; project-based learning which mimics real-life situations to develop greater soft skills.
