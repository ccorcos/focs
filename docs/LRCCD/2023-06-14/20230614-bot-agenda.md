Los Rios Community College District Indigenous Land Acknowledgment Statement  
In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our four colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.  

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item C  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Jacob Knapp, General Counsel  
**FIRST READING**  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION**  
**INFORMATION**  

**BACKGROUND:**  
On October 25, 2022, the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges filed revisions to Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations related to Campus Climate and Public Safety with the Secretary of State. These regulations apply to all public safety services and public safety personnel at community college districts statewide. The State Chancellor’s Office released a memo in February of 2023 clarifying that local community college districts are expected to review and update local policies and procedures to address the new Title 5 public safety requirements by May of 2023. The proposed Policy 8912, Campus Police and Safety Services, is intended to address these changes in law. Both the proposed Policy 8912 and the associated administrative regulation, R-8912, have already been vetted through the Chancellor’s Cabinet process at Chancellor’s Cabinet meetings in March and April of 2023. The proposed policy was presented to the Board of Trustees for a first reading at the May 10, 2023 Board meeting.  

**STATUS:**  
The proposed Policy, if adopted, would require campus police to adhere to community-based policing principles and evidence-based policing practices. It would establish a Public Safety Advisory Committee to make recommendations on campus police and safety services to the Chancellor and Board at least annually. The policy, if adopted, would require the Chancellor to establish a “Public Safety Compact” with stakeholders to establish the district’s requirements for delivery of public safety services at District campuses and facilities. The proposed policy includes other requirements for District public safety services, as required by Title 5, including regular training on methods of community policing, cultural responsibility, conflict avoidance, and deescalation, a prohibition on the purchase of military equipment unless authorized by the Board, and the provision of routine mental health services for campus police and safety personnel.  

The associated Administrative Regulation (R-8912) is not before the Board for consideration, but is attached to provide the Board of Trustees with additional information and context.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve and adopt the proposed policy.

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
Currently, one thousand forty-nine (1049) District retirees receive a monthly District contribution for post-employment (retiree) healthcare premiums. Eligibility requirements for the District contribution varies depending upon if the former employee: a) retired between 1969 and 1978 and qualifies for the District monthly contribution pursuant to Board Policies (pre-collective bargaining); or b) retired under a particular collective bargaining contract which states the District contribution level and provisions for subsequent increases. Changes to the District contribution level for all retirees is subject to Governing Board action per Board Policies 5165 (Certificated Employees), 6622 (Classified Employees), or 9414 (Management/Confidential Employees).

**STATUS:**  
Consistent with Board policies, any change to the District contribution for retirees' healthcare premiums is reviewed biannually by the Board and is subject to the District's ability to fund the increase.

The last adjustment was effective July 1, 2021, with an increase of $28, to the current monthly contribution of $334. From the date of the last adjustment, the total monthly healthcare premiums (healthcare plan premiums plus Medicare premiums) for the majority of our retirees decreased from $399 at July 1, 2021 to $393 at July 1, 2023. Medical premiums will remain the same through December 2023. As of January 1, 2024, premiums will change on an annual basis each January.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve to maintain the monthly District contribution at $334. It is further recommended that the board review the District contribution for retirees' healthcare premiums again in December 2023 when the January 1, 2024 premium change is established.

**INFORMATION**  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
Pursuant to Article XIII-B of the Constitution and Government Code Section 7900, all community college districts are required to compute an annual appropriation limit. That appropriation limit is adjusted annually for changes in price index, population, and other applicable factors. This requirement is also known as the Gann Limit.

Due to recent legislative updates to the Gann limit, districts with excess limit should adopt a new appropriations limit equal to their proceeds of taxes, thereby transferring any available limit to the State of California. Staff has calculated the 2023-24 appropriation limit as specified in the Government Code Section 7908. The calculated spending limit is $366,938,794. The District’s 2023-24 appropriations subject to this limit are calculated at $388,457,326, which indicates that the District has excess limit, since its tentative budget is $21,518,532 above its appropriation limit. For 2022-23 the District’s appropriations subject to the limit were $41,732,577 above the appropriation limit of $306,265,965.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
Since the District has an excess limit, it is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the appropriation limitation of $388,457,326 for 2023-24 by adopting the attached Resolution No. 2023-09.

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  
**FIRST READING**  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION**  
**INFORMATION**  

**BACKGROUND:**  
On September 14, 2022, the Governing Board adopted the 2022-23 maximum funding level (Z Budget) for the General Fund. The Board approved budget revision #1 on February 8, 2023. The attached Schedule I details modifications to this funding level since the first revision.  

**STATUS:**  
Revisions to the adopted budget for the General Fund are necessary for the following reasons:  

1. Schedule I summarizes changes to revenues, appropriations, and fund balance for the general fund. General Fund revenues and appropriations are budgeted $29 million more than the budget revision #1 level due to changes in general purpose, and restricted/special programs revenues. General fund unrestricted revenue increased by $6 million, which is predominantly due to new awards for state programs and increased interest income. Restricted revenues increased by $23 million, which is predominantly due to additional State awards received since the budget was last revised, as shown on Schedule II.  
2. Schedule II provides specific adjustments to restricted and special program revenues. Restricted revenues reflect new awards for Federal and State programs, as well as augmentations to existing programs for federal, state and local. The changes in appropriations reflect the allocation of those additional resources as well as re-alignment across object codes as expenditure plans are formalized.  

Revisions to other District funds due to:  

3. Instructionally-Related Activities (Schedule III): There is an increase in budgeted local revenue and interfund transfers. The changes in appropriations reflect the allocation of additional resources as well as re-alignment of expenditures.  
4. Child Development Fund (Schedule IV): There is an increase in budgeted federal revenue due to a new federal grant. Interfund transfers decreased due to additional resources and decreased appropriations.  
5. Capital Outlay Projects (Schedule V): The increase in local revenues reflects interest.  

26
<!-- Page 27 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

1. Income and miscellaneous spending adjustments. The decrease in state revenue is a reduction in State Capital Outlay Funds. Interfund transfers are an adjustment of amounts from the General Fund for projects.
2. Bond Projects – Measure M (Schedule VI): Changes are related to the appropriation of budgeted ending fund balance.
3. Bond Interest and Redemption Fund (Schedules VII and VIII): Changes are related to the revised bond payment schedules.
4. Other Debt Service Fund (Schedule IX): Increase in expected interest income.
5. Self Insurance (Schedule X): Increase in expected interest income, an increase in insurance premiums and the change in funding and appropriations for the dental program.

**DATE:** June 14, 2023  

**SUBJECT:** Disposition of Surplus Equipment  
**ATTACHMENT:** None  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item I  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
The Education Code regulates the procedures by which a Community College District can dispose of real and personal property. Education Code section 81452 provides that the governing board may, by unanimous vote, dispose of items valued at $5,000 or less by private sale without advertising or selling the items at public auction. The District has held previous auctions, but they have generally cost more than they have netted for the District.  

**STATUS:**  
The District has a quantity of surplus materials that needs to be disposed of, such as outdated desks and computers. The District has located a scrap dealer who will take selected surplus items for recycling. Any items remaining will be disposed.  

The surplus items to be recycled or disposed of are either irreparable, obsolete, in poor condition or not needed for district/college operations and include the following: 3 Chromebooks; 18 computers; 2 laptops; 17 monitors and 4 printers.  

These items have a value of less than $5,000.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the disposal of the listed items per Education Code section 81452.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** June 14, 2023  

**SUBJECT:** Fiscal Year 2023-24 Salary Schedules for Extra Service Assignments and Professional Expert Agreements  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item N  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:** CONSENT/ROUTINE X  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  
**FIRST READING**  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION**  
**INFORMATION**  

**BACKGROUND:**  
In August of each year, changes to Extra Service Assignment (ESA) and Professional Expert Agreement (PEX) are included when the revised salary schedules are presented to the Board to consider any retroactive salary schedule adjustment or on schedule improvements.

For academic, ESA class and step placement are determined based on schedule B placement from the preceding Spring semester or initial hire paperwork. Extra Service Assignments (ESA) academic assignments are not subject to retroactive salary improvements typically applied to the other salary schedules in August.

Per Education Code 88003, Professional Experts should be hired on a temporary basis for a specific project. They are expected to have specialized knowledge and to perform duties not found in the classified service. Professional Expert Agreements must be assigned hourly rates as defined on the attached salary schedules. Professional Expert Agreements also are not subject to retroactive salary improvements typically applied to the other salary schedules in August.

**STATUS:**  
Improving the Extra Service Assignment (ESA) salary schedule and reaffirming the Professional Expert Agreement (PEX) rates at this time will allow the entry of assignments for fiscal year 2023-24 to begin sooner.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the attached 2023-24 salary schedules for Extra Service Assignment (ESA) and Professional Expert Agreement (PEX) assignments.

**ACTION**  
**INFORMATION**  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
The Los Rios College Federation of Teachers (LRCFT) collective bargaining agreement, Appendix A, calls for the improvement of stipend amounts at the rate of the continuing salary schedule improvements.

**STATUS:**  
It was discovered during our recent negotiations with LRCFT, faculty stipends were not improved as specified in Appendix A of the LRCFT collective bargaining agreement. The stipend salary schedules impacted are specified below and are being presented to the Board for consideration and approval. Subsequent to approval, the affected employees will be paid a retroactive payment for the stipends paid during Fiscal Years 2022 and 2023 at the rate of 5.09% and 4.0%, respectively. The compounded amount of the improvement for both years equates to a 9.29% improvement to the stipend amount currently paid.

1. Department Chair Stipends  
2. Athletic Stipends  
3. Performing Arts Stipends  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the attached 2021-22 and 2022-23 salary schedules for faculty stipends.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** June 14, 2023

**SUBJECT:** LRCFT Collective Bargaining Agreement 2023-2026 Public Disclosure and Approval  
**ATTACHMENT:** None  
**ENCLOSURE:** Yes  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Collective Bargaining Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
Per Section 3547.5 of the Government Code, prior to entering into a written agreement with an exclusive representative covering matters within the scope of representation, all public school employers are required to disclose the major provisions of the agreement, including but not limited to, the costs associated with the agreement. Although the State Chancellor’s Office has stated community colleges are not covered by this statute, we are required to disclose similar information to the State Chancellor’s Office on certain financial reports. Given the significance of these agreements, public disclosure, even if not specifically required, is still appropriate and prudent.

In Spring 2023, the Los Rios College Federation of Teachers (LRCFT) and district representatives initiated negotiations to discuss the establishment of a new collective bargaining contract for the next three year period (2023-26). Negotiations were conducted in accordance with applicable law, including Government Code 3547, regulations of the Public Employment Relations Board, and Los Rios Board policies and administrative regulations.

The District has reached a tentative agreement with LRCFT for the contract effective July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2026. Throughout the agreement, references to dates have been updated as well as clarification to language when necessary. In addition, provisions from memorandums of understanding (MOUs) agreed to during the 2020-2023 contract term have been incorporated. A summary of the major provisions of the agreement, including estimated costs to implement, where applicable, is as follows (where no cost is identified, the provision is either cost neutral or of minimal impact):

**Article 2: Salaries**  
Two hundred and fifty dollars will be added between each step of steps 16-25 in all classes on the A-164 schedule, which will also be prorated to the A-174 and all B schedules. Estimated cost is $1.2 million.  

**Article 2.2 Stipends and Department Chair Reassigned Time**  
Establish a pilot program where Department Chair reassigned time is applied to regular load and stipends will no longer be paid.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT
**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** June 14, 2023

**SUBJECT:** Resolution No. 2023-10: Five Year Capital Outlay Plan  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** Five Year Plan  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  
**CONSENT/ROUTINE**  
**FIRST READING**  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION** X  
**INFORMATION**  

---

### BACKGROUND:
The State Chancellor’s Office has a prescribed capital outlay process and calendar for requesting State funds for capital outlay projects. Each year the District must file a Five Year Capital Outlay Plan which lists all proposed projects, whether State funded or not. Final Project Proposals (FPPs), which are prepared to request State funding for projects listed in the Five Year Capital Outlay Plan, are also to be submitted with the Five Year Capital Outlay Plan each year. This information is due to the State Chancellor’s Office by July 3, 2023.

Although a district may qualify for State funding, all districts are competing with each other for the limited funds available. Facility capacity/load ratios (enrollment growth) and local contribution of funds are key elements in the State’s prioritization of funding capital projects.

### STATUS:
In November 2016 Proposition 51 was passed authorizing $7 billion in general obligation bonds from the State. These funds are approaching full expenditure and have resulted in the construction of multiple facilities around the District. In February 2020 the State was unsuccessful in passing a new bond measure leaving the capital outlay process in an unfunded status. Regardless of the State’s capital outlay status, the District continues to participate in the capital outlay process in the hopes that future bond measures will be passed allowing participation to resume. Additionally, due to the failure of the District’s local bond measure in 2020 and the requirement of a local contribution to obtain State funding, there will be no FPP’s submitted this year. The plan does, however, anticipate a future State and local bond and the timing of projects so that these funds can be combined and maximized.

This is a second reading of the draft Five Year Capital Outlay Plan that the Board is being asked to approve. The attached executive summary describes the Five Year Capital Outlay Plan. A first reading of the draft plan was presented at the May Board meeting and is included as an enclosure to the agenda.

### RECOMMENDATION:
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the Five Year Capital Outlay Plan and supporting Resolution No. 2023-10 for submission to the State.

**State Five Year Construction Plan:**

The basic intent and purpose of the Plan is to analyze enrollment forecasts and determine the amount and type of spaces that will be needed to meet increases changes in enrollment and changes in the educational program. The Plan is used to determine overall estimated costs and identify possible funding sources.

The major components of the Plan are: forecasted student load (enrollment/WSCH), facilities capacity to handle load, proposed new space, proposed modernizations and possible funding sources. The first three components are compiled into “capacity/load ratios”. Capacity/load ratios represent, as a percentage, the facilities capacity to handle forecasted student load (or demand). These capacity/load ratios are the primary tool used by the State to determine which projects will be approved. Also, the State has a priority system which causes districts to compete against each other to offer the State the least cost alternative. Because of this, most projects have a local contribution indicated. The local contribution is intended to make our projects more competitive for limited State funding.

This year’s State Five Year Capital Outlay Plan lists 43 projects, comprised mainly of modernization projects.

**Possible Sequencing of State Funded Projects**

In November 2016, the voters passed Proposition 51 authorizing $7 billion in general obligation bonds for new construction and modernization of K–12 public school facilities; charter schools and vocational education facilities; and $2 billion for California Community Colleges facilities. This influx of bond dollars allowed for a significant amount of FPPs to be funded. Proposition 51 currently contributes funding to several District projects in process.

However, due to no further State or local bond funds being available, there will be no FPP’s submitted this year.

### BACKGROUND:
In 2021, SB169 created the Higher Education Student Housing Grant Program (HESHGP). This program commits $4 billion from the General Fund over three years to affordable student housing projects for California Community College (CCC) District, University of California and California State University institutions. $2.2 billion is for student housing planning and construction grants, of which 50% is committed to CCC projects. The remaining $1.8 billion is committed to a revolving loan fund for future student housing projects. The purpose of the planning and construction grants is to provide affordable, low-cost housing, which must first be offered to low-income students. It is the intent of the HESHGP to provide 100% of necessary funding for the planning and construction of student housing with no local district match required. In October 2021, Los Rios CCD submitted planning grant requests for all of its four colleges and in March 2022, Los Rios CCD received $440,000 in grant funding ($110,000/college).

### STATUS:
Since the FY2022-23 planning grant awards, the State Chancellor’s Office (SCO) has been designated the administrative agency of HESHGP funds for CCC student housing projects. In October of 2022, the SCO published a detailed application process CCC’s must follow in order to apply for available funds. This process allows for one grant application per college district per funding year resulting in Los Rios CCD having to prioritize its future applications. Based on student surveys conducted in the fall of 2022 at each of our four colleges, American River College was identified as having a high need for low-income student housing. For FY2024-25 HESHGP funding, board-approved applications must be submitted to the SCO no later than July 3, 2023. The application requests $48,136,000 to design and construct a 50,040 ft² housing facility with 272 student beds.

### RECOMMENDATION:
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve Los Rios Community College District’s HESHGP construction grant application for American River College.

**ACTION** X  
**INFORMATION**  

**BACKGROUND:**  
The State of California is statutorily required to enact a State Budget by June 30th. Similarly, the Board of Trustees is required by law to adopt a tentative budget for the upcoming fiscal year no later than July 1st for all district funds.

Despite increased economic uncertainties surrounding highly publicized tech sector layoffs and a banking crisis that saw three of the four largest bank failures in U.S. history in March and April 2023, the U.S. and California economies have been continued deceleration of inflation and steady, though slowing, job growth within a tight labor market. U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2023, buoyed by strong consumption as American consumers have remained resilient. Having recovered all the jobs lost during the COVID-19 Pandemic, both the U.S. and California economies are now firmly in the post-pandemic and subsequent recovery period.

As the state dictates to a significant extent the manner of how funds are earned and expended, our District’s budget is almost entirely contingent upon the adoption of the State Budget Act. While uncertainty and risks to the U.S. and California economies have increased since the Governor’s Budget was proposed, the state’s economic outlook is only modestly downgraded, due largely to actual economic data coming in slightly lower than projected and tighter monetary conditions from more cautious lending in the banking sector. At the same time, tax receipts continue to come in substantially lower than projected at the Governor’s Budget. Personal income tax and corporation tax receipts are down around $9 billion cumulatively in the first ten months of the 2022-23 fiscal year. However, it is important to note, cash results outside of personal income tax withholding are distorted by tax deadlines shifting to October as well as the impact of the Pass-Through Entity (PTE) Elective Tax on personal income tax payments.

The multi-year Roadmap between the Administration and the California Community College (CCC) system, introduced in the 2022-23 budget, continues to shape the Administration’s revised budget. The roadmap is aimed at advancing equity, student success, and the system’s ability to prepare students for California’s future. The proposed budget provides funding for a COLA, targets one-time

funds for enrollment and retention efforts, and allows districts more flexibility in the use of funds in pursuit of the roadmap’s goals.

The May Revision proposes additional ongoing resources of approximately $746 million to California Community Colleges appropriations and categorical programs. Revised proposals for ongoing spending include $678 million for an 8.22% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for community college apportionments. The proposal also includes $95.5 million for COLAs and adjustments to certain categorical programs.

The revised budget proposal reflects continuing concern about enrollment declines across the community colleges, providing $100 million one-time to continue supporting college efforts and focused strategies to increase student retention rates and enrollment (a decline from the $200 million proposed in the Governor’s Budget in January). The May Revision proposes to decrease the one-time funds provided in the 2022 Budget Act for the COVID-19 Recovery Block Grant, reducing the funding by $345 million (from $650 million down to $305 million). The administration also is proposing to reduce the deferred maintenance and instructional equipment by $452 million (from $840 million down to $388 million). These decreases are rare for the state but preserve the ability to use deferrals in future budget years.

As stated earlier, the District’s tentative budget is based on the May Revise. Changes resulting from the Enacted budget will be incorporated into the Adopted Budget in September.

STATUS:
The District budget process uses three potential revenue assumptions. The revenue assumptions have a base level expenditure plan (X budget), at which the District operates. The Y and Z budgets are improved based upon projections. The District has authority to operate at the Z budget level. For 2023-24, all three budgets will assume at least full restoration of FTES from the 2019-20 fiscal year. The current trend we are witnessing from daily year-over-year tracking is a full restoration, with the possibility of growth of a few percentage points over our pre-pandemic FTES benchmark.

The 2023-24 tentative budget is balanced. There is no draw on reserves projected nor reliance on one-time funds to support on-going costs at this time. The variations in the X, Y and Z budgets are captured in the appropriation area entitled Program and Salary Improvement and the three budgets are summarized on the attached General Fund schedule. The District will start the year operating at the X budget level.

RECOMMENDATION:
It is recommended that the Governing Board adopt the 2023-24 tentative budgets for the General Fund (Z budget), Instructionally-Related Sub-Fund, Special Revenue, Capital Projects, Debt Service, Enterprise, Internal Service, Fiduciary, Trust and Auxiliary Funds of the District for filing with the appropriate County/State agencies.
