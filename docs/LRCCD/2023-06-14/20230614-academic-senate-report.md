**District Academic Senate (DAS) President, Alisa Shubb, Reports:**

- The DAS recommended a PREP Counselor/Coordinator critical hire position be taken “off the top” of the Fall 2023 district allocations for tenure-track faculty hires. This recommendation has been presented to the Colleges Presidents for consideration.
- DAS approved revisions to R-3412 (Participatory Governance/Academic Senate). We will request these revisions be considered at the next Chancellor’s Cabinet meeting.
- DAS initiated a faculty-weighted SID Project Enhancement Workgroup. The purpose of this workgroup is to review and refine the purpose, scope of work and implementation plan for expanding paid internships across the district, including roles and responsibilities, tools and resources, communication strategies, and workflow while meeting LAEP grant requirements. This group will be co-chaired by DAS President Alisa Shubb and AVCI Tammy Montgomery. Specific tasks of this group include:
  - Review and refine the job description and reporting structure for the Sector Internship Developers
  - Develop consistent branding for internship opportunities
  - Develop a process for communicating outreach efforts, including an exploration of Hubspot and Handshake
  - Develop a training plan for new staff
  - Develop a communication plan for each college
  - Consider models for identifying gaps/areas of need for employer recruitment
  - Review and adhere to LAEP grant requirements
- DAS reviewed the Non-credit Exploration Task Force Report & Recommendations and requested addition development of the report related to the group's charge. We plan to continue reviewing a revised report from the work group in the Fall.
- DAS adopted a resolution to prioritize Ethnic Studies hires in the regular Fall 2023 hiring prioritization process (full text of resolution included at end of this document).
- DAS discussed the state of district-level collegial consultation and produced the draft report for Spring 2023 (included at the end of this document).
- DAS is planning a Fall retreat focused on getting to know each other and deepening our commitment to collegial consultation & collaboration. Please save the date: **Friday August 25 from 3-6pm** - and be on the lookout for individual invitations for our esteemed Trustees.

![Resolution to Prioritize Ethnic Studies Hires in the Los Rios District](https://example.com/image-url)

**Resolution to Prioritize Ethnic Studies Hires in the Los Rios District**  
**Passed by District Academic Senate 5/16/23**

Whereas, Title 5, Section 55063 Minimum Requirements for the Associate Degree Subsection (3) lists satisfactory completion of a transfer-level course (minimum of three semester units or four quarter units) in ethnic studies as a graduation requirement; and the new CalGETC requirements include one three semester units or four quarter units in ethnic studies; and

Whereas, the Los Rios Community College District serves approximately 80,000 students and despite the recent downward trend in enrollment, we are finding a higher demand for Ethnic Studies courses that satisfy Title 5 graduation requirements while serving as CSU Area F and UC IGETC 7 approved transfer courses; and

Whereas, the Los Rios District Ethnic Studies Faculty Council, understands that student need for additional course sections is outpacing the number of faculty currently teaching these course sections and Adjunct Ethnic Studies faculty are difficult to find because of the high demand in this field and the large number of full time hires throughout the state within this last year alone; and

Whereas, full time Ethnic Studies faculty have expressed a desire to teach dual enrollment courses and in the Prison Reentry and Education Program (PREP) but are currently unable to do so due to the overwhelming demand for our courses. This demand already compels us to offer additional sections each semester as well as during the summer. In short, student demand for Ethnic Studies exceeds our regular course load taught at our colleges; and

Whereas that to better serve our student’s needs across the District, four (4) additional full-time Ethnic Studies faculty members, one at each of our sister colleges, would increase our ability to offer culturally relevant and anti-racist curricula; and to sustain, support and retain faculty of color in Ethnic Studies and to have robust, competitive, comprehensive and equitable Ethnic Studies Programs.

Resolved that the Los Rios District Ethnic Studies Faculty Council urges our local college Academic Senates to recommend Ethnic Studies tenure-track professor positions receive the highest support possible during the Fall 2023 faculty hiring prioritization process.  
And Resolved, and the Los Rios District Academic Senate urge our local college Academic Senates to give all due consideration to the whereas statements in this resolution during the Fall 2023 faculty hiring prioritization process.
