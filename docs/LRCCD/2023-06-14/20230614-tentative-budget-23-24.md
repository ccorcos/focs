**Chancellor’s Message**

In many ways, the 2023-24 California state budget is the first in the new, “post-pandemic” era. The state’s fiscal health is in flux, leaving forecasters and economists with a somewhat mixed bag of positive and negative indicators. This balance is reflected in the state budget, which includes both optimistic and pessimistic signs of the state’s economy in the year ahead.

The headline in this year’s budget is undoubtedly the 8.22% Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA). This is a significantly large COLA, one of the largest in recent California history. Typically, COLAs are particularly noteworthy in that they represent an increase to ongoing resources, not the one-time funds we have become used to for the past several years.

This year, however, the opposite is true. The COLA, an ongoing commitment from the state, is funded in part using one-time funds. By any responsible standard, this is not best practice from a budgeting perspective. In fact, Los Rios has built its strong fiscal reputation in part by never using one-time funds to pay for ongoing expenses. The state budgeting process, however, is more complicated than a local district’s and must account for many economic, policy and political factors.

State experts have defined the use of one-time funds to pay for the COLA by noting the economic forecast in the coming years may not include a severe recession, and the state has ample reserves to cover any shortfalls if it were to come to that.

Another atypical element of this year’s state budget has to do with one-time funded state categorical programs. In a typical year, the state provides one-time funds for districts to implement a particular program or initiative. Last year, for example, the state provided funds to assist with recruitment and retention efforts as community colleges all over the state worked hard to recapture enrollment lost during the pandemic.

This year, however, the state is taking the unprecedented move to make cuts to programs funded with one-time resources from previous budget years. Since these funds are already allocated, the clawing back of those resources amounts to a significant budget cut, even while they are providing new one-time resources with similar programmatic focuses.

And so, this year’s Los Rios budget is among the most unique in our district’s history, as we navigate an underfunded state COLA and concurrent cuts and new allocations to categorical programs.

But despite all of this uncertainty, Los Rios’ fiscal health is not in doubt. Los Rios has a healthy reserve, thanks to the budget leadership of our Board of Trustees and collaborative partnerships with our collective bargaining partners. Our overall fiscal health, combined with growing optimism about student enrollment, offset concerns about the methodology behind the state budget. If enrollment trends continue at this pace, we will have completely restored enrollment to pre-pandemic levels well ahead of our five-year target.

And even with questions about the budget policies that underpinned the decision to provide a large COLA without an ongoing funding source, it represents an ongoing commitment of resources from the state and Los Rios is budgeting accordingly. As always, our employee compensation model (“Bucket System”) serves us well in the face of unique budgetary circumstances, allowing us to appropriately and fairly distribute new resources to our employee groups.

Los Rios has a long tradition of responsible budget stewardship, led by our Board Trustees’ commitment to conscientious leadership and bolstered by strong and transparent relationships with our labor partners. Together, we have a shared interest in leveraging all available funding to serving as many students as possible as well as possible, while at the same time ensuring that our budget is built on a sustainable and secure foundation.

I am incredibly proud of the resiliency and creativity of our students, faculty, and staff over the past year. Together, we have weathered extraordinary times and are prepared to rebuild our colleges stronger than ever before.

# Executive Summary

## INTRODUCTION

The Los Rios Community College District is a two-year public college district that serves the greater Sacramento region totaling over two million residents. Los Rios comprises four separately accredited colleges: American River, Cosumnes River, Folsom Lake and Sacramento City serving students at their main campuses as well as education centers in Davis, Elk Grove, Natomas, Placerville, Rancho Cordova and West Sacramento. The colleges offer AA/AS degrees, certificates and transfer education opportunities. The District's 2,400 square mile service area includes Sacramento County, most of El Dorado County and parts of Yolo, Placer and Solano counties. Over 65,000 students enroll in our colleges during our primary terms.

The District’s annual budget is an important element in communicating to the District’s constituents and one of the most significant responsibilities and requirements for a community college district. The budget outlines the utilization of available financial resources and serves as a planning document for the year.

The budget process for the upcoming fiscal year begins in January with the release of the Governor’s proposed budget. The January proposal reflects the Governor's goals and objectives for the coming year and highlights significant issues, policies, and initiatives of the Administration.

For community colleges, the January proposal similarly reflects the Governor’s vision for the system by linking funding to initiatives that are a priority for the Governor shaped by input from the Board of Governors’ annual budget request.

At the May Revise, the Governor updates his initial proposal to reflect changes in projected revenues. Appropriations may change as the result of dialog with the State’s legislative bodies and constituent groups following the January proposal. With the issuance of the May Revise, the legislature begins its final budget process which, by law, requires a budget by June 15th for the Governor to sign by June 30th.

As the state dictates to a significant extent the manner of how funds are earned and expended, a district’s budget is almost entirely contingent upon the adoption of the State Budget Act.

## STATE BUDGET OVERVIEW

### ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS

Despite increased economic uncertainties surrounding highly publicized tech sector layoffs and a banking crisis that saw three of the four largest bank failures in U.S. history in March and April 2023, the U.S. and California economies have seen continued deceleration of inflation and steady though slowing job growth within a tight labor market. U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 1.1 percent in the first quarter of 2023, buoyed by strong consumption as American consumers have remained resilient. Having recovered all the jobs lost during the COVID-19 Pandemic, both the U.S. and California economies are now firmly in the post-pandemic and subsequent recovery period.
<!-- Page 5 -->
![Executive Summary](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Executive+Summary)

**REVENUE PROJECTIONS**  
While uncertainty and risks to the U.S. and California economies have increased since the Governor’s Budget was proposed, the state’s economic outlook is only modestly downgraded, due largely to actual economic data coming in slightly lower than projected and tighter monetary conditions from more cautious lending in the banking sector. At the same time, tax receipts continue to come in substantially lower than projected at the Governor’s Budget. Personal income tax and corporation tax receipts are down around $9 billion cumulatively in the first ten months of the 2022-23 fiscal year. However, it is important to note, cash results outside of personal income tax withholding are distorted by tax deadlines shifting to October as well as the impact of the Pass-Through Entity (PTE) Elective Tax on personal income tax payments.

**PROPOSITION 98 PROJECTIONS**  
The Guarantee continues to be in Test 1 for 2021-22, 2022-23, and 2023-24. To accommodate enrollment increases related to the expansion of transitional kindergarten, the Governor’s Budget proposed rebenching the Test 1 percentage to increase the percentage of General Fund revenues due to the Guarantee, from 38.3 percent to approximately 38.6 percent. The May Revision updates the increased Test 1 percentage from approximately 38.6 percent to approximately 38.5 percent to reflect revised estimates of enrollment increases related to the expansion of transitional kindergarten. The decrease in revenues projected for fiscal years 2021-22, 2022-23, and 2023-24 results in a corresponding decrease in resources for K-14 schools. Proposition 98 is estimated to be $110.6 billion in 2021-22, $106.8 billion in 2022-23, and $106.8 billion in 2023-24, representing a three-year decrease in the minimum Guarantee of $2 billion below the level estimated in the Governor’s Budget.

**CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES PROPOSALS**  
The multi-year Roadmap introduced in the 2022-23 budget continues to shape the Administration’s revised budget, aimed at advancing equity, student success, and the system’s ability to prepare students for California’s future. The roadmap builds on existing efforts toward achieving the Vision for Success goals. The proposed budget provides funding for a COLA, targets one-time funds for enrollment and retention efforts, and allows districts more flexibility in the use of funds in pursuit of the roadmap’s goals.  
The revised proposal includes $26.4 million ongoing to fund 0.5% enrollment growth and $678 million ongoing to support an 8.22% COLA for apportionments, the same COLA proposed for K-12. Another $95.5 million ongoing would support a COLA of 8.22% for selected categorical programs and the Adult Education program.  
The revised budget proposal reflects continuing concern about enrollment declines across the community colleges, providing $100 million one-time to continue supporting college efforts and focused strategies to increase student retention rates and enrollment (a decline from the $200 million proposed in the Governor’s Budget in January).  
The May Revision proposes to decrease the one-time funds provided in the 2022 Budget Act for the COVID-19 Recovery Block Grant, reducing the funding by $345 million (from $650 million down to $305 million). The administration also is proposing to reduce the deferred maintenance and instructional equipment by $452 million (from $840 million down to $388 million). These decreases are rare for the state, but preserve the ability to use deferrals in future budget years.

**REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS**

**X, Y, Z Budgets**  
The District budget process uses three potential revenue assumptions. The revenue assumptions have a base level expenditure plan (X budget), at which the District operates. The Y and Z budgets are improved based upon updated projections throughout. The District budgets at the Z budget level.

For 2023-24, all three budgets assume at least a full restoration of FTES from the 2019-20 fiscal year. The current trend we are witnessing from daily year-over-year tracking is a full restoration, with the possibility of growth of a few percentage points over our pre-pandemic FTES benchmark. In light of this, the X budget assumes only a full restoration of FTES, as this is our most conservative budget estimate. The Y budget assumes a 2% restoration in addition to restoring from the pandemic decline, and the Z budget assumes an additional 2% restoration of FTES served over the Y level (a 4% increase over the X budget).

# Historical Overview

The Los Rios Community College District was formed in 1965, 57 years ago, as a result of the consolidation of ten separate K-12 “feeder” districts. At the time of its organization, the District consisted of two colleges: Sacramento City College and American River College. In 1970, the California Community College Board of Governors (BOG) and California Post-Secondary Educational Commission (CPEC) approved the creation of Cosumnes River College serving the southern portion of the District. In February 2004, Folsom Lake College achieved college status.

In 2015-16, Folsom Lake College’s Rancho Cordova Educational Center was approved by the Board of Governors. With that approval, the District achieved the completion of its plan for educating a region. There are now six official centers: Folsom Lake College’s El Dorado and Rancho Cordova Centers, American River College’s Natomas Center, and Sacramento City College’s Davis and West Sacramento Centers, Cosumnes River College’s Elk Grove Center. In addition, American River College operates the Sacramento Regional Public Safety Training Center (SRPTC). Although not an official center, the SRPTC offers basic academy and in-service training in law enforcement, fire, and other public safety areas. The District’s facility master plans include future expansion of its centers.

The District served over 67,000 students in fall 2022. Based upon enrollment, the District is the second largest community college system in California and one of the largest in the nation.

Covering nearly 2,440 square miles, the District operates in five contiguous counties including Sacramento County, El Dorado County, Placer County, Yolo County, and Solano County. It encompasses the Cities of Sacramento, Elk Grove, Davis, Folsom, West Sacramento, Rancho Cordova, Citrus Heights, and various other Sacramento County municipalities.

Enrollment growth has declined in the State. The District’s facility plans were based upon projected growth well in excess of 100,000 students. For example, in 2008 the CCCCO projected Los Rios’s enrollment for the fall 2017 term would exceed 127,000 students, which is 60,000 more students than we currently service. Significantly lower projections means deferring facility projects planned to meet the much higher projections. That is somewhat fortunate given the current lack of State funding to support facility projects. Since 2002, the District’s facility program has added or modernized over 2.5 million square feet. The program is also replacing and updating infrastructure to ensure the District is ready for the next fifty years.

In recent years, the District has undergone a great deal of change. We have experienced shifts in economics, demographics, substantive business process modifications, and changes in ways we deliver educational programming. In light of all this, the Los Rios Community College District is proud of its past and very optimistic about its future.

# Values, Vision, Mission and Goals

During the 2021-2022 academic year, members of the Chancellor’s Cabinet, which includes leadership representatives from all constituency groups in Los Rios, voted to reaffirm the five strategic goal areas from our 2015-2016 Strategic Plan. Following the reaffirmation and during the 2023-24 academic year, faculty staff and students at each college reviewed and updated the college’s strategies for each goal area. Additionally, the District Research Council with representatives from each college, came together to develop measurable metrics (Indicators of Achievement) for each goal area. For the current plan, which guides the District through 2026-27, the planning process involved looking at where we are and where we want to be as a community college district. The 2026-27 Strategic Plan provides a thoughtful vision of the future of Los Rios. The vision centers on promoting student access and equitable achievement through several initiatives that will be measured toward specific goals for improvements.

## CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES’ MISSION

The mission of the California Community Colleges is to provide high quality, lower division instruction for students who wish to obtain associate degrees, transfer to a baccalaureate institution, or prepare for an occupation as well as the provision of remedial English as a Second Language (ESL) and literacy instruction to all who require those services.

Primary missions of the colleges are to offer academic and vocational education at the lower division level for recent high school graduates and those returning to school; and to advance California’s economic growth and global competitiveness through education, training, and services that contribute to continuous workforce improvement. Essential functions of the colleges include: developmental instruction, English as a second language, adult noncredit instruction, and providing support services that help students to succeed. Fee-based Community Service education is designated as an authorized function.

By law, California Community Colleges are required to admit any resident with a high school diploma or equivalent and may admit anyone who is capable of benefiting from the instruction offered.

## LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT VISION

Like all plans, a vision builds upon past successes, but it does much more. The Los Rios Community College District coordinates our district and college planning activities by establishing a flexible framework of goals and directions to support innovative planning at each college and unit within the District. The mission and vision for the District are as follows:

### MISSION STATEMENT

The Los Rios Colleges provide a vibrant learning environment that empowers all students to achieve their educational and career goals.

### VISION STATEMENT

To transform the lives of students and enhance the vitality of our region. In order to achieve its mission, the District has identified and embraced five strategic goals which serve as the guidelines that our colleges, centers, and offices will use in developing their own strategies for achieving our vision.

Primary responsibilities include developing policies to administer the District to oversee budgetary decisions. Board positions are assigned to a specific area of the District and trustees are elected by constituents within the local trustee boundary. Members are elected to alternating four year terms and are not subject to term limits.

The Los Rios Board of Trustees meets on a monthly basis. Business meetings are conducted the second Wednesday of each month generally in the District Office Board Room located at 1919 Spanos Court, Sacramento, California. Citizens are welcome to attend these public open meetings.

On February 1, 2013, Brian King, Ed.D., became Chancellor of the Los Rios Community College District. Dr. King, who previously served as the President/Superintendent of Cabrillo College in Santa Cruz County, was selected from a nationwide search and is known, among other accomplishments, for building collaborative relationships with K-12 and higher education partners. The budget is a reflection of the budget priorities set in place under Dr. King’s leadership.

As Chancellor, Dr. King’s primary responsibilities include overseeing the educational and financial programs of the District to ensure compliance with Board adopted policies and State laws and requirements. To this end, he oversees over 2,700 certificated and 2,100 classified full-and part-time employees.

# Summary of District Funds

## FUND ACCOUNTING
California’s community colleges utilize governmental accounting and operate on a uniform fund structure. A fund is a self balancing set of accounts recording cash and other financial resources, together with all related liabilities and residual equities or balances, and changes therein. Funds are segregated for the purpose of carrying on specific activities or obtaining certain objectives in accordance with special regulations, restrictions or limitations. Generally, funds are established to account for revenues and expenditures with common purposes and activities.

In addition to using the governmental fund accounting approach, the Los Rios Community College District, as specified by the California Community College Chancellor’s Office, uses the Business Type Activity (BTA) model for financial statement reporting. The BTA model is defined in the Governmental Accounting Standard Board’s (GASB) Statement No. 35.

The District’s financial statement reporting is on a full accrual basis. However, certain types of financial reporting, such as depreciation of fixed assets, are reported only in the enterprise funds for the fund statements in this presentation. All other funds are presented using the modified accrual basis. In 2023-24, the District will utilize the following funds to account for its various programs, revenues and expenditures:

- **General Fund**: The primary operating fund of the District. It is used to account for the basic educational programs and ordinary operations of the District including instruction, student services, administration, and maintenance and operations. Restricted programs for similar activities are also recorded in the general fund as they are instructionally-related activities, a sub-fund of the General Fund used to account for local revenues and expenditures generated in support of co-curricular activities.

- **Child Development Fund**: Utilized to operate the District’s preschool programs, primarily funded by State and Federal contracts and entitlements as well as parent fees.

- **Capital Projects Fund**: Utilized to account for the acquisition and/or construction of major capital facilities in the District and significant capital equipment purchases as well as scheduled maintenance and special repairs projects.

- **Bond Projects Fund**: Utilized to account for revenues and expenditures for the District’s Measure M General Obligation Bond Program. Revenues include bond proceeds as well as interest derived from those proceeds before expended. Expenditures are for capital improvements identified in the ballot measures.

- **Debt Service Fund**: Utilized to account for the accumulation of resources for the payment of general long-term debt.

- **Bond Interest and Redemption Fund**: Utilized to account for the receipt and expenditure of property taxes levied for the payment of principal and interest for outstanding general obligation bonds of the District.

- **Internal Service Fund**: Utilized to account for the District’s self-insured program, including workers’ compensation, dental, property and liability.

# Summary of District Funds

**Financial Aid Fund:** Utilized to account for Federal and State financial aid programs for students.

**Fiduciary/Student Association Fund:** The Student Association Fund is utilized to account for monies held in trust by the District for organized Student Body Associations (excluding clubs) established pursuant to Education Code §76060. In a multi-college district such as Los Rios, the fund may be established for each college’s student body.

**Foundation Fund:** Utilized to account for the activities of the District’s 501(c)(3) IRS recognized Foundations, for which the District is the accounting/fiscal agent for the organization.

**Scholarship and Loan Fund:** Utilized to account for such gifts, donations, bequests and devices to be used for scholarships or for grants and aid or loans to students. The scholarship and loan fund excludes categorical governmental monies and their required matches, which are recorded in the financial aid fund as Los Rios, the fund may be established for each college’s student body.

**Retiree Benefits Fund:** Utilized to account for monies that have been set-aside for future STRS and PERS increases.

**Notes:**
**Other Post Employment Benefit Trust:** Not contained herein but noted, the District has established an irrevocable trust for assets designated for the provision of health benefits for retirees of the District. Per Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the assets of an irrevocable trust are not reported in the sponsoring entity’s financial statements.

**SIGNIFICANT BUDGET AND FINANCIAL POLICIES**  
The following are some of the significant budget and financial policies that govern the development of the District’s budget. For certain items, additional detail is provided in other parts of the narrative.

**Primary revenue source:** The District's budget is primarily dependent upon the funding provided to it via the annual budget of the State of California. Although property taxes and enrollment fees are part of the District’s total revenue, the District has no control over the level of those revenues. Except for special assessments, such as a general obligation bond tax, property tax assessments are regulated by Proposition 13 passed in 1978. The level of enrollment fees is established by the State. The State-established revenue level for the District considers that property taxes and enrollment fees will offset their commitment and therefore the District does not retain any taxes or fees. Rather, State apportionment is netted against those two sources. However, if either property taxes or enrollment fee receipts are below projections in the State budget, the State does not backfill with additional apportionment unless special legislation is enacted.

# Summary of District Funds

**Growth funding:** Another aspect of the limitations placed on the District’s ability to project and plan for more than one budget year is how the State determines and then funds student growth. Districts are not entitled to funding based upon the actual growth achieved but on a complex formula that limits based upon available resources.

**Designation of nature of funding sources as continuing or one-time-only (OTO) in nature:** An important element in the development of the budget is the distinction between whether a source of funding will be provided on an on-going basis (continuing) or whether it is a one-time source. The District is careful in determining the nature of the source to ensure a match of like appropriations to avoid funding an on-going cost without a corresponding resource.

**The Fifty-Percent (50%) Law:** Contained in the Education Code, this law requires that 50% of the current expense of education be for classroom instructional salaries and benefits. Financial penalties may be assessed for districts that fail to meet this requirement. Monitoring commitments of funds is essential to ensure a balance between classroom salaries and benefits and all other operating costs in the development of the budget.

**Full-time Faculty Obligation:** The number of full-time faculty employed by districts is governed by State regulation. Districts are required to maintain full-time faculty positions at an established level that is increased each year by the level of funded growth. As with the 50% law, failure to comply may result in financial penalties and districts must ensure new positions are funded relative to funded growth.

**General Fund Reserves:** The Chancellor’s Office recommends districts maintain at least 5% of projected total unrestricted expenditures and other outgo in general fund unrestricted fund balance. Districts falling below 5% may be subject to fiscal monitoring by the Chancellor’s Office. In addition, District Board Policies require the District maintain a 5% uncommitted contingency reserve. The required amount is based upon total projected unrestricted revenues.

**GANN Appropriations Limitation:** Under the guidelines set forth by Proposition 111, the annual appropriations limit will not exceed a base year adjusted by the change in population of the City or the County combined with either the change in California per capita personal income or the change in the local assessment roll due to local non-residential construction.

**Budget and Accounting Manual (BAM):** This manual issued by the System Office carries the force of regulation and prescribes the fund, account, and activity reporting structure for all districts in the State. Financial information contained in this document is presented in compliance with the budget and accounting manual.

**Student Attendance Accounting Manual (SAAM):** This manual, also issued by the Chancellor’s Office and carrying the force of regulation, provides direction for compliance with Education Code and Title 5 regulations for determining student residency and reporting student attendance. As full-time equivalent students (FTES) is the primary determinant for State funding, compliance with the SAAM is critical to ensure accurate attendance and hence financial reporting. Only resident students of the State of California may be claimed for State funding. Non-resident students must pay tuition to cover the cost of education. The determination of non-resident tuition rates is also governed by State regulation.

# Summary of District Funds

**Collective Bargaining Agreements:** The District has four represented employee groups: faculty (LRCFT), classified support (LRCEA), classified maintenance and police (SEIU), and supervisors (LRSA). In addition, two other groups (management and confidential), though not represented, receive compensation improvements consistent with the formula contained in the contracts of the four represented groups. The compensation formula designates eighty percent (80%) of defined new revenues of the District to fund compensation and other improvements. The other twenty percent (20%) is directed to operational costs. These agreements drive a large portion of the budget development in terms of directing where funds will be committed.

**Instructional Staffing:** The single largest component of the General Fund budget is instructional staffing. The District closely monitors the allocation and use of instructional staffing and sets a productivity goal (students per class) for each college to try to maximize access for our students while keeping a handle on costs.

**Other Staffing:** Counselors are staffed per formula at a ratio of one counselor for every nine hundred students (1:900). The staffing level does not consider any funding source other than general purpose. When all funding sources, including categorical, are considered, the actual ratio has historically been around 1:600. Other faculty and new classified and management positions are not driven by an established formula, but have historically tracked to the District’s growth. Funds are set-aside in the budget process to accommodate new positions as a result of growth.

**Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB)** and other employment-related liabilities of the District: The District provides a fixed monthly amount to eligible retirees toward their healthcare costs and has funded its OPEB obligation since 1986. In 2007-08, the District established the OPEB trust to irrevocable designate assets for funding this benefit. The OPEB trust ended 2021-22 with $143 million in funding, well in excess of the total OPEB liability of $124 million. The total OPEB liability is measured at June 1, 2019, using assumptions of bi-annual increases of 9.0% and annual investment returns of 5%. The bi-annual increase aligns the timing of any benefit improvements with the actuarial results. The annual budget includes a continuing line item to fund the service cost although that contribution could be suspended given the over-funding. However, by continuing to make contributions, the projections indicate that the OPEB trust could withstand a significant market correction and still be fully funded for its OPEB obligation. The District is also fully funded for the vacation liability accrued to its classified and management employees and the liability for paid leave of faculty under a banked leave program.

**Other regulations that govern budget development:** Some line items in the budget are due to legislative mandates. For example, Proposition 20 restricted a certain level of lottery funds to be used only for the purchase of instructional/library materials. Most employees are members of either the State Teachers’ Retirement System (STRS) or the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) and employer contribution rates are established either by statute or through PERS Board action. Sufficient budget must be provided to ensure compliance with recycling laws, emergency preparedness, and other important mandates although no funding is provided by the State to support District efforts.

# Summary of District Funds

**2022-23 REVISED BUDGET & 2023-24 TENTATIVE BUDGET – DISTRICT FUNDS**  
Several funds are utilized to categorize revenues and expenditures designated for specific purposes. Following is a summary of all the District funds with activity in either 2022-23 or 2023-24 followed by schedules for each fund showing planned activity.

**General Fund:** The primary operating fund of the District. General Fund revenues consist of general purpose and restricted. Appropriations cover delivery of the District’s instructional program and student services as well as the administrative support for those programs. More detailed information regarding revenues and appropriations is found in the General Fund Summary and Detail sections of this book.

**Child Development Fund:** Utilized to operate the District’s preschool programs funded primarily by state and federal contracts as well as fees for childcare programs. During 2009-10, Folsom Lake College discontinued its program. The programs at the other three colleges are accounted for in this fund. The operations are expected to be self-sufficient, with revenues covering the expenditures incurred for the operation of the program. However, state reimbursement rates have lagged relative to costs requiring support by the colleges and District.

**Capital Outlay Projects Fund:** Utilized to account for the acquisition and/or construction of major capital facilities in the District as well as much of the District’s expenditures for equipment. Major capital facility acquisitions and improvements appropriated in this fund are not funded from the District’s Bond proceeds, but rather, State Capital Outlay funds. Equipment expenditures are also primarily from the carryover of State allocations for instructional equipment and library materials.

**Bond Project Fund:** The Bond Project Fund accounts for projects funded through the District’s General Obligation Bond Authorization – Measure M ($475 million). Under Measure M, the District issued the fifth series, Series E, for $130 million on June 16, 2021 for a total Measure M issuance of $465 million at June 30, 2023. Interest income on unspent bond proceeds is recorded in this fund. Measure A ($265 million) has been fully issued and expended.

**Bond Interest and Redemption Fund:** Revenues from tax collections and expenditures from debt service payments for the District’s Measure A and Measure M outstanding general obligation bonds are accounted for in this fund. The County Treasurer sets the appropriate tax rate to fund interest payments and principal retirement for the bonds. The projected ending fund balance at June 30, 2023 of $24.4 million and $30.6 million for Measure A and Measure M, respectively, is restricted for future debt service payments.

**Other Debt Service Fund:** Utilized to account for the accumulation of funds for long-term debt. The fund currently is used for recording vacation liability and banked leave for faculty.

# Summary of District Funds

**Internal Service/Self Insurance Fund:** The Self Insurance Fund accounts for the District's property, liability, workers' compensation, and dental programs. The General Fund recognizes the expense for these programs and then transfers the funds as revenue to this fund. Interest generated by the fund is another revenue source. The costs of self insurance claims are accounted for as expenditures. In addition, classified salaries dedicated to overseeing the programs and contracted administrative oversight are charged to the fund. Lastly, reinsurance costs above the self-insurance retention levels are accounted for in the fund.

**Enterprise/Regional Performing Arts (Harris) Center Fund:** In spring 2011, Folsom Lake College opened its Visual and Performing Arts facility which includes an 847 seat community theater. The theater is used both by the college's instructional program and as a venue for professional performances. The revenues and expenses for the operation of the community theater are recorded in this fund. In March 2022, VenueTech Management Group, Inc. was selected to assume management of Harris Center for the Arts day-to-day operations and performance programming. The District is working closely with VenueTech to transition to the new operating structure.

**Fiduciary Fund–Student Associations:** This fund accounts for official Student Association activities in the District. Revenues are from student card sales, student representation fees, various fundraising events, and interest income. Expenditures provide support and materials for the Student Association programs to operate.

**Scholarship and Loan Fund:** This fund accounts for District administered scholarships and loans. Donations are the major source of revenue and scholarships account for most of the expenditures with the exception of some minimal student loans. The funds projected ending balance of $1.5 million for 2022-23 is committed to future scholarship programs and SCC Fine Arts department needs.

**Fiduciary Fund – Foundation:** In 1998, the District converted its independent Foundation to an auxiliary organization of the District. The Los Rios Foundation operates under auxiliary status authorized by §95257 of the California Code of Regulations. By approving this change in status, the District's Foundation is under the approval of the District's Board of Trustees. The Foundation raises money for various activities, including program endowments, campus physical plant improvements, and scholarship support. The Foundation is projected to have an ending balance of $14.6 million on June 30, 2023, which is virtually all committed to college purposes.

# General Fund Financial Data Summary

## REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE CLASSIFICATIONS
For the purpose of reporting revenues and expenditures, uniform major account classifications are required of California community college districts. Following is a summation of the revenue and expenditure reporting classifications:

### Revenue Classifications
A. Base, COLA & Growth (Access)  
B. Federal  
C. State  
D. Local  
E. Other Financing Sources  

### Expenditure Classifications
A. Academic Salaries (1000)  
B. Classified Salaries (2000)  
C. Employee Benefits (3000)  
D. Supplies and Materials (4000)  
E. Other Operating Expenses (5000)  
F. Capital Outlay (6000)  
G. Other Outgo (7000)  
H. Program and Other Improvements  
I. Instructionally-Related Activities  

Using the above classifications, the 2023-24 General Fund budget for the District is summarized as follows:

## UNRESTRICTED REVENUE SUMMARY

### A. Base, COLA & Growth
The District's primary operational revenue is calculated using three factors: the amount funded in the prior year (base), cost of living adjustments applied to the base, and growth funds for serving additional students. The total of these three factors is referred to as "Total Computational Revenue" (TCR) representing nearly 73% of total General Fund revenues and approximately 88% of unrestricted resources. TCR is comprised of the following sources: state general apportionment, state Educational Protection Account (EPA), local property taxes (including revenues from Redevelopment Agencies (RDAs), and student enrollment fees. The Z budget projects nearly $401.6 million will be received from these sources in 2023-24. The Z budget TCR level is $33.3 million higher than the 2022-23's $368.3 million.

### B. Federal Revenues
Unrestricted federal revenue represents a small percentage of the total General Fund revenue. The District's General Fund Federal revenues are for administrative costs for Veteran’s education and are projected at $25,000 for 2023-24.

### C. State Revenues
Unrestricted State revenues account for approximately 7% of the total General Fund budget. These revenues do not include general state apportionment, accounted for in Base, COLA and Growth. Major revenues from the State in this classification are unrestricted lottery funds, apprenticeship, and part-time faculty compensation. Total State revenues projected for 2023-24 are $39.6 million, a small decrease from the 2022-23 final budget.

### D. Local Revenues
Local revenues, excluding enrollment fees, account for approximately 2.0% of the total General Fund budget. Primary sources of local revenue include non-resident and international student tuition, interest income, community services fees, facility rentals, and student fees and fines.

# General Fund Financial Data Summary

These sources along with other miscellaneous local revenue accounts total nearly $12.9 million for 2022-24, no change from the 2022-23 final budget.

## E. Other Financing Sources
Other financing sources represent less than 1% of total General Fund revenue and includes transfers into the General Fund from other District funds. The amount for 2023-24 is $1.4 million.

## F. Restricted Revenues
Restricted revenues are resources available for the operation and support of educational programs that are specifically restricted by laws, regulations, donors, or other outside agencies as to their expenditure. Restricted funds are further categorized by source in terms of Federal, State and Local as well as revenues derived from parking fees and fines and the health service fee.

Parking revenues are restricted solely for the operation, maintenance and expansion of the District’s parking lots.

A significant source of restricted Federal revenue budgeted in 2022-23 is the remaining funding from CARES Act Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF). The performance period for all remaining HEERF funding was extended through June 30, 2023.

Restricted State revenue 2022-23 budget includes the District’s $28.1 million share of the 2022-23 state budget’s one-time funding of the California Community College COVID-19 Recovery Block Grant. The funds are intended to be used on activities that directly support community college students and mitigate learning losses related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Restricted State revenue 2022-23 budget also includes $13.8 million in funding from the Learning-Aligned Employment Program (LAEP). This program offers eligible underrepresented students the opportunity to earn money to help defray their educational costs, while gaining education-aligned, career-related employment.

The $18.1 million Sacramento K16 Collaborative funding, included in restricted State revenue 2022-23 budget, is intended to support regional K-16 education collaboratives that create streamlined pathways from high school to postsecondary education and into the workforce. Los Rios serves as the fiscal agent for this grant, receiving funds from the state and meeting the established requirements to ensure the collaborative remains in compliance.

### APPROPRIATIONS SUMMARY
This section presents summarized information for the General Fund, excluding program and other improvements (X,Y,Z). More detailed information regarding unrestricted appropriations can be found in the General Fund Budget Guidelines and the Information sections.

For all account classifications, the District reserves appropriations for program and other improvements. These improvements including compensation improvements, are tied to the realization of revenues above the X budget. At the end of each fiscal year, a determination is made regarding the net amount of resources available compared to compensation and program cost increases. After accounting for growth costs as well as compensation improvements such as step and class changes and fringe benefit increases, the calculation may result in a retroactive salary payment.

Consistent with the comparability of restricted revenues between the current and budget year, the comparison of appropriations by account classification are affected by the difference in restricted revenues and the XYZ appropriations. The following information is inclusive of both unrestricted and restricted appropriations.

#### A. Academic Salaries
The 1000 series object codes are used to record salary expenditures for employees in academic positions requiring minimum qualifications pursuant to Education Code §87356. At Tentative Budget, $164.7 million is appropriated for academic salaries. This is 35% of the total appropriations.

A consideration in the budget process is the “50% Law” requiring at least 50% of the current expense of education be for salaries and benefits of classroom instructors. The District reported instructional salaries and benefit costs at 53.05% of the total current expense of education for 2021-22. The 2022-23 report, to be filed in October 2023, is projected to be approximately the same.

#### B. Classified Salaries
Classified Salaries reflects appropriations for salaries of employees in positions that do not require minimum qualifications established by the Board of Governors. The 2000 series object codes are used to record classified salaries. 2023-24 appropriations for classified salaries are $107.9 million. This accounts for 23% of the District’s General Fund expenditures.

Employee benefits, object code series 3000, represent all expenditures for the employer’s share of contributions to retirement plans, as well as costs for health and welfare benefits for current employees and their dependents.

The budget projects $132.5 million will be expended on employee benefits in 2023-24, accounting for 28% of the 2023-24 budget. Employee benefits are generally segregated into two primary categories: 1) health and welfare benefits; 2) retirement benefits.

Health and welfare benefits are the District’s health, dental, disability, unemployment, and workers’ compensation programs. The District is self-funded for dental. Except for unemployment and workers’ compensation which are mandated programs, all health and benefit welfare programs are reviewed by the District’s Insurance Review Committee which is comprised of representatives from each employee group. The Committee seeks consensus on recommended changes and enhancements to the benefit programs. This approach provides consistency in the benefit programs for all employees and provides for a large pool for rating purposes.

Each employee group’s compensation formula includes a provision to fund increases in the District’s contribution toward medical and dental premiums. Employees may choose from multiple plans with the District funding the premium cost up to the level of the district contribution as established between the District and their unit. If an employee selects a plan with a premium higher than the district contribution, the difference is paid by the employee. At this time there is no change in health insurance premiums for 2023-24 for the medical plan selected by most employees. The 2022-2023 rates are effective through December 31, 2023.

All employee groups have a term life insurance benefit of $50,000. The total cost of the benefit is $6.75 per employee per month in 2023-24. The initial funding of this benefit was shared between the District and the employee groups.

Retirement (pension) benefits are primarily a function of salary and are for employer contributions to either the State Teachers’ Retirement System (STRS) for academic personnel or the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) for classified personnel. Academic salaries in general are not subject to Social Security. Classified employees are subject to Social Security thereby increasing the percentage of employee benefit costs for classified employees. Both groups are subject to the Medicare portion of Social Security. The District also provides a contribution toward post-retirement health benefits for eligible retired employees. That program is fully funded for past service but requires an annual contribution for active employees.

Following is a summary of the District’s 2023-24 premiums for health and welfare benefits as well as statutory benefits.

# General Fund Financial Data Summary

## Health & Welfare Benefits
- **Health Insurance**: $1,791.93/month (Kaiser HMO)*
- **Dental Insurance**: $128.00/month (projected)
- **Life Insurance**: $6.75/month
- **Long Term Disability**: $0.228/$100 of covered payroll
- **Workers’ Compensation**: 0.49%  
*Reflects the Kaiser HMO premium, the primary health insurance plan selected by employees.

## Statutory Benefits
- **STRS**: 19.10%
- **PERS**: 26.68%
- **Unemployment**: 0.575%
- **OASDI**: 6.20%
- **Medicare**: 1.45%

## D. Supplies and Materials
The Supplies and Materials classification 4000 is used to record all expenditures for instructional and non-instructional supplies and materials, including costs of freight, sales/use tax and handling charges. Supplies and materials are items that are expendable and quickly consumed or easily broken, damaged, or lost. It is currently projected that nearly $8.0 million will be expended in 2023-24 on supplies and materials nearly 2% of the 2023-24 expenditures.

In administering the discretionary budgets, the colleges and departments are allowed to transfer budgets between non-regular salary and non-benefit accounts. Funds originally allocated to supplies and materials may be re-appropriated across object codes. Because of this and the inclusion of carryover funds in 2022-23, comparisons across the two years are difficult.

## E. Other Operating Expenses
Object classification 5000 is used for expenditures for services, leases, rents, travel, and other operating expenses. At tentative, approximately $53.8 million is budgeted, representing 11% of the total General Fund expenditures. Again, because allocations can be moved across operational accounts, comparisons to prior years Other Operating Expenses may be difficult.

## F. Capital Outlay
Capital Outlay is used to record amounts paid for the acquisition of fixed assets or additions to fixed assets including land and site improvements, building purchase, construction or improvement, and equipment. The District uses a minimum value of $5,000 for capital outlay items. At tentative budget, approximately $557,000 million is appropriated for Capital Outlay, which is less than 1% of the total General Fund expenditures. It is anticipated that as departments finalize their budget requests and categorical and carryover funds are appropriated, additional amounts for capital outlay will be budgeted. It is important to note that many of the District’s equipment purchases are recorded in the Capital Outlay projects fund. Therefore, the actual expenditures for assets are greater than what is reflected in the General Fund.

## G. Other Outgo
The Other Outgo classification is used to record other expenses and non-expenditure disbursements, including inter-fund transfers. At tentative budget, it is projected that $4.5 million will be transferred in 2023-24, nearly 1% of the total General Fund expenditures.

## H. Program and Other Improvements
As described earlier, these appropriations are reserved until the end of the fiscal year when revenues can be reasonably determined as well as the related costs.

**I. Instructionally-Related Activities, General Fund sub-fund**  
These funds represent revenues received from local activities, such as gate receipts, as well as the General funds in support of student and instructional programs. These funds are part of the General Fund, but are not included in the above narrative due to the nature and use of the funds.

**2023-24 GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION BY MAJOR ACCOUNT**

- Academic Salaries: 35%
- Classified Salaries: 23%
- Employee Benefits: 28%
- Other Operating Expenses: 11%
- Supplies and Materials: 2%
- Other Outgo: 1%
- Capital Outlay: 0%

# District Reserves – Fund Balances

Fund balances and reserves are often desirable to fund future program commitments, as well as to provide for economic uncertainties. As such, the California Chancellor’s Office has identified a desired reserve in the General Fund for community college districts of at least 5% of expenditures. In addition, Los Rios policies require an uncommitted reserve in the District’s General Fund of at least 5% of revenues. The District’s ending balance meets both State and policy requirements with a projected total unrestricted fund balance, including instructionally related, of 6.5% of expenditures and an uncommitted fund balance (general fund only) of 6.7% of revenues. Outlined below is a summary of all the projected fund balances for the District’s various fund activities:

| **General Fund** | **Instructionally Related Fund** | **Child Development Fund** | **Capital Projects Fund** | **Bond Projects Fund (Measure M)** | **Bond Interest & Redemption Fund (Measures A & M)** | **Other Debt Service Fund** | **Enterprise/ Regional Performing Arts Center Funds** | **Fiduciary/ Student Association Fund** | **Scholarship & Loan Fund** | **Foundation Fund** | **Retiree Benefits Fund** |
|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|

# Fiscal Health Assessment

## Fiscal Health Risk Analysis for Community Colleges

**District:**  
Los Rios Community College District  

**Total Risk Score, All Areas**  
**3.7%***

### Annual Independent Audit Report

1.1 Has the independent audit report for the most recent fiscal year been completed and presented to the board by the statutory timeline of December 31? (Extensions of the timeline granted by the Chancellor’s Office should be explained.)  
**Response:** yes  

1.2 Were the district’s most recent and prior two independent audits reports free of material findings of weakness?  
**Response:** yes  

1.3 Has the district corrected all audit findings from the recent and prior two audits?  
**Response:** n/a  

1.4 Has the district corrected the most recent and prior two years’ audit findings without affecting its fiscal health (e.g., material apportionment or internal control findings)?  
**Response:** n/a  

**Section Score (0.5% maximum):**  
0.0%  

**Self-assessment notes:**  

* The Fiscal Crisis Management Assistance Team (FCMAT) developed the Fiscal Health Risk Analysis as a tool to help evaluate community college's fiscal health and risk of insolvency in the current and two subsequent fiscal years. A score of 40% or more is considered high risk; a score of 25%-39% is considered moderate risk; a score of 24% or lower is considered low risk.

### Budget Development and Adoption

| Question | Response |
|----------|----------|
| 2.1 Does the district develop and use written budget assumptions and multiyear projections that are reasonable, clearly articulated, and aligned with the signed state budget and the Student-Centered Funding Formula (SCFF)? | no |
| 2.2 Does the district use a budget development method other than a prior-year rollover budget, and if so, is there a procedure to evaluate prior year and future expenses (nonfixed expenditures, supplies, adjunct and other hourly positions) and removal of one-time revenues and expenses? | yes |
| 2.3 Does the district use position control data for budget development? | yes |
| 2.4 Does the district coordinate program review as part of the budget development process and include input from faculty/staff, administrators, the governing board, and the budget committee in accordance with a documented planning model? | yes |
| 2.5 Does the budget development process include an explanation of the calculation of the SCFF (base full-time equivalent students [FTES], supplemental low income and student success portioning of the funding) with reasonable assumptions? | yes |
| 2.6 Does the district budget and expend restricted funds as authorized by the funding source before expending unrestricted funds? | yes |
| 2.7 Does the district have a documented policy and/or procedure evaluating the proposed acceptance of grants and other types of restricted funds to assess their congruence with the institution’s strategic plan and the potential multiyear impact on the district’s unrestricted general fund? | yes |
| 2.8 Are expected revenues (not based on actuals) more than or equal to expected expenditures (not based on actuals) in the district’s adopted budget (budget is not dependent on carryover funds to be balanced)? | yes |
