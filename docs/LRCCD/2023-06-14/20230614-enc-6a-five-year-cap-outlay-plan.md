**Explain why this project is needed:**  
The proposed project will construct a new affordable student housing complex on the American River College (ARC) campus. The new student housing complex will have the capacity to house 272 low-income students and will be approximately 37,909 Assignable Square Feet (ASF) / 50,040 Gross Square Feet (GSF). The complex is expected to be located south of campus at the southern end of Stadium Parking at the corner of College Oak Drive and Winding Way. The proposed housing complex is anticipated to include 1 unit – Resident Director Apartment (950-Apartment), 12 units – single occupancy (910-Sleep/Study without Toilet/Bath), and 130 units - double occupancy (910-Sleep/Study without Toilet/Bath). Common areas are to include toilet/bath, along with the following seven (7) ancillary/student support service spaces: package center, laundry room, lounge, shared kitchens, study/tutoring spaces, food pantry and mental health services specifically intended to support the basic needs and academic success of participating low-income students.

**District Priority & Project:** 4 Paramedics Classroom

**Project Type:** Replacement  
**Total Estimated Cost:** $4,011,303

### Explain why this project is needed:
The Paramedic program is currently housed in the former Child Development Center. This facility is scheduled to be demolished as part of a larger future project associated with Davies Hall. In addition to this fact, the current facility fails to meet the needs of this successful CTE program. This project will provide a permanent home for the Paramedic program which will improve the interior usage, access to technology, exterior quality and infrastructure stability. In addition, this project will be located immediately adjacent the Health Education complex which allows students and faculty improved access to departmental services.

**Explain why this project is needed:**  
Modernize Davies Hall by replacing the old Davies Hall with a new building. The new Davies Hall will be the same assignable square footage (ASF) as the old building. The use of Davies Hall will also remain the same, primarily instructional and faculty office. The new Davies Hall will be constructed on an adjacent building pad and upon completion the old building will be demolished. Approaching the project this way eliminates the need for swing space and minimizes the impact to students and faculty increasing the quality of instruction during construction phase.

### Explain why this project is needed:
Modernize the Library by replacing the old outdated and non-code compliant Library with a new modern, aesthetic and equitable Library building. The existing Library has multiple access compliance issues, unstable aged electrical and mechanical infrastructure, technology deficiencies, and inefficient circulation and space configurations which will be resolved by building a new replacement. The new building will house the same uses: Learning Resource, Classroom, Lab and Office spaces in the existing building's current location.

### Explain why this project is needed:
This project will modernize the Rodda Hall North building. The building was constructed in 1975 and has had no major renovations other than small tenant improvements in individual rooms. The existing HVAC, electrical and plumbing systems are old, outdated and energy inefficient. The building consists of modular style which has become uninhabitable and unreparable and contributes to poor acoustics and a depressing interior experience. The entire buildings assignable square footage (ASF) of 61,894 will be modernized and upon completion contain upgraded building systems, ADA accommodations and a student and staff experience matching the instruction delivered. The Facility Condition Index (FCI) for this building is 56.34 indicating a building in poor shape and needing renovation.

**Explain why this project is needed:**  
The entire building is in need of modernization, to improve needed classrooms and support spaces, along with better organization of the interior. The South Gymnasium needs a complete interior renovation. If modernization becomes a new building, some of the classroom spaces can move into the Business Building, and student organizations to the Student Union, to keep only athletic functions in the South Gym building, which would be connected to the Community Room that would remain in place. The new building footprint could be reduced and additional outdoor space could be developed between South Gym and Business Building. Consideration should be given to a relationship or connection between North Gym and South Gym buildings.
