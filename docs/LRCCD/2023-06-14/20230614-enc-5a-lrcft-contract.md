# Article 1 Recognition

The Los Rios Community College District (District) confirms its recognition of the Los Rios College Federation of Teachers, Local 2279, AFT/AFL-CIO (LRCFT or Federation), as the exclusive representative for the bargaining unit whose membership is comprised of all the faculty of the Los Rios Community College District except those who:
a. primarily perform managerial, supervisory or confidential duties, or  
b. day-to-day substitutes  

"Faculty" or "faculty member" means those employees of a community college district who are employed in academic positions that are not designated as supervisory or management. Faculty include, but are not limited to, classroom faculty, librarians, counselors, college nurses, disabled student programs and services professionals, extended opportunity programs and services professionals, coordinators and individuals employed to perform a service that, before July 1, 1990, required non-supervisory, non-management community college certification qualifications. (Education Code §87003.)  

Further, the parties agree to meet in an attempt to reach a consent agreement as to any changes in the above-defined unit prior to requesting the Public Employment Relations Board to rule on the matter.

2.2.4.3 Responsibilities and Duties  
The primary role of a Department Chair is that of a liaison between the department members and the Area Dean. Directly responsible to the Dean of an area/division, the Department Chair advises and assists in performing department-related duties. The Department Chair gains consensus and facilitates communication, coordination, and cooperation among faculty within the department. The Department Chair effectively communicates faculty issues and concerns to the Area Dean.

The Department Chair also serves as a liaison between the department members and the college administration and represents the department to the college community. The Department Chair engages in multiple tasks that are normally beyond the responsibilities of a regular faculty member. The duties of a department chair are determined by mutual agreement between the chair and the dean, in accordance with Article 2.2.4.2, and may include but are not limited to the typical duties listed below:

2.2.4.3.1 Assisting in recommending to the Academic Senate President faculty appointments to hiring and peer review committees.

2.2.4.3.2 Assisting in the recruitment, hiring process, mentoring and evaluation of faculty; recommending peer evaluation teams, facilitating peer evaluation activities, and serving on peer review teams as needed and without additional compensation.

2.2.4.3.3 Assisting in the recruitment and hiring process of substitutes.

2.2.4.3.17.2 While the Department Chair is the formal channel for communicating to the administration department consensus on issues identified by faculty of that department, this does not preclude the right of department faculty to communicate to the administration directly.

The Area Dean will distribute the feedback form to all full-time and preferred adjunct faculty members of the department in March of each year. The Area Dean will collect the Department Chair Feedback Forms and give them to the Department Chair by April 1st each year. The Department Chair Feedback Forms are confidential.

The Area Dean will use the same feedback form as the faculty and note via his/her signature and date that it is the Department Chair’s performance review. In the case of an unsatisfactory performance review, the College President may declare a vacancy and request a special election to recommend a replacement. The Department Chair performance review by the Area Dean will not be included in the personnel file.

2.2.4.6.1.4 After the election, the elected Department Chair and the Area Dean will meet to determine if the minimum reassigned time listed in Appendix G is appropriate or if additional compensation is warranted based on the Department Chair’s responsibilities for the upcoming two (2) year term.

2.2.4.6.1.6 Qualified candidates (tenured and third and fourth year tenure-track faculty) shall be placed on the ballot at their request or upon nomination by another department member with the concurrence of the nominee in accordance with Section 8.6.5. 2.2.4.6.1.6.1 If faculty meet the requirements in Section 2.2.4.6.1.6, first and second year tenure track faculty shall be eligible as a qualified candidate for the position.

## 3.2 District Contribution Levels – Tenured and Tenure-Track Faculty

3.2.2 For tenured and tenure-track faculty with an assignment of less than fifty percent (50%) of full-time (under .50 FTE), the District shall make a pro-rata contribution of the established District contribution levels for insurance coverages based upon the percentage of the reduced assignment level to full-time. The District contribution shall be applied towards the insurance premium cost of the employee's selected plan(s).  
3.2.3 The District will pay the stated contribution for the employee as long as he/she remains in paid status. Premium contribution for nine-, ten- and eleven-month regular employees will be paid by the District during regular non-pay months.

3.3.2 For adjunct faculty with a semester assignment of forty percent (40%) of full-time (.40 FTE) or six (6.0) formula hours, the established District contribution levels as described in Appendix A for medical and dental coverage shall be applied toward the premium cost of the selected plan(s). Adjunct faculty are not eligible for Health Savings Account contributions.

3.3.3 For adjunct faculty with a semester assignment of less than forty percent (40%) of full-time (.40 FTE) or six (6.0) formula hours but at least thirty percent (30%) of full-time (.30 FTE) or four and one-half (4.5) formula hours, the District shall make a contribution of seventy-five percent (75%) of the established District contribution levels as described in Appendix A for health coverage.

3.3.4 For eligible adjunct faculty members as defined in Section 1.3, the following requirements and related processes shall be used to determine the eligible full-time-equivalent (FTE) assignment.
3.3.4.1 The eligible adjunct faculty must be working on September 1 or March 1 based upon an approved and processed Tentative Class Schedule(s) for services to be rendered within the semester. The measurement dates to determine FTE eligibility for benefits shall be August 23 for benefits which begin on September 1, and February 10 for benefits beginning on March 1.
3.3.4.2 The eligible employee must have a Tentative Class Schedule(s) issued providing for a total assignment within the current semester of at least thirty percent (30%) of full-time (.3 FTE) or a minimum of four and one-half (4.5) formula hours. If this Tentative Class Schedule(s) is changed for any reason (cancellations, reductions or additions), no adjustments will be made to the calculated FTE assignment used to determine health plan eligibility or District contribution. If all Tentative Class Schedules for the employee are canceled, then the employee will be ineligible for medical coverage or District contribution. However, the employee may be eligible for COBRA coverage (see below).
3.3.4.3 Other types of assignments which are typically processed on the District form, Employment Service Agreement (ESA) or other employment District form other than a Tentative Class Schedule, shall be excluded from any computation of full-time equivalency (FTE).
3.3.4.4 The eligible employee must commit to a coverage period of at least six (6) months.
3.3.4.5 The Employee Benefits Department will confirm all Tentative Class Schedules on file with the District Human Resources Office as of the measurement dates listed in Section 3.3.4.1 and will notify the adjunct faculty.
<!-- Page 29 -->
![LRCFT Contract: 2023-26 Page 24](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=LRCFT+Contract:+2023-26+Page+24)

3.3.4.6 Insurance coverage will be for a six-month period beginning on September 1 or on March 1, based on the semester for which the Tentative Class Schedule(s) is assigned. District contributions will be paid evenly over the six-month coverage period. If the unit member drops the insurance coverage or becomes ineligible during the six-month coverage period, no District contribution will be made for the remaining months. If the qualifying employment period as stated on the Tentative Class Schedule is less than six (6) months, the insurance coverage shall continue for the balance of the six-month period and the employee shall pay the employee's share of premiums to the Employee Benefits Department by the first day of each month. Failure to make timely payments of premiums shall result in discontinuance of health coverage for the remaining months.

3.3.4.7 If there is a break in service, the employee will be eligible to re-enroll in District health/medical and dental plans only if the employee elects COBRA coverage upon conclusion of previous eligibility with the District and has continued that coverage to the beginning of the new employment period (Tentative Class Schedule). Employees who did not elect to continue with COBRA coverage will be ineligible for coverage or District contribution until the March 1 or September 1 following eighteen months after the last day of eligibility. For example, an employee losing eligibility on March 31, 2023, and not continuing coverage through COBRA, would not be eligible to re-enroll until September 1, 2024. Employees who are continually employed by Los Rios but lose eligibility for health coverage due to lack of sections to receive the required minimum load may re-enroll in the active employees health coverage as soon as they are assigned sufficient load to regain eligibility without having to wait eighteen months. If the employee does not re-elect health coverage when he/she regains eligibility, the eighteen month waiting period will remain in effect. Upon initial enrollment or when re-enrolling after a break in service or coverage, adjunct faculty must certify that they do not have other health insurance coverage. Certifications must be submitted at the time of initial enrollment.

3.3.4.9  
If an adjunct participant in District insurance plans becomes covered by another plan as an employee, spouse, or dependent, and the coverage is either fully or partially paid by another employer, the employee shall immediately become ineligible under the District plan. In order to terminate District coverage, the employee must notify the Employee Benefits Department within thirty (30) days of such coverage. If the employee does not notify the Employee Benefits Department of the other coverage within the thirty-day (30) period, the employee will be responsible for any District costs incurred beyond this ineligibility date.

3.3.5 Joint District Medical Insurance Program  
3.3.5.1 Eligible adjunct faculty who plan to participate in the District medical program and who also teach credit courses in the Sierra Community College District may include such courses for Los Rios benefits if their total credit workload is greater than sixty percent (60%) of full-time (greater than .60 FTE), thus reducing the employee cost of medical insurance.  
3.3.5.2 The joint District program applies to medical insurance benefits only.  
3.3.5.3 The adjunct faculty member must file form CCFS-36 with the District, certifying all credit courses taught at both districts, by August 23 (for fall semester benefits) and February 10 (for spring semester benefits).  
3.3.5.4 The District will extend benefits on the basis of the employee certification. The District will then confirm the certified workload with Sierra Community College District.  
3.3.5.4.1 If the workload confirmed by Sierra Community College District differs from the workload certified by the employee, the employee will be given ten (10) working days to reconcile the difference.  
3.3.5.4.2 If the variance is not reconciled within ten (10) working days, or if the employee-certified amount is determined to be incorrect, the District will adjust or cancel benefits accordingly.  
3.3.5.4.3 The medical insurance will be canceled retroactively when possible and the employee will be notified.

3.3.5.5  
All other conditions and terms of the Los Rios adjunct health insurance program, including documentation and deadlines, must be followed in order to participate in the Joint District Medical Insurance Program.

3.3.5.6  
This joint program with Sierra Community College District is dependent upon state funding and mutual agreement between the districts. The inter-district agreement grants each District the right to terminate or modify the inter-district agreement at any time if there are material changes in the subject matter of the agreement, including changes in legislation, State funding of the program, changes in insurance rates or coverage, plan changes due to collective bargaining, or any other cause. Therefore, this joint district program may be altered or terminated at the end of any six-month coverage period due to changes in State funding or the inter-district agreement. If such changes should occur, the District will notify LRCFT of such changes. Either LRCFT or the District may elect to renegotiate this article within thirty (30) days of such notice to LRCFT. If neither LRCFT nor the District elects to renegotiate, the changes will be implemented without such renegotiations.

4.6.2 Management recognizes that over a two-year period the typical faculty load is sixty (60) formula hours and the non-credit faculty load is ninety (90) formula hours. However, in order to meet department or scheduling problems, the District reserves the right to make an assignment over that two-year period which could vary from sixty (60) – sixty-two (62) formula hours (credit) or ninety (90) – ninety-two (92) formula hours (non credit) as part of a unit member’s regular load. Faculty assigned in an instructional mode as defined in Section 4.1.1 shall be maintained at sixty (60) formula hours over the two-year period. At the end of the two-year period of load balancing, formula hours greater than sixty (60) (4 FTE) in the instructional mode (by an amount equivalent to or greater than .067 FTE or one (1) formula hour) shall be paid as overload (Schedule B). If the faculty member is below the sixty (60) formula hours for load balancing (by an amount equivalent to or greater than .067 FTE or one (1) formula hour), the faculty member may makeup the imbalance the following contract year by mutual agreement. Otherwise, money is owed to the District and must be repaid.

Assignments shall be scheduled to begin at the time the faculty member is assigned on each day of service and the beginning of the first hour assigned on the next day of service worked. Exceptions shall be the following:  
4.8.7.1 By mutual consent between the faculty member and the Area Dean.  
4.8.7.2 In order to meet program needs, single faculty department/assignments, or in order to make load for a tenure-track level faculty member.  

4.8.8 Counselor Staffing Levels  
The fall semester census report (third week enrollment data) adjusted for students who are enrolled in multiple locations and those who would not be expected to seek counseling services, such as students enrolled under the contract with the University of California, Davis, and employed public safety officers enrolled in in-service courses, shall be the basis for the full-time equivalent (FTE) authorized counseling level at a ratio not to exceed 900:1. The change in FTE from the prior year’s authorized level will be funded by the District for the current year from one-time-only Program Development Funds. The continuing change in authorized FTE will be funded as per Attachment 1.  

Counseling FTEF funded from sources such as categorical programs or through a separate, distinct allocation of general purpose funds are not counted toward the authorized counseling level.  

4.9 Overload Assignments  

4.9.1 Definition  
An overload assignment is an assignment for extra pay in excess of the normal assignment of a full-time unit member. In making overload assignments, preference shall be given to full-time unit members for assignments in his/her subject area at his/her college, contingent upon overall satisfactory performance reviews. In order to maintain preference for an overload assignment, the request must be submitted concurrently with the request for the regular assignment.  

4.9.2 No overload assignment shall be allowed to any contract regular full-time unit member until each contract/tenured unit member in each designated division of each college has been assigned work in proportion to the percent of load at which the individual is tenured.  

4.9.3 Extra service beyond a regular assignment and contract period shall be allowed on a mutual consent basis to full-time unit members.  
<!-- Page 59 -->
![LRCFT Contract: 2023-26 Page 54](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=LRCFT+Contract:+2023-26+Page+54)

Extra service shall be compensated for according to placement on Salary Schedule B1, B2 or B3, as appropriate. The hourly rate shall be proportionate to the number of hours required to equal a work day for a full-time assignment as defined in Section 4.2.2.

4.9.4 Workload distributions will not be discriminatory. Assignments which are alleged to be discriminatory may be grieved. As a prior condition to filing a grievance, the member must appeal the assignment to the College Faculty Workload Committee. The appeal to the committee substitutes for Step 1 in the grievance process provided in Section 13.4, and the time limits of that article are applicable.

4.10 Adjunct Faculty Member  
4.10.1 Adjunct faculty are “temporary employees” in accordance with the California Education Code. Nothing contained in this article nor in any article of this Agreement places a legal obligation on the District to provide continuing employment for adjunct faculty except as specified in Section 4.10.6 of this article.  
4.10.2 Nothing contained in this section nor in any article of this Agreement shall be construed to allow adjunct faculty to be assigned a load over the limit permitted for temporary employees as per the Education Code or by past District practice.  
4.10.3 A Faculty Availability/Preference Form will be available to adjunct faculty members so they may indicate their interest in an assignment for a subsequent semester. The form will be available in the Area Dean’s office, on the college website, and on the Los Rios Human Resources’ Forms webpage. The deadline for submission of the form will be provided by the Area Dean and on each college’s website. The form must be submitted to the appropriate Area Dean at each college where the adjunct faculty member wishes to receive an assignment. Those adjunct faculty members who submit the form to the appropriate Area Dean by the deadline will be notified no later than thirty (30) days prior to the start of the semester of requested assignment if they are not to be sent a Tentative Class Schedule. Such notification will be (1) by District mail, (2) by U.S. Mail using the address provided on the Faculty Availability / Preference Form, or (3) by email using the faculty member’s Los Rios email address.  
4.10.4 The Tentative Class Schedule form in use will not be changed without LRCFT approval.  
4.10.5 Adjunct Counselor Office Time  
Adjunct counselors scheduled for four (4) hours in a day shall have thirty (30) minutes for office time for a total of four and one-half (4.5) hours. Adjunct counselors whose daily schedule is more than five (5) hours shall have one (1) of the hours in the schedule committed to office time. Office time is not to be reduced during peak time. Article 4.8.3.1 provides definition of Counselor Office Time.  
4.10.6 Hiring Preference  
<!-- Page 60 -->
When there is need for additional faculty service in a subject area at a given college beyond that provided by tenured or contract employees, preference shall be given according to the following priority order:

**First**  
Full-time faculty who teach that subject as a part of his/her regular load at the college where the hiring is to occur. Preference for the purpose of assignments for those unit members with first level priority shall not exceed 40% of a regular full-time load per semester.

**Second**  
Adjunct faculty who are employed in or have completed sixteen (16) of the last twenty (20) semesters. Such preference shall be at the college where the preference was earned. Faculty may transfer this level of preference to another college, when they have been interviewed, completed two (2) semesters at the new college and received performance reviews in which no "needs improvement" ratings were given. By transferring preference to the new college, the employee voluntarily relinquishes preference at the former site.

a. Adjunct faculty at the second level of preference shall have a preference load of “60%” per semester if the faculty member has been employed for at least 59.5% of a regular full-time load for five of the previous six semesters. The adjunct faculty member’s actual “60%” semester load offering must be at least 59.5%.  
   i. Eligibility determination may include semester teaching loads that occurred at preference level three.  
   ii. If the most recent evaluation is overall less than satisfactory, the individual is ineligible for 60% load preference, but maintains eligibility for level two preference of 40% (Section 1.10.8.1 remains applicable).

b. For all other adjunct faculty at preference level two, load preference shall be set at the average FTE of the two (2) highest of the previous three (3) semesters worked. For these individuals, preference for the purpose of assignments shall not exceed 40% of a regular full-time load per semester.

**Third**  
Adjunct faculty who are employed in or have completed eight (8) of the last twelve (12) semesters. Such preference shall be at the college where the preference was earned. Third level preference priority shall be set at the average FTE of the two (2) highest of the previous three (3) semesters worked. Preference for the purpose of assignments for any individual in the third level priority shall not exceed 40% of a regular full-time load per semester.

**Non-preferenced**  
LRCFT Contract: 2023-26  
Page 55
<!-- Page 61 -->
All other district faculty who meet minimum qualifications and all other qualified applicants with a completed District application in an adjunct pool.  
Full-time faculty members teaching overloads in subjects outside their regular assignment may earn preference in the same manner as adjunct faculty.  

4.10.6.1 In order for the procedure described in Section 4.10.3 to be applicable, all of the following conditions must be met:  
a. A Faculty Availability / Preference Form must be submitted to the appropriate Area Dean at the college with the opening before the deadline provided by the Area Dean and posted on the college website. Forms will also be available on the Los Rios Human Resources’ Forms webpage.  
b. Service on an "emergency hire" basis will not be counted for preference.  
c. Unit members who retire or resign are considered new adjunct faculty for the purposes of assignment under this article.  
d. Unit members who are subject to discipline for just cause consistent with Article 27, and receive a written reprimand based on the findings of a misconduct investigation substantiating the unit member’s misconduct, are considered new adjunct faculty for the purposes of assignment under this article.  

i. The unit member shall be entitled to the full due process rights afforded by Article 27 related to the issuance of a written reprimand and resulting in the loss of preference eligibility under this article, including progressive discipline and LRCFT representation in any misconduct investigation.  
ii. When the District is aware that one or more misconduct allegations against an adjunct faculty member are sufficiently serious that a finding of responsibility might lead to a written reprimand and to loss of preference under 4.10.6.1(d), the District shall inform the faculty member of this possibility in its initial notice to the adjunct faculty member regarding the misconduct investigation, or as soon thereafter as the District has reason to believe that the allegations may lead to a written reprimand and loss of preference under 4.10.6.1(d). A copy of this notice shall also be promptly provided to the relevant LRCFT Campus President.  

LRCF Contract: 2023-26

![LRCFT Contract: 2023-26 Page 57](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=LRCFT+Contract:+2023-26+Page+57)

4.10.6.1  
iii. Any written reprimand issued consistent with Section 4.10.6.1(d) must include notice to the employee that the discipline in question may result in the loss of preference for assignment and that the employee has the right to LRCFT representation in the discipline process.  
iv. This Section 4.10.6.1(d) is a pilot program. These changes will be reviewed annually by LRCFT and LRCCD. Either party may, in June of any academic year under this contract, provide written notice of its intent to terminate, modify, or renegotiate the terms of this Section 4.10.6.1(d) at the end of the current academic year. This pilot program will expire on June 30, 2026, unless the parties agree to continue and/or modify this pilot program for any future contracts.  

4.10.6.2  
Preference for adjunct or overload assignment may be earned at more than one (1) college. Preference earned at different colleges cannot be combined. Preference will be used for purposes of staffing during the summer term; however, the summer term is not counted as a semester for purposes of obtaining a preference priority as described in 4.10.6. Load preference shall not exceed 40% for summer assignment for any individual, including all level two preference adjuncts.  
4.10.6.2.1 No adjunct faculty member without preference shall receive a load before each individual adjunct faculty member in preference levels 2 and 3 has received an assignment according to 4.10.6.2 above.  

4.10.6.3  
Exceptions to the priority order of preference can be made for any one (1) of the following conditions:  
4.10.6.3.1 To obtain the services of a person with unique qualities who would enrich the educational offerings of the District (eminence). Eminence shall be determined by the Academic Senate.  
4.10.6.3.2 To provide staffing of short term classes at the Sacramento Regional Public Safety Training Center, Training Source, and outreach centers having a duration of less than three (3) weeks.  
4.10.6.3.3 Credit generating contracts through the Training Source.  

4.10.6.4  
Preference in assigning is for the purpose of initial assignment only. When necessary to displace another faculty member for the purpose of making a full load for a full-time faculty member, such adjustments will be made in the order below, when possible. When not possible, upon request of the adjunct faculty member, a written
<!-- Page 63 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

1. The full-time faculty member’s current overload will be moved to load.

2. Non-preferenced adjunct faculty.

3. Adjunct faculty with lower level of preference.

4. Adjunct Faculty with higher level of preference.

5. Other full-time faculty with overload.

4.10.6.4.1 A full-time faculty member with an overload class that has been cancelled cannot displace any faculty member from a class to retain that overload assignment.

4.10.6.4.2 The term “when possible” in Section 4.10.6.4 allows for exceptions to the order of priority when making a full-time faculty member’s load. The guidelines in Sections 4.4, 4.7, and 5.7 such as number of class preparations, online class restrictions, five (5) consecutive days, and 9-hour day maximum describe when exceptions to the reverse order of priority are allowed.

4.10.6.4.3 Section 5.7.1 also allows consideration of whether the full-time faculty member has the necessary background or skill necessary to teach a class (i.e. sound educational practices).

4.10.6.4.4 In order to make load for a faculty member who does not possess the necessary background, or if other limitations exist in a course assigned to a non-preferenced adjunct, the full-time faculty member may have to be assigned a class of a part-time faculty member in a higher priority. Exceptions to the reverse order of priority do not include a more convenient time, schedule, room or location for a full-time faculty member.

4.10.6.5 Employment as a long-term temporary faculty member (LTT) shall be included when calculating a faculty member's semesters of employment for purposes of determining preference level consistent with Section 4.10.6. Semester(s) of long-term temporary service shall be counted for purposes of determining preference level at

LRCFT Contract: 2023-26 Page 58
<!-- Page 64 -->
![LRCFT Contract: 2023-26 Page 59](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=LRCFT+Contract:+2023-26+Page+59)

4.10.6.5.1 Employment as a long-term temporary faculty member shall not be included for purposes of calculating averaged preference load pursuant to Section 4.10.6. When calculating FTE load at any preference level consistent with Section 4.10.6, the faculty member's most recent and relevant semesters of adjunct load will be considered and averaged as appropriate. Semesters of long-term temporary service will not be considered for purposes of calculating averaged preference load.

4.10.7 The District shall determine for which discipline and subjects an individual adjunct faculty is qualified to teach.

4.10.8 The intent of this article is to ensure fairness in the scheduling process. This article does not guarantee assignment of specific class times or sections of a class. The following provisions shall apply when assigning adjunct faculty in preference levels 2 and 3.

4.10.8.1 Adjunct faculty in the above preference levels shall not be denied a load as per 4.10.6 for reasons other than a reduction in the program FTE available for adjunct assignment or two (2) consecutive documented overall less than satisfactory performance reviews.

4.10.8.2 No adjunct faculty member without preference shall receive a load unless each individual adjunct faculty member in preference levels 2 and 3 has received an assignment according to 4.10.6 above.

4.10.8.3 The development of a specific work location assignment(s) and hours shall take into consideration the requests of the faculty member in coordination with the Department Chair and Area Dean. The employee’s preferences in scheduling (time of day, courses, etc.) shall be given every consideration when consistent with sound educational practices. Assignments that are alleged to violate the intent of this article as stated in Section 4.10.8 may be grieved.

4.10.8.4 Adjunct faculty with second level preference and with four (4) consecutive semesters teaching a course at a consistent time/location may request a written explanation/rationale if their assignment is changed. The adjunct faculty member will be responsible for indicating such status on the Faculty Availability/Preference Form.

4.10.8.5 Cancellation of a preferred adjunct faculty member’s classes for lack of enrollment shall not result in that individual losing preference or in reducing the required.
<!-- Page 65 -->
![LRCFT Contract: 2023-26 Page 60](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=LRCFT+Contract:+2023-26+Page+60)

4.10.9 When full-time or adjunct faculty transfer from one college to another college, or are reassigned from one subject area to another subject area, he/she shall be reviewed at the discretion of the Area Dean, except where covered by Section 4.10.

4.10.10 Adjunct faculty who have preference within the District according to Section 4.10.6 and who apply for a full-time position in the same discipline will be screened with all other applicants. A minimum of the top two (2) such adjunct faculty applicants from the pool, if available and not included already, will be added to those candidates selected to interview for the position.

4.10.11 Adjunct Faculty Office Hours Program  
The Adjunct Faculty Office Hours Program is a voluntary program. Office hours will typically be scheduled on days that synchronous classes meet and will typically be evenly distributed across the semester or other term each week that the class is scheduled, unless approved by the Area Dean. All assignments will be combined for one stipend.

4.10.11.1 Adjunct faculty maintaining a minimum of 0.2 FTE up to .399 FTE assignment will be provided compensation for a semester total of nine (9) hours or eighteen (18) hours, at the option of the adjunct faculty member.

4.10.11.2 Adjunct faculty maintaining a minimum of 0.4 FTE assignment will be provided compensation for a semester total of nine (9), eighteen (18), twenty-seven (27), or thirty-six (36) hours, at the option of the adjunct faculty member.

4.10.11.3 Adjunct faculty may choose to hold their office hours online. Online office hours shall be included in the course syllabus and shall be time and day specific. Online office hours shall include the opportunity to meet synchronously using a video conferencing system (e.g., Zoom). Faculty can opt to offer audio communication technology (e.g., telephone), or real-time text-based messaging system (e.g., Canvas messaging; Discord) to meet student need. The course syllabus shall clearly describe how to access the online office hours, including links and/or access codes where applicable. Quality assurance will be through the faculty performance review process (Article 8).

4.10.11.4 Adjunct faculty members who wish to participate in the Office Hours Program for either the fall or spring semester may apply by completing the designated form and submitting the form to the appropriate Area Dean no later than the end of the first week of scheduled classes. Forms will be available from the Area Deans and in Appendix C. Individuals who do not submit the form by

the above dates are not eligible to participate in the Adjunct Faculty Office Hour Program. All other conditions/provisions of the tentative class schedules apply. For full semester classes, the FTE assignment will be confirmed immediately after the end of the first week of the semester. For short-term classes, FTE confirmation will occur immediately after the first week the classes are held.

4.10.11.5 Adjunct faculty office hours held on ground must be scheduled at a site where the class is conducted and the course syllabus must include the time/place of the office hours, except as referenced in Section 4.10.11.3. Should the faculty member have assignments at multiple sites, the expected office hours will be appropriately scheduled and conducted at each assigned site.

4.10.11.6 Sick leave and other paid leaves may not be used for office hours that were not conducted as scheduled. The faculty member may reschedule any missed office hours during the instructional time period of the course.

4.10.11.7 Compensation provided for services rendered in the fall and spring semester are considered as a form of “stipend” payment and the actual amount paid to adjunct faculty is based upon the per hour rate established for each faculty member at their regular Class and Step on Salary Schedule B-2. Payment for office hours worked for full term courses will be scheduled for distribution on the tenth of the month following the end of the fall or spring term. Office hour payment for short-term classes will generally be scheduled for distribution on the tenth of the following month that classes were completed.

4.10.11.8 The office hour stipend compensation for adjunct faculty office hours is not subject to any retroactive payment provisions.

4.10.11.9 Adjunct faculty office hours do not count toward the .670 FTE limit (Education Code §87882) or for step movement on Salary Schedule B-1 or B-2.

4.10.11.10 The cost of compensation for adjunct faculty office hours shall be funded from LRCFT’s proportionate share of funds which is further described in Appendices A and B.

4.10.11.11 The District shall apply to the State Chancellor’s Office for reimbursement of up to fifty percent (50%) of the office hour compensation provided to eligible adjunct faculty members. When reimbursements are received by the District from the State for partial funding of the adjunct faculty office hour program, such amounts shall be used to reduce the cost of this program.
<!-- Page 67 -->
4.10.11.12 The cost of funding the adjunct faculty office hour program shall be funded after parking fee reimbursements are paid (Appendix A).  
4.10.12 Other conditions of employment for adjunct faculty are determined by the District.  

4.11 Workload Study Committee  
At the District level, a Workload Study Committee shall be jointly convened by the District and LRCFT to address workload issues of unit members.  
4.11.1 The committee shall be comprised of equal numbers of LRCFT representatives and District representatives.  
4.11.2 The committee is charged with the clarification of the workload issues assigned to it jointly by the District and LRCFT. This shall be accomplished by defining each issue, listing the interests of all affected parties, and identifying reasonable options to meet those interests and resolve the issues.  
4.11.3 The committee may create subcommittees, comprised of equal numbers of unit members and District representatives, to include members more knowledgeable of particular assigned workload issues and may delegate its charges to such subcommittees.  
4.11.4 The committee shall report its findings by May 1st of each year or the timeline established by the committee.

have received no “needs improvement” or “unsatisfactory” marks on their first and second year peer reviews.  
**Process Stages**  
The voluntary transfer process shall consist of four (4) stages: a preliminary stage; a screening stage consisting of two (2) steps; a first-level interview stage consisting of three (3) steps; and a second-level interview stage consisting of two (2) steps.  

**5.3.1.1 Preliminary Stage**  
There shall be three (3) preliminary steps in the voluntary transfer process.  

**Step One:** As part of the college process for filling new full-time faculty positions, full-time faculty within the department will reach consensus as to whether to review voluntary transfers. The Department Chair and Area Dean shall define faculty consensus. If a department does not have any full-time faculty or a new faculty position is without a designated department, the Area Dean, in consultation with the Academic Senate President (or designee), will determine whether to review voluntary transfers. If there is no consensus, then Involuntary Transfer may occur.  

**Step Two:** If voluntary transfer applicants are to be considered, the District Human Resources Office shall inform full-time faculty members via email regarding the voluntary transfer deadline date. The District voluntary transfer deadline date shall be no later than three (3) weeks earlier than the general application deadline date.  

**Step Three:** Voluntary transfer applicants must submit to the District Human Resources Office a Voluntary Transfer Request Form, an application used for general hiring, a resume and/or a letter of interest no later than the voluntary transfer deadline date. The District Human Resources Office shall forward all voluntary transfer applications to the college requesting the position prior to the general application deadline date.  

**5.3.1.2 Screening Stage**  
There shall be two (2) screening steps in the voluntary transfer process.  

**Step One:** A transfer screening committee shall screen the voluntary transfer application(s) according to screening criteria established by the committee prior to reviewing the voluntary transfer applications.  

**Step Two:** The transfer screening committee may recommend by consensus moving forward with one (1) or
<!-- Page 70 -->
5.3.1.3 First Level Interview Stage  
There shall be three (3) first-level interview steps in the voluntary transfer process.  

**Step One:** The transfer interview committee develops interview questions that must be used for all voluntary transfer applicants being interviewed.  

**Step Two:** The transfer interview committee conducts [an] interview(s) of the voluntary transfer applicant(s).  

**Step Three:** The transfer interview committee may recommend by consensus [a] voluntary transfer applicant(s) for selection to the College President or choose not to recommend by consensus any voluntary transfer applicant(s). If there is no recommendation, then Involuntary Transfer may occur.  

5.3.1.4 Second Level Interview Stage  
There shall be two (2) second-level interview steps in the voluntary transfer process.  

**Step One:** After receiving the recommendation(s) from the transfer interview committee, the College President (or designee) interviews the voluntary transfer applicant(s) and checks applicant references consistent with hiring manual procedures.  

**Step Two:** The College President determines to either accept or deny the transfer of the voluntary transfer applicant(s) and then notifies the applicant(s). If the College President denies the voluntary transfer applicant(s), then Involuntary Transfer may occur.  

LRCFT Contract: 2023-26 Page 65
<!-- Page 71 -->
5.3.2 Committee Appointments  
Members of the transfer screening committee and transfer interview committee shall be taken from the general hiring committee.  

The hiring committee will determine the appointments to the transfer screening and interview committees under conditions in Sections 5.3.2.1 and 5.3.2.2.  

5.3.2.1 Transfer Screening Committee Membership  
The transfer screening committee shall consist of one (1) administrative member, an equity representative who should be a faculty member if one is available, and at least one (1) tenured discipline faculty member and one (1) additional faculty member, excluding the voluntary transfer applicant’s current institution of assignment.  

5.3.2.2 Transfer Interview Committee Membership  
The transfer interview committee shall consist of at least the transfer screening committee, with the option of adding any or all of the faculty members from the department assigned to the hiring committee.  

5.3.2.3 The Rights of Unsuccessful Voluntary Transfer Applicants  
If at the screening stage, the first-level interview stage, or the second-level interview stage, a voluntary transfer applicant’s request for transfer is denied, the applicant reserves the right to be considered for the position through the general hiring process as described in the hiring manual.  

5.3.3 Involuntary Transfer  
If a vacancy in the District is to be filled internally and there are no qualified volunteer faculty members, the District may administratively transfer that qualified faculty member with the lowest seniority in that discipline area from a college which has staff overage. General counseling, DSP&S, EOPS, and CalWORKS are considered as separate discipline areas.  

5.4 Rights of Return  
When there is a vacancy in the subject area at the work location from where the employee was originally transferred or reassigned, the employee who has been involuntarily transferred or involuntarily reassigned has the right to such an opening provided:  
5.4.1 The employee accepts such first available assignment which is at least equal to the percent of assignment (tenure) as previously held in the original unit; otherwise the employee forfeits all rights to return automatically.  

LRCFT Contract: 2023-26  
Page 66  
<!-- Page 72 -->
5.4.2 In the event there is an opening which is not at least equal to the percent of assignment (tenure) as previously held, the employee has the option to accept the lesser percent of assignment which has become available at the original unit. However, should subsequent opening combinations develop at the original unit which would provide opportunity for the employee to have a reassignment which is at least equal to the percent of assignment originally held by the employee, then the employee must do one (1) of two (2) things, either:  
5.4.2.1 Accept the developed opening combination which would at least equal the original percent of assignment held, or  
5.4.2.2 Forfeit all rights to automatic reassignment and also forfeit all rights to the partial reassignment at the original unit. Further, in such case the employee may be reassigned to the initial voluntary position as per the terms of the initial volunteering at the discretion of the District. This subsection applies to unit members who apply for an opening and are voluntarily transferred from one college to another college or are voluntarily reassigned from one division to another division within the same college in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.  

5.5 Seniority, Reduction in Force, and Recall Rights  
5.5.1 All faculty members with re-employment rights shall hold a seniority number corresponding to their relative date of employment in the District.  
5.5.2 The District shall provide LRCFT with current seniority lists for all bargaining unit employees with re-employment rights no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of a written request.

# Article 8 Performance Review

## 8.1 Introduction
The primary goal of faculty performance review is to improve the quality of the educational program. The process should promote professionalism, encourage reflection, enhance performance, and be effective in yielding a genuinely useful and substantive assessment of performance. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to identify, recognize and nurture excellence; to identify standard performance; to encourage regular and substantive faculty student interaction; and to indicate areas where improvement is necessary or desirable. While formal performance review as described in this article occurs on a cyclical basis, informal review by colleagues and supervisors occurs on a continuous basis, and, as such, communication should also be continuous. All matters relating to the performance review process are of a confidential nature and members of the review team have the responsibility of maintaining this confidentiality. The faculty member being reviewed, however, is encouraged to utilize all available college and District resources in responding to any performance team recommendations, including working with an Academic Senate-appointed mentor.

## 8.2 Authorization
Education Code §87660 et seq. set forth the requirements for the evaluation of faculty. The legislative intent, as stated in AB 1725, provides that a faculty member's students, administrators and peers should all contribute to his or her performance review, but the faculty should play a central role in the performance review process and, together with appropriate administrators, assume principal responsibility for the effectiveness of the process.

## 8.3 Definitions
### 8.3.1
**Academic year (year)** is the period from the first day of the fall semester through the last day of the following spring semester. The academic year for employees on a 12-month calendar begins July 1 and ends June 30.

### 8.3.2
**Faculty or faculty member** includes, but is not limited to, instructors, librarians, counselors, community college health services professionals, DSP&S professionals, EOP&S professionals, coordinators, and individuals employed to perform a service that, before July 1, 1990, required non-supervisory, non-management community college certification qualifications. (Education Code §87003)

### 8.3.3
The **Academic Senate President** is the college Academic Senate President.

### 8.3.4
The **course syllabus (syllabus)** refers to those handouts that describe the procedures, practices, texts, office hours, grading policies, etc., normally distributed during the first class meeting.

### 8.3.5
The **approved course outline** is the official documentation emerging from the Academic Senate led curriculum recommendation process.

8.3.6  
**Student Reviews**  
Student reviews are primarily a tool for faculty to use to facilitate the improvement of instruction or student services. In addition, a less than satisfactory performance review based on workstation observations, administrative documentation (i.e., written letters or documentation from students, faculty, staff, or administration directly related to the performance review), and self-study may be corroborated by student reviews.

Original individual student reviews will be returned to the faculty after grades have been submitted. For tenure-track faculty, the District may maintain copies no longer than one (1) semester following the fourth year of review or until a grievance has been resolved. For all other faculty, the District may maintain copies no longer than one (1) semester or until a grievance has been resolved, or unless there is a disciplinary process underway for which the reviews may be relevant. The District’s handling of online student reviews is summarized below.

Student reviews will be administered online unless determined otherwise by the review team or the faculty member under review by the second week of the semester. The Area Dean will, prior to the start of the semester in which the review is to occur, send a Pre-Semester Notification Email to the faculty member under review informing them that student reviews will be conducted online unless the faculty member elects to have on-ground reviews, and that the faculty member must convey their decision about this matter to the Area Dean by the end of Week 2. Online reviews of on-ground classes will use the review form for on-ground classes.

**Timing of Student Reviews**  
For classroom faculty, on-ground student reviews occur between the 6th-15th week. Online student reviews occur in Canvas during week six (6) for 8-week-1 classes and week twelve (12) for 16-week classes, and in the 4th week of 8-week-2 classes. Faculty teaching 16-week classes may change the week of their online student reviews to any week between the 6th-12th week by mutual agreement with the review team.

For counselors and nurses, four (4) weeks within the overall timeline will be identified by the Area Dean in consultation with the Department Chair to administer student reviews. The four (4) identified weeks must be scheduled after the pre-review conference or arrangements are completed. However, the return of student reviews
<!-- Page 78 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

will be collected throughout the overall timeline and used for the performance review.

**Timeline of Handling Online Student Reviews**
- Once online student reviews are completed by DO-IT, they are sent to the appropriate Dean in PDF format.
- The Dean then shares the student reviews with the Performance Review Team (PRT) members via email with a note that once the student reviews are read, they should be deleted from the PRT member's computer.
- The Dean holds the PDF review forms until the faculty member under review submits grades at which time the Dean or a designee (like the Administrative Assistant) emails the PDF forms to the faculty member.
- Once the faculty member receives the student reviews, the Dean and/or designee then deletes the PDF forms.
- DO-IT deletes all reviews one month after the end of the semester, unless there is a disciplinary process underway for which the reviews may be relevant.

**8.3.7 Equity Reflection**
The equity reflection is intended to foster a conversation and to facilitate discussion among colleagues that reflects on how faculty can individually and collectively work to improve student outcomes for historically underrepresented groups and disproportionately impacted populations. The reflection should be used to help advance individual professional development and institutional dialogue on change.

The reflection document must not be used as evidence to support a less than satisfactory rating; however, nothing in the reflection process shall limit a performance review team's ability to address a faculty member's less than satisfactory performance issues utilizing evidence or information consistent with Section 8.15.1.2.

**8.4 Standards and Criteria for Performance Review**

8.6.1.1 Purpose  
To assess the potential of tenure-track faculty to become regular faculty and to help tenure-track faculty achieve excellence in instruction during the tenure-track period. In exercising this responsibility, the team may or may not recommend to the appropriate administrator the offer of a second-year contract, a third/fourth-year contract, and, after the fourth year, the granting of tenure.  

8.6.1.2 Membership  
8.6.1.2.1 The Academic Senate President (or designee), in consultation with the Area Dean or appropriate administrator and the Department Chairs, if any, will jointly define the Performance Review Service Area, the area from which faculty shall be selected to form the team.  
a. The Performance Review Service Area shall be regarded as the entire area, a department within the area, a special emphasis within a department or a grouping of related departments or disciplines within an area, depending on the joint determination, as stated above, of the Academic Senate President, the Area Dean or appropriate administrator, and the Department Chairs, if any.  
b. If the tenure-track faculty member to be reviewed has a workload split between two (2) or more administrative areas, then the Area Dean or appropriate administrator who supervises the area in which the faculty member performs most of his/her assigned workload, based on percentage of FTE, shall be the administrator who aids in the determination of the Performance Review Service Area and who serves on the team for that tenure-track faculty member. In cases in which the load is split evenly, the Area Deans or appropriate administrators involved will jointly agree on the administrator to be involved in the processes named above.  

8.6.1.2.2 The team shall be composed of two (2) or more tenured faculty selected from the Performance Review Service Area, and the Area Dean or appropriate administrator, with at least one

8.6.1.2.1 The Tenure-Track Faculty Peer Review Team shall be composed of at least one (1) of the faculty named to come from the evaluatee's discipline or from a closely-related discipline whenever practicable. If the tenure-track faculty member is a coordinator with a workload split between two (2) or more administrative areas, then the team will be composed of two (2) or more tenured faculty selected from the instructional/counselor Performance Review Service Area. In no case will the Tenure-Track Faculty Peer Review Team be composed of an even number of members. In special cases, the Academic Senate President (or designee), in consultation with the Academic Senate President(s) from the other college(s) involved, may appoint faculty members from other colleges to help assure that at least one (1) of the faculty on the team comes from the same or closely-related discipline as the faculty member being reviewed. In special cases, the Academic Senate President (or designee) may appoint one (1) fourth-year tenure-track faculty to the team.

8.6.1.2.3 The Academic Senate President (or designee), in consultation with the Area Dean or appropriate administrator and the Department Chair, if any, shall select the faculty members on the team. Under no circumstances will an appointed mentor to the tenure-track faculty member under review be appointed to the Tenure-Track Faculty Peer Review Team.

8.6.1.2.4 It is intended that faculty appointed to the team shall serve for the duration of the tenure-track period. No additional team members will be appointed after the initial team composition has been determined except in those cases where a vacancy occurs due to sabbaticals, retirements, etc., or except as provided otherwise in this article.

8.6.1.2.5 The list of faculty selected for the team shall be reviewed by the faculty member under review. During the four-year tenure-track period, each tenure-track faculty member will have one (1) peremptory challenge concerning the composition of his/her review team (faculty membership only). This challenge may be made at the beginning of years 2, 3 or 4, by the

8.6.1.2.6 If appointments are not made by the end of week three or the faculty members of the team fail to meet their obligations in the review process, the Area Dean or appropriate administrator shall give written notice to the Academic Senate President and the LRCFT College President of the faculty's failure to act. The administrator shall then proceed with the review, which may include, but not be limited to, workstation observations.

8.6.1.2.7 The Area Dean and a faculty member on the review team can jointly request to replace the other faculty member of the team if they find that faculty member either does not actively participate, may not be objective, or has shown a bias and/or prejudice against the faculty member being reviewed. The request to replace the faculty member must be in writing and include an explanation for the request, signed by the Area Dean and faculty member who requested a replacement, and sent to the Academic Senate President. The Academic Senate President (or designee) must notify the faculty member of the replacement request. An appeal and explanation for the appeal by the faculty member being replaced must be made in writing to the Academic Senate President within five (5) working days from being notified of the request. Following an appeal, it will be the decision of the college Academic Senate President whether to replace the faculty member on the team and the decision shall be final. If the appeal is denied or there is no appeal, the vacancy created by the request shall be filled by the Academic Senate President, in consultation with the Area Dean or appropriate administrator and
<!-- Page 90 -->
8.6.2 The review of tenure-track faculty shall include the following elements and procedures:  
a. **Pre-Review Conference**  
The team and the tenure-track faculty member meet to discuss the review process. A copy of this article will be provided to and reviewed with the team and the faculty member under review. For tenure-track coordinator faculty reviews, the selectable standards will be agreed to at the beginning of the first year of review in the pre-review conference. The same selectable standards for coordinators will stay in place for the four (4) years of tenure-track review. Therefore, the coordinator will know the specific selectable standards at the beginning of the period of review. Please note that the sub-categories in the list of selectable standards are intended only to help arrange and orient the selectable standards and are not intended to restrict a team and reviewee’s options to any particular sub-category. However, if selectable standards under “When Coordinator Works Directly with Students in Assisting Learning or Study, or When Coordinator Trains, Teaches, or Counsels Students or Clients” are selected, then the committee and reviewee will determine jointly whether the extent of teaching in the coordinator’s assignment is such that the use of the standard classroom instructor evaluation form is appropriate in the case of that coordinator. At the end of the tenure-track period and after every tenured faculty review cycle, the selectable standards agreed to for the prior review will be reviewed for possible change in respect to the next cycle of review during the post-review conference.  
b. **Informal Advisement**  
On an informal basis, team members and the tenure-track faculty member work together to assist the tenure-track faculty member.  
c. **Self-Study (second, third and fourth years only)**  
Each faculty member will prepare a self-study using the approved format as described in Appendix E and provide copies to all review team members by the sixth (6th) week of the semester of the review.  
d. **Equity Reflection**  
Each faculty member will prepare an Equity Reflection using the approved format as described in Appendix E1.  
e. **Workstation Observation**  
There will be a minimum of three (3) direct workstation observations by members of a tenure-track faculty review team (faculty plus Area Dean or appropriate administrator).  

LRCF Contract: 2023-26 Page 85
<!-- Page 91 -->
Whenever possible, observations should include different course preparations. A minimum of one (1) workstation observation must be completed before the mid-semester review meeting;

f. **Student Reviews**  
Student reviews will be administered in a minimum of three (3) classes and when practicable for each class preparation. Student reviews from a minimum of one (1) class must be completed before the mid-semester review meeting. For counselors and nurses, a minimum of one (1) week must be specified and student reviews administered prior to the mid-semester review meeting. A majority vote of the review team will determine if student reviews are necessary for coordinators with a workload split with another service area (e.g. instructional, nursing, counseling), or if the extent of their selectable standards and criteria warrant such consideration. If student reviews are to be used, the procedure will be the same for that specific in Performance Review Service Area for Adjunct Faculty (Section 8.8.2.1.d).

g. **Mid-Semester Review**  
The mid-semester review is a mandatory meeting. The review team will provide feedback to the faculty member about the current status of the review such as the syllabus, self-study, workstation observations, and student reviews.

h. **Review Team Conference**  
All team members meet to discuss the results of the syllabi, self-study, workstation observations, the review of professional responsibilities, administrative documentation, and the student review forms. All elements of the performance review must be completed prior to the review team conference. Performance review forms including written recommendations will be completed at this time. The team decides whether to recommend continuation of the tenure-track contract (for first and second year tenure-track faculty). The team meets in the fall semester for fourth-year tenure-track faculty to consider whether or not to recommend to the College President that tenure be granted. While the team will meet at the end of year, no specific tenure recommendation may be made. If the team members do not agree on the review, the majority recommendation will prevail; however, a minority opinion may be attached. The Area Dean or appropriate administrator will be responsible for enforcing timelines. Failure on the part of the team to meet its obligations will invoke the provisions of paragraph 8.6.1.2.6.

i. **Post-Review Conference**  
The tenure-track faculty member and all team members meet to discuss the performance review and to consider the faculty member's plans for the next semester, if applicable. Overall results of the student reviews will be shared during the meeting;

<!-- Page 92 -->
![LRCFT Contract: 2023-26 Page 87](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=LRCFT+Contract:+2023-26+Page+87) 

individual review forms will be given to the faculty member after the end of the semester. In all reviews, the reviewer(s) shall cite specific examples and recommendations for improvement in writing for each “needs improvement” and “unsatisfactory” mark. The faculty member under review shall have an opportunity to append any written rebuttal or explanations to the review form.

j. Faculty Performance Review Form  
The review form and any rebuttal or explanations by the reviewee will become an official part of the employee’s personnel file. The Area Dean or appropriate administrator then submits the signed performance review form by the end of the fall semester to the College President (or designee) for submission to the District Human Resources Office and the faculty member's personnel file. In the fourth year of review, the fall semester recommendation of the review team will be considered by the College President in the President's recommendation to the Chancellor and the Board.

8.6.3 Frequency of Performance Reviews  
Tenure-track faculty shall be reviewed the first semester of employment and every fall semester thereafter. One (1) formal review per year shall be the norm for tenure-track faculty performance review; additional reviews may be performed with the agreement of a majority of the members of the team.  
8.6.3.1 Spring Semester Tenure-Track Appointments: Year Zero (0) of Tenure Track  
This section applies to faculty members who are newly appointed to a tenure-track position in the Spring semester, and who did not work for the District at a load of 0.5 FTE or greater during the immediately preceding Fall semester.

If the first semester of tenure-track employment falls during the Spring semester, the first Spring performance review is conducted to conform to California Education Code §87663a. The review is placed in the reviewee’s personnel file, but the reviewee is not required to respond to any recommendations from the first Spring review in the subsequent Fall review, nor will any aspects of the first Spring review be used to sustain a less than satisfactory review or a non-renewal of the faculty member’s contract during the subsequent Fall semester. Observations and recommendations from the first Spring review may be used in the second and subsequent probationary years if they are relevant to an ongoing pattern of practice or behavior. Year One (1) of the faculty member’s tenure-track appointment and reviews begins in Fall of the academic year immediately following the Spring semester of hiring. The faculty member will not be required to complete a Self Study or Equity Reflection for that Spring semester.

8.6.3.1.1 It is the Area Dean’s or appropriate administrator’s responsibility to inform the faculty review team members of the nature of any Spring review of new tenure-track faculty.

8.6.3.1.2 The Academic Senate President, in consultation with the Dean and the Department Chair, may opt to appoint new members of the Review Team for the start of the tenure-track review cycle the following Fall. The new Review Team must be approved by the Academic Senate President.

8.6.3.2 Spring Semester Tenure-Track Appointments: Year One (1) of Tenure Track  
This section applies to faculty members who are newly appointed to a tenure-track position in the Spring semester, and who also worked for the District at a load of 0.5 FTE or greater during the immediately preceding Fall semester. If the first semester of tenure-track employment falls during the Spring semester, the first Spring performance review is conducted to conform to California Education Code §87663a. The review is placed in the reviewee’s personnel file, and the reviewee is required to respond to recommendations from the first Spring review in the subsequent Fall review. Year Two (2) of the faculty member’s tenure-track appointment and reviews begins in Fall of the academic year immediately following the Spring semester of hiring. The faculty member will not be required to complete a Self Study or Equity Reflection for that Spring semester review.

8.6.3.2.1 It is the Area Dean’s or appropriate administrator’s responsibility to inform the faculty review team members of the nature of any Spring review of new tenure-track faculty.

8.6.3.2.2 The Academic Senate President, in consultation with the Dean and the Department Chair, may opt to appoint new members of the Review Team for the start of the tenure-track review cycle the following Fall. The new Review Team must be approved by the Academic Senate President.

8.6.4 The review team may only make tenure recommendations as part of the fourth year review.

### 8.7.1 Timeline Overview  
Prior to the beginning of the semester of review, the appropriate administrator will notify the Academic Senate President of the name(s) of the persons whose performance reviews are to be conducted. Prior to the beginning of classes, each faculty member to be reviewed will be notified and provided a copy of the self-study format so that it will be prepared by the sixth (6th) week of the semester of review. For faculty on a 174-day year, reviews may begin any time after July 1. The reviews of both classroom faculty and non-classroom faculty must be completed by the end of the academic year in which they were initiated. The Area Dean or appropriate administrator will be responsible for assuring that the process is completed by the end of the school year. Failure on the part of the team to meet its obligations will invoke the provisions of Section 8.7.2.2.4. Appropriate timeline adjustments will be made for short-term classes. Faculty who have submitted written notice of retirement in the year of a scheduled review are exempt from review. Special reviews may be conducted under the special circumstances described in Section 8.14.  

### 8.7.2 Tenured Faculty Review Team  
#### 8.7.2.1 Purpose  
To review the performance of tenured faculty. In exercising this responsibility, the team shall make, on the basis of its findings, one (1) of two (2) recommendations in regard to the faculty member under review: a) that the faculty member should be regarded as having successfully

8.7.2.2 Membership  
The Academic Senate President (or designee), in consultation with the Area Dean or appropriate administrator and the Department Chairs, if any, will jointly define the Performance Review Service Area of the faculty to be evaluated; this is the area from which tenured faculty shall be selected to form the team for purposes of the review.  
a. The Performance Review Service Area shall be regarded as the entire area in which the faculty member to be reviewed serves, a department within the area, a special emphasis, online courses, or discipline within a department or a grouping of related departments or disciplines within an area, depending on the joint determination by those named in the paragraph above.  
b. If the faculty member to be reviewed has a workload split between two (2) or more administrative areas, then the Area Dean or appropriate administrator who supervises the area in which the faculty member performs most of his/her assigned workload based on percentage of FTE shall be the administrator who aids in the determination of the faculty member's Performance Review Service Area. In cases in which the assigned load is split evenly between or among areas, the Area Deans or appropriate administrators involved will jointly agree on the administrator to aid in the determination of the Performance Review Service Area.  

8.7.2.2.1 Each tenured faculty review team shall be composed of the Area Dean or appropriate administrator, and at least two (2) tenured faculty members selected from the Performance Review Service Area of the faculty member under review, with at least one (1) of the faculty named to come from the discipline or from a closely-related discipline whenever practicable. If a coordinator has a workload split between two (2) or more administrative areas, then the team will be composed of two (2) or more tenured faculty selected from the instructional/counselor Performance Review Service Area. In special cases, the Academic Senate President (or designee), in consultation with the Academic

Senate President(s) from the other college(s) involved, may appoint faculty members from other colleges to help assure that at least one (1) of the faculty of the team comes from the same or closely-related discipline as the faculty member being reviewed.  
8.7.2.2.2 The Academic Senate President (or designee), in consultation with the Area Dean or appropriate administrator and the Department Chair(s), if any, shall select the faculty to serve on the team.  
8.7.2.2.3 The list of faculty selected for the team shall be reviewed by the faculty member under review. One (1) peremptory challenge is allowed. Such challenge must be in writing and directed to the Academic Senate President within three (3) weeks of being notified of the performance review team members. The vacancy created by the challenge is to be filled by the Academic Senate President (or designee), in consultation with the Area Dean or appropriate administrator and the Department Chair(s), if any, from the pool of tenured faculty in the Performance Review Service Area, as described above.  
8.7.2.2.4 If appointments are not made by the end of week three or the faculty members of the team fail to meet their obligations in the review process, the Area Dean or appropriate administrator shall give written notice to the Academic Senate President and the LRCFT College President of the faculty's failure to act. The administrator shall then proceed with the review, which may include, but not be limited to, workstation observations.  
8.7.3 The performance review of tenured faculty shall consist of two (2) tracks. Procedure A, the more rigorous procedure, shall be used in alternate review cycles, upon recommendation of the peer review team. Procedure B, the less rigorous procedure, may be used no more than once every six (6) years and only if the previous performance review was “satisfactory.”  
8.7.3.1 Elements and Procedures of A  
a. Pre-Review Arrangements  
The Area Dean will determine whether the faculty member shall be reviewed in the fall or spring semester by the fourth (4th) week of the fall semester. Within the first six (6) weeks of the semester under review, the team establishes, by email, telephone,

8.7.4 Frequency of Reviews  
There will be a performance review of tenured faculty three (3) years following the four-year tenure-track procedure and the granting of tenure. The first review of a tenured faculty member will begin with

f. Review Team Conference  
All elements of the performance review must be completed prior to the review team conference. All team members meet to discuss the results of the syllabi, self-study, workstation observations (if conducted), the review of professional responsibilities, administrative documentation, and the student review forms, and use the same Procedures as in A.

g. Post-Review Conference  
The post-review conference is optional. The review shall be completed and a copy given to the faculty member by the end of the school year in which it was initiated. The review shall document specific examples and provide clear suggestions for improvement in writing for each “needs improvement” and “unsatisfactory” mark. The faculty member under review shall have an opportunity to append any written rebuttal or explanations to the review form. The review form with such rebuttal or explanations will become an official part of the employee’s personnel file. The team will meet to discuss the results of the review at the request of a peer review team member or the faculty member under review. If the review results in an overall “needs improvement” or “unsatisfactory,” the review team will meet with the faculty member under review to discuss the results of the review before the review is finalized.

8.8.1 Timeline Overview  
Prior to the beginning of the semester of review, the appropriate administrator will notify the Academic Senate President of the names of the adjunct faculty whose performance reviews are to be conducted. Prior to the beginning of classes, each faculty member to be reviewed will be notified whether they will have a Procedure A or B review and will be provided a copy of the self-study format so that it will be prepared by the sixth week of the semester of review. An adjunct faculty member scheduled for a Procedure B review may change to a Procedure A review upon request within one (1) week following notification. The reviews of both classroom faculty and non-classroom faculty must be completed by the end of the academic year in which they were initiated. Appropriate timeline adjustments will be made for short-term classes. The Area Dean or appropriate administrator will be responsible for assuring that the process is completed by the end of the school year. Failure on the part of the team to meet its obligations will invoke the provisions of Section 8.8.1.1.f.  
8.8.1.1 Adjunct Faculty Review Team Appointments  
a. A review team or teams shall be formed in every area that contains adjunct faculty scheduled for review.  
b. The review team shall consist of one (1) faculty member from the discipline or related discipline and the Area Dean. For the purposes of reviewing online courses, if the faculty member serving on the review team does not have experience teaching online, an ex-officio faculty member may be appointed at the request of the adjunct faculty member undergoing review or the peer review team. Appointment as an ex-officio member requires consensus by the Area Dean and the appointed faculty member and approval by the Academic Senate President (or designee). The ex-officio faculty member has no vote in the final evaluation decision.  
c. The faculty member serving on this team shall be appointed by the Academic Senate President (or designee) in consultation with the Area Dean or appropriate administrator and Department Chair, if any, from the pool of regular faculty, part-time tenured faculty, or adjunct faculty with preference in the area.  
8.8.1.1.c.1 The list of faculty selected for the team shall be reviewed by the faculty member under review. One (1) peremptory challenge is allowed. Such challenge must be in writing and directed to the Academic Senate President within three (3) weeks of being notified of the

8.8.1.1.c.2 The peremptory challenge may not be used in the adjunct's first review cycle.

8.8.1.1.c.3 This Section (8.8.1.1.c.1 - 8.8.1.1.c.3) is a pilot program. These changes will be reviewed annually by the LRCFCT and LRCCD. Either party may, in June of any academic year under this contract, provide written notice of its intent to terminate, modify, or renegotiate the terms of this Section 8.8.1.1.c.1 at the end of the current academic year. This pilot program will expire on June 30, 2026, unless the parties agree to continue and/or modify this pilot program for any future contracts.

d. After consultation with the Area Dean and Department Chair, and approval of the Academic Senate President (or designee), a faculty member who is not on the peer review team may carry out a workstation observation.

e. If the Department Chair is not appointed on the adjunct peer review team, the Department Chair may serve on the team as an ex-officio member. Appointment as an ex-officio member requires consensus by the Area Dean and appointed faculty member, and approval by the Academic Senate President (or designee). As an ex-officio member, the Department Chair may participate in the adjunct review but has no vote in the final decision.

f. If appointments are not made by the end of week three (3) or the faculty member of the team fails to meet his/her obligations in the review process, the Area Dean or appropriate administrator shall give written notice to the peer review team members, the

#### 13.2.1 Right to Representation
13.2.1.1 At Step 1, Step 2 and Step 3 meetings, the grievant may choose either:

- b. Represent him/herself or herself alone (i.e., does not have the right to non-LRCFT representation at the meetings). This option applies to situations in which the grievant does not request LRCFT representation or to situations where the LRCFT denies a representation request.

13.2.1.1.1 Where the grievant chooses Section 13.2.1.1(b), LRCFT shall have the right to be represented by an observer at meetings between the grievant and the District. At Step 2 or Step 3, the District shall notify LRCFT of such meetings.

13.2.5.1 Failure at any step of this procedure to communicate the decision on a grievance within the specified time limit shall automatically move the grievance to the next step.  
13.2.5.2 Failure at any step of this procedure to appeal within the specified time limit shall be considered a waiver of the right to appeal.

### 13.3 Informal Dispute Resolution Process
Participants and stakeholders in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process should make every effort to involve only those individuals involved in the dispute. The parties recognize that in unique situations or atypical disputes, upper management may need to be involved in lower-level dispute resolution.

#### 13.3.1 
Parties should exhaust an alternative dispute resolution process prior to submitting a grievance at Step 2. This process may include the use of a third party to assist in the dispute resolution. A list of individuals trained in mediation or interest-based resolution processes will be maintained by the LRCFT and the District so that a mutually agreed upon party from this list can become a resource to the process. Timelines are held in abeyance during any informal dispute resolution process but can be restated by either party at any time.

#### 13.3.2 
Any grievance that alleges a failure to grant tenure was unreasonable or violated, misinterpreted, or misapplied any District policies and procedures or the terms and conditions of this Agreement concerning the evaluation of tenure-track employees shall be immediately removed to arbitration, as per Education Code 87610.

### 13.4 Grievance Process
**Step 1**  
Within thirty (30) days after the grievant knew, or by reasonable diligence could have known, of the condition upon which the grievance is based, the grievant shall present his/her grievance, either orally or in writing, to the immediate supervisor of the grievant. If the manager notified of the grievance does not have the authority to grant the remedy requested of the grievance, he/she shall initiate actions immediately that will bring the complaint to the appropriate authority. If the appropriate authority is determined to be the College President, the grievance is no longer considered to be at Step 1. The grievant shall be informed of the appropriate authority. Within three (3) days from the date the manager is notified of the grievance, the manager will contact the grievant for a meeting which shall be held within five (5) days of the contact. Within five (5) days of the meeting, the manager will communicate his/her decision to the grievant. This meeting will be held without regard to whether the matter is grievable or for any other reason.

**Step 2**  
If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the grievant may submit the grievance to the College President. If a faculty member has more than 50 percent (50%) of his/her assignment at the District Office, the Vice Chancellor of the faculty member’s assignment area shall assume the role of the College President for purposes of this article. The submission must be made within ten (10) days of the receipt of the decision at Step 1 and must certify that the Step 1 meeting was held indicating the date and issues discussed. Within twelve (12) days of receipt of the grievance, the College President will...

schedule and hold a meeting with the grievant. The College President will give his/her decision in writing within ten (10) days of the meeting.  
**Step 3**  
If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2, the grievant may submit the grievance to the Human Resources administrator. The submission must be made within ten (10) days of the receipt of the decision of the College President and must certify that the Step 2 meeting was held indicating the date and issues discussed. Within twelve (12) days of receipt of the grievance, the Chancellor (or designee) will schedule and hold a meeting with the grievant. The Chancellor (or designee) will give his/her decision in writing within ten (10) days of the meeting. For grievances waived to Step 3, both parties to the grievance will be afforded an opportunity to use a facilitated interest-based dispute resolution process.  
**Step 4**  
If either side appeals the decision of the Chancellor (or designee) within twenty-five (25) days after receipt of that written decision to arbitration, both sides agree that the grievance will be heard by a mutually agreed upon mediator appointed by the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service prior to the arbitration.  
13.4.1 The mediation shall be scheduled within thirty (30) days after receipt of the appeal or as soon as the mediator is available.  
13.4.2 Until the mediation process is exhausted, timelines for scheduling the arbitration will be held in abeyance.  
13.4.3 At the mediation level and the arbitration, the grievant must be represented by the LRCFT.  
13.4.4 All costs of the mediation and arbitration shall be shared equally by LRCFT and the District. All other costs shall be borne by the party incurring those costs.  
**Step 5**  
LRCFT may appeal the decision of the Chancellor (or designee) within twenty-five (25) days after receipt of the written decision of the Chancellor (or designee) to arbitration. The appeal shall be filed in the office of the Chancellor and shall include all pertinent written materials.  
13.4.5 The arbitrator shall be chosen from a rotational list of neutral third parties provided by the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service.  
13.4.6 The representatives of the parties will meet in advance of the hearing to attempt to agree on the issues to be presented to the arbitrator and the remedy sought.  
13.4.7 The arbitrator shall conduct a hearing with the parties to the grievance within thirty (30) days or as soon as he/she is able to schedule the hearing. The parties to the grievance will be allowed to attend all hearings at which information is given to the arbitrator. Sessions of the arbitration shall be private, with attendance limited to parties to the grievance, their representatives, and witnesses called by the arbitrator. While the proceeding is pending before the arbitrator, no disclosure of the proceedings shall be made public without concurrence of the arbitrator and the parties to the

13.4.8 The arbitrator shall have no right to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement. He/She shall consider and decide only the specific issue or issues submitted to him/her in writing by the parties and shall have no authority to make recommendations on any other issue not so submitted. The arbitrator shall be without power to make any decision contrary to, or inconsistent with, or modifying or varying in any way to applicable laws and rules and regulations having the force and effect of law.

g. Repayment of money owed to District pursuant to Section 2.11. The decision of the arbitrator shall supersede all previous decisions and shall become binding on all parties except in cases where the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000 in which cases the parties may appeal to the Board. Cases where the amount in controversy is $5,000 or less that are settled by the arbitrator shall not be considered precedent setting.

13.4.9 The cost of the services of the arbitrator, including per diem expenses, if any, travel and subsistence expenses, the cost of recording the hearings, and any costs ordered by the arbitrator will be shared by the parties. All other costs will be borne by the party incurring them.

Step 6
Except as provided in Section 13.4.8 regarding matters in controversy of $5,000 or less, the LRCFT or the Chancellor may appeal the decision of the arbitrator to the Board. Any appeal by either LRCFT or the Chancellor must be filed with the Secretary of the Board within fifteen (15) days after receiving the arbitrator’s decision.

13.4 Appeals  
The Board shall transmit its reasoning and conclusions of the arbitrator to the Board; however, each are controlled by the specific findings of fact of the arbitrator. The Board shall have the right to issue a final decision resulting from its deliberations. If the Board does not transmit its decision within sixty (60) days from its receipt of the appeal to the arbitrator’s decision, then the parties shall automatically accept the decision rendered by the arbitrator as being final.

13.5 Time Limits  
The District and LRCFT are mutually committed to adhering to the time limits outlined in the dispute resolution process and a good faith effort will be made towards meeting all time limits.

**Article 24 Contracting for Instructional Services**

Both the LRCCD and the LRCFT recognize the benefits of offering certain instruction through outside contracts. For example, some instruction that may be so specialized as to make it difficult, if not impossible, to find qualified instructors within the LRCFT’s bargaining unit, such as those courses taught through the Sacramento Regional Public Safety Training Center, is more effectively addressed through outside contracts. Also, courses offered through high schools in conjunction with agreements between the LRCCD and the local high school district can bring needed funding to Los Rios, funding that can serve to support ongoing instructional programs within the Los Rios district. In entering into these outside contracts, the benefits of which are recognized by both parties to this agreement, it is the intent of the parties to avoid the loss of jobs in the LRCFT bargaining unit as a result of any decision to contract out instruction. Furthermore, the parties to this Agreement wish to maintain the primacy of Los Rios faculty in developing curriculum, determining course content, equivalencies, standards and grading practices, evaluation, assignment and hiring processes.

A. Only “for credit” classes are subject to this Agreement.

B. Employment of Faculty
1. Faculty employed by other agencies or school districts and performing instructional activities for the Los Rios district shall be subject to the compensation schedules established by their employers.
2. With the exception of those contract instructors employed at the Sacramento Regional Public Safety Training Center (SRPSTC), apprenticeships, and non-credit courses at The Training Source, contract instructors shall be subject to the peer review process for adjunct faculty outlined in Section 8.8.

C. Contracts
1. Existing apprenticeship contracts, contracts initiated to provide instruction through the SRPSTC, and credit courses at The Training Source may remain in force for a period not to exceed the life of the individual contract years unless provisions concerning the nature of the employment are changed. Changed contracts are subject to review by the LRCFT.
2. Contracts for credit instruction which do not utilize District employees shall be subject to the following approval process:
   a. The Chancellor (or designee) shall consult with the LRCFT President regarding a proposed contract. The District may seek a waiver in writing at least ninety (90) days prior to the effective date of any such contract. The LRCFT President (or designee) shall respond in writing within forty-five (45) days.
      1) For the purposes of this article, “waiver” is defined as the approval by the LRCFT to have an individual instructor teach a specific course for a defined period of time at a particular location.

**LRCFT Contract: 2023-26 Page 176**
<!-- Page 182 -->
b. The District may contract for instruction with outside entities and use instructors who are not District employees providing the contract does not exceed nine (9) months in duration. Contracts exceeding nine (9) months in duration and any subsequent contract with the same contractor will use only District employees as instructors unless a waiver is granted.  
c. A further condition of any waiver shall be that all preferred adjunct faculty in a subject area and all tenure-track/tenured faculty seeking overload assignments must be accommodated before any instructors who are the subjects of a waiver can begin teaching the course for which they have been contracted.  

D. Faculty Oversight of Contracted Programs  
1. The Academic Senate at the Los Rios college from which the contract originated shall have responsibility for adopting the course as part of the curricula of the Los Rios district through the normal curriculum development process, approving a course outline, assuring that grading standards are adhered to, overseeing the performance review process, verifying that contracting District instructors meet the appropriate academic standards, and that courses and programs offered by the contracting districts meet accreditation standards.  
2. LRCFT shall be notified of the terms of contracts such that they can provide input on the working conditions of faculty members.

# Article 25  Academic Rank

Faculty shall have the following academic ranks/titles:  
a. The title of tenured faculty shall be Professor.  
b. The title of tenure-track faculty shall be Assistant Professor.  
c. The title of part-time tenured faculty shall be Associate Professor.  
d. The title of adjunct faculty without preference (as described in Section 4.10) shall be Adjunct Assistant Professor.

# Article 26 Educational Technology

## 26.1 Intent
A key strategy in the Los Rios Community College District's vision of a restructured higher education system is to expand the system's learning opportunities on and off campus by using multiple technologies. The purpose of this article is to establish a series of contractual understandings between the LRCFT and the Board regarding the use of instructional technology.

## 26.2 Definitions
**Distance Education** extends the process of teaching and learning from the college to one or more locations, including classrooms on other colleges; work sites; community centers; and homes. It includes instruction; instructional support, such as libraries and computer centers; student services, such as registration and counseling; and student activities that are provided to those other locations.

**Distance Instruction** broadly defines a condition of learning where instructor and student are physically separate for most, if not all, of the experience. Interaction is mediated by some form of technology - currently audio, video, and computer technologies - that allows for students and instructor to engage in the process of education.

**Distance Education in Asynchronous Mode** is where instructional audio, text, and/or video is prerecorded and delivered to students on any media including, but not limited to, disks, tapes, and Internet web pages.

**Instructional Technology Material** includes video and audio recordings; motion pictures; film strips; photographic and other similar visual materials; live video and audio transmissions; computer programs; computer-assisted instructional coursework; programmed instructional materials; three dimensional materials and exhibits; and combinations of the above materials which are prepared or produced, in whole or in part, by an employee and which are used to assist or enhance instruction.

**Intellectual Property** is the result of creative activities, including teaching and research. Examples of intellectual property include works of art or design, poetry, musical scores, films, video or audio recordings, instructional materials (e.g., textbooks, syllabi, student exercises, multimedia programs), computer software, fictional or non-fictional narratives, analyses (e.g., scientific, logical, opinion or criticism), inventions, devices, processes, and other enduring representations of creative activities. Intellectual property may be instructional, professional, dramatic or commercial in nature. The media in which intellectual property exists is irrelevant to the question of ownership. (See Article 28)

**A Work** is any material which is eligible for copyright protection, including, but not limited to, books; articles; dramatic or musical compositions; poetry; instructional materials, e.g., syllabi, lectures, student exercises, multimedia programs, tests, etc.; fictional or non-fictional narratives; analyses, e.g., scientific, logical, opinion or criticism; works of art or design; photographs or

27.2.4 Employees who are the subject of misconduct investigations must have the right to request representation by LRCFT in the investigation. LRCFT has the right, upon request, to represent employees in such investigations. Those employees who are involved in misconduct investigations may request to be accompanied by a representative of LRCFT to any meetings with the District relating to the investigation.  
27.2.5 If LRCFT is representing an employee who is the subject of a misconduct investigation a complainant, or witness, the Federation must be provided all information, including documents, provided to the represented employee within five school days.  
27.2.6 If LRCFT is representing an employee who is the subject of a misconduct investigation, the District must, provide to employees who are the subject of a misconduct investigation an opportunity to confer with the Federation prior to any investigatory interview.  
27.2.7 Prior to the investigatory interview of the employee, if LRCFT is representing an employee who is the subject of a misconduct investigation, the District will provide LRCFT with the following information related to the alleged misconduct, to the extent it is available to the District: (1) a description of the alleged misconduct by the employee, including the basic facts giving rise to the allegation(s) in the complaint; (2) the specific date(s), time(s), and location(s) of the alleged misconduct by the employee; and (3) a description of whether the complainant is a student, a faculty member, an administrator, or not a member of the college community. If appropriate, and at the discretion of the Associate Vice Chancellor of Human Resources, the District may also provide LRCFT with the name of the complainant(s) or individuals(s) whose concerns caused the District to initiate an investigation. The District will provide this information to LRCFT no later than five school days before any investigatory interview of the employee, and the parties will reschedule the interview as may be necessary to comply with this requirement.  
In the event that new allegations arise during the scope of an investigation but before the interview of the employee, the District will provide LRCFT with information related to the new allegations consistent with the requirements of this section no later than five school days before any investigatory interview of the employee, and the parties will reschedule the interview as may be necessary to comply with this requirement.

27.2.9.2  
If the District does not conclude the employee engaged in any misconduct or violated any District policies or procedures and if the District also does not intend to impose discipline/corrective action or take any employment action regarding the employee as a result of a misconduct investigation, LRCFT agrees that it will limit its requests for disclosure of additional information to those instances where LRCFT has reasonable concerns about the investigative process or is evaluating potential grievances, rather than as a matter of course. If such a request is made, the parties must meet and confer to discuss the request and any District objections to the request, including any objections based upon confidentiality. The District must not withhold documents based upon a generalized fear of retaliation.

27.3 Student Complaints Not Resulting in Misconduct Investigation (General, Non-Formal)

# Appendix A  Salary and Benefits

## A.1 Funding Sources/Fiscal Years
The bargaining unit shall receive its proportionate share of eighty percent (80%) of certain new or increased unrestricted revenue which is above an established base amount. The bargaining unit's proportionate share of such revenues is based upon:

1) The unit's total salary and benefit cost, including the cost of District contribution towards health coverage for all authorized/filled positions, including summer term positions, associated with the LRCFT unit which is compared to the total District salary benefit and contribution costs for authorized/filled positions of all District employee groups.

2) Authorized/filled positions which are funded from special programs/categorical funds are excluded from both LRCFT unit's cost and other employee group costs.

3) The related salary and benefit costs associated with District contract managers are also excluded.

4) Contract year consists of the fiscal years 2023-24, 2024-25 and 2025-26.

5) Any reference to prior year refers to the fiscal year preceding one of the contract years stated above.

The determination as to whether such defined revenues are continuing or one-time-only is defined below but may be modified during the term of this contract due to new State law or regulations. Such revenues and related base amounts are defined as follows:

### A.1.1 Base Revenues (Basic Allocation plus Base Full-Time Equivalent Students Supplemental and Student Success Allocation; funded by State General Apportionment, Property Taxes, Education Protection Act (EPA), and Student Enrollment Fees)
The base amount for a contract year is the revenue level recognized in the prior fiscal year that was used for retroactive salary improvement calculations for that year including any prior year Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA), and prior year Growth Funds and reduced by any State deficit, which may be applied retroactively. Base revenues are generally considered continuing funds and shall be used to fund continuing salary and benefit costs applicable to LRCFT unit members.

### A.1.2 COLA
New or increased revenues above the base amount are generally derived from two primary sources: 1) Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA); and 2) Growth Funds. The determination, availability, and distribution of the bargaining units proportionate share of new or increased revenues due to the COLA factor applied to Base Revenue is dependent upon the final adoption of the State Budget and the reliability of receiving such entitlements. An initial salary schedule improvement may be implemented for the fiscal year based upon COLA funds authorized in the State budget for community colleges provided that such COLA revenues are reliable (no projected State revenues).

![LRCFT Contract: 2023-26](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=LRCFT+Contract:+2023-26)

A.1.3 Growth Funds  
After providing for specified costs associated with student growth, as described in Attachment 1, net available Growth are considered continuing funds and are proportionally allocated to the unit. Growth funds are attributed to either an increase in funded Full-Time Equivalent Students (FTES) or an increase in the District’s Basic Allocation.  
A.1.3.1 Cost Reduction  
As described in Attachment 1, any cost savings which were previously funded from student growth funds shall be included in the calculation of net available Growth Funds.  

A.1.4 Lottery Revenue  
The initial base amount for Lottery revenue was established at $3.3M. Effective July 1, 2000, fifty percent (50%) of Lottery revenues above 1997-98 revenues are restricted per the conditions set forth in Proposition 20. Such restricted amounts may not be used for salaries and benefits and, therefore, are excluded from the provisions of this article.  
In 2014-15, the base amount for unrestricted Lottery revenue was increased by $2.6M to a new established base of $5.9M. Eighty percent (80%), which is $2.08M, of the increase was considered a continuing resource and the proportionate amount of such funds was provided to LRCFT through the proportionate share calculation as a continuing resource.  
Lottery revenues below the base amount of $5.9M shall reduce available continuing funds.  
Any revenue received above the established base of $5.9M is considered one-time-only revenue and the proportionate amount of eighty percent (80%) of such funds provided to LRCFT as a non-continuing resource.  

A.1.5 State Mandates  
Mandate Block Grant is unrestricted funding provided to districts that elect to receive a block grant in lieu of filing claims seeking reimbursement for mandated activities for a specific fiscal year. If the State budget includes mandate block grant funding during the contract year and the District elects to receive the block grant in lieu of filing a claim, eighty percent (80%) of that amount will be allocated to the compensation calculation to be distributed to LRCFT unit members based upon its proportionate share. This resource is categorized as one-time only funding.  

A.1.6 State Adjunct Medical Premium Reimbursements  
The 2022 Budget Act appropriates $200.49 million for the Part-Time Faculty Health Insurance Program. In any year where funds provided in the budget are insufficient to cover the total cost of all claims submitted, each district will receive a proportionate share of the available funds. Any funds remaining after all participating  

LRCFT Contract: 2023-26  
Page 198
<!-- Page 204 -->
district claims have been reimbursed will revert to the State general fund each year. The Chancellor’s Office shall first reimburse all districts that establish a part-time faculty health insurance program up to 50% of the districts’ costs of the individual premiums paid to the health insurance coverage of participating part-time faculty, multidistrict part-time faculty, and their dependents. After an initial allocation of up to 50% of costs, any remaining funds will be allocated to districts who meet the program eligibility criteria for up to 100% reimbursement. Eligibility requirements are stated in Section 3.3.5. A Memorandum of Understanding dated April 15, 1998, between Los Rios Community College District and the Sierra Joint Community College District further specifies the terms of participation in the program and follows the guidelines and requirements prescribed by the State Chancellor’s Office (EC 87860 through 87869 - AB 3099).

A.1.6.1 Each fiscal year the Los Rios district shall file the appropriate claim for reimbursement with the State for medical premium costs incurred by both districts and for benefits provided to adjunct faculty who participate in the District’s plan.

A.1.6.2 Amounts received by the District shall: 1) reimburse Sierra for their share of costs incurred for adjunct premiums (up to 50%) and as specified in the Memorandum of Understanding with Sierra; and 2) remaining amounts shall be used to support the cost of this Adjunct Medical Premium program. Such reimbursements are considered a funding source available to LRCFT for related medical premium costs (Section A.2.3) in the year such monies are paid by the State and received by the District.

A.1.7 State Adjunct Faculty Office Hours Program
In 1997, the State established requirements and funding for participating districts for the cost of office hours held by adjunct faculty. This program provides up to fifty percent (50%) reimbursement to districts to offset the office hour costs incurred for participating faculty members who maintain a workload of twenty percent (.20 FTE) or more. The Adjunct Faculty Office Hours Program is further described in Section 4.10.11 and follows the guidelines and requirements prescribed by the State Chancellor’s Office.

A.1.7.1 Each fiscal year the District shall file the appropriate claim for reimbursement with the State for adjunct office hour costs incurred which meet the State requirements. Amounts received by the District from the State shall be used to reduce the cost of this program. 

A.1.7.3 Such reimbursements are considered a funding source available to LRCFT for adjunct office hour costs (Section A.2.10) in the year such monies are paid by the State and received by the District.

LRFCT Contract: 2023-26  
Page 199
<!-- Page 205 -->
A.1.8 Part-Time Faculty Compensation Funds  
These funds are designated by the State to be used toward salary schedule parity for part-time faculty. Once parity was achieved, residual funds were used for other part-time faculty compensation items that are now part of the base funding and compensation for the unit. The 2021-22 level of Part-Time Faculty Compensation funds is $945,170. Should Part-Time Faculty Compensation funds receive COLA, the COLA will be identified as a continuing resource for the unit to support salary and benefit costs. Should the State restore the funding reduction of $1,294,856 for Part-Time Faculty Compensation reflecting the 2002-03 level of $2,240,026, such increase to the 200203 level will be included with other resources for the unit to support salary and benefits costs. If revenues above the 2002-03 level, excluding COLA, are received, the District and LRCFT will meet to negotiate the use of such funds. If the State further reduces the funding, other continuing sources will be used to offset such continuing costs.  

A.1.9 District Contribution Reduction  
Should District contribution for medical and dental coverage be reduced in a contract year below the preceding years established level, the related reduction in District contribution costs for unit members shall be returned to the unit as a source of funds which are available for redistribution.  
A.1.9.1 The amount of funds attributed to premium reductions in a contract year shall be distributed to unit members in combination with any District growth funds.  

A.1.10 Salary Savings (Decrements)  
Any net salary savings, after actual replacement costs are considered, realized from unit member retirements or resignations will be included as a resource for the unit. Decrements are the difference between the placement (base) salary of the employee who vacated the position and the estimated replacement cost at class III, step five (5). Step 5 is the average step newly hired faculty are initially placed. Actual replacement costs are calculated as the difference between the placement of new hires compared to class III, step 5. Decrements for positions vacated at the end of the academic or fiscal year will be included in the calculation for the following fiscal year. Step 5 is used because it is the average placement step of a new hire. Net salary savings may be used to:  
A.1.10.1 Address the unit’s proportionate share of any reductions in Base revenues below the defined base, and  
A.1.10.2 Fund the increased cost of conversions of part-time instructional FTE to regular full-time instructional positions if growth funds per Attachment 1 are not available or are insufficient to fund such increased costs; then,  
A.1.10.3 Remaining salary savings shall be available to the unit as another source of revenue.  

LRCCFT Contract: 2023-26  
Page 200
<!-- Page 206 -->
A.1.11 State Revenue Recalculations and Other Funding Sources  
Should Base, COLA or Growth revenues be increased or reduced as a result of retroactive calculations performed by the State Chancellor's Office (February of the following year) such revenue adjustments shall be applied to the related revenue computations as per Section A.1.1 through A.1.9.  

A.1.12 Carry Forward of Funds from prior year  
Should the Unit and the District agree to defer either continuing or one-time funds from a prior year calculation such funds will be combined with other available resources for the following contract year.  

A.2 Distribution or Allocation of Funds  
Unit members’ proportionate share of such additional funds shall be applied in the following priority order:  
A.2.1 The cost of step increments and class changes for a contract year for unit members and any prior year step increment costs which were not adequately funded from previous year’s continuing funds; then  
A.2.2 The increased District cost in a contract year of providing Medicare coverage to members and other increased payroll related benefits such as disability insurance coverage, Social Security or unemployment coverage.  
A.2.3 The District contribution cost increases for medical premiums for eligible adjunct faculty who are jointly employed by Los Rios and Sierra Community College Districts as described in Section 3.3.5.  
A.2.4 The increased cost over the prior year level of providing the District contribution up to the level agreed to by the District and LRCFT for each contract year.  
A.2.4.1 The 2023-24 District contribution for medical premiums is established at $1,485.50 per month on a twelve-month basis and shall remain at this level until sufficient continuing funds allow for an increase, subject to agreement by the District and LRCFT to use continuing resources for any additional contribution. The contribution level is only made up to the premium level for the plan selected.  
A.2.4.1.1 The District will contribute to a Health Savings Account (H.S.A.) for regular employees who select one of two high deductible health plans (HDHP) offered by the District: the Western Health Advantage (WHA) HDHP or Kaiser HDHP. The contribution level for 2022-23 is either $100 per month or $150 per month dependent upon single or family coverage, respectively. The H.S.A. contribution will remain in effect for the contract term unless the WHA HDHP or Sutter Health Plus HDHP is discontinued or as long as the premium for the plan selected by the employee plus the H.S.A.  

LRCFT Contract: 2023-26  
Page 201
<!-- Page 207 -->
![LRCFT Contract: 2023-26](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=LRCFT+Contract:+2023-26)

A.2.4.1 The H.S.A. contribution amount for 2023-24, 2024-25 and 2025-26 will be determined based upon the difference between the District contribution for medical compared to the premium level for the HDHP. Adjunct employees may select either HDHP plan, but are not eligible for the H.S.A. contribution.

A.2.4.2 Negotiated increases in the District contribution for medical premiums may be determined prior to the open enrollment period for the upcoming fiscal year dependent upon the availability of continuing resources.

A.2.4.3 The District contribution level may be increased, but not lowered, during or at the end of each contract year subject to the availability of continuing resources. However, this does not preclude a reduction in the contribution level for the subsequent year if the District and LRCFT agree to a lower contribution.

A.2.5 The cost in a contract year for increasing the District contribution for the monthly dental premium.

A.2.5.1 For 2022-23; the District contribution level for dental coverage is established at $128.00 per month (twelve month basis);

A.2.6 Any increase in the premium cost above the current premium of $6.75 for $50,000 term life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment coverage.

A.2.7 Non-credit revenues identified in accordance with Section 4.6.2, which are set aside for non-credit unit members workload adjustments; then

A.2.8 The cost to improve stipend amounts at the rate of the continuing salary schedule improvements and increased for Department Chair stipends and reassigned time assignments; then

A.2.9 The incremental cost increase of parking fees reimbursed to unit members in the preceding academic/contract year as defined per Section 3.9; then

A.2.10 The increased cost for compensating adjunct faculty for office hours; then

A.2.11 The cost to fund additional Type B Leaves as defined in Section 11.6.8.1.

A.2.12 The costs defined in this article require continuing funds in order to permanently support such costs in succeeding fiscal years and are a funding priority for any continuous sources of revenue such as Base, COLA and Growth Funding. After funding the above costs, any remaining continuing funds shall be used to improve Salary Schedules A and B and payroll related fringe benefit improvements by three percent (3%). Continuing funds earmarked as described in Section A.2.13 will be paid to all unit members as one-time only until sufficient funds are accumulated for implementation of those items.

A.2.12.1 The cost of any salary schedule improvements provided in advance of the final determination of revenues available to LRCFT shall be considered in the retroactive salary calculations.  
A.2.12.2 Any of the above costs funded in a contract year from one-time-only revenues (as defined in Section A.1) shall be considered one-time-only distributions/improvements for the contract year. One-time only revenues are typically included with any distribution of retroactive compensation and other improvements.  
A.2.13 Then, remaining continuing funds shall be earmarked for the multi-year funding plan for funding the following items:  
A.2.13.1 Funding will first be set aside to fund increasing the lab hour to lecture hour ratio from .75 to 1 .80 to 1.  
A.2.13.2 Following the implementation of the above item, earmarked continuing funds shall be used to fund the cost of compensating adjunct office hours at an hourly rate based upon the actual placement on Schedule B-1. The determination of the rate is the annual Schedule A class and step placement divided by 1,430 hours. Additional provisions for this change will be determined prior to implementation to avoid a reduction in pay for any participating member. The LRCFT and the District may choose to implement other options as intermediate steps toward this item such as using an alternative step and/or class from the B-2 schedule as funding allows and as mutually agreed.  
A.2.13.3 The LRCFT and the District will meet prior to the distribution of remaining funds to consider whether the minimum 3% continuing salary schedule improvement should be lowered or waived for a given year in consideration of implementing the items listed above.  
A.2.14 Should the District expand its Cafeteria plan offerings increased costs associated with changes in the plan shall be charged to the bargaining unit’s proportionate share.  
A.3 Distribution of Lottery Revenues  
The increase in funds attributable to lottery revenues above the base amount stated in Section A.1.4 shall be considered one-time-only payments and will be distributed to LRCFT unit members on an annual basis in conjunction with other retroactive salary compensation for the fiscal year.  
A.3.1 Lottery revenues for the fiscal year will be reasonably estimated at the time of processing any retroactive salary payments; such funds shall be included in the scheduled retroactive compensation improvement. Any revenue differences between actual lottery revenues received for this fiscal year compared to the lottery revenue estimates used in the improvements to salary and benefits shall be included in the succeeding fiscal year’s revenue distribution to LRCFT.  
LRCFT Contract: 2023-26 Page 203
<!-- Page 209 -->
A.3.2 Prior to distribution of lottery revenues to unit members, $250,000 will be charged to the unit for the contract year Paid Employee and Immediate Family Catastrophic Leave and Eight (8) Week Parental Leave programs. In addition, lottery funds will be charged for one-half (1/2) the amount of costs incurred by the leave bank between $250,000 and $350,000. If costs for the contract year exceed $350,000, the unit will bear the full cost above $350,000 as a charge against lottery revenues. In the event the costs for the program are less than $250,000 in the contract year, the balance of the $250,000 set aside from the prior year will be carried forward to the following contract year. The unit will contribute an additional initial $750,000 for fiscal year 2023-24 to fund the Immediate Family Catastrophic Leave and 8-week Parental Leave program that was added as a pilot program for the 2023 – 2026 contract year. The leave bank must maintain adequate reserves. Adequate reserve levels will be established at the end of 2023 – 2026 contract year. Carryover funds will remain in the bank until the reserve level is established.

A.4 Distribution of Net Available Resources  
The distribution of available net resources as defined in A.2 shall be made no later than sixty (60) days after the final status of such funds is determined by the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, or the close of the District's fiscal year, whichever is later.

A.5 Retroactive Salary Adjustment  
Per the provisions defined in Sections A.2 through A.4, unit members may receive retroactive salary improvements both continuing and one-time in nature. Non-regular (adjunct and overload) services provided for Summer terms will not be included in the retroactive payment. Summer assignments will continue to be paid from the interim salary schedule in effect for the Spring term preceding the Summer term. However, Summer term salary improvements due to a continuing improvement of Schedule B are provided for in the determination of the use of continuing resources for the fiscal year preceding the Summer term.

A.6 Salary Savings (Other)  
A.6.1 Salary savings resulting from unclaimed Dependent Care Assistance Program or Flexible Spending Plan elections by LRCFT unit members will revert to unit members who participated in the plan(s) per Internal Revenue Service code net of any costs associated with the plan administration.  
A.6.2 Salary savings from unused Type A and B Leaves over the carryover limit will be used for one-time-only compensation improvements.

A.7 Other Unrestricted Funds  
Should other new State unrestricted revenues become available in a contract year as a result of changes in funding legislation or excess unrestricted funds above the State’s appropriation limit become available, such new revenue source(s) shall be subject to further negotiations.  
A.7.1 The District shall notify the LRCFT unit of such new unrestricted revenues which are subject to further negotiations.

A.8 Excluded Revenue/Funding Sources

**A.9.1** The District shall notify the LRCFT unit of such excess funds above the ten percent (10%) level as it relates to the revenues defined herein.

### A.10 Review of District Records
Records maintained by the District Office Business Services Department which relate to the implementation and calculation of LRCFT’s proportionate share of the defined funds shall be available for review by representatives designated by the LRCFT Executive Board. LRCFT and Business Services representatives shall meet at a mutually agreeable time. Business Services representatives will provide copies of any records upon the request of the designated representatives during their review of the records. Annual reports which summarize the calculation of LRCFT’s proportionate share of defined funds and the allocation/distribution of such funds shall be prepared by Business Services representatives. All such summary reports relating to the implementation of this Appendix shall be provided to designated representatives of LRCFT.

### A.11 Changes in Funding Formulas for Community Colleges

![Attachment 1 Calculation of Available Growth Revenues & Related Growth Cost](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Attachment+1+Calculation+of+Available+Growth+Revenues+%26+Related+Growth+Cost)

1. **Calculation of Available Growth Revenues**  
   Eighty percent (80%) of Growth Funds as defined in Appendix A received in a contract year shall be initially appropriated in the following manner:  
   1.1 The increased costs associated with each year’s actual full-time equivalent (FTE) instructional level above the previous year’s actual instructional staffing level.  
   1.1.1 The actual instructional staffing level for each year shall be determined after the end of the third week spring and shall be based upon the average of the Fall / Spring instructional FTE level for that year plus the change in FTE for the Summer term above the base level of 122.34 subject to 1.1.1.1 below. For this provision the summer term is the term occurring prior to the fall term for the fiscal year.  
   1.1.1.1 To calculate the growth in instructional FTE for the summer term, a productivity level of 450 will be used. If the actual summer term productivity is below 450, growth funds will not be awarded for FTE utilized below the 450 level.  
   1.1.2 The cost for the additional FTE will be based upon the standard adjunct cost for the contract year, except the standard adjunct cost for summer term instruction will not include health and welfare benefit costs. In computing the standard adjunct cost for the purposes of this calculation, the 2023-24 STRS rate of 19.10% for employer contribution will be used. The 2022-23 rate using the 2023-24 rates is $70,060 and  
   1) for 2023-24 the standard rate as determined by averaging the fall 2023 actual payments for adjunct and overload instructional assignments and the standard benefit rate for part-time instructional service; then  
   2) for 2024-25, the standard rate as determined by averaging the fall 2024 actual payments for adjunct and overload instructional assignments and the standard benefit rate for part-time instructional service; then  
   3) for 2025-26 the standard rate as determined by averaging the fall 2025 actual payments for adjunct and overload instructional assignments and the standard benefit rate for part-time instructional service.  
   1.2 The increased cost over the previous year’s cost related to contracted instruction such as public safety instructional programs and other contracts.

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

1.3 The determination of actual staffing level utilized, increased contracted instruction costs, and actual enrollment growth revenues received for the contract year shall be made no later than sixty (60) days following the close of the district’s fiscal year-end. Potential State funding deficits may reduce expected growth revenue. The records maintained by the District Office Business Services Department shall be used to determine actual staffing levels.

1.4 The cost of additional counselors required to maintain a counselor/student ratio of 900:1. The cost will be based upon the average salary and fringe benefit annual contract cost in the contract year for adjunct and overload counselors.  
1.4.1 such positions shall be authorized as a continuing appropriation for the start of the following fiscal year; and  
1.4.2 continuing growth funds committed for the additional authorized counseling positions and set aside for this purpose in the contract year shall be proportionately distributed to the unit on a one-time-only basis; then  

1.5 The cost of additional full-time faculty required to be hired as specified in Title V provisions (faculty obligation number). The incremental salary and fringe benefits costs due to conversion of part-time instructional and counseling FTE to regular instructional and counseling positions and salary and benefit costs of other non-classroom faculty positions shall be funded from Growth Funds. The 2022-23 rate for converted instructional FTE is using the 2023-24 STRS employer rate is $40,942. The 2022-23 rate for new or re-authorized regular faculty positions (164 or 174 day) is $106,497 and $120,656, respectively. The established District contribution costs towards health benefits shall also be considered. Calculated standard costs for required faculty hires pursuant to Title V provisions shall be determined annually and typically increases by salary schedule and fringe benefit improvements provided in 2023-24 through 2025-26 as applicable;  
1.5.1 Continuing growth funds shall be committed for any positions authorized in the contract year; and  
1.5.2 The salary and benefit costs of the additional full-time faculty hired shall consider whether such hires were for the start of the spring semester or the following fall semester. Any unused continuing growth funds set aside for this purpose in the contract year shall be proportionately distributed to the unit on a one-time-only basis; then  

1.6 The salary and fringe benefit cost of additional classified positions which are needed as a result of district enrollment growth or new educational sites.  
1.6.1 The maximum number of additional full-time equivalent (FTE) classified staff required due to enrollment growth shall be based upon the District’s current growth factor.

1.6.1 The percentage assigned by the state multiplied by the total classified FTE level authorized for the year. Authorized classified FTE includes White Collar, Blue Collar, Supervisory and Confidential positions funded with general purpose revenues. Classified positions (FTE) which are funded from categorical resources/revenues are excluded from this computation.

1.6.2 For any given contract year, it is the District’s intent to distribute the additional classified staff funded from growth funds across all classified units; then

1.6.3 The additional classified FTE shall be in place no earlier than the spring semester of the contract year or July 1 of the succeeding year.

1.6.4 The actual number of additional classified staff (FTE) authorized for the contract year and the related salary and benefit costs of such positions shall be funded from continuing growth funds.

1.6.5 The cost of any retroactive salary improvements for the additional classified positions which are authorized in a given contract year shall be provided from growth funds at $95,000 per FTE, based on the average salary from the prior year 1% calculation and the 2026-27 PERS projected rate of 28.70%; and

1.6.6 Any unused continuing growth funds in the contract year shall be proportionately distributed to the unit on a one-time-only basis.

1.7 Additional administrative positions shall not be funded from growth funds.

1.8 The net Growth funds shall be proportionately allocated to LRCFT in accordance with Appendix A. The difference between the current employer contributions for STRS and PERS and the rates used in 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 shall be credited back as a one-time resource until required.

1.9 The cost savings or cost reductions related to those items listed below shall be calculated and applied as an additional source of funds. Items previously funded from Growth revenues are:

1.9.1 Cost reductions associated with the actual instructional FTE utilized for the academic year based upon the average of the Fall / Spring third week instructional FTE level which is below the previous year’s actual instructional staffing level. The standard 2022-23 part-time cost per FTE of $70,060, as defined per Section 1.1, shall be used to determine instructional cost savings, and

1.9.2 Cost reductions in the contract year attributed to the annual salary and fringe benefit cost due to a reduced number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) counselors required per the terms of the LRCFT contract. The previous year’s required counseling FTE shall be used as a base to

1.10 Available Growth Revenue for 2024-25 and 2025-26 shall be determined in the same manner as 2023-24 contract year except that:
1.10.1 The actual instructional staffing levels expressed in full-time equivalent (FTE) terms in either 2024-25 or 2025-26 compared to the actual FTE level of the previous year shall be determined for the particular contract year as well as the standard cost; and the actual cost for contract instruction for the 2024-25 and 2025-26 compared to the cost charged in the previous year, and
1.10.2 The change in authorized level, the conversion of part-time to regular FTE and classified positions shall be determined using the basis described for the 2023-24 year and the salary schedule and fringe benefit rates in effect for the 2024-25 and 2025-26 years.

![Appendix G Department Chair Compensation](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Appendix+G+Department+Chair+Compensation)

Compensation for Department Chairs is initially set based on department FTE (or FTEF for counseling and library departments) as shown below. In some cases, Department Chair workload necessitates increased compensation above these standard levels. The Department Chair Compensation Form can be used to explain the need for increased compensation beyond this initial placement. The form is to be completed by the current Department Chair (or other department faculty representative) and the Dean, then submitted to the appropriate Vice President. The submission deadline is two weeks after the department election results are announced. Copies of signed Department Chair Compensation Forms will be kept on file by LRCCCD for at least 3 years, and will be provided to LRCFT upon request.

### Initial Department Chair Compensation Table

| Dept FTE/FTEF:          | Level | Chair Reassigned Time* | Anticipated Average Hours/Week** |
|-------------------------|-------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Less than 5 FTE        | 1     | 0.1 FTE per semester   | 3.5 hours                         |
| 5.0 to less than 10.0 FTE | 2   | 0.2 FTE per semester   | 7 hours                           |
| 10.0 to less than 16.0 FTE | 3  | 0.3 FTE per semester   | 10.5 hours                        |
| 16.0 to less than 25 FTE | 4   | 0.4 FTE per semester   | 14 hours                          |
| More than 25 FTE       | 5     | 0.5 FTE per semester***| 17.5 hours                        |

*Chairs are required to take the chair reassigned time as part of their full-time load. Levels 1-3 chairs may combine fall and spring reassigned time if needed in order to take a course release in either fall or spring.  
**The anticipated average hours per week in the Chair Compensation table is for determining department chair compensation only. The anticipated average hours per week for department chairs may not accurately reflect the total number of hours a department chair is expected or required to work each work day, week, or semester. The Chair Compensation Table may not be used to determine the hourly work week expectations or work hours for any LRCFT members.  
***0.5 FTE per semester shall be the maximum reassigned time available to any Department Chair.

Effective June 30, 2026, the above changes related to Appendix G, Article 2.2.4, and the Department Chair Compensation Form shall be incorporated as part of the 2026-2029 successor agreement unless the District or Federation indicate their desire to discontinue or renegotiate the Appendix G.
