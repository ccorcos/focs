**Budget Request Summary:**  
The proposed project will construct a new affordable student housing complex on the American River College (ARC) campus. The new student housing complex will have the capacity to house 272 low-income students and will be approximately 37,909 Assignable Square Feet (ASF) / 50,040 Gross Square Feet (GSF). The complex is expected to be located south of campus at the southern end of Stadium Parking at the corner of College Oak Drive and Winding Way. The proposed housing complex is anticipated to include 1 unit – Resident Director Apartment (950-Apartment), 12 units - single occupancy (910-Sleep/Study without Toilet/Bath), and 130 units - double occupancy (910-Sleep/Study without Toilet/Bath). Common areas are to include toilet/bath, along with the following eight (8) ancillary/student support service spaces: package center, laundry room, lounge, shared kitchens, study, tutoring/workshop spaces, food pantry and mental health services specifically intended to support the basic needs and academic success of participating low-income students.

The proposed affordable student housing complex is anticipated to have a total project cost of $448,136,000 (escalated to midpoint of construction). The College is proposing 100% of this development for low-income students and the entire complex is anticipated to be State-Supportable (0% Locally Funded). The College does not currently have sufficient local funds to augment or contribute to this project. Total project cost includes completion of design documents, DSA plan check fees, legal/specialty services, permits/fees, project management, construction, and group II equipment.

The primary goal of the proposed student housing project is to support student success by meeting students’ essential physiological needs. By providing low-cost student housing and ancillary/student support service spaces, the College is looking to increase enrollment, Full Time Equivalent Students (FTES), retention, and engagement; along with cultivating diversity, inclusion and belonging on campus. Per the College’s Institutional Equity Plan, “Equity is focused on providing educational opportunities and support that meet the needs of the community, especially those who are historically underserved, marginalized, and/or disproportionately impacted.” Alleviating housing insecurities for students, faculty/staff, and the community will help close the equity gap and provide a holistic approach to student learning.

**AMERICAN RIVER COLLEGE**  
**FY 2024-25**

Based on May 2022 California Department of Housing and Community Development data, Sacramento County’s Area Median Income (AMI) for a single-room occupancy unit type was $71,550. For the purposes of this Student Housing Grant Program, the maximum single-room monthly rental rate that ARC could charge would be $894 per month ($71,550 x 50% x 30% = $10,733 annual rent / 12 months = $894 monthly rent). ARC plans to offer its traditional single occupancy units at $764.70 per bed and traditional double occupancy units at $764.70 per bed to low-income students. The Resident Director apartment unit is anticipated to not generate revenue since the rent from this unit will be included within the employee compensation package. The College is committed to first offering housing to low-income students at a rental rate of approximately $765 per bed, which is approximately 14% below the $894 monthly rent per bed maximum.

As of July 2023, ARC has completed a student housing market feasibility study, financial feasibility analysis, and schematic building design efforts. Next steps for the proposed project will be to finish design documents, obtain Division of State Architect (DSA) approval, and start construction. Completing the design process is anticipated to take approximately 6 months and could be completed as early as December 2024. Following completion of construction documents, the College will review and approve plans in anticipation to take approximately 6 months. Given the anticipated time schedule, the proposed project could be ready for construction groundbreaking as early as September 2025.

The College is committed to requiring low-income students renting the proposed housing facility to enroll in a minimum average of 12 degree-applicable units per semester-term (or quarterly-term equivalent) to facilitate timely degree completion. The minimum unit load requirement may be temporarily reduced if the College deems a student demonstrates an exceptional circumstance. Eligible low-income students renting the proposed facility will be permitted to live in the building for the full academic or calendar year, so long as the student remains enrolled at the College. Renewal of housing in the facility for subsequent academic or calendar years will require the student to demonstrate compliance with minimum average enrollment requirements.

### A. Purpose of the Project:  
**Background/History**  
Founded in 1955 as California’s 61st public junior college, American River College was previously known as American River Junior College District. Prior to its California Public Junior College establishment, the College’s history includes Grant Union Junior College/Grant Technical College, which was established in 1942 to train civilian personnel for national service during World War II. The College did not move to its permanent 153-acre site location until 1958, and it wasn’t until 1965 that the college became a part of the Los Rios Community College District and changed its name to American River College. Today, ARC is one of the larger higher education institutions in California and the largest of its four-College District. ARC offers a large selection of academic and career-oriented associate degrees and programs designed to prepare students to enter the workforce or transfer to four-year universities.

Housing in the Sacramento area has risen exponentially in recent years and continues to be an impediment not only for educational attainment, but overall well-being. ARC does not currently offer student housing; therefore, this affordable student housing complex can fill a critical need for students. An on-campus affordable student housing complex will be able to improve the College’s ability to assist traditionally vulnerable and disenfranchised students and encourage faster degree and transfer completion rates.

According to the California Community College Chancellor Office’s Datamart, ARC enrolled approximately 41,491 students and generated approximately 17,176 Full-Time Equivalent Students (FTES) during the 2021-22 academic year. During the same academic year, approximately 53% of students at ARC received either a California College Promise Grant, Fee Waiver, Pell Grant, CalWORKs Grant, or other financial aid grant source (21,881 students), representing students of lower income households. These low-income students may benefit from a low-income student housing complex that offers rents below market rates.

In 2022, the College embarked upon initial planning studies to determine the feasibility of affordable student housing on campus. To date, the College has completed a feasibility/demand study, financial feasibility analysis, site evaluations, implementation planning, and pre-schematic design efforts.

![STATE OF CALIFORNIA Capital Outlay Budget Change Proposal (COBCP) - Cover Sheet DF-151 (REV 07/21) Modified for the CCC Affordable Student Housing Program AMERICAN RIVER COLLEGE FY 2024-25 Problem Statement According to the US Census for Sacramento County, approximately 65% of housing units are single family homes and 58% are owner-occupied, which shows more than half of Sacramento County housing market to be unsuitable for a single student irrespective of income status. Additional preliminary market research via US Census also shows median rent of $1,512 with approximately 51% of renters paying over $1,500 in monthly rent. These high monthly housing rents are not ideal for full-time students seeking to further their education while living safely and independently. American River College does not currently offer any form of student housing and therefore has not been able to adequately serve the unmet demand of low-income or housing insecure student populations. With over half of ARC’s students considered low-income and receiving financial aid in the 2021-22 academic year, there is sufficient evidence to support the demand for affordable student housing. According to market research, the City of Sacramento does not have a sufficient inventory of affordable housing or shelters for low-income or unhoused populations. The most recent data available from the US Census (E5_County_State_2022) shows California’s rental vacancy rate at 6.7% while Sacramento County has a rental vacancy rate of 3.9%. A low rental vacancy rate indicates a low stock of rental units exacerbating competition and rising prices. In addition, approximately 46% of residents renting in Sacramento pay 35% percent or more of their gross monthly income in rent. Ideally, a renter’s level of income to housing expenditure should be approximately 33% or less of their gross monthly income. With nearly half of Sacramento renters paying more than the ideal housing expenditure ratio, affordable housing is an on-going concern. Due to recent impacts of COVID-19 on the labor force and remote working, Sacramento County has seen a large influx of migration from the more costly Bay Area residents. This influx has contributed to high rental rates and low rental vacancy rates, creating further hardships for low-income students and their families. By alleviating the stock of affordable housing in the community, ARC hopes to increase their FTES considering only approximately 16% of ARC students were considered Full-Time (12.0+ unit load) in Fall 2022. ARC offers numerous vocational education programs and other specialized programs that are not readily in the area. These types of Career-Technical Educational (CTE) and vocational education programs typically require in-person instruction and a full-time curriculum with extended in-person hours. For many community college students, being a full-time student is difficult with high cost of living expenses. The proposed project would allow historically disenfranchised students the opportunity to enroll in these types of programs and engage in other campus support services/programs. Housing Need/Demand In Fall 2022, Student Housing Demand Surveys were conducted and analyzed by Servitas to determine student demand for on-campus housing. The email based online survey was conducted at each of the four Los Rios Community College District College’s independently. The purpose of the surveys was to understand student housing needs and demand, desired floor plan(s) and 4.1](https://example.com)

student’s financial affordability for on-campus student housing. The surveys concluded that ARC had the highest demand for student housing within the entire district.

ARC’s Student Housing Demand Survey provided 1,564 individual responses out of 18,171 emails sent yielding a statistically valid response rate of 8.6% with an overall 99% confidence level and 3.2% margin of error. Based on survey responses and Fall 2022 enrollment (27,342 students), Servitas estimates that ARC currently has a housing demand of approximately 2,394 beds. Based on the survey, 74% of students would consider student housing and 71% of students would be interested in two-bedroom units at a least expensive cost.

The proposed affordable student housing complex may offer varying unit styles and occupancy options, along with the added value of living on campus. Area Median Income (AMI) for California county are updated annually by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). Based on May 2022 HCD data, Sacramento County’s Area Median Income (AMI) for a single-room occupancy unit type was $71,550. For the purposes of this Student Housing Grant Program, the maximum single-room monthly rental rate that ARC could charge would be $894 per month ($71,550 x 50% x 30% = $10,733 annual rent / 12 months = $894 monthly rent). ARC plans to offer its traditional single occupancy units at $764.70 per bed and traditional double occupancy units at $764.70 per bed to low-income students. The Resident Director apartment unit is anticipated to not generate revenue since the rent from this unit will be included in the employee compensation package. The College is committed to first offering housing to low-income students at a rate of approximately $765 per bed, which is approximately 14% below the $894 monthly rent per bed maximum.

**Project Description & Goals**  
The proposed project will construct a new student housing complex that has the capacity to house approximately 272 students. The new student housing complex will be approximately 37,909 Assignable Square Feet (ASF) / 50,040 Gross Square Feet (GSF) and feature traditional residence hall single (one-person) and double (two-person) units. The complex is anticipated to be located at the southern end of Stadium Parking at the corner of College Oak Drive and Winding Way. This is an ideal location due to its distance from the parking garage access roads and roundabout, which are heavily trafficked during peak hours.

The proposed building design is to include fully furnished single occupancy and double occupancy units with kitchenette that includes mini-refrigerator and microwave. Within the building there will be a total of 1 unit – Resident Director Apartment (950-Apartment), 12 units - single occupancy (910-Sleep/Study without Toilet/Bath), and 130 units - double occupancy (910-Sleep/Study without Toilet/Bath). Common areas on each floor include toilet/bath, along with the following seven (7) ancillary/student support service spaces: package center, laundry room, lounge, shared kitchens, study/tutoring spaces, food pantry and mental health services specifically intended to support the basic needs and academic success of participating low-income students. The College plans to offer its traditional single occupancy units at $764.70 per bed and traditional double occupancy units at $764.70 per bed to low-income students. The 1 unit-Resident Director apartment will be included in employee compensation, and therefore will not generate revenue.

# AMERICAN RIVER COLLEGE
## FY 2024-25

The College is committed to first offer housing to low-income students at a rental rate of approximately $765 per bed, which is 14% below the $894 monthly rent per bed maximum.

The primary goals of the proposed student housing project will be to provide low-income student housing on campus and design housing facilities to function as living-learning communities to promote student success. By meeting students’ essential physiological needs and by providing dedicated studies and other student support spaces, the College is looking to increase enrollment, Full Time Equivalent Students (FTES), retention, and engagement; along with cultivate diversity, inclusion and belonging on campus. Alleviating housing insecurities for students, faculty/staff, and the community will help close the equity gap and provide a holistic approach to student learning. The College aims to increase its ability to serve a larger number of historically unserved communities and students.

As of July 2023, ARC has completed a student housing market feasibility study, financial feasibility analysis, and schematic building design. Next steps for the proposed project will be to finish design documents, obtain Division of State Architect (DSA) approval, and start construction. Completing the design process is anticipated to take approximately 6 months and could be completed as early as December 2024. Following completion of construction documents, DSA review and approval of plans is anticipated to take approximately 6 months. Given the anticipated time schedule, the proposed project could be ready for construction groundbreaking as early as September 2025.

The proposed project is requesting Affordable Student Housing Grant funding to complete design, DSA approval, and construction. This project will be 100% state supportable, and therefore, all units will be priced and rented to low-income students. The College is requesting a total state funding of $48,136,000 (escalated to midpoint of construction) for the proposed project and is represented by the following categories/costs:

| Activity                          | Proposed State Funding |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Preliminary Plans & Working Drawings | $3,497,000           |
| Hard Construction                  | $36,815,000          |
| Soft Construction                  | $5,844,000           |
| Total Construction                 | $42,659,000          |
| Equipment (Group II)              | $1,980,000           |
| **TOTAL STATE FUNDING REQUEST**   | **$48,136,000**      |
| (CCI 8823 / EPI 5455 - ESCALATED TO MIDPOINT) |                       |

This project is 100% state-supportable, and the College is requesting 100% of state-supportable costs ($48,136,000) to be state funded. There are 272 state supportable low-income beds within the proposed project. The state funded cost per bed is approximately $176,971 (escalated to midpoint of construction). The College is committed to constructing the proposed project within the resource needs identified in this proposal.

### Operation/Maintenance Model
The College would set student housing rates and other grant constraints according to state requirements, while the collection of fees and daily operations/maintenance is anticipated to be outsourced. Residential life and/or other programs within the building to enhance student development will more than likely be operated and maintained by ARC. The proposed project would likely be operated and maintained by outsourcing a property management company under ARC. Furthermore, the College may enter into a project management agreement with an entity who is responsible for the delivery of the project during construction.

The College anticipates annual costs for operating/maintaining the facility to be approximately $1,333,063. Any net revenue that may be generated by the proposed facility could be used by the College to support equipment needs within the facility, on-going or one-time maintenance needs, temporary reduction in low-income student rental rates, institutional support services (including strengthening transfer pathways with 4-year institutions), or other community benefit.

### B. Consistency with Government Code Section 65041.1:
**Does the recommended solution (project) promote infill development by rehabilitating existing infrastructure and how? Explain.**

The California Community Colleges are exempt from the specific provisions of the Government Code Section.

The proposed project is a new construction, and the facility is anticipated to be constructed on an existing parking lot (Stadium Parking) at the farthest southern point of the College campus. Per site evaluation efforts this on-campus location was identified as the ideal location. This project is anticipated to include connection to existing campus sewer, water, and electrical infrastructure and does include site preparation of District property.

**Does the project improve the protection of environmental and agricultural resources by protecting and preserving the state’s most valuable natural resources? Explain.**

The California Community Colleges are exempt from the specific provisions of the Government Code Section.

The proposed project will limit site work to the area of campus already in use by an existing parking lot and areas not heavily surrounded by forest land, mature trees, or wildlife habitats. The proposed project will be included in the College’s updated Facilities Master Plan and accompanying Environmental Impact Report (EIR) documents. Appropriate environmental mitigation measures and monitoring plan will be implemented during construction of the project.

**Does the project encourage efficient development patterns by ensuring that infrastructure associated with development, other than infill, support efficient use of land and is appropriately planned for growth? Explain.**

The California Community Colleges are exempt from the specific provisions of the Government Code Section.

The proposed project will use land available for development on campus efficiently; is planned to be constructed adjacent to existing campus buildings that encourage a synergy between students housed on campus and instruction; is located on-campus in an area currently in use by an existing lot that is readily available for re-purpose; is consistent with goals within the College’s Facilities Master Plan; is served by adequate transportation and other essential utilities/services; and minimizes ongoing costs to taxpayers.

   - Maximum Low-Income Monthly Rental Rate per Bed = (30% x 50% x $71,550/12) = $894  
   - Low-Income Units (272 Total Beds) – Monthly Rent:  
     - Traditional Single Occupancy (12 Beds) = $764.70/Bed (14% less than maximum)  
     - Traditional Double Occupancy (260 Beds) = $764.70/Bed (14% less than maximum)  

   b. Itemize the estimated monthly or annual costs associated with operating and maintaining the facility, not including operational costs associated with any ancillary facilities that may be co-located, such as dining, academic and student support services spaces, basic needs centers, and student healthcare centers:  
   - Annual itemized costs associated with operating and maintaining the facility (including ancillary/student support services) are estimated to be approximately $1,333,063. When removing Student Services Programs and Student Housing Support expenses, the annual operating and maintenance cost is anticipated to be approximately $1,196,498.  
   - The College has modeled a total cost of ownership for this project which is included within Section 14.1 of this project proposal.

c. Does estimated annual revenue from student rents exceed the estimated operational and maintenance expenses associated with the proposed project?  
☑ Yes ☐ No  

If yes, please indicate the amount of the net revenue and describe the intended use of the net revenue:  
It is the College’s goal to generate just enough annual revenue to break-even in relation to operational and maintenance costs. According to the College’s Total Cost of Ownership model, the anticipated annual revenues collected from the proposed project will be negligible in relation to operational and maintenance costs. In the first year, net operating income is anticipated to be $991,639.  

In years where there is positive net revenue generated from the proposed facility, the College intends to use these funds to support equipment needs, one-time maintenance needs, increased utility costs, temporary reduction in low-income student rental rates, institutional support services (including strengthening transfer pathways to 4-year institutions), or other community/public benefit.  

d. The units will be subject to a recorded affordability restriction for the life of the facility:  
☑ Yes ☐ No  

C. The applicant commits to constructing the proposed Student Housing Grant project within the resource needs identified in the proposal:  
☑ Yes ☐ No  

D. The applicant commits to first offer the housing available from the facilities to low-income students, as defined in Education Code Section 17200:  
☑ Yes ☐ No  

(Note: In meeting this requirement, a campus may calculate the rental savings and number of low-income students that would be served by the student housing constructed pursuant to this section, and place the calculated number of students qualifying for the reduced rental rate throughout the campus’s available housing.)  

a. Does the applicant intend to place low-income students who would be served by the proposed project in other student housing facilities for the campus(es)?  
☐ Yes ☑ No  

If yes, please describe the intended plan for placement of qualifying low-income students among the campus(es’) available housing stock:  
ARC does not own or operate student housing. This proposed project will construct a new student housing complex that has the capacity to house approximately 272 students. Qualifying low-income students exceeding the 272-bed capacity will more than likely be put on a waitlist. A waitlist would suggest the need for additional student housing and could guide further discussions and planning.

E. The applicant commits to require any students renting housing in the facilities to take a minimum average of 12 degree-applicable units per semester term, or the quarterly equivalent, to facilitate timely degree completion:  
☐ Yes  ☑ No  

(Note: Eligible students renting housing in the facilities shall be permitted to live in the facilities for the full academic or calendar year so long as the student remains enrolled in the applicable campus, but renewal of housing in the facility in subsequent years requires the student to demonstrate compliance with unit requirements.)  

F. Describe how the receipt of a grant will result in a public benefit, such as providing low-cost student housing and reduced rents, reducing students’ total cost of attendance, serving more low-income students, or other tangible benefits that would not be practical without the grant for student housing. Also describe how this housing is more affordable than what is available in the community:  

Receipt of a grant for the proposed student housing project will result in the following public benefits:  
- Increase supply of affordable housing within the community  
- Provide needed low-cost, on-campus student housing  
- Provide reduced rents for low-income students  
- Increase the College’s ability to service a larger number of low-income students by providing them with affordable housing  
- Increased enrollment and FTES (full time equivalent students) for the College  
- Support student success by meeting students’ essential physiological needs for secure housing and by providing dedicated student study spaces  

Based on US Census data, the median rent paid in Sacramento County was $1,512 per month. The low-income student housing beds within this project will be offered at a rental rate of $765 per month, which is approximately 49% less than the median rent in Sacramento County.  

2. For a Student Housing Grant, respond to the following:  
A. Describe how the proposed project will help the campus(es) meet established equity goals:  

This project will increase the ability for the College to reduce equity gaps by increasing access, retention, transfer rates, and program completion rates for a segment of students traditionally underrepresented. Affordable student housing will allow these students the opportunity to access support services/programs, as well as be a part of campus community and academics. Inclusion of more students on campus can help foster a sense of belonging and provide learning and career opportunities.

B. Using the definition of low-income students described in subdivision (d) of Education Code Section 17200, submit available data on the number of low-income students proposed to be served by the campus(es), and as a percent of the campus(es)’ overall low-income student population(s). This includes the percentage of students who are Pell Grant eligible, percentage of students who are Pell Grant recipients, and percentage of students who are using financial assistance (e.g. Pell, Promise grants):  

During the 2021-22 academic year, 21,881 unduplicated students at ARC received financial aid through the Board of Governors Fee Waiver, California Promise Grant, or Pell Grant. To qualify for these grants a student must qualify as low-income. During the same academic year, the College enrolled 41,491 unduplicated students. Thus, approximately 53% of ARC students may be considered low-income during the 2021-22 academic year. However, the number and percentage of low-income students could be higher because some students may not have navigated the financial aid process correctly or applied for financial aid.  

3. For a Student Housing Grant, provide more detail on any of the following scenarios if applicable to the proposal and not already addressed in the Capital Outlay Budget Change Proposal:  
A. If acquiring and/or renovating commercial property, provide additional narrative detail on the plan for acquiring and renovating the commercial space:  
Not Applicable – Proposed project will be on campus property.  

B. Is this a district level project? (District level projects are separate from campus level projects and require their own data sets to score.)  
☐ Yes ☒ No  
Note: Campus selected upon project creation will not impact a district level student housing project in any way.  

C. Is this an intersegmental project with other higher educational institutions or other partnerships?  
☐ Yes ☒ No  
a. Select the appropriate partnership option. If other, specify that partnership:  
☐ CSU ☐ UC ☐ P3 ☐ Other Not applicable  

b. Please provide additional narrative detail on the name of the partner institution, the benefit being provided through this collaboration, and the proposed number of units and beds available for each participating campus:  
The proposed project is planned to be for American River College students only.

# BOARD OF GOVERNORS ENERGY AND SUSTAINABILITY POLICY

This project will be designed to exceed Title 24, Part 6 Energy Code by at least 15%, consistent with the Board of Governors Energy and Sustainability policy. The design should incorporate sustainable goals for site and energy efficiency, water use reduction, storm water management, occupant health as well as minimizing the buildings impact on the environment both by design and construction. Strategies may consider:

- Natural and native planting materials may be incorporated around the building to minimize, if not eliminate, the irrigation demand.
  
- Concrete walkways may be minimized to reduce stormwater runoff and promote natural filtration into the soil as well as a reduction in the heat island effect.
  
- Solar heat gain reduction measures may be used. Overhangs may be incorporated to shade glazing. Low E glazing may be incorporated to reduce heat gain. Roofing may incorporate cool roofing to reduce the heat island effect and heat gain.
  
- Heating and cooling may be provided by a highly energy efficient HVAC system with controls designed to maximize efficiency.
  
- Natural lighting may be incorporated into most spaces.
  
- Energy saving lighting may include automatic lighting controls and sensors.
  
- Interior materials may be low in volatile organic compounds, high in recycled content.
  
- Water efficient fixtures, faucets and devices may be incorporated.
  
- A strict recycling program may be required during construction.
  
- Requested participation in the local utility’s energy incentive program, if available.
  
- Photovoltaic panels may be incorporated where appropriate.
  
- Durable systems and finishes with long life cycles that minimize maintenance and replacement.
  
- Optimization of indoor environmental quality for occupants with high efficiency industrial ventilation.
  
- Utilization of environmentally preferable products and processes, such as recycled content materials and recyclable materials.
  
- Procedures that monitor, trend and report operational performance as compared to the optimal design and operating parameters to the campus’ central energy management system.
  
- Space may be provided throughout the building to support an active recycling program.
