# Economic Forecast

- GDP growth is projected to slow as high interest rates and tighter financial conditions dampen consumer and business demand
- Job growth is projected to slow, in line with the slowing of GDP growth
- Inflation will continue to slow due to FOMC action and resolution of supply chain issues
- Additional layoffs in the tech industry and additional disruptions in the banking sector pose significant risks to the forecast

# Legislative Analyst’s Office Criticism
- Roughly two-thirds chance revenues will come in below May Revision estimates
- Revenue estimates are $11 billion lower than the May Revision estimates
- Adopting lower revenue estimates reduces required spending
- Significantly reduce discretionary spending
- Proposition 98 can only support roughly 5% of the roughly 8% COLA

# X, Y, Z Budget Assumptions
- X Budget assumes full restoration of pandemic decline
- Y Budget assumes additional 2% on top of X Budget
- Z Budget assumes additional 2% on top of Y Budget
- 8.22% COLA for SCFF
<!-- Page 11 -->
# Importance of Restoring
- Fully restored instructional programming
- Additional full-time and part-time faculty positions
- Getting out of “hold harmless”
- Compensation adjustments instead of backfilling revenue loss
<!-- Page 12 -->
# Future Concerns
- Continuing to mitigate impacts of the pandemic
  - Less students with financial need attending college
  - Future demographic analysis provided this fall on restoration
- Uncertain revenue and budget model at the state level
  - Ongoing budget allocation made with one-time revenue
  - Predictions of moderately high inflation with flat revenue
- Uncertainty with global conflicts
  - Russia and Ukraine
  - China and Taiwan
