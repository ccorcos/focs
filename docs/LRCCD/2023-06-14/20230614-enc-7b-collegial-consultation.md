# How do we consult collegially?  
Los Rios P-3421  

- 2.4 The Board of Trustees, or designee, shall consult collegially with the District Academic Senate when adopting policies and procedures on academic and professional matters. Formal recommendations from the District Academic Senate shall be presented by the President of the District Academic Senate  
  - in writing to the Chancellor’s Cabinet or  
  - in regular meeting reports to the Board of Trustees.  

![Page 17](https://example.com/page17)
<!-- Page 19 -->
# Limitations:
- 4.1 Recognizing that the work of the District must continue against a background of timelines and deadlines produced by legislation, state and federal agencies and the general welfare of its primary clients, the District Academic Senate affirms that the
  - **Board of Trustees clearly retains the right to act without the benefit of recommendation if the responsible recommending body fails to perform or fails to perform in a reasonably timely way.**
  - The District Academic Senate also recognizes that **effective shared involvement in the District/College(s) decision making processes depends on the willingness and ability of all affected parties to share vital information in a timely and useable way.**
<!-- Page 20 -->
# NOT collegial consultation

- Just sharing information
- Information items on meeting agendas
- Working closely with individual faculty members
- Discipline-specific meetings
- Conversations with individuals
- Conversations with constituency leaders without opportunity to bring items back constituency for formal action
- Information disseminated verbally from administration to AS Presidents
- Informal gatherings where discussions include governance or decision making
- Decisions made without opportunity for formal input from constituencies
- Providing written reports on decisions that have already been made
- Ensuring compliance
