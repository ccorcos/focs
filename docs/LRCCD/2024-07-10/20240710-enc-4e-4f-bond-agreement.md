<!-- Page 8 -->
(c) Subsequent Events; Amendments to Official Statement. If, between the date hereof and the date which is 25 days after the End of the Underwriting Period for the Bonds (determined pursuant to Section 17), an event occurs which would cause the information contained in a final Official Statement, as then supplemented or amended, to contain an untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make such information therein, in the light of the circumstances under which it was presented, not misleading, the District will notify the Underwriter, and, if in the opinion of the District or the Underwriter, such event requires the preparation and publication of a supplement or amendment to said Official Statement, the District will forthwith prepare and furnish to the Underwriter (at the expense of the District) a reasonable number of copies of an amendment of or supplement to said Official Statement (in form and substance satisfactory to the Underwriter) which will amend or supplement said Official Statement so that they will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances existing at the time said Official Statement is delivered to prospective purchasers, not misleading. If such notification shall be given subsequent to the Closing, the District also shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, such additional legal opinions, certificates, instruments and other documents as the Underwriter may reasonably deem necessary to evidence the truth and accuracy of any such supplement or amendment to said Official Statement.

(d) Application of Proceeds. The District will apply the proceeds from the sale of the Bonds for the purposes specified in the Bond Resolutions and as described in the Official Statement.

If an amended Official Statement is prepared in accordance with Section 10(c) of this Purchase Agreement during the “Primary Offering Disclosure Period” (as defined herein), and if required by an applicable SEC Rule or MSRB rule, the Underwriter also shall make the required filings of the amended Official Statement. The “Primary Offering Disclosure Period” is used as defined in MSRB Rule G-32 and shall end on the twenty-fifth day after the Closing Date.

11. Establishment of Issue Price.

(a) Actions to Establish Price. The Underwriter agrees to assist the District in establishing the issue price of the Bonds and shall execute and deliver to the District at Closing an “issue price” or similar certificate, together with the supporting pricing wires or equivalent communications, substantially in the form attached hereto as Appendix B, with such modifications
<!-- Page 9 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

as may be appropriate or necessary, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriter, the District and Bond Counsel, to accurately reflect, as applicable, the sales price or prices or the initial offering price or prices to the public of the Bonds. As applicable, all actions to be taken by the District under this section to establish the issue price of the Bonds may be taken on behalf of the District by the District's municipal advisor and any notice or report to be provided to the District may be provided to the District's municipal advisor.

(b) 10% Test. Except for the maturities (if any) identified in Appendix A for which the Hold-The-Offering-Price Rule described in (c) below shall apply, the District will treat the first price at which 10% of each maturity of the Bonds (the “10% test”) is sold to the public as the issue price of that maturity. At or promptly after the execution of this Purchase Agreement, the Underwriter shall report to the District the price or prices at which it has sold to the public each maturity of Bonds. If at that time the 10% test has not been satisfied as to any maturity of the Bonds, the Underwriter agrees to promptly report to the District the prices at which it sells the unsold Bonds of that maturity to the public. That reporting obligation shall continue, whether or not the Closing Date (as defined herein) has occurred, until either (i) the Underwriter has sold all Bonds of that maturity or (ii) the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity, provided that, the Underwriter's reporting obligation after the Closing Date may be at reasonable periodic intervals or otherwise upon request of the District or Bond Counsel. For purposes of this Section, if Bonds mature on the same date but have different interest rates, each separate CUSIP number within that maturity will be treated as a separate maturity of the Bonds.

(c) Hold-The-Offering-Price Rule. The Underwriter confirms that it has offered the Bonds to the public on or before the date of this Purchase Agreement at the offering price or prices (the “initial offering price”), or at the corresponding yield or yields, set forth in Appendix A. Appendix A also sets forth, as of the date of this Purchase Agreement, the maturities, if any, of the Bonds for which the Underwriter represents that (i) the 10% test has been satisfied (assuming Purchase Agreement) and (ii) the 10% test has not been satisfied and for which the District and the Underwriter agree that the restrictions set forth in the next sentence shall apply, which will allow the District to treat the initial offering price to the public of each such maturity as of the sale date as the issue price of that maturity (the “hold-the-offering-price rule”). So long as the hold-the-offering-price rule remains applicable to any maturity of the Bonds, the Underwriter will neither offer nor sell unsold Bonds of that maturity to any person at a price that is higher than the initial offering price to the public during the period starting on the sale date and ending on the earlier of the following:

(1) the close of the fifth (5th) business day after the sale date; or

(2) the date on which the Underwriter has sold at least 10% of that maturity of the Bonds to the public at a price that is no higher than the initial offering price to the public.

The Underwriter will advise the District promptly after the close of the fifth (5th) business day after the sale date whether it has sold 10% of that maturity of the Bonds to the public at a price that is no higher than the initial offering price to the public.

(d) Selling Group or Third-Party Distribution Agreements. The Underwriter confirms that: 

-9-
<!-- Page 10 -->
(i) any selling group agreement and any third-party distribution agreement relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together with the related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each dealer who is a member of the selling group and each broker-dealer that is a party to such third-party distribution agreement, as applicable:

(A) (i) to report the prices at which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each maturity allocated to it, whether or not the Closing Date has occurred, until either all Bonds of that maturity allocated to it have been sold or it is notified by the Underwriter that the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity, provided that, the reporting obligation after the Closing Date may be at reasonable periodic intervals or otherwise upon request of the Underwriter, and (ii) to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable, if and for so long as directed by the Underwriter,

(B) to promptly notify the Underwriter of any sales of Bonds that, to its knowledge, are made to a purchaser who is a related party to an underwriter participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (each such term being used as defined below), and

(C) to acknowledge that, unless otherwise advised by the dealer or broker-dealer, the Underwriter shall assume that each order submitted by the dealer or broker-dealer is a sale to the public.

(ii) any selling group agreement relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together with the related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each dealer that is a party to a third-party distribution agreement to be employed in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public to require each broker-dealer that is a party to such third-party distribution agreement to (A) report the prices at which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each maturity allocated to it, whether or not the Closing Date has occurred, until either all Bonds of that maturity allocated to it have been sold or it is notified by the Underwriter or the dealer that the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity, provided that the reporting obligation after the Closing Date may be at reasonable periodic intervals or otherwise upon request of the Underwriter or the dealer, and (B) comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable, if and for so long as directed by the Underwriter or the dealer and as set forth in the related pricing wires.

The District acknowledges that, in making the representations set forth in this Section, the Underwriter will rely on (i) in the event a selling group has been created in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, the agreement of each dealer who is a member of the selling group to comply with the requirements for establishing issue price of the Bonds, including, but not limited to, its agreement to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable to the Bonds, as set forth in a selling group agreement and the related pricing wires, and (ii) in the event that a third-party distribution agreement was employed in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, the agreement of each broker-dealer that is a party to such agreement to comply with the requirements for establishing issue price of the Bonds, including, but not limited to, its agreement to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable to the Bonds, as set forth in the third-party distribution agreement and the related pricing wires. The District further acknowledges that the Underwriter shall not be liable for the failure of any dealer who is a member

-10-
<!-- Page 11 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  

of a selling group, or of any broker-dealer that is a party to a third-party distribution agreement, to comply with its corresponding agreement to comply with the requirements for establishing issue price of the Bonds, including, but not limited to, its agreement to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable to the Bonds.

(e) Sales to the Public; Definitions. The Underwriter acknowledges that sales of any Bonds to any person that is a related party to an underwriter participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (each such term being used as defined below) shall not constitute sales to the public for purposes of this section. Further, for purposes of this section:

(i) “public” means any person other than an underwriter or a related party,

(ii) “underwriter” means (A) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract with the District (or with the lead underwriter to form an underwriting syndicate) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public and (B) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract directly or indirectly with a person described in clause (A) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (including a member of a selling group or a party to a third-party distribution agreement participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public),

(iii) a purchaser of any of the Bonds is a “related party” to an underwriter if the underwriter and the purchaser are subject, directly or indirectly, to (i) more than 50% common ownership of the voting power or the total value of their stock, if both entities are corporations (including direct ownership of one corporation of another), (ii) more than 50% common ownership of their capital interests or profits interests, if both entities are partnerships (including direct ownership by one partnership of another), or (iii) more than 50% common ownership of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation or the capital interests or profit interests of the partnership, as applicable, if one entity is a corporation and the other entity is a partnership (including direct ownership of the applicable stock or interests by one entity of the other), and

(iv) “sale date” means the date of execution of this Purchase Agreement by all parties.
