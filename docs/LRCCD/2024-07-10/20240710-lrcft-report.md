# LRCFT Report to the LRCCD Board of Trustees
**July 10, 2024**

The LRCFT in late July is sending a group of 8 faculty to attend the AFT’s national convention in Houston, Texas.

The LRCFT was proud to join the CFT and college students from all 3 higher education systems in providing “me too” testimony on CFT co-sponsored bill AB 2586, the “College Opportunity for All”. This bill enables students enrolled in any of the higher ed systems to work on college campuses. The bill provides important opportunities for our undocumented students without work authorization to attain financial stability and avail themselves of work and internship opportunities needed for degree completion. We are encouraged to hear that the legislature has passed the bill.

A special thank you to FLC student Jose David Rangel Martinez for accepting CFT’s invitation to provide witness testimony to the committee. And thank you to the FLC Undoc Resource Center for supporting David and for mentoring students through the legislative process.

I am also pleased to report that the LRCFT met with the District several times over the past two months to discuss Los Rios faculty participation in the Prison and Reentry Program. The 9 faculty prison teachers whom the District investigated have now been completely exonerated. As we actively negotiate a new MOU with the District this month, the LRCFT Exec. Board will convene a special meeting off contract to potentially approve the new draft agreement prior to the start of the semester. I look forward to putting this year long PREP controversy behind us as we move forward in our relationship with the District.

In closing, I want to announce the unfortunate passing of Anthony Barcellos. He was a long-time math instructor at ARC and a former LRCFT board member. We will miss his humor and thoughtful contributions to our union. Our thoughts go out to his family and students during this difficult time.

Thank you.
