**Los Rios Community College District Indigenous Land Acknowledgment Statement**  
In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our four colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

Changes related to student eligibility are proposed to comply with the requirements of AB 1736 which added exceptions to student eligibility requirements for DSPS students.

**STATUS:**  
The Associated Student Body of American River College passed the proposed changes to its Constitution during the college-wide student election held in April 2024.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the proposed amendments to the American River College Student Senate’s Constitution.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** July 10, 2024

---

**SUBJECT:** Public Hearing: College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) Memorandum of Understanding: Rio Valley Charter School  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 1,2,3  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Dr. Albert Garcia,  
Sacramento City College President  
**CONSENT/ROUTINE**  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION** X  
**INFORMATION**  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
With the passage of Assembly Bill 102, California community college districts are authorized to enter into a College and Career Access Pathways Partnership with a charter school to expand opportunities for high school students to take college courses during the regular school day and for community colleges to claim apportionment. To go forward with this program, the law requires community college districts and charter schools to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding approved by the governing boards of both the community college district and the charter school.

---

**STATUS:**  
The proposed College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is between the Los Rios Community College District and Rio Valley Charter School. There are minor language changes regarding location and facilities in this MOU compared to our standard CCAP MOU template. The purpose of the MOU is to offer and expand dual enrollment opportunities for students who may not already be college bound or who are underrepresented in higher education, with the goal of developing seamless pathways from high school to community college. Beginning Fall 2024, classes will be offered to high school students attending Rio Valley Charter School. At the completion of these classes, students will earn credit toward multiple degree or certificate programs within their relevant college’s catalog.

---

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees conduct a public hearing; adopt the proposed CCAP MOU between the Los Rios Community College District and Rio Valley Charter School and authorize the Chancellor or his designee(s) to execute the MOU and any future augmentations, amendments, renewals, extensions, or other modifications to the MOU.

**OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT/PRESIDENT**

Jamey Nye, Deputy Chancellor  
Los Rios Community College District (LRCCD)  
1919 Spanos Court  
Sacramento, CA 95825  

Re: Out of Service Area Dual Enrollment Agreement  

Dear LRCCD,

California Education Code, section 76004(e), states that “a community college district shall not enter into a CCAP partnership with a school district within the service area of another community college district, except where an agreement exists, or is established, between those community college districts authorizing that CCAP partnership.”

This letter confirms that San Joaquin Delta College agrees to the CCAP partnership between Sacramento City College (SCC) and Pacific Charter Institute (PCI) where students from PCI schools that are located outside of San Joaquin Delta College service area will be served by SCC in the following program and terms:

- College and Career Readiness Pathway, starting Fall 2024

San Joaquin Delta Community College retains the right to terminate this agreement during any subsequent term. If further information from me is needed, you may contact me via email at lisa.lawrenson@deltacollege.edu.

Sincerely,  
Lisa Aguilera Lawrenson, Ph.D.  
Superintendent/President

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** July 10, 2024  

**SUBJECT:** Public Hearing: College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) Memorandum of Understanding: John Adams Academy  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 1,2,3  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item B  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Dr. Art Pimentel, Folsom Lake College President  
**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
With the passage of Assembly Bill 102, California community college districts are authorized to enter into a College and Career Access Pathways Partnership with a charter school to expand opportunities for high school students to take college courses during the regular school day and for community colleges to claim apportionment. To go forward with this program, the law requires community college districts and charter schools to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding approved by the governing boards of both the community college district and the charter school.  

**STATUS:**  
The proposed College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is between the Los Rios Community College District and John Adams Academy. There are no significant differences between this MOU and our standard CCAP MOU template. The purpose of the MOU is to offer and expand dual enrollment opportunities for students who may not already be college bound or who are underrepresented in higher education, with the goal of developing seamless pathways from high school to community college. Beginning Fall 2024, classes will be offered to high school students attending John Adams Academy. At the completion of these classes, students will earn credit toward multiple degree or certificate programs within their relevant college’s catalog.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees conduct a public hearing; adopt the proposed CCAP MOU between the Los Rios Community College District and John Adams Academy and authorize the Chancellor or his designee(s) to execute the MOU and any future augmentations, amendments, renewals, extensions, or other modifications to the MOU.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** July 10, 2024

---

**SUBJECT:** Public Hearing: College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) Memorandum of Understanding: Mountainside Middle College High School  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 1,2,3  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item C  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Dr. Art Pimentel, Folsom Lake College President  
**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
With the passage of Assembly Bill 102, California community college districts are authorized to enter into a College and Career Access Pathways Partnership with a charter school to expand opportunities for high school students to take college courses during the regular school day and for community colleges to claim apportionment. To go forward with this program, the law requires community college districts and charter schools to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding approved by the governing boards of both the community college district and the charter school.

---

**STATUS:**  
The proposed College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is between the Los Rios Community College District and Mountainside Middle College High School. The only significant differences between this MOU and our standard CCAP MOU template are in the facilities sections 7.H. and 12., as a result of the high school existing on the SCC El Dorado Center Campus. The purpose of the MOU is to offer and expand dual enrollment opportunities for students who may not already be college bound or who are underrepresented in higher education, with the goal of developing seamless pathways from high school to community college. Beginning Fall 2024, classes will be offered to high school students attending Mountainside Middle College High School. At the completion of these classes, students will earn credit toward multiple degree or certificate programs within their relevant college’s catalog.

---

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees conduct a public hearing; adopt the proposed CCAP MOU between the Los Rios Community College District and Mountainside Middle College High School and authorize the Chancellor or his designee(s) to execute the MOU and any future augmentations, amendments, renewals, extensions, or other modifications to the MOU.

**BACKGROUND:**  
Regular furniture upgrades are necessary across the District to maintain effective, efficient, and code-compliant learning and working environments for our students, faculty, and staff.

The aim is to offer District various options at consistent and predictable prices for the next five years.

**STATUS:**  
The Request for Proposals (RFP) was advertised, and invitations to qualify were sent to firms specializing in modular furniture systems. The committee evaluated the bids based on product pricing, labor rates, product quality, industry qualifications, and experience. After assessing these criteria, all four bidders were found to be responsive and qualified. As a result, the following bidders were selected to provide districtwide furniture and related services:

| Bidder                     | Selected by Committee |

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** July 10, 2024  

**SUBJECT:** Resolution No. 2024:07 – 2024 Refunding General Obligation Bonds, Series A  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** POS/BPA  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item E  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**STATUS:**  
The 2002 Series E Bonds were issued in June 2013 with a true interest cost of 4.177% and an optional redemption provision allowing the bonds to be refinanced any date commencing on August 1, 2023. The ability to redeem the 2002 Series D Bonds at this time, coupled with the low current interest rate environment, present an opportunity to refund the 2002 Series E Bonds by issuing 2024 Refunding General Obligation Bonds, Series A in the amount not to exceed $15 million. The projected taxpayer savings of the refunding is approximately $3.2 million. The projected savings are net of all costs of issuance including financial advisory, legal, rating, and underwriting fees. This projection is based on current market interest rates, and the amount of savings ultimately generated by the refunding will depend on bond market conditions on the day of the refunding bond sale.  

The Refunding Bonds will be sold on a negotiated basis to an Underwriting firm which will be designated by the Chancellor based upon proposals received by the District and upon consultation with the Municipal Advisor. As with other bond issuances, the District retains the guidance of a fiduciary agent that protects the interests of the electorate of the District. The Refunding Bonds will be sold to the Underwriter under a Bond Purchase Agreement which is approved pursuant to the Resolution, a copy of which is included in the information presented to the Board. A copy of the Preliminary Official Statement.

describing the financing, which will be updated following the sale to the Official Statement, is also included in the information presented to the Board.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve Resolution No. 2024:07 authorizing the issuance and sale of the 2024 Refunding General Obligation Bonds, Series A in the maximum principal amount of $15,000,000 to refund the outstanding 2002 Series E Bonds issued under Measure A and approving related documents and official actions, including the Preliminary Official Statement and Bond Purchase Agreement relating to the refunding bonds.

APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS**

**Section 3.01. Sale of Refunding Bonds.** Pursuant to Section 53583 of the Refunding Bond Law, the Board hereby authorizes the negotiated sale of the Refunding Bonds to an underwriting firm, investment banking firm or other financial institution which is designated by the Chancellor to serve as the Underwriter, based upon proposals received by the District and upon consultation with the Municipal Advisor. The Refunding Bonds shall be sold pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement in substantially the form on file with the Clerk of the Board with such changes therein, deletions therefrom and modifications thereto as a District Representative may approve, such approval to be conclusively evidenced by the execution and delivery of the Bond Purchase Agreement. The Underwriter’s discount shall not exceed 0.50% of the par amount of the Refunding Bonds, and the Refunding Bonds shall be sold at interest rates which ensure that the debt service savings requirement set forth in Section 53552 of the Refunding Bond Law are met. The Board hereby authorizes a District Representative to execute and deliver the final form of the Bond Purchase Agreement in the name and on behalf of the District.

In accordance with Section 53583(c) of the Refunding Bond Law, the Board has determined to authorize the sale of the Refunding Bonds at a negotiated sale for the following reasons: (i) a negotiated sale provides more flexibility to choose the time and date of the sale which is often advantageous in the municipal bond market; (ii) the involvement of the Underwriter in preparing documents, rating agency presentations and structuring bonds generally enhances the quality and results of the bond offering; (iii) a negotiated sale will permit the time schedule for the issuance and sale of the Refunding Bonds to be expedited, if necessary; (iv) a negotiated sale provides the District access to the Underwriter’s trading desk for providing estimates of the cost of various bond structures (yields, discounts, premiums and maturities) for the purpose of evaluating alternative potential bond structures with the goal of producing the best match between the District’s objectives and investor acceptance and demand; and (v) a negotiated sale provides time for the Underwriter to educate potential investors about the District and the Refunding Bonds with the goal of maximizing investor orders and reducing the interest cost on the day of bond pricing.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any of the terms of the Refunding Bonds may be established or modified under the Bond Purchase Agreement. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between this Resolution and the Bond Purchase Agreement relating to the terms of the Refunding Bonds, the provisions of the Bond Purchase Agreement shall be controlling.

Section 3.06. Bond Insurance. If the District is advised by the Municipal Advisor and the Underwriter that it is in the best financial interests of the District to obtain a municipal bond insurance policy insuring the payment of debt service on the Refunding Bonds, a District Representative is authorized to apply for such insurance and to take all actions and execute all documents and certifications relating thereto.

Section 3.07. Professional Services. The firm of Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, has previously been engaged to act as the District’s bond counsel and disclosure counsel, and the firm of Dale Scott & Company Inc. has previously been engaged to act as the Municipal Advisor, in connection with the issuance and sale of general obligation bonds of the District, including the Refunding Bonds. The estimated costs of issuance associated with the issuance of the Refunding Bonds are set forth in Appendix B.

Section 3.08. Actions to Close Bond Issuance. Each District Representative and any and all other officers of the District are each authorized and directed in the name and on behalf of the District to execute and deliver any and all certificates, requisitions, agreements, notices, consents and other documents, which they or any of them might deem necessary or appropriate in order to consummate the lawful issuance, sale and delivery of the Refunding Bonds. Whenever in this Resolution any officer of the District is authorized to execute or countersign any document or take any action, such execution, countersigning or action may be taken on behalf of such officer by any person designated by such officer to act on their behalf if such officer is absent or unavailable.

### Section 4.01. Security for the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall be a general obligation of the District payable from the levy of ad valorem taxes upon all property within the District which are subject to taxation by the District, without limitation as to rate or amount. The District hereby directs the County to levy, and hereby directs all other counties whose jurisdiction includes properties within the District to levy, on all the taxable property in the District, in addition to all other taxes, a continuing direct and ad valorem tax annually during the period the Refunding Bonds are Outstanding in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when due, including the principal of any Refunding Bonds upon the mandatory sinking fund redemption thereof under Section 2.03(b), which moneys when collected will be paid to the Director of Finance and placed in the Debt Service Fund.

The principal of and interest on Refunding Bonds do not constitute a debt of the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions other than the District, or any of the officers, agents or employees thereof, and neither the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions nor any of the officers, agents or employees thereof are liable therefor.

### Section 4.02. Establishment of Debt Service Fund.
The District hereby directs the Director of Finance to establish, hold and maintain while the Refunding Bonds are Outstanding an interest and sinking fund for the Refunding Bonds (the “Debt Service Fund”), which shall be maintained by the Director of Finance as a separate account, distinct from all other funds of the District, into which shall be deposited the proceeds of any taxes levied under Section 4.01.

The Debt Service Fund is hereby pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when and as the same become due, including the principal of any Term Bonds required to be paid upon the mandatory sinking fund redemption thereof. Upon the written request of the District filed with the County, amounts in the Debt Service Fund shall be transferred by the County to the Paying Agent to the extent required to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when due.

### Section 4.03. Disbursements From Debt Service Fund.
The County shall administer the Debt Service Fund and make disbursements therefrom in the manner set forth in this Section. The County shall transfer amounts on deposit in the Debt Service Fund, to the extent necessary to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when due and payable, to the Paying Agent which, in turn, shall pay such moneys to DTC to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds. DTC will thereupon make payments of principal and interest on the Refunding Bonds when due.

## OTHER COVENANTS OF THE DISTRICT

### Section 5.01. Punctual Payment.
The District shall punctually pay, or cause to be paid, the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds, in strict conformity with the terms of the Refunding Bonds and this Resolution, and shall faithfully observe and perform all of the conditions, covenants and requirements of this Resolution and of the Refunding Bonds. Nothing herein contained prevents the District from making advances of its own moneys howsoever derived to any of the uses or purposes permitted by law.

### Section 5.02. Books and Accounts; Financial Statements.
The District shall keep, or cause to be kept, proper books of record and accounts, separate from all other records and accounts of the District in which complete and correct entries are made of all transactions relating to the expenditure of the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds. Such books of record and accounts shall at all times during business hours be subject to the inspection of the Paying Agent and the Owners of not less than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Refunding Bonds then Outstanding, or their representatives authorized in writing.

### Section 5.03. Protection of Security and Rights of Refunding Bond Owners.
The District shall preserve and protect the security of the Refunding Bonds and the rights of the Refunding Bond Owners, and will warrant and defend their rights against all claims and demands of all persons. Following the issuance of the Refunding Bonds by the District, the Refunding Bonds shall be incontestable by the District.

### Section 5.04. Tax Covenants.
It is intended that the Refunding Bonds shall be issued as federally tax-exempt obligations under the Tax Code. However, a portion of the Refunding Bonds may be issued on a federally taxable basis in the event and to the extent required under the Tax Code in the opinion of Bond Counsel. The following provisions of this Section apply to those Refunding Bonds which are issued on a federally tax-exempt basis.

(a) **Private Activity Bond Limitation.** The District shall assure that the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds are not so used as to cause the Refunding Bonds to satisfy the private business tests of Section 141(b) of the Tax Code or the private loan financing test of Section 141(c) of the Tax Code.

(b) **Federal Guarantee Prohibition.** The District shall not take any action or permit or suffer any action to be taken if the result of the same would be to cause any of the Refunding Bonds to be “federally guaranteed” within the meaning of Section 149(b) of the Tax Code.

-19-  
173
<!-- Page 174 -->
(c) No Arbitrage. The District shall not take, or permit or suffer to be taken by the Paying Agent or the County or otherwise, any action with respect to the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds which, if such action had been reasonably expected to have been taken, or had been deliberately and intentionally taken, on the Closing Date would have caused the Refunding Bonds to be "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of Section 148 of the Tax Code.

(d) Maintenance of Tax-Exemption. The District shall take all actions necessary to assure the exclusion of interest on the Refunding Bonds from the gross income of the Owners of the Refunding Bonds to the same extent as such interest is permitted to be excluded from gross income under the Tax Code as in effect on the Closing Date.

(e) Rebate of Excess Investment Earnings to United States. The District shall calculate or cause to be calculated excess investment earnings with respect to the Refunding Bonds which are required to be rebated to the United States of America under Section 148(f) of the Tax Code, and shall pay the full amount of such excess investment earnings to the United States of America in such amounts, at such times and in such manner as may be required under the Tax Code, if and to the extent such Section 148(f) is applicable to the Refunding Bonds. Such payments shall be made by the District from any source of legally available funds of the District. The District shall keep or cause to be kept, and retain or cause to be retained for a period of six years following the retirement of the Refunding Bonds, records of the determinations made under this subsection (e). In order to provide for the administration of this subsection (e), the District may provide for the employment of independent attorneys, accountants and consultants compensated on such reasonable basis as the District deems appropriate.

Neither the County nor the Paying Agent has any duty to monitor the compliance by the District with any of the covenants contained in this Section.

Section 5.05. Continuing Disclosure. The District hereby approves the Continuing Disclosure Certificate in substantially the form attached as an appendix to the Preliminary Official Statement for the Refunding Bonds, together with any changes therein or modifications thereof which are approved by a District Representative, and the execution thereof by a District Representative shall be conclusive evidence of the approval of any such changes or modifications. The District hereby covenants and agrees that it will comply with and carry out all of the provisions of the Continuing Disclosure Certificate, which shall be executed by a District Representative and delivered on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Resolution, failure of the District to comply with the Continuing Disclosure Certificate does not constitute a default by the District hereunder or under the Refunding Bonds; however, any Participating Underwriter (as that term is defined in the Continuing Disclosure Certificate) or any holder or beneficial owner of the Refunding Bonds may take such actions as may be

**Section 5.06. CDIAC Annual Reporting.** The District shall comply with the provisions of California Government Code Section 8855(k) with respect to annual reporting to the California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission. Said reporting will occur at the times and include the types of information as set forth therein. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Resolution, failure of the District to comply with said reporting shall not constitute a default by the District hereunder or under the Refunding Bonds.

**Section 5.07. Further Assurances.** The District shall adopt, make, execute and deliver any and all such further resolutions, instruments and assurances as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out the intention or to facilitate the performance of this Resolution, and for the better assuring and confirming unto the Owners of the Refunding Bonds of the rights and benefits provided in this Resolution.

**ARTICLE VI**

**THE PAYING AGENT**

**Section 6.01. Appointment of Paying Agent; Approval of Paying Agent Agreement.** The Director of Finance is hereby appointed to act as Paying Agent for the Refunding Bonds and, in such capacity, shall also act as registration agent and authentication agent for the Refunding Bonds. The Paying Agent undertakes to perform such duties, and only such duties, as are specifically set forth in this Resolution, and even during the continuance of an event of default with respect to the Refunding Bonds, no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Resolution against the Paying Agent. The Board hereby approves the form of a Paying Agent Agreement between the District and the County in substantially the form on file with the Clerk of the Board with such changes therein, deletions therefrom and modifications thereto as a District Representative may approve, such approval to be conclusively evidenced by the execution and delivery of the Paying Agent Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between the provisions of this Resolution and the Paying Agent Agreement, the provisions of the Paying Agent Agreement shall be controlling.

The District may remove the Paying Agent initially appointed, and any successor thereto, and may appoint a successor or successors thereto, but any such successor shall be a bank or trust company doing business and having an office in the State of California, having a combined capital (exclusive of borrowed capital) and surplus of at least $100,000,000, and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority. If such bank or trust company publishes a report of condition at least annually, under law or to the requirements of any
<!-- Page 176 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

supervising or examining authority above referred to, then for the purposes of this Section the combined capital and surplus of such bank or trust company shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.

The Paying Agent may at any time resign by giving written notice to the District and the Refunding Bond Owners of such resignation. Upon receiving notice of such resignation, the District shall promptly appoint a successor Paying Agent by an instrument in writing. Any resignation or removal of the Paying Agent and appointment of a successor Paying Agent will become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor Paying Agent.

**Section 6.02. Paying Agent May Hold Refunding Bonds.** The Paying Agent may become the owner of any of the Refunding Bonds in its own or any other capacity with the same rights it would have if it were not Paying Agent.

**Section 6.03. Liability of Paying Agent.** The recitals of facts, covenants and agreements in this Resolution and in the Refunding Bonds constitute statements, covenants and agreements of the District, and the Paying Agent assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the same, nor makes any representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Resolution or of the Refunding Bonds, nor shall incur any responsibility in respect thereof, as set forth in this Resolution. The Paying Agent is not liable in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder, except for its own negligence or willful default.

In the absence of bad faith, the Paying Agent may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Paying Agent and conforming to the requirements of this Resolution.

The Paying Agent is not liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a responsible officer in the absence of the negligence of the Paying Agent.

No provision of this Resolution requires the Paying Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it has reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

The Paying Agent may execute any of the powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Paying Agent is not responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder.

**Section 6.04. Notice to Paying Agent.** The Paying Agent may rely and is protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any notice, resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report, warrant, bond or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or proper parties. The Paying Agent may consult with counsel, who may be counsel to the District, with regard to legal questions, and the opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance therewith.

Whenever in the administration of its duties under this Resolution the Paying Agent deems it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof is specifically prescribed in this Resolution) may, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Paying Agent, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate of the District, and such certificate shall be full warrant to the Paying Agent for any action taken or suffered under the provisions of this Resolution upon the faith thereof, but in its discretion the Paying Agent may, in lieu thereof, accept other evidence of such matter or may require such additional evidence as to it may seem reasonable.

**Section 6.05. Compensation; Indemnification.** The District shall pay to the Paying Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered under this Resolution, and also all reasonable expenses, charges, counsel fees and other disbursements, including those of their attorneys, agents and employees, incurred in and about the performance of their powers and duties under Resolution. The District further agrees to indemnify the Paying Agent against any liabilities which it may incur in the exercise and performance of its powers and duties hereunder which are not due to its negligence or bad faith.

**ARTICLE VII**

**REMEDIES OF REFUNDING BOND OWNERS**

**Section 7.01. Remedies of Refunding Bond Owners.** Any Refunding Bond Owner has the right, for the equal benefit and protection of all Refunding Bond Owners similarly situated:

(a) by mandamus, suit, action or proceeding, to compel the District and its members, officers, agents or employees to perform each and every term, provision and covenant contained in this Resolution and in the Refunding Bonds, and to require the carrying out of any or all such covenants and agreements of the District and the fulfillment of all duties imposed upon it;

Section 7.02. Remedies Not Exclusive. No remedy herein conferred upon the Owners of Refunding Bonds shall be exclusive of any other remedy and that each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or thereafter conferred on the Refunding Bond Owners.

(a) to add to the covenants and agreements of the District in this Resolution, other covenants and agreements to be observed by the District which are not contrary to or inconsistent with this Resolution as theretofore in effect;

(b) to confirm, as further assurance, any pledge under, and to subject to any lien or pledge created or to be created by, this Resolution, of any moneys, securities or funds, or to establish any additional funds or accounts to be held under this Resolution;

(c) to cure any ambiguity, supply any omission, or cure or correct any defect or inconsistent provision in this Resolution, in a manner which does not materially adversely affect the interests of the Refunding Bond Owners in the opinion of Bond Counsel filed with the District; or

(d) to make such additions, deletions or modifications as may be necessary or desirable to assure exemption from federal income taxation of interest on the Refunding Bonds.

If the District pays all Outstanding Refunding Bonds and also pays or causes to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the District, then and in that case, at the election of the District (evidenced by a certificate of a District Representative filed with the Paying Agent, signifying the intention of the District to discharge all such indebtedness and this Resolution), and notwithstanding that any Refunding Bonds have not been surrendered for payment, this Resolution and other assets made under this Resolution and all covenants, agreements and other obligations of the District under this Resolution shall cease, terminate, become void and be completely discharged and satisfied, except only as provided in Section 9.02(b). In that event, upon request of the District, the Paying Agent shall cause an accounting for such period or periods as may be requested by the District to be prepared and filed with the District and shall execute and deliver to the District all such instruments as may be necessary to evidence such discharge and satisfaction, and the Paying Agent shall pay over, transfer, assign or deliver to the District all moneys or securities or other property held by it under this Resolution which are not required for the payment or redemption of Refunding Bonds not theretofore surrendered for such payment or redemption.

Bond at the address appearing on the Bond registration books at the close of business on the 15th day of the calendar month next preceding such Interest Payment Date (the “Record Date”); provided, however, that at the written request of the registered owner of Bonds in an aggregate principal amount of at least $1,000,000, which written request is on file with the Paying Agent before any Record Date, interest on such Bonds shall be paid on each succeeding Interest Payment Date by wire transfer in immediately available funds to such account of a financial institution within the United States of America as shall be specified in such written request.

This Bond is one of a series of $________ of Bonds issued for the purpose of raising money to refinance outstanding general obligation bond indebtedness of the District, issued under a resolution of the Board of Trustees of the District adopted on July 10, 2024 (the “Bond Resolution”). This Bond and the issue of which this Bond is a part are payable as to both principal and interest from the proceeds of the levy of ad valorem taxes on all property subject to such taxes in the District, which taxes are unlimited as to rate or amount.

The principal of and interest on this Bond does not constitute a debt of the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions other than the District, or any of the officers, agents and employees thereof, and neither the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions, nor any of the officers, agents and employees thereof shall be liable herefor. In no event shall the principal of and interest on this Bond be payable out of any funds or properties of the District other than ad valorem taxes levied upon all taxable property in the District.

The Bonds of this issue are issuable only as fully registered Bonds in the denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. This Bond is exchangeable and transferable for Bonds of other authorized denominations at the principal corporate trust office of the Paying Agent, by the Registered Owner or by a person legally empowered to do so, upon presentation and surrender hereof to the Paying Agent, together with a request for exchange or an assignment signed by the Registered Owner or by a person legally empowered to do so, in a form satisfactory to the Paying Agent, all subject to the terms, limitations and conditions provided in the Bond Resolution. Any tax or governmental charges shall be paid by the transferor. The District and the Paying Agent may deem and treat the Registered Owner as the absolute owner of this Bond for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of principal or interest and for all other purposes, and neither the District nor the Paying Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

[if applicable:] The Bonds maturing on and before August 1, 20__, are not subject to optional redemption before their respective stated maturities. The Bonds maturing on and after August 1, 20__, are subject to redemption at the option of the District on August 1, 20__, and on any date thereafter, at a redemption

price equal to ___% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed together with interest accruing thereon to the redemption date, without premium.

[[if applicable:]] The Bonds maturing on August 1 in each of the years ____ and _____ are Term Bonds which are subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption on August 1 in each of the years and in the respective principal amounts as set forth in the following tables, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed (without premium), together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption. If some but not all of the Term Bonds have been redeemed under the preceding paragraph, the aggregate principal amount of Term Bonds to be redeemed under this paragraph will be reduced as designated in written notice filed by the District with the Paying Agent.

**Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption of Bonds Maturing on August 1, ____**

| Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Date (August 1) | Principal Amount To Be Redeemed |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
|                                                    |                                  |

The Paying Agent shall give notice of the redemption of the Bonds at the expense of the District. Such notice shall specify: (a) that the Bonds or a designated portion thereof are to be redeemed, (b) the numbers and CUSIP numbers of the Bonds to be redeemed, (c) the date of notice and the date of redemption, (d) the place or places where the redemption will be made, and (e) descriptive information regarding the Bonds including the dated date, interest rate and stated maturity date. Such notice shall further state that on the specified date there shall become due and payable upon each Bond to be redeemed, the portion of the principal amount of such Bond to be redeemed, together with interest accrued to such date, and that from and after such date interest with respect thereto shall cease to accrue and be payable.

Notice of redemption shall be given to the registered owner of the Bonds, to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and to the District and the respective Owners of any Bonds designated for redemption at their addresses appearing on the Bond registration books, in every case at least 20 days, but not more than 60 days, before the redemption date; provided that neither failure to receive such notice nor any defect in any notice shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for the redemption of such Bonds.

Neither the District nor the Paying Agent will be required: (a) to issue or transfer any Bond during a period beginning with the opening of business on the 15th calendar day next preceding either any Interest Payment Date or any date of

Unless this Bond is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation (“DTC”), to the Trustee for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any Bond issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.

It is certified, recited and declared that all acts and conditions required by the Constitution and laws of the State of California to exist, to be performed or to have been met precedent to and in the issuing of the Bonds in order to make them legal, valid and binding general obligations of the District, have been performed and have been met in regular and due form as required by law; that payment in full for the Bonds has been received; that no statutory or constitutional limitation on indebtedness or taxation has been exceeded in issuing the Bonds; and that due provision has been made for levying and collecting ad valorem property taxes on all of the taxable property within the District in an amount sufficient to pay principal and interest when due, and for levying and collecting such taxes the full faith and credit of the District are hereby pledged.

This Bond shall be not valid or obligatory for any purpose and shall not be entitled to any security or benefit under the Bond Resolution (described on the reverse hereof) until the Certificate of Authentication below has been manually signed by the Paying Agent.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** July 10, 2024  

**SUBJECT:** Resolution No. 2024:08 – 2024 Refunding General Obligation Bonds, Series B  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** POS/BPA  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item F  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  
**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  

**CONSENT/ROUTINE**  
**FIRST READING**  
**ACTION** X  
**INFORMATION**  

**BACKGROUND:**  
In November 2008, District voters approved Measure M, a $475 million general obligation bond authorization for the construction and modernization of District facilities. Under Measure M, the District has previously issued bonds in the principal amount of $130 million in October 2010 (Series A); $60 million in June 2013 (Series B); $65 million in February 2018 (Series C); $80 million in June 2019 (Series D); and $130 million in July 2021 (Series E). The District issued its Refunding Bonds in December 2017 for the purpose of refinancing the 2008 Series A Bonds, realizing total debt service savings over $14.4 million. The proceeds of the new issue of Refunding Bonds to be authorized under Resolution No. 2024:08 will be applied to refinance the 2008 Series B Bonds.  

**STATUS:**  
The 2008 Series B Bonds were issued in June 2013 with a true interest cost of 4.109% and an optional redemption provision allowing the bonds to be refinanced on any date commencing on August 1, 2023. The ability to redeem the 2008 Series B Bonds at this time, coupled with the low current interest rate environment, present an opportunity to refund the 2008 Series B Bonds by issuing 2024 Refunding General Obligation Bonds, Series B in the amount not to exceed $50 million. The projected net taxpayer savings of the refunding is approximately $12.6 million. The projected savings are net of all costs of issuance including financial advisory, legal, rating, and underwriting fees. This projection is based on current market interest rates, and the amount of savings ultimately generated by the refunding will depend on bond market conditions on the day of the refunding bond sale.  

The Refunding Bonds will be sold on a negotiated basis to an Underwriting firm which will be designated by the Chancellor based upon proposals received by the District and upon consultation with the Municipal Advisor. As with other bond issuances, the District retains the guidance of a fiduciary agent that protects the interests of the electorate of the District. The Refunding Bonds will be sold to the Underwriter under a Bond Purchase Agreement which is approved pursuant to the Resolution, a copy of which is included in the information presented to the Board. A copy of the Preliminary Official Statement describing the financing, which will be updated following the sale to the Official Statement, is also included in the information presented to the Board.  

**192**
<!-- Page 193 -->
RECOMMENDATION:  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve Resolution No. 2024:08 authorizing the issuance and sale of the 2024 Refunding General Obligation Bonds, Series B in the maximum principal amount of $50,000,000 to refund outstanding 2008 Series B Bonds issued under Measure M and approving related documents and official actions, including the Preliminary Official Statement and Bond Purchase Agreement relating to the refunding bonds.

**ARTICLE II**

**TERMS OF REFUNDING BONDS**

**Section 2.01.

or the Underwriter that the requirements of Section 53552 of the Refunding Bond Law have been satisfied.

Section 2.02. Terms of Refunding Bonds.

(a) Terms of Refunding Bonds. The Refunding Bonds shall be issued as fully registered bonds, without coupons, in the form of current interest bonds in the denomination of $5,000 each or any integral multiple thereof. The Refunding Bonds shall be lettered and numbered as the Paying Agent may prescribe, and shall be dated as of the Closing Date.

Interest on the Refunding Bonds shall be payable semiannually on each Interest Payment Date. Each Refunding Bond shall bear interest from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date of registration and authentication thereof unless (i) it is authenticated as of an Interest Payment Date, in which event it shall bear interest from such date, or (ii) it is authenticated prior to an Interest Payment Date and after the close of business on the Record Date preceding such Interest Payment Date, in which event it shall bear interest from such Interest Payment Date, or (iii) it is authenticated prior to the first Record Date, in which event it shall bear interest from the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if interest on any Refunding Bond is in default at the time of authentication thereof, such Refunding Bond will bear interest from the Interest Payment Date which has previously been paid or made available for payment thereof.

(b) Maturities; Basis of Interest Calculation. The Refunding Bonds shall mature on August 1 in the years and in the amounts, and shall bear interest at the rates, as determined upon the sale thereof as provided in the Bond Purchase Agreement. The limits relating to the maximum maturity and interest rates prescribed by the Refunding Bond Law and the Board shall be set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement. Interest on the Refunding Bonds shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

(c) CUSIP Identification Numbers. CUSIP identification numbers shall be printed on the Refunding Bonds, but such numbers do not constitute a part of the contract evidenced by the Refunding Bonds and any error or omission with respect thereto will not constitute cause for refusal of any purchaser to accept delivery of and pay for the Refunding Bonds. Any failure by the District to use CUSIP numbers in any notice to Owners of the Refunding Bonds will not constitute an event of default or any violation of the District’s contract with the Owners and will not impair the effectiveness of any such notice.

(d) Payment. Interest on the Refunding Bonds (including the final interest payment upon maturity or redemption) shall be payable by check, draft or wire of the Paying Agent mailed to the Owner thereof (which shall be DTC so long as the Refunding Bonds are held in the book-entry system of DTC) at such Owner’s address as it appears on the Registration Books at the close of business on the 

-8-

![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)  
preceding Record Date; except that at the written request of the Owner of at least $1,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Refunding Bonds, which written request is on file with the Paying Agent as of any Record Date, interest on any Refunding Bonds will be paid on the succeeding Interest Payment Date to such account as will be specified in such written request. Principal of the Refunding Bonds shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America upon presentation and surrender at the Office of the Paying Agent. The provisions of this Section relating to the payment of the Refunding Bonds shall be subject in all respects to the provisions of Section 2.09 so long as the Refunding Bonds are held in the book-entry system of DTC.

Section 2.03. Redemption.

(a) Optional Redemption. If and as determined upon the sale of the Refunding Bonds, the Refunding Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity, at the option of the District, in whole or in part among maturities on such basis as designated by the District and by lot within a maturity, from any available source of funds, on the dates and at the redemption prices which are set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement.

(b) Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption. If and as determined upon the sale of the Refunding Bonds, any maturity of Refunding Bonds shall be designated as Term Bonds which are subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption on August 1 in each of the years as determined upon the sale of the Refunding Bonds, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed (without premium), together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption. If some but not all of the Term Bonds have been redeemed under the preceding subsection (a) of this Section, the aggregate principal amount of such Term Bonds to be redeemed in each year under this subsection (b) will be reduced in integral multiples of $5,000, as designated in written a Written Request of the District filed with the Paying Agent.

(c) Selection of Refunding Bonds for Redemption. Whenever less than all of the Outstanding Refunding Bonds of any one maturity are designated for redemption, the Paying Agent shall select the Outstanding Refunding Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed by lot in any manner deemed fair by the Paying Agent. For purposes of such selection, each Refunding Bond will be deemed to consist of individual Refunding Bonds of $5,000 denominations, which may be separately redeemed.

(d) Redemption Procedure. The Paying Agent shall cause notice of any redemption to be given at least 20 days but not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption, to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and the respective Owners of any Refunding Bonds designated for redemption, at their addresses appearing on the Registration Books. Such notice shall not be a condition precedent to such redemption and failure to give or to receive any such  
-9-  
202
<!-- Page 203 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

notice shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of such Refunding Bonds. In addition, the Paying Agent shall give notice of redemption to each of the Securities Depositories.

Such notice shall (i) state the redemption date and the redemption price, (ii) if less than all of the then Outstanding Refunding Bonds are to be called for redemption, designate the serial numbers of the Refunding Bonds to be redeemed by giving the individual number of each Refunding Bond or by stating that all Refunding Bonds between two stated numbers, both inclusive, or by stating that all of the Refunding Bonds of one or more maturities have been called for redemption, (iii) require that such Refunding Bonds be then surrendered at the Office of the Paying Agent for redemption at the applicable redemption price, and (iv) state that further interest on such Refunding Bonds will not accrue from and after the redemption date. Any notice of optional redemption of the Refunding Bonds may state that it is conditional, in which case it shall make reference to the right of the District to rescind the notice as set forth in subsection (e) of this Section.

Upon surrender of Refunding Bonds redeemed in part only, the District shall execute and the Paying Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the Owner, at the expense of the District, a new Refunding Bond or Bonds, of the same maturity, of authorized denominations in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Refunding Bond or Bonds.

From and after the date fixed for redemption, if notice of such redemption has been duly given and funds available for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds so called for redemption have been duly provided, such Refunding Bonds as called will cease to be entitled to any benefit under this Resolution other than the right to receive payment of the redemption price, and no interest will accrue thereon on or after the redemption date specified in such notice. The Paying Agent shall cancel all of the Refunding Bonds, and submit a certificate of cancellation to the District.

(e) Right to Rescind Notice of Redemption. The District has the right to rescind any notice of the optional redemption of Refunding Bonds under subsection (a) of this Section by written notice to the Paying Agent on or prior to the dated fixed for redemption. Any notice of redemption shall be cancelled and annulled if for any reason funds will not be or are not available on the date fixed for redemption for the payment in full of the Refunding Bonds then called for redemption. The District and the Paying Agent shall have no liability to the Refunding Bond Owners or any other party related to or arising from such rescission of redemption. The Paying Agent shall give notice of such rescission of redemption to the respective Owners of the Refunding Bonds designated for redemption, at their addresses appearing on the Registration Books, and also to the Securities Depositories and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.

The Paying Agent and the District may treat DTC (or its nominee) as the sole and exclusive owner of the Refunding Bonds registered in its name for all purposes of this Resolution, and neither the Paying Agent nor the District shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. The Paying Agent and the District shall not have any responsibility or obligation to any Depository System Participant, any person claiming a beneficial ownership interest in the Refunding Bonds under or through DTC or a Depository System Participant, or any other person which is not shown on the register of the District as being an owner, with respect to the accuracy of any records maintained by DTC or any Depository System Participant or the payment by DTC or any Depository System Participant by DTC or any Depository System Participant of any amount in respect of the principal or interest with respect to the Refunding Bonds.

**ARTICLE III**  
**SALE OF REFUNDING BONDS;**  
**APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS**  

**Section 3.01. Sale of Refunding Bonds.** Pursuant to Section 53583 of the Refunding Bond Law, the Board hereby authorizes the negotiated sale of the Refunding Bonds to an underwriting firm, investment banking firm or other financial institution which is designated by the Chancellor to serve as the Underwriter, based upon proposals received by the District and upon consultation with the Municipal Advisor. The Refunding Bonds shall be sold pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement in substantially the form on file with the Clerk of the Board with such changes therein, deletions therefrom and modifications thereto as a District Representative may approve, such approval to be conclusively evidenced by the execution and delivery of the Bond Purchase Agreement. The Underwriter’s discount shall not exceed 0.50% of the par amount of the Refunding Bonds, and the Refunding Bonds shall be sold at interest rates which ensure that the debt service savings requirement set forth in Section 53552 of the Refunding Bond Law are met. The Board hereby authorizes a District Representative to execute and deliver the final form of the Bond Purchase Agreement in the name and on behalf of the District.  

In accordance with Section 53583(c) of the Refunding Bond Law, the Board has determined to authorize the sale of the Refunding Bonds at a negotiated sale for the following reasons: (i) a negotiated sale provides more flexibility to choose the time and date of the sale which is often advantageous in the municipal bond market; (ii) the involvement of the Underwriter in preparing documents, rating agency presentations and structuring bonds generally enhances the quality and results of the bond offering; (iii) a negotiated sale will permit the time schedule for the issuance and sale of the Refunding Bonds to be expedited, if necessary; (iv) a negotiated sale provides the District access to the Underwriter’s trading desk for providing estimates of the cost of various bond structures (yields, discounts, premiums and maturities) for the purpose of evaluating alternative potential bond structures with the goal of producing the best match between the District’s objectives and investor acceptance and demand; and (v) a negotiated sale provides time for the Underwriter to educate potential investors about the District and the Refunding Bonds with the goal of maximizing investor orders and reducing the interest cost on the day of bond pricing.  

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any of the terms of the Refunding Bonds may be established or modified under the Bond Purchase Agreement. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between this Resolution and the Bond Purchase Agreement relating to the terms of the Refunding Bonds, the provisions of the Bond Purchase Agreement shall be controlling.

### Section 4.01. Security for the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall be a general obligation of the District payable from the levy of ad valorem taxes upon all property within the District which are subject to taxation by the District, without limitation as to rate or amount. The District hereby directs the County to levy, and hereby directs all other counties whose jurisdiction includes properties within the District to levy, on all the taxable property in the District, in addition to all other taxes, a continuing direct and ad valorem tax annually during the period the Refunding Bonds are Outstanding in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when due, including the principal of any Refunding Bonds upon the mandatory sinking fund redemption thereof under Section 2.03(b), which moneys when collected will be paid to the Director of Finance and placed in the Debt Service Fund.

The principal of and interest on Refunding Bonds do not constitute a debt of the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions other than the District, or any of the officers, agents or employees thereof, and neither the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions nor any of the officers, agents or employees thereof are liable therefor.

### Section 4.02. Establishment of Debt Service Fund.
The District hereby directs the Director of Finance to establish, hold and maintain while the Refunding Bonds are Outstanding an interest and sinking fund for the Refunding Bonds (the "Debt Service Fund"), which shall be maintained by the Director of Finance as a separate account, distinct from all other funds of the District, into which shall be deposited the proceeds of any taxes levied under Section 4.01.

The Debt Service Fund is hereby pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when and as the same become due, including the principal of any Term Bonds required to be paid upon the mandatory sinking fund redemption thereof. Upon the written request of the District filed with the County, amounts in the Debt Service Fund shall be transferred by the County to the Paying Agent to the extent required to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when due.

### Section 4.03. Disbursements From Debt Service Fund.
The County shall administer the Debt Service Fund and make disbursements therefrom in the manner set forth in this Section. The County shall transfer amounts on deposit in the Debt Service Fund, to the extent necessary to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when due and payable, to the Paying Agent which, in turn, shall pay such moneys to DTC to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds. DTC will thereupon make payments of principal and interest on the Refunding Bonds when due.

## OTHER COVENANTS OF THE DISTRICT

### Section 5.01. Punctual Payment.
The District shall punctually pay, or cause to be paid, the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds, in strict conformity with the terms of the Refunding Bonds and of this Resolution, and shall faithfully observe and perform all of the conditions, covenants and requirements of this Resolution and of the Refunding Bonds. Nothing herein contained prevents the District from making advances of its own moneys howsoever derived to any of the uses or purposes permitted by law.

### Section 5.02. Books and Accounts; Financial Statements.
The District shall keep, or cause to be kept, proper books of record and accounts, separate from all other records and accounts of the District in which complete and correct entries are made of all transactions relating to the expenditure of the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds. Such books of record and accounts shall at all times during business hours be subject to the inspection of the Paying Agent and the Owners of not less than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Refunding Bonds then Outstanding, or their representatives authorized in writing.

### Section 5.03. Protection of Security and Rights of Refunding Bond Owners.
The District shall preserve and protect the security of the Refunding Bonds and the rights of the Refunding Bond Owners, and will warrant and defend their rights against all claims and demands of all persons. Following the issuance of the Refunding Bonds by the District, the Refunding Bonds shall be incontestable by the District.

### Section 5.04. Tax Covenants.
It is intended that the Refunding Bonds shall be issued as federally tax-exempt obligations under the Tax Code. However, a portion of the Refunding Bonds may be issued on a federally taxable basis in the event and to the extent required under the Tax Code in the opinion of Bond Counsel. The following provisions of this Section apply to those Refunding Bonds which are issued on a federally tax-exempt basis.

(a) **Private Activity Bond Limitation.** The District shall assure that the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds are not so used as to cause the Refunding Bonds to satisfy the private business tests of Section 141(b) of the Tax Code or the private loan financing test of Section 141(c) of the Tax Code.

(b) **Federal Guarantee Prohibition.** The District shall not take any action or permit or suffer any action to be taken if the result of the same would be to cause any of the Refunding Bonds to be “federally guaranteed” within the meaning of Section 149(b) of the Tax Code.

-19-
212
<!-- Page 213 -->
(c) No Arbitrage. The District shall not take, or permit or suffer to be taken by the Paying Agent or the County or otherwise, any action with respect to the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds which, if such action had been reasonably expected to have been taken, or had been deliberately and intentionally taken, on the Closing Date would have caused the Refunding Bonds to be "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of Section 148 of the Tax Code.

(d) Maintenance of Tax-Exemption. The District shall take all actions necessary to assure the exclusion of interest on the Refunding Bonds from the gross income of the Owners of the Refunding Bonds to the same extent as such interest is permitted to be excluded from gross income under the Tax Code as in effect on the Closing Date.

(e) Rebate of Excess Investment Earnings to United States. The District shall calculate or cause to be calculated excess investment earnings with respect to the Refunding Bonds which are required to be rebated to the United States of America under Section 148(f) of the Tax Code, and shall pay the full amount of such excess investment earnings to the United States of America in such amounts, at such times and in such manner as may be required under the Tax Code, if and to the extent such Section 148(f) is applicable to the Refunding Bonds. Such payments shall be made by the District from any source of legally available funds of the District. The District shall keep or cause to be kept, and retain or cause to be retained for a period of six years following the retirement of the Refunding Bonds, records of the determinations made under this subsection (e). In order to provide for the administration of this subsection (e), the District may provide for the employment of independent attorneys, accountants and consultants compensated on such reasonable basis as the District deems appropriate.

Neither the County nor the Paying Agent has any duty to monitor the compliance by the District with any of the covenants contained in this Section.

Section 5.05. Continuing Disclosure. The District hereby approves the Continuing Disclosure Certificate in substantially the form attached as an appendix to the Preliminary Official Statement for the Refunding Bonds, together with any changes therein or modifications thereof which are approved by a District Representative, and the execution thereof by a District Representative shall be conclusive evidence of the approval of any such changes or modifications. The District hereby covenants and agrees that it will comply with and carry out all of the provisions of the Continuing Disclosure Certificate, which shall be executed by a District Representative and delivered on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Resolution, failure of the District to comply with the Continuing Disclosure Certificate does not constitute a default by the District hereunder or under the Refunding Bonds; however, any Participating Underwriter (as that term is defined in the Continuing Disclosure Certificate) or any holder or beneficial owner of the Refunding Bonds may take such actions as may be -20-  
213
<!-- Page 214 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

necessary and appropriate to compel performance, including seeking mandate or specific performance by court order.

Section 5.06. CDIAC Annual Reporting. The District shall comply with the provisions of California Government Code Section 8855(k) with respect to annual reporting to the California Debt and Investment Advisory Commission. Said reporting will occur at the times and include the types of information as set forth therein. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Resolution, failure of the District to comply with said reporting shall not constitute a default by the District hereunder or under the Refunding Bonds.

Section 5.07. Further Assurances. The District shall adopt, make, execute and deliver any and all such further resolutions, instruments and assurances as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out the intention or to facilitate the performance of this Resolution, and for the better assuring and confirming unto the Owners of the Refunding Bonds of the rights and benefits provided in this Resolution.

ARTICLE VI

THE PAYING AGENT

Section 6.01. Appointment of Paying Agent; Approval of Paying Agent Agreement. The Director of Finance is hereby appointed to act as Paying Agent for the Refunding Bonds and, in such capacity, shall also act as registration agent and authentication agent for the Refunding Bonds. The Paying Agent undertakes to perform such duties, and only such duties, as are specifically set forth in this Resolution, and even during the continuance of an event of default with respect to the Refunding Bonds, no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Resolution against the Paying Agent. The Board hereby approves the form of a Paying Agent Agreement between the District and the County in substantially the form on file with the Clerk of the Board with such changes therein, deletions therefrom and modifications thereto as a District Representative may approve, such approval to be conclusively evidenced by the execution and delivery of the Paying Agent Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between the provisions of this Resolution and the Paying Agent Agreement, the provisions of the Paying Agent Agreement shall be controlling.

The District may remove the Paying Agent initially appointed, and any successor thereto, and may appoint a successor or successors thereto, but any such successor shall be a bank or trust company doing business and having an office in the State of California, having a combined capital (exclusive of borrowed capital) and surplus of at least $100,000,000, and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority. If such bank or trust company publishes a report of condition at least annually, under law or to the requirements of any

-21-
214
<!-- Page 215 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

supervising or examining authority above referred to, then for the purposes of this Section the combined capital and surplus of such bank or trust company shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.

The Paying Agent may at any time resign by giving written notice to the District and the Refunding Bond Owners of such resignation. Upon receiving notice of such resignation, the District shall promptly appoint a successor Paying Agent by an instrument in writing. Any resignation or removal of the Paying Agent and appointment of a successor Paying Agent will become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor Paying Agent.

Section 6.02. Paying Agent May Hold Refunding Bonds. The Paying Agent may become the owner of any of the Refunding Bonds in its own or any other capacity with the same rights it would have if it were not Paying Agent.

Section 6.03. Liability of Paying Agent. The recitals of facts, covenants and agreements in this Resolution and in the Refunding Bonds constitute statements, covenants and agreements of the District, and the Paying Agent assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the same, nor makes any representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Resolution or of the Refunding Bonds, nor shall incur any responsibility in respect thereof, as set forth in this Resolution. The Paying Agent is not liable in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder, except for its own negligence or willful default.

In the absence of bad faith, the Paying Agent may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Paying Agent and conforming to the requirements of this Resolution.

The Paying Agent is not liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a responsible officer in the absence of the negligence of the Paying Agent.

No provision of this Resolution requires the Paying Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it has reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

The Paying Agent may execute any of the powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Paying Agent is not responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder.

**Section 6.04. Notice to Paying Agent.** The Paying Agent may rely and is protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any notice, resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report, warrant, bond or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or proper parties. The Paying Agent may consult with counsel, who may be counsel to the District, with regard to legal questions, and the opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance therewith.

Whenever in the administration of its duties under this Resolution the Paying Agent deems it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof is specifically prescribed in this Resolution) may, in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Paying Agent, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate of the District, and such certificate shall be full warrant to the Paying Agent for any action taken or suffered under the provisions of this Resolution upon the faith thereof, but in its discretion the Paying Agent may, in lieu thereof, accept other evidence of such matter or may require such additional evidence as to it may seem reasonable.

**Section 6.05. Compensation; Indemnification.** The District shall pay to the Paying Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered under this Resolution, and also all reasonable expenses, charges, counsel fees and other disbursements, including those of their attorneys, agents and employees, incurred in and about the performance of their powers and duties under Resolution. The District further agrees to indemnify the Paying Agent against any liabilities which it may incur in the exercise and performance of its powers and duties hereunder which are not due to its negligence or bad faith.

SECTION 9.02. Defeasance of Refunding Bonds.

(a) Discharge of Resolution. Refunding Bonds may be paid by the District in any of the following ways, provided that the District also pays or causes to be paid any other sums payable hereunder by the District:

![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)

If the District pays all Outstanding Refunding Bonds and also pays or causes to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the District, then and in that case, at the election of the District (evidenced by a certificate of a District Representative filed with the Paying Agent, signifying the intention of the District to discharge all such indebtedness and this Resolution), and notwithstanding that any Refunding Bonds have not been surrendered for payment, this Resolution and other assets made under this Resolution and all covenants, agreements and other obligations of the District under this Resolution shall cease, terminate, become void and be completely discharged and satisfied, except only as provided in Section 9.02(b). In that event, upon request of the District, the Paying Agent shall cause an accounting for such period or periods as may be requested by the District to be prepared and filed with the District and shall execute and deliver to the District all such instruments as may be necessary to evidence such discharge and satisfaction, and the Paying Agent shall pay over, transfer, assign or deliver to the District all moneys or securities or other property held by it under this Resolution which are not required for the payment or redemption of Refunding Bonds not theretofore surrendered for such payment or redemption.

(b) Discharge of Liability on Refunding Bonds.

The District may at any time surrender to the Paying Agent for cancellation by it any Refunding Bonds previously issued and delivered, which the District may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and such Refunding Bonds, upon such surrender and cancellation, shall be deemed to be paid and retired.

(c) Deposit of Money or Securities with Paying Agent. Whenever in this Resolution it is provided or permitted that there be deposited with or held in trust by the Paying Agent money or securities in the necessary amount to pay or redeem any Refunding Bonds, the money or securities to be deposited or held may include money or securities held by the Paying Agent in the funds and accounts established under this Resolution and shall be:

(ii) Federal Securities (not callable by the issuer thereof prior to maturity) the principal of and interest on which when due, in the opinion of a certified public accountant delivered to the District, will provide money sufficient to pay the principal or redemption price of and all unpaid interest to maturity, or to the redemption date, as the case may be, on the Refunding Bonds to be paid or redeemed, as such principal or redemption price and interest become due, provided that, in the case of Refunding Bonds which are to be redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption has been given as provided in Section 2.03 or provision satisfactory to the Paying Agent has been made for the giving of such notice.

(d) Payment of Refunding Bonds After Discharge of Resolution. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Resolution, any moneys held by the Paying Agent in trust for the payment of the principal or redemption price of, or interest on, any Refunding Bonds and remaining unclaimed for two years after the principal of all of the Refunding Bonds has become due and payable (whether at maturity or upon call for redemption or by acceleration as provided in this Resolution), if such moneys were held at such date, or two years after the date of deposit of such moneys if deposited after such date when all of the Refunding Bonds became due and payable, shall, upon request of the District, be repaid to the District free from the trusts created by this Resolution, and all liability of the Paying Agent with respect to such moneys shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that before the repayment of such moneys to the District as aforesaid, the Paying Agent may (at the cost of the District) provide to the Owners of all Refunding Bonds which have not been paid at the addresses shown on the Registration Books a notice in such form as may be deemed appropriate by the Paying Agent, with respect to the Refunding Bonds so payable and not presented and with respect to the provisions relating to the repayment to the District of the moneys held for the payment thereof.

The District further agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the County, including its Board of Supervisors, officers, officials, agents and employees, against the payment of any and all liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and court costs), damages and claims which the County, including its Board of Supervisors, officers, officials, agents and employees, may incur in the exercise and performance of its or their powers and duties hereunder which are not due to its or their negligence or bad faith.

**Section 9.06. Destruction of Canceled Refunding Bonds.** Whenever in this Resolution provision is made for the surrender to the District of any Refunding Bonds which have been paid or canceled under the provisions of this Resolution, a certificate of destruction duly executed by the Paying Agent shall be deemed to be the equivalent of the surrender of such canceled Refunding Bonds and the District shall be entitled to rely upon any statement of fact contained in any certificate with respect to the destruction of any such Refunding Bonds therein referred to.

**Section 9.07. Partial Invalidity.** If any section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this Resolution shall for any reason be held illegal or unenforceable, such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Resolution. The District hereby declares that it would have adopted this Resolution and each and every other section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase hereof and authorized the issue of the Refunding Bonds pursuant thereto irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses, or phrases of this Resolution may be held illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If, by reason of the judgment of any court, the District is rendered unable to perform its duties hereunder, all such duties and all of the rights and powers of the District hereunder shall be assumed by and vest in the chief financial officer of the District in trust for the benefit of the Refunding Bond Owners.

The LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT (the "District"), located in Sacramento County, California (the "County"), for value received, hereby promises to pay to the Registered Owner named above, or registered assigns, the Principal Amount on the Maturity Date, as stated above, and interest thereon, calculated on a 30/360 day basis, until the Principal Amount is paid or provided for, at the Interest Rate stated above, such interest to be paid on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing ___________ 1, 20__ (the "Interest Payment Dates").

Bond at the address appearing on the Bond registration books at the close of business on the 15th day of the calendar month next preceding such Interest Payment Date (the “Record Date”); provided, however, that at the written request of the registered owner of Bonds in an aggregate principal amount of at least $1,000,000, which written request is on file with the Paying Agent before any Record Date, interest on such Bonds shall be paid on each succeeding Interest Payment Date by wire transfer in immediately available funds to such account of a financial institution within the United States of America as shall be specified in such written request.

This Bond is one of a series of $________ of Bonds issued for the purpose of raising money to refinance outstanding general obligation bond indebtedness of the District, issued under a resolution of the Board of Trustees of the District adopted on July 10, 2024 (the “Bond Resolution”). This Bond and the issue of which this Bond is a part are payable as to both principal and interest from the proceeds of the levy of ad valorem taxes on all property subject to such taxes in the District, which taxes are unlimited as to rate or amount.

The principal of and interest on this Bond does not constitute a debt of the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions other than the District, or any of the officers, agents and employees thereof, and neither the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions, nor any of the officers, agents and employees thereof shall be liable herefor. In no event shall the principal of and interest on this Bond be payable out of any funds or properties of the District other than ad valorem taxes levied upon all taxable property in the District.

The Bonds of this issue are issuable only as fully registered Bonds in the denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. This Bond is exchangeable and transferable for Bonds of other authorized denominations at the principal corporate trust office of the Paying Agent, by the Registered Owner or by a person legally empowered to do so, upon presentation and surrender hereof to the Paying Agent, together with a request for exchange or an assignment signed by the Registered Owner or by a person legally empowered to do so, in a form satisfactory to the Paying Agent, all subject to the terms, limitations and conditions provided in the Bond Resolution. Any tax or governmental charges shall be paid by the transferor. The District and the Paying Agent may deem and treat the Registered Owner as the absolute owner of this Bond for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of principal or interest and for all other purposes, and neither the District nor the Paying Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

[if applicable:] The Bonds maturing on and before August 1, 20__ are not subject to optional redemption before their respective stated maturities. The Bonds maturing on and after August 1, 20__ are subject to redemption at the option of the District on August 1, 20__, and on any date thereafter, at a redemption

price equal to ___ % of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed together with interest accruing thereon to the redemption date, without premium.

[[if applicable:]] The Bonds maturing on August 1 in each of the years ____ and ____ are Term Bonds which are subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption on August 1 in each of the years and in the respective principal amounts as set forth in the following tables, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed (without premium), together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption. If some but not all of the Term Bonds have been redeemed under the preceding paragraph, the aggregate principal amount of Term Bonds to be redeemed under this paragraph will be reduced as designated in written notice filed by the District with the Paying Agent.

**Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption of Bonds Maturing on August 1, ____**

| Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Date (August 1) | Principal Amount To be Redeemed |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
|                                                    |                                  |

The Paying Agent shall give notice of the redemption of the Bonds at the expense of the District. Such notice shall specify: (a) that the Bonds or a designated portion thereof are to be redeemed, (b) the numbers and CUSIP numbers of the Bonds to be redeemed, (c) the date of notice and the date of redemption, (d) the place or places where the redemption will be made, and (e) descriptive information regarding the Bonds including the dated date, interest rate and stated maturity date. Such notice shall further state that on the specified date there shall become due and payable upon each Bond to be redeemed, the portion of the principal amount of such Bond to be redeemed, together with interest accrued to such date, and that from and after such date interest with respect thereto shall cease to accrue and be payable.

Notice of redemption shall be given to the registered owner of the Bonds, to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and to the District and the respective Owners of any Bonds designated for redemption at their addresses appearing on the Bond registration books, in every case at least 20 days, but not more than 60 days, before the redemption date; provided that neither failure to receive such notice nor any defect in any notice shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for the redemption of such Bonds.

Neither the District nor the Paying Agent will be required: (a) to issue or transfer any Bond during a period beginning with the opening of business on the 15th calendar day next preceding either any Interest Payment Date or any date of

selection of any Bond to be redeemed and ending with the close of business on the Interest Payment Date or a day on which the applicable notice of redemption is given, or (b) to transfer any Bond which has been selected or called for redemption in whole or in part.

Reference is made to the Bond Resolution for a more complete description of the provisions, among others, with respect to the nature and extent of the security for the Bonds of this series, the rights, duties and obligations of the District, the Paying Agent and the Registered Owners, and the terms and conditions upon which the Bonds are issued and secured. The owner of this Bond assents, by acceptance hereof, to all of the provisions of the Bond Resolution.

Unless this Bond is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation (“DTC”), to the Trustee for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any Bond issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest herein.

It is certified, recited and declared that all acts and conditions required by the Constitution and laws of the State of California to exist, to be performed or to have been met precedent to and in the issuing of the Bonds in order to make them legal, valid and binding general obligations of the District, have been performed and have been met in regular and due form as required by law; that payment in full for the Bonds has been received; that no statutory or constitutional limitation on indebtedness or taxation has been exceeded in issuing the Bonds; and that due provision has been made for levying and collecting ad valorem property taxes on all of the taxable property within the District in an amount sufficient to pay principal and interest when due, and for levying and collecting such taxes the full faith and credit of the District are hereby pledged.

This Bond shall be not valid or obligatory for any purpose and shall not be entitled to any security or benefit under the Bond Resolution (described on the reverse hereof) until the Certificate of Authentication below has been manually signed by the Paying Agent.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Los Rios Community College District has caused this Bond to be executed by the facsimile signature of the President of its
