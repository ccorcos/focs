# Economic Forecast

- **Slow, but steady economic growth through 2027**  
  - Driven by strong personal consumption, but will moderate with restrictive monetary policy

- **Job growth to return to steady state**  
  - Technology layoffs, a high interest rate environment, and already nearing pre-pandemic employment result in less projected job growth

- **Inflation is expected to cool**  
  - Slows to historical inflation rates of around 2% by early 2025 due to fiscal and monetary policy changes since the end of the pandemic

  - Inflation appears to be normalizing
  - Sticky inflation could lead to persistently high interest rates
- **Uncertain revenue and budget model at the state level**
  - Changing tax laws may not bring in anticipated level of revenue
  - Highly dependent on 1% of earners to pay nearly 40% of total PIT
- **Uncertainty with geopolitical conflicts**
  - Russia and Ukraine and/or China and Taiwan
