**Los Rios Community College District Indigenous Land Acknowledgment Statement**  
In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our four colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.  

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

**BACKGROUND:**  
Proposition 30, The Schools and Local Public Safety Protection Act of 2012 temporarily raised the State sales and use tax by .25 cents for four years and raised the income tax rate for high income earners ($250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for couples) for seven years to provide continuing funding for local school districts and community colleges. In November 2018, voters passed proposition 55, the Children’s Education and Health Care Protection Act. Proposition 55 extended the personal income tax increase under proposition 30 through 2030-31. The accounting and reporting requirements under proposition 55 are the same as under Proposition 30.

Under proposition 30, the State established the Education Protection Account (EPA) to receive and disburse the tax revenues derived from proposition 30 and subsequently proposition 55. These funds do not represent new or additional resources for districts; rather, the EPA replaced a portion of the base State General apportionment. In essence, the three revenue sources traditionally supporting California Community Colleges: general apportionment, local property taxes, and student enrollment fees, now include a fourth source, EPA.

Districts have sole authority to determine how moneys received from the EPA are spent. The governing board must make the spending determination in open session of a public meeting of the board and with the limitation that EPA funds cannot be used to pay administrative salaries and benefits and other administrative costs. Each entity receiving funds must annually publish on its website an accounting of how much money was received from the EPA and how that money was spent. Additionally, the annual independent financial and compliance audit required of community colleges shall ascertain and verify whether the funds provided from the EPA have been properly disbursed and expended as required by law. Expenses incurred to comply with these additional audit requirements may be paid from the EPA.

---

**STATUS:**  
The California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office (CCCCO) distributes EPA funds to districts based upon their proportionate share of total computational revenue. This basis results in a more equitable distribution of EPA rather than distributing on the relative share of general apportionment.  

---  

19
<!-- Page 20 -->
![HOME](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

For 2024-25, the District is currently projected to receive $48,506,502 in EPA funds. As was the case in prior years, the amount may change as the year progresses and entitlements are modified. However, our overall apportionment entitlement under the state’s funding formula will generally be fully funded even if our share of EPA funds are reduced.

The Board must adopt its plan for the use of the funds as described in the background section relying on the best information available. Consistent with the message to voters that Proposition 30 would allow districts to maintain their instructional programs and the requirement that EPA not be used for administrative costs; staff recommends that EPA funds be designated as supporting compensation costs for classroom instruction services for both faculty and classified staff. Classroom instructional salaries and benefits up to the actual amount received for EPA will be transferred to separate accounts within the unrestricted general fund to identify those costs as funded by EPA.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt for the 2024-25 fiscal year, the plan to designate compensation costs for classroom instruction as funded by EPA. Upon approval, the District will update its website to reflect the Board’s action.

**SUBJECT:** District Annual Investment Report  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item D  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Mario Rodriguez,

**CONSENT/ROUTINE** X  
**FIRST READING**  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION**  
**INFORMATION**  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
As specified in Board Policy P-8252, within three months of the close of each fiscal year, an annual investment report of all District directed investments shall be presented to the Board of Trustees.

The purpose of the investment report is to inform the Board regarding District directed investments, consisting primarily of assets of the Retiree Health Benefits Trust and certain fiduciary funds. The majority of the District’s monetary assets – cash, cash equivalents, and investments – are required to be held in appropriate Sacramento County Treasury accounts and investments of such assets are directed by the County. For comparative purposes and a complete overview of investment and interest income earned by the District in 2023-24, the attached annual investment report shows both District and County directed monetary assets and their earnings.

---

**STATUS:**  
District directed assets were invested in compliance with Board Policy P-8252. Detail regarding those investments for the year ended June 30, 2024 follows.

**Retiree Health Benefits Trust (Trust):**  
On November 7, 2007 the Board established an irrevocable trust in response to accounting standards issued by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), specifically GASB 43 and 45. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. was appointed trustee and investment manager of the Trust. As the sponsor and sole contributor of monies to the Trust, the District has primary responsibility for the management of the Trust for the benefit of its current and future retirees. On July 1, 2019, Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement & Trust was acquired by Principal Financial Group. As of February 22, 2022, Principal Custody Solutions is the trustee and investment manager of the Trust. Under review by the Oversight Committee, established by the Board, and within investment guidelines and restrictions of Board Policy P-8252, the Principal Custody Solutions investment manager has invested Trust monies in various mutual and index funds. As of June 30, 2024, approximately 70% of the $160.9 million portfolio was invested in bond funds and 30.0% in equity funds. The Committee meets quarterly with the investment manager to review the portfolio. As is good practice, returns are evaluated against benchmarks for similar investments.  

---  

21
<!-- Page 22 -->
![HOME](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

Due to the strength of equity markets during the past fiscal year, the Trust had a net gain of $11.1 million or approximately a 7.3% gain in asset value. The net return for the past five years is 3.8% and the return since inception of the trust is 4.8%. The District goal for average return is currently 5%. An actuarial study is required every two years which allows for current economic conditions to be factored into the goal for annual returns.

**Annual Investment Report:**
The first page of the attached report summarizes both District and County directed investment balances as of June 30, 2024 and the related earnings during fiscal year 2023-24. Only $7.9 million of the total District funds (excluding Retiree Health) of nearly $851.1 million is directed by the District. District funds have earned a weighted average annual percentage rate (APR) of 7.4%. Most of the District directed assets are invested in the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF).

The second page provides more detailed information about District directed investments. This includes trust assets that are professionally managed by Principal Custody Solutions. The investment advisor meets regularly with the Retiree Health Benefits Trust Oversight Committee.

The third page of the report shows similar information regarding County and Escrow directed investments. Except for the Bond Projects and Bond Interest and Redemption Funds, County directed assets are invested in the County’s pooled account, which earned 4.672% in 2023-24. Proceeds from the District’s sale of General Obligation (GO) Bonds are separately invested by the County in commercial paper, government agency notes and other authorized investment instruments. Earnings on these separately invested GO Bond monies ranged from 3.00% - 5.325% in fiscal year 2023-24. Investment earnings for the Bond Projects or Bond Interest and Redemption funds may only be expended for bond project costs or bond debt service, respectively.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees accept the District’s Annual Investment Report for fiscal year 2023-24.

**BACKGROUND:**  
The Education Code regulates the procedures by which a Community College District can dispose of real and personal property. Education Code section 81452 provides that the governing board may, by unanimous vote, dispose of items valued at $5,000 or less by private sale without advertising or selling the items at public auction. The District has held previous auctions, but they have generally cost more than they have netted for the District.

**STATUS:**  
The District has a quantity of surplus materials that needs to be disposed of, such as outdated desks and computers. The District has located a scrap dealer who will take selected surplus items for recycling. Any items remaining will be disposed.

The surplus items to be recycled or disposed of are either irreparable, obsolete, in poor condition or not needed for district/college operations and include the following:  
- 1 A/V receiver  
- 2 audio interface units  
- 1 aural exciter  
- 7 Chromebooks  
- 1 compressor  
- 19 computers  
- 1 digital audio tape player  
- 2 fog machines  
- 1 graphic equalizer  
- 8 laptops  
- 2 lighting trusses  
- 1 M-audio controller  
- 2 mic pre-amps  
- 8 monitors  
- 1 power conditioner  
- 1 projector  
- 1 scanner  
- 7 stage lights  
- 7 studio monitors  
- 2 switches  
- and 1 webcam.  

These items have a value of less than $5,000.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the disposal of the listed items per Education Code section 81452.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** September 11, 2024

**SUBJECT:** Public Hearing: Adoption of 2024-25 Proposed Budgets  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** Budget Book  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item A

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**ACTION** X  
**INFORMATION**  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
The 2024-25 General fund tentative budget, adopted by the Board of Trustees in June, has been revised to reflect the enacted State budget. The Board is required to hold a public hearing on the proposed budget for the fiscal year on or before the 15th day of September. Budget revisions will be brought to the Board as needed, typically at least twice during the year.

The enacted budget for Community Colleges prioritized stability amidst a significant state budget deficit. Rather than making major core reductions to programs or services, it relies on reserves and operational savings to balance the budget. The enacted budget includes modest ongoing resources for California Community Colleges, amounting to approximately $142 million for appropriations and categorical programs. Ongoing spending includes about $100 million for a 1.07% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), $31 million for COLAs and adjustments to certain categorical programs, and $28 million for systemwide enrollment growth of .05%.

The District’s fiscal health is strong. The budget is balanced and reserves are in line with board policy. The District is strategically using funds provided by the federal government and state government to mitigate and offset impacts caused by the disruption. Additionally, the District continues to fund and refine projections to mitigate the impact of increasing employer contributions required by CalPERS and CalSTRS.

---

**STATUS:**  
The budget scenarios for the General Fund are titled the X, Y, and Z budgets. All three budgets are based on at least a full recovery of FTES to the levels seen in the 2019-20 fiscal year. Our current daily year-over-year tracking indicates a full restoration, with growth above our pre-pandemic FTES benchmark. Taking this into account, the X budget projects a full restoration of FTES with an additional 4% growth, which is our more conservative estimate. The Y budget anticipates full restoration plus 6% growth, while the Z budget assumes full restoration plus 8% growth. However, the State's enacted budget only allocates $28 million for a statewide 0.5% growth.

enrollment growth, which could result in unfunded growth for the District. As a result, the total computational revenue for all three budgets is adjusted to account for this potential unfunded growth.

The variations in the X, Y and Z budgets are captured in the appropriation area entitled Program and Salary Improvement and the three budgets are summarized on the attached General Fund schedule. The District is currently operating at the X budget level.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees conduct a public hearing to receive comments on the proposed budgets and adopt the 2024-25 proposed budgets for the General Fund (Z budget), Instructionally-Related, Special Revenue, Capital Projects, Debt Service, Enterprise, Internal Service, Fiduciary, Trust and Auxiliary Funds of the District for filing with the appropriate County/State agencies.

![Section B: Collection and Analysis of Recruitment, Retention, and Longitudinal Data](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Section+B:+Collection+and+Analysis+of+Recruitment,+Retention,+and+Longitudinal+Data)

**Section B, Part 1: Summarizing Actions, Strategies, Measurements, and Outcomes**

Referring to your district’s EEO Plan Components 10-12, report upon your district’s strategies for recording and reviewing data related to the recruitment and retention of monitored groups.

For reference:
- Component 10: A Process for Gathering Information and Periodic Longitudinal Analysis of the District’s Employees and Applicants
- Component 11: A Process for Utilizing Data to Determine Whether Monitored Groups Are Underrepresented Within District Job Categories
- Component 12: Methods for Addressing Underrepresentation

| EEO Plans: Summary of Anticipated Actions |
|--------------------------------------------|
| Referring to your district’s EEO Plan, briefly summarize your district’s plan to do the following: |
| **collect applicant and employee data** | The district will collect demographic data on applicants and employees. It will be the intent of the District to collect data on each of the seven identified job categories: 1) administrative/executive, 2) faculty (tenure-track/tenured) & faculty (adjunct), 3) Professional (non-faculty), 4) clerical/secretarial, 5) technical/paraprofessional, 6) skilled craft, 7) service/maintenance. |
| **review applicant and employee data for adverse impact** | To review applicant data, the district will employ adverse impact analysis at each step of the recruitment: the initial applicant pool, to the qualified applicant pool, to interview selections, to offers of employment. To review employee data for adverse impact, the district will 1) calculate the selection rate for each demographic group, 2) observe which group has the highest selection rate, 3) calculate the impact ratio by comparing the selection rate of each demographic group with that of the highest group, 4) observe whether the selection rate for any group is substantially less (i.e., less than 4/5 or 80%) than the selection rate for the highest group. |
| **review applicant and employee data for underrepresentation** | To review applicant data for underrepresentation, the district will compare demographic data of applicants to student demographic data. It is the intent of the district to provide hiring committees applicant demographic data to compare with employee demographic data in the same specific department/job classification under recruitment. To review employee data for underrepresentation, the district will compare annual student demographic data to employee demographic data. |

| Since submitting your EEO Plan, summarize actual actions taken and the methods used to review your district’s applicant and employee data for: |  |
| adverse impact | - The district has collected data to employ adverse impact analysis for each specific position being hired. The goal is to analyze where adverse impact exists in hiring from each stage of recruitment, from initial applicants, to interview selection, to job offers. In the 2023 EEO Plan Component 1, it was stated that: "It is the intent of the district to conduct an analysis, as identified in this section, of specific full-time faculty hiring processes starting in the first year of this Plan. This goal was not realized: With over 70 full-time faculty hiring processes occurring, the volume of data was unprecedented and unexpected. The person hours needed for a proper analysis was not available. For the 2023-2024 academic year, adverse analysis impact has been calculated for all 12 faculty positions at Sacramento City College where cluster hiring was piloted in an effort to reverse adverse impact. See Appendix B. |
| underrepresentation | - The district has collected data of applicants and employees to compare to demographics of the service area and to demographics of the student population. <br> - For the purposes of this report, underrepresentation in applicants and employees is shown in Appendix B. |
| Summarize actual actions taken and the methods used to address any findings of: |  |
| adverse impact | - All hiring committees develop screening criteria that focuses on the job description in an effort to be inclusive in who may be interviewed. Hiring committee also develop interview questions that are focused on the job announcement as a way to avoid unintended bias. <br> - Hiring committees also have an Equity Representative whose purpose is to prevent problems in hiring due to bias, problems in the hiring process, and problems that may result in discriminatory impact. <br> - Cluster hiring has been piloted at Sacramento City College with a focus on explicitly broadening the applicant pools with a goal of increasing the opportunity to hire faculty of color and reverse adverse impact and underrepresentation. (See Appendix A.) |
| underrepresentation | - Faculty are asked where to focus recruitment to help broaden the applicant pool. <br> - Faculty from affinity groups help recruit at CCC Registry recruitment fairs. <br> - All members of hiring committees complete "Hiring the Best" training focused on (a) federal and state laws regarding nondiscrimination, (b) the educational benefits of workforce diversity, (c) elimination of bias in hiring decisions; (d) best practices in serving on a selection/screening committee, and (e) the role of the EEO Advisory Committee in promoting EEO. <br> - The Faculty Diversity Internship Program exists to help build a diverse faculty that reflects the demographics of the student body, and to prepare faculty for teaching diverse populations that exist in the District. <br> - The "Equity Reflection" in faculty performance reviews came into being as a result of faculty wanting to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion among the faculty as a whole. |

**Innovative Strategies Reporting**  
Please highlight the use and impact (if applicable) of any innovative strategies, resources, or tools your district has employed.  
In Spring 2024, cluster hiring was piloted at Sacramento City College, one of the four Los Rios College. A preliminary analysis of applicants at Sacramento City College compared to the 3 other colleges raises a number of questions regarding the effectiveness of cluster hiring. (The data regarding the results of cluster hiring at SCC compared to hiring in the same disciplines at the other colleges where cluster hiring did not exist are included in Appendix A.)

| Implementation | What/When | Effectiveness Metrics and Review | PRE-HIRING |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------------------|------------|
| Provide training to employees, students & trustees. (53024.1(d)) | Hiring the Best and Equity Representative training are provided to students and employees who will serve on hiring committees. The Trustees are trained at their annual retreat. | Training of employees/students who will serve on hiring committee compared to training of students/employees who are not scheduled to serve on a committee. | Challenges: Employees often wait until they are asked to serve on a committee before being trained. This can result in trainers scrambling to provide trainings. This reality also suggests that employees may not engage with the content of the training unless they will serve on a committee. How this impacts who will be hired is unknown. |
| Convey in publications and website the district's commitment to diversity & EEO. (53024.1(g)) | a) Evaluate Los Rios website to ensure the EEO Plan is posted and accessible to the public. (Year 1) b) Review and update a necessary statement of commitment to diversity and EEO in publications and website. (Year 1) | a) The EEO Plan is posted and accessible to the public. b) District commitment to EEO is updated and posted to websites and publications. | Observed successes: Faculty appointed to the EEO Advisory Committee have provided advice that will help in revision of the Hiring the Best Training and in revision of the Faculty Hiring Manual with a continued focus of upholding diversity, equity, and inclusion principles and policies in faculty hiring. Challenged: no challenges observed at this time. |
| Review and update District EEO/DEI policy statement. (53024.1(k)) | Review EEO policy and DEI statement, and update as necessary. (Year 1) | Policy statement is reviewed, up to date and publicly available on the District’s website. | Observed successes: The District continues to be seen as an employer committed to DEI and EEO. We have observed applicants cite these factors as reasons to apply. Observed challenges: How to record the numbers of people who cite the District commitment to EEO and DEI as reasons to apply for employment. |
| Providing EEO/diversity enhancement resources and assistance to other districts. (53024.1(m)) | This strategy is relevant to year 2 or year 3. | | |
| Addressing diversity issues in a transparent and collaborative fashion. (53024.1(o)) | EEO Advisory Committee will be asked to consider how to collaborate with community groups to focus recruitment efforts with a clear understanding of why Los Rios values diversity and specifically values the inclusion of diversity in the community to improve equity for all. (Year 1) | Discussion on how to collaborate with community groups to focus recruitment will be documented with a focus on how Los Rios values diversity and inclusion in hiring. | Observed successes: Faculty are happy to attend recruitment fairs and to provide recommendations of where to place positions announcements during recruitment. Observed challenges: 1) Recruitment fairs and advertisements in publications are limited in scope; 2) A broader recruitment may also require funding, which can be difficult at times. 3) Disciplines where there exists underrepresentation of diverse faculty will find it difficult to reverse a reality that has occurred over time even with concerted efforts to change that reality. But, with sustained commitment to diversifying the faculty, change will come. |

**Unexpended Allocations (if applicable)**  
**Explain why funds are unexpended.**  
From March 2020 to January 2022, the majority of all operations at the colleges and district office were remote. Funds were not expended for outreach, professional development on DEIA, accommodations for applicants/employees. We were also in a hiring freeze which curtailed recruitment.  
During the 2022-2023 year, Faculty Diversity Internship Program was paused, thus EEO funds which could have been expended for the program were not expended.

**Describe any actions or strategies that will be taken to utilize the funds and outline anticipated dates.**  
During the 2023-2024 year, EEO funds have been spent for 1) FDIP faculty stipends consistent with professional development on equal employment opportunity ($42,444.05); 2) professional development related to DEIA ($12,568.79); 3) accommodations for employees pursuant to title 5 section 3205 ($8,907.00), 4) stipends for faculty mentors for PDIP - other reasonable activities to promote equal employment opportunities ($150,943.30).  
During the 2024-2025 year, EEO funds will be spent on 1) FDIP faculty stipends (estimated at $50,000); 2) professional development related to DEIA (estimated at $25,000); 3) outreach and recruitment (estimated at $40,000).  
During the 2025-2026 year, EEO funds will be spent on 1) FDIP faculty stipends estimated at $50,000; professional development related to DEIA (estimated at $25,000); 3) outreach and recruitment estimated at $50,000.

# Appendix A: Preliminary Analysis of Cluster Hiring at Sacramento City College:

Sacramento City College piloted cluster hiring for faculty recruitment during the Spring 2024 semester. Cluster hiring refers to the process of recruiting, hiring, and eventually supporting employees who are focused on a specific college or district-wide initiative, such as the hiring faculty who are committed to making a positive difference for minoritized students. [African-American Faculty Cluster Hires | Student Affairs and Campus Diversity | SDSU](https://sdsu.edu)

To be considered for the cluster hire initiative at Sacramento City College, faculty applicants were asked to address three or more of the following criteria with their applications:

We are excited to invite you to bring your lived experiences and authentic selves to contribute to discourse and action in supporting our Brown, Indigenous, and/or People of Color (BIPOC) communities.

1. Provide specific examples of how you have demonstrated a commitment to engaging in service with populations historically underrepresented and underserved in higher education, particularly with BIPOC communities.

2. Provide specific examples of your experience dismantling or disrupting institutional racism.

3. Provide specific examples of how you have created research, scholarship, media, art, or cultural/political engagement opportunities with BIPOC communities.

4. Provide specific examples of how you have demonstrated experience and knowledge of barriers for BIPOC students and how to address the disproportionate impact at institutions of higher education.

5. Provide specific examples of your skills in developing cross-cultural and anti-racist communication, collaboration, and/or pedagogy.

A preliminary analysis of applicants and who was hired into disciplines at Sacramento City College, compared to who was hired into those same disciplines at the three other Los Rios colleges where there was not a focus on cluster hiring, suggests a number of questions regarding the effectiveness of cluster hiring that should be followed in further cluster hiring efforts. Table 1 shows the results of cluster hiring at SCC compared to hiring at the other colleges in the disciplines of Chemistry, Communication Studies, Counselor, Ethnic Studies, Physics/Astronomy, and Psychology.

## Adverse Impact Analysis:

Under the EEOC’s Adverse Impact Test, an adverse impact occurs when the selection rate for any group is less than 4/5th (80%) of the selection rate for the group with the highest selection rate. Applying the Adverse Impact Test to the faculty positions which were hired at SCC where cluster hiring was piloted suggests a number of questions which should be regarded at the recruitment stage and applicant screening stage for interviews. With a goal of diversifying the faculty at SCC, an explicit recruitment goal was to help diversify the applicant pool. As shown in Table 2, an adverse impact analysis of applicants can help determine whether the applicant pools at SCC were diverse and whether that diversity helped prevent adverse impact in the hiring process:

**Discussion:**

In 9 disciplines, (Chemistry, Communication Studies, Counselor, Ethnic Studies, Kinesiology, Photography, Physics/Astronomy, Psychology, and Vision Care Technology), groups with the highest number of total applicants also resulted in the highest number of applicants screened in by Human Resources (HR) and the highest number of applicants invited to interview. Specifically:

- In 5 disciplines, (Chemistry, Communication Studies, Photography, Psychology, and Vision Care Technology), the largest number of applicants were white and white applicants were the majority of applicants who were screened in by HR and interviewed at the College.

- In the disciplines of Counselor, Ethnic Studies, and Kinesiology, the majority of applicants were Hispanic (Counselor and Ethnic Studies) or African American (Kinesiology). AAPI were the largest number of applicants in Physics/Astronomy, and AAPI were the majority of applicants screened in by HR and interviewed at the College.

- In History, African American and white applicants were both represented equally in the overall applicant pool at 33%. White applicants were the majority of applicants screened in by HR at 44%. African American and white applicants were interviewed at the same rate (28.6%).

In three disciplines with single digit applicant pools, very little or no diversity existed in the applicant pools. Specifically:

- In Nursing, all 3 applicants were AAPI and all 3 applicants were screened in by HR and all 3 applicants were interviewed.

- In Mechanical Electrical Technology, 71.4% of 7 applicants were AAPI. AAPI were also the majority of applicants screened in by HR (50% or 5), but out of the 3 applicants interviewed, one was AAPI, one was white, and one did not disclose ethnicity.

- In Vision Care Technology, out of the 5 applicants, 2 were white, and white applicants were the majority of applicants screened in by HR and interviewed.

In 8 disciplines (66%) of faculty hired are people of color: Chemistry, Counselor, Ethnic Studies, History, Kinesiology, Photography, and Physics/Astronomy. Nursing had only 3 applicants who were AAPI and 2 out of the 3 applicants were hired. White applicants were hired in 3 areas (Chemistry, Photography, Vision Care Technology), and 1 person not disclosing ethnicity was hired into Mechanical Electrical Technology.

While adverse impact did exist in the faculty hiring process at SCC with a focus on cluster hiring, as shown in Appendix B below, SCC hired more people of color by percentage than the other 3 colleges during Spring 2024 faculty hiring period.

Appendix A

A look at the result of hiring for each discipline at SCC reveals general and discipline specific questions for cluster hiring that should be considered in any future cluster hiring efforts:

**Chemistry:** A total of 20 applicants applied at ARC and 38 applied at SCC and each college hired one professor. ARC, where cluster hiring did not exist, hired a professor who identifies as white with white applicants at a little more than one quarter of the applicant pool (26.5%). The applicants at ARC and CRC were not all the same applicants at SCC. CRC did not pilot cluster hiring and had the largest applicant pool with the highest number of African American applicants (6) and the highest number of AAPI applicants (20). ARC and CRC both advertised for two professors. Fewer Hispanic applicants by percentage (15.8%) applied to Chemistry at SCC than at ARC (20.0%). At CRC, Hispanic applicants were only 12.3% with two positions available. ARC had only 1 African American applicant.

- Questions to consider regarding cluster hiring:
  - To what extent did location and opportunity to be hired play in an applicant’s decisions to apply to Chemistry at a specific college?
  - Did the focus on cluster hiring contribute to a greater number of applicants overall at SCC compared to ARC where both colleges were hiring one professor?
  - Did the focus on clustering hiring at SCC serve as a barrier to Hispanic applicants?

**Communication Studies:** CRC hired two Communications Studies professors; one identifies as two or more races and one identifies as AAPI. CRC applicants who identify as two or more races were 8.5% of the total applicants and AAPI applicants were 12.8% of the total applicants. White applicants were 40% of the total applicants. Hispanic applicants (23.4%) were almost twice the percentage of AAPI applicants and three times the percentage of applicants identifying as two or more races. SCC, with a focus on cluster hiring selected a Communication Studies professor who identifies as African American where African American applicants were 13.5% of the applicant pool. There were also fewer applicants at SCC who identified as AAPI, Hispanic, two or more races, and white compared to CRC.

- Questions to consider regarding cluster hiring:
  - What impact, if any, did the cluster hiring supplemental questions have for applicants in Communication Studies at SCC?
  - At CRC where cluster hiring was not a focus, what factors contributed to fewer applicants of color in Communication Studies, but also resulted in two hires identifying as people of color?
  - To what extent did location and opportunity to be hired play in an applicant’s decisions to apply to Communication Studies at a specific college?

# Appendix A

**Counselor:** ARC had 9 more applicants overall for one position than at SCC where there were two positions available. The counselor hired at ARC did not disclose ethnicity. SCC hired two counselors who identify as African American and one counselor who identifies as Hispanic.

- **Questions to consider regarding cluster hiring:**
  - To what extent did location play in an applicant’s decisions to apply for a Counselor role at a specific college?
  - Did cluster hiring present a barrier to Counselor applicants overall at SCC?

**Ethnic Studies:** SCC, where cluster hiring was piloted, hired two professors who identify as African American. The most applicants were Hispanic (42.5%), which was almost double African American applicants (27.5%). At CRC, with one open position, one professor who did not disclose ethnicity was hired; 2.9% of applicants at CRC did not disclose ethnicity. CRC had one failed search in Ethnic Studies. American River College with two positions to hire, hired a professor who identifies as African American. ARC had a failed search in Ethnic Studies, and African Americans were the largest percentage of applicants (61.9%). Total applicants at SCC and CRC were 40 and total applicants at ARC was 21, and the 40 applicants at SCC and CRC were not the same 40 applicants.

- **Questions to consider regarding cluster hiring:**
  - How did cluster hiring impact those who applied to Ethnic Studies at SCC?
  - To what extent did location and opportunity to be hired play in an applicant’s decisions to apply to a specific college?

**History:** The total number of applicants was 15. Two thirds of those applicants identified as African American (5) and white (5). A professor identifying as two or more races was hired. At the recruitment stage, adverse impact existed for American Indian and AAPI applicants as zero applied, as well as for the 1 Hispanic applicant and 3 applicants identifying as two or more races, and those who did not disclose ethnicity (1 applicant). At the HR screening stage, adverse impact existed for all groups except for white who had the most applicants screened in: 9 out of 11 or 26.5%. Seven of the 15 applicants were interviewed: 2 African American, 1 Hispanic, 1 identifying as two or more races, 2 white, and 1 applicant who did not disclose ethnicity. At the interviewing stage, adverse impact existed for applicants identifying as Hispanic, two or more races, and for those who did not disclose ethnicity.

- **Question to consider regarding cluster hiring:**
  - Did the cluster hiring focus pose a barrier to potential applicants who are Native American or AAPI?

**Kinesiology:** Total number of applicants was 26. A professor identifying as African American was hired and African American applicants were the largest number: 11 of 26 or 42.3%. The remaining applicants identified as American Indian (1), Hispanic (4), two or more races (3), white (5); two

# Appendix A

Applicants did not disclose ethnicity and adverse impact existed for these groups. Seven of the 26 applicants were interviewed: 3 African American, and 0 American Indian, 1 Hispanic, 1 identifying as two or more races, 1 white, and 1 applicant who did not disclose ethnicity. Adverse impact existed for all groups other than African Americans in interviewing.

- Question to consider regarding cluster hiring:
  - Did cluster hiring pose a barrier to potential applicants?

**Mechanical Electrical Engineering:** Only 7 applicants applied and 5 identified as AAPI. Adverse impact existed for groups that did not apply: African American, American Indian, Hispanic, and two or more races. Only 3 applicants were interviewed: one identifying as AAPI, one identifying as white, and one applicant not disclosing ethnicity, who was hired.

- Questions to consider regarding cluster hiring:
  - Did the cluster hiring focus impact who decided to apply?
  - Did cluster hiring pose a barrier to potential applicants who were African American, Native American, Hispanic, or Multi-Ethnic?

**Nursing:** With only 3 AAPI applicants, SCC hired 2 professors.

- Question to consider regarding cluster hiring:
  - Did the cluster hiring focus pose a barrier from applicants from all ethnic groups?

**Physics/Astronomy:** SCC with cluster hiring had 29 applicants and hired a professor who identifies as two or more races. Only 2 of the 29 applicants identified as two or more races FLC without clustering hiring selected a professor who identifies as white with 31 applicants. White applicants at FLC were the largest group with 11 out of 31 or 35.5%. White applicants at SCC were also the largest group with 9 out of 29 or 31%.

- Questions to consider regarding cluster hiring:
  - Did cluster hiring at SCC cause a barrier for applicants?
  - Did location influence where applicants chose to apply?

**Photography:** SCC with cluster hiring hired a professor who identifies as white. White applicants were almost half of the pool: 11 or 26 or 45.8%. There were 8 Hispanic applicants (33.3%) with two interviewed (22.2%). White applicants were 44.4% of interviewed applicants. There were 4 multi-ethnic applicants (16.7%) with 3 of those applicants interviewed (33.3%).

A- 13 -  
129
<!-- Page 130 -->
# Appendix A

- Questions to consider regarding cluster hiring:
  - What did white applicants and multi-ethnic applicants possess in their applications that caused them to be interviewed more than Hispanic applicants?
  - Did cluster hiring pose a barrier for African American, Native American, or Asian/Pacific Islanders as no one from these groups applied for the position?

**Psychology:** SCC with cluster hiring hired a professor who identifies as AAPI and ARC without cluster hiring hired a professor who identifies as white. ARC also had a failed search in Psychology. Total applicants at SCC were 14 and total applicants at ARC was 27. Two AAPI applicants applied at ARC and two AAPI applicants applied at SCC. SCC had the highest percentage of white applicants at 6 (42.9%), but ARC had a majority of white applicants at 12 or 46.2%. Hispanic applicants at ARC were 6 out of 26 (23.1%), while Hispanic applicants at SCC were 3 out of 14 (21.4%).

- Questions to consider regarding cluster hiring:
  - Did cluster hiring pose a barrier for applicants overall at SCC compared to ARC without cluster hiring?
  - Did cluster hiring at SCC discourage Hispanic applicants?

**Vision Care Technology:** SCC with clustering hiring hired a white professor. Out of 5 applicants, 2 were white, 1 was AAPI, 2 were Hispanic, 2 were white, and 1 did not disclose ethnicity. One of 3 applicants was interviewed: the AAPI applicant and the white applicants.

- Questions to consider regarding cluster hiring:
  - What did the Hispanic applicants and the applicant who did not disclose cluster hiring not have in their applicants that the other applicants had causing them to be interviewed?
  - Did cluster hiring pose a barrier for potential African American, Native American, or Multi-Ethnic applicants?

In conclusion, one clear purpose of cluster hiring at Sacramento City College in Spring 2024 was to help diversify the faculty with a specific emphasis on hiring professors who understand the importance of supporting students of color who form the majority of SCC’s students but whose achievement may continue to expose equity gaps. Assuming that faculty applicants across the District were aware of job opportunities that might exist in their discipline at any of the four colleges, they would have been aware that SCC specifically was requiring applicants to identify how they had helped to disrupt the realities of historically underrepresented and underserved populations in higher education. Applicants could have expected that to be competitive at SCC they would have to address how they have specifically worked to dismantle effects of racism and barriers facing students of color in higher education, provided opportunities for college students from BIPOC communities in research, scholarship, media, art, or cultural/political engagement, or how they themselves have developed cross-cultural and anti-racist practices.

# Appendix B:

## Data Regarding Underrepresentation Among Faculty Applicants and All Employees

In the 2023 EEO Plan Component 10, a stated goal was that:

The District’s HR Department will annually review the District’s workforce composition and shall monitor applicants for employment on an ongoing basis to evaluate the District’s progress in implementing the EEO Plan, to provide data needed for the reports required by the Plan, to determine any additional measures to support equity, diversity, inclusion, and ensure equal employment opportunity, and to determine if significant underrepresentation of a monitored group may be the result of non-job related factors in the employment process.

Goal 2 of Los Rios Community College District Strategic Plan is to “ensure equity academic achievement across all racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and gender groups.” To reach this goal, the District set a specific indicator of achievement “to recruit, hire, and retain faculty, staff, and administrators who would reflect the diversity of students who attend our colleges.” (District, 2024)

During the Spring 2024 semester, the Los Rios Community College District authorized 71 full-time faculty hires and hired 54 new faculty across the four colleges. At Sacramento City College, cluster hiring was also implemented as an effort to further diversify the faculty.

### Results of Faculty Hiring in Spring 2024:

Tables 1 – 4 show ethnicity demographics of new full-time faculty hires at the four colleges. As shown in table 1, at American River College, 12 new tenure-track faculty were hired into 11 disciplines. 41.6% of faculty hired (5 out of 12) identify as people of color:
- 1 African American
- 3 Asian Pacific Islander
- 1 Hispanic

Four out of 12 faculty hired identify as white (33%):

Appendix B:

At Sacramento City College, 16 tenure-track faculty were hired into 12 disciplines: 
- 12 out of 16 identify as people of color:
  - 5 African American (31.3%)
  - 3 Asian American/Pacific Islander (18.8%)
  - 1 Hispanic (12.5%), 2 multi-ethnic (12.5%)
- 3 identify as white (18.8%)
- 1 professor who did not disclose ethnicity (6.33%):

**How Diverse were the Faculty Applicant Pools in Spring 2024?**

Tables 5 - 8 show ethnicity of faculty applicants in comparison to student diversity at each college during the Spring 2024 semester faculty hiring efforts:
- At American River College and Folsom Lake College, the majority of students identify as white. White applicants were the majority of faculty applicants at these colleges as shown in tables 5 and 7 respectively.
- At Sacramento City College, the majority of students identify as Hispanic. Hispanic applicants where the majority of faculty applicants as shown in table 8.
- At Cosumnes River College, as shown in table 6, white students comprise less than ¼ of the student body at 22.29% of the student population, but the vast majority of faculty applicants were white: 43.9%.

As shown in table 5, faculty applicant underrepresentation at ARC is most notable among those applicants identifying as Hispanic, Native American, and those not disclosing ethnicity. White applicants were the majority. 

*There were three cancelled or failed faculty searches at Sacramento City College.*

*This table is empty because for the 2021-2022 year while the application for employment did ask applicants to voluntarily disclose if they had a disability, that data was not tabulated or recorded. Not tabulating or recording data on disability status of applicants occurred out of an abundance of caution so that information would not inappropriately used. However, the District does need to have a mechanism to know when that data should be used to facilitate any accessibility concerns of applicants and those applicants who are hired.

*This table is empty because for the 2022-2023 year while the application for employment did ask applicants to voluntarily disclose they had a disability, that data was not tabulated or recorded. Not tabulating or recording data on disability status of applicants occurred out of an abundance of caution so that information would not inappropriately used. However, the District does need to have a mechanism to know when that data should be used to facilitate any accessibility concerns of applicants and those applicants who are hired. The table will serve as a template to tabulate and record voluntary disability status disclosure of applicants in the future.

*This table is empty because for the 2023-2024 year while the application for employment did ask applicants to voluntarily disclose if they had a disability, that data was not tabulated or recorded. Not tabulating or recording data on disability status of applicants occurred out of an abundance of caution so that information would not inappropriately used. However, the District does need to have a mechanism to know when that data should be used to facilitate any accessibility concerns of applicants and those applicants who are hired. The table will serve as a template to tabulate and record voluntary disability status disclosure of applicants in the future.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** September 11, 2024

---

**SUBJECT:** Resolution No. 2024-10: Intention to Approve a Contract Between CalPERS and LRCCD for Participation in the School Safety Members Pension

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item C  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
In July 2021, SEIU expressed an interest in exploring School Safety Member retirement for our Officers and initial inquiries were made to CalPERS. In 2022, the desire to add safety pension to Los Rios Supervisors Association (LRSA) and Management positions was expressed and the inquiry to CalPERS was expanded to include all Los Rios Police Department (LRPD) positions. Job descriptions were sent to CalPERS for review to determine eligibility. Through interactions with CalPERS and the bargaining units, the job descriptions were modified where needed, and all but the Chief of Police job description was deemed eligible to qualify in the School Safety Members pension.

**STATUS:**  
Communications continued with CalPERS and valuations were ordered and completed to determine the cost for such a change. In August 2024, the District received the specific steps required to put such a change up for vote to the employees. The first step of this process is the passing of a Resolution by the Board of Trustees for the intent to approve a contract with CalPERS. If the Board approves the attached resolution, an election will be required to permit the employees proposed to be included in this system to express by secret ballot their approval or disapproval of the retirement proposal. The contract shall not be approved if a majority of the affected members vote to disapprove of the proposed plan.

The estimated rates if the new plan is approved is as follows:

| Member Rate                     | Employer Rate                   |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Classic School Safety Members     | 15.00%                          | 15.44%                          |
| New School Safety Members         | 14.50%                          | 14.72%                          |

A summary of major provisions is also attached to this agenda.

The future annual costs, as determined by the CalPERS for the increase or change in retirement benefits are estimated to be $287,944 if all positions are filled.

**SUMMARY OF MAJOR PROVISIONS**  
**LOCAL SAFETY MEMBERS: 2.7% @ 57 Formula (Section 7522.25(d))**  

**Service Retirement**  
To be eligible for service retirement, a member must be at least age 50 and have five years of CalPERS credited service.  

The monthly retirement allowance is determined by age at retirement, years of service credit and final compensation. The basic benefit is 2.7% of final compensation for each year of credited service upon retirement at age 57. If retirement is earlier than age 57, the percentage of final compensation decreases for each quarter year of attained age to 2.0% at age 50.  

Final compensation is the average monthly pay rate during the last consecutive 36 months of employment, or 12 months if provided by the employer's contract, unless the member designates a different period of 36 or 12 consecutive months when the average pay rate was higher. Certain items of special compensation earned during your final compensation period will be included in your final compensation, in accordance with Board regulations.  

**Disability Retirement**  
Members substantially incapacitated from performing the usual duties for the position for his/her current employer would be eligible for disability retirement provided they have at least five years of service credit. The monthly retirement allowance is 1.8% of final compensation for each year of service. The maximum percentage for members who have between 10.000 and 18.518 years of service credit is one-third of their final compensation. If the member is eligible for service retirement the member will receive the highest allowance payable, service or disability. If provided by the employer's contract, the benefit would be a minimum of 30% of final compensation for the first five years of service credit, plus 1% for each additional year of service to a maximum benefit of 50% of final compensation.  

166
<!-- Page 167 -->
![Industrial Disability Retirement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Industrial+Disability+Retirement)

**Industrial Disability Retirement**  
Members permanently incapacitated from performing their duties, as defined above under Disability Retirement, and the disability is a result of a job-related injury or illness may receive an Industrial Disability Retirement benefit equal to 50% of their final compensation. If provided in the employer’s contract and the member is totally disabled, the disability retirement allowance would equal 75% of final compensation in lieu of the disability retirement allowance otherwise provided. If the member is eligible for service retirement, the service retirement allowance is payable. The total allowance cannot exceed 90% of final compensation.

**Pre-Retirement Death Benefits**  
**Basic Death Benefit**  
This benefit is a refund of the member's contributions plus interest and up to six months' pay (one month's salary rate for each year of current service to a maximum of six months).

**1957 Survivor Benefit**  
An eligible beneficiary may elect to receive either the Basic Death Benefit or the 1957 Survivor Benefit. The 1957 Survivor Benefit provides a monthly allowance equal to one-half of the highest service retirement allowance the member would have received had he/she retired on the date of death. The 1957 Survivor Benefit is payable to the surviving spouse or registered domestic partner until death or to eligible unmarried children until age 18.

**1959 Survivor Benefit**  
This benefit applies if it is provided by the employer’s contract and the employer has not entered into a voluntary 218 Agreement with the Internal Revenue Service. If provided by the employer's contract and the member is not covered under social security, a surviving spouse or registered domestic partner and eligible children may receive a monthly allowance as determined by the level of coverage. This benefit is payable in addition to the Basic Death Benefit or 1957 Survivor Benefit. Children are eligible if under age 22 and unmarried.

**Pre-Retirement Option 2W Death Benefit**  
This benefit is applicable when provided by the employer’s contract. The spouse or registered domestic partner of a deceased member, who was eligible to retire for service at the time of death, may elect to receive the Pre-Retirement Option 2W Death Benefit in lieu of the lump sum Basic Death Benefit. The benefit is a monthly allowance equal to the amount the member would have received if he/she had retired for service on the date of death and elected Option 2W, the highest monthly allowance a member can leave a spouse or registered domestic partner.

**PERS-CON-63**  
**167**
<!-- Page 168 -->
![Special Death Benefit](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Special+Death+Benefit)

**Special Death Benefit**

A surviving spouse registered domestic partner, or eligible children or stepchildren may receive a monthly allowance equal to one-half of the final compensation. If the cause of death is due to external violence or physical force while on the job, and there are eligible surviving children in addition to a spouse or registered domestic partner, the allowance may be increased to a maximum of 75%.

**Cost-of-Living Adjustments**

The cost-of-living allowance increases are limited to a maximum of 2% compounded annually unless the employer's contract provides a 3, 4, or 5% increase.

**Death After Retirement**

The lump sum death benefit is $2000 (or $3,000, $4,000 or $5,000 if provided by the employer's contract) regardless of the retirement plan chosen by the member at the time of retirement.

**Termination of Employment**

Members who have separated from employment may elect to leave their contributions on deposit or request a refund of contributions and interest. Those who leave their contributions on deposit may apply at a later date for a monthly retirement allowance if the minimum service and age requirements are met. Members who request a refund of their contributions terminate their membership and are not eligible for any future benefits unless they return to CalPERS membership.

**Employee Contributions**

Local safety members covered by the 2.7% @ 57 formula, shall have a contribution rate of 50 percent of the present value of projected benefits under the defined benefit that is attributable to the current year of service, or “normal cost,” as determined by CalPERS’ Actuarial Office.

**NOTE:** Should prior service be included in the contract, the employer bears the entire cost associated with the benefit for service earned prior to the effective contract date for the designated period stated in the contract.

All employer contribution rates are subject to adjustment by the CalPERS Board of Administration.

# Introduction
Measure M, a $475 million authorization, was approved by the voters on November 4, 2008. The proceeds are to be used for construction of new facilities and modernization of existing facilities at the District's four colleges and District Office/District-wide services. The elections were conducted under Proposition 39, which requires the establishment of a Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee. The Committee, representing various constituents of the community and appointed by the Board of Trustees, is responsible for the review of bond expenditures and the presentation of an annual report.

This publication is intended to present to the community a cumulative summary of the expenditures of the District's bond measures, as well as the Committee’s activities for the preceding year.

# Oversight Committee Activities
The District issued Series A of Measure M bonds in October 2010 in the amount of $130 million, issued Series B for $60 million in June 2013, issued Series C for $65 million in February 2018 and issued Series D for $80 million in June 2018. Measure E was issued in the amount of $130 million in July 2021. In November 2017, the District refunded $106.9 million of Measure M, Series A resulting in savings to our taxpayers of approximately $12.8 million (NPV). In April 2022, the Board of Trustees voted to issue $35 million in Refunding General Obligation Bonds with a projected taxpayer savings of $3.7 million (NPV).

During the past year, the Committee reviewed the financial activity for capital projects funded by bond proceeds. The Committee also received the District's Independent Auditor’s reports, financial statements, and performance audit for the bond funds as of June 30, 2023. These reports fulfill the requirement for separate review of the financial activity per the provisions of Proposition 39. The Committee received updates on the District’s budget, Scheduled Maintenance and Special Repair (SMSR) funding, the District’s Facilities Master Plan, and the status of bond funded projects in progress during the year.

# Summary
All expenditures authorized by the School Facilities Bonds have been reviewed by the Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee to ensure the money has been spent only on school facility improvements authorized by the Bond Act. All funds expended from Measure M are audited annually by an independent audit firm. The Oversight Committee has reviewed expenditures and projects and believes the District is in compliance with the requirements of Article XIII A Section 1(b)(3) of the California Constitution and consistent with the District’s approved local bond measures. Implementation of the District’s long-term capital plans continues to progress. For Measure M, $479.9 million has been appropriated for sixty-five projects including funding for infrastructure improvements at three of the colleges and District wide. Detailed information regarding the projects for both measures is provided on the following pages. The expenditures are cumulative through May 31, 2024.
