# Academic Senates’ Reports to the LRCCD Board of Trustees
## September 2024

### District Academic Senate (DAS) President, Paula Cardwell, Reports:
- The District Academic Senate is hard at reviewing and vetting the proposed board policy changes to the general education requirements for our local degrees. We hope to have the official changes to the Chancellor's Cabinet and the Board very shortly. The DAS would like to sincerely thank Bill Simpson, former District Curriculum Coordinating Council chair, and Renee Medina, our current chair, for their careful attention to and hard work on these proposed changes.
- Our August 30th Retreat was well-attended. We welcomed several new officers and committee chairs. We discussed goals and priorities for the coming year and had a great time spending time with Trustee Knight. I would like to personally thank the district for supporting our retreat. It was a wonderful way to kick off our year!
- The statewide Common Course Numbering Initiative is well underway and the new course taxonomy was announced in a memo from the Chancellor’s Office last week. Once fully implemented, an aligned Introduction to Public Speaking course will be numbered consistently across the state as COMM1000, for example. The goal of common course numbering is to “establish a structure that maximizes credit mobility for all students, strengthening equitable transfer and student success.”
- Our NAGPRA policy task force is very hard at work, meeting weekly and intentionally seeking the common ground within our equity and social justice frameworks and our commitment to and respect for academic freedom. We are hopeful that we will have a NAGPRA policy proposal to the District Academic Senate by early October.

### American River College Senate President, Brian Knikr, Reports:
- ARC welcomed 12 new full-time tenure track faculty this Fall, but is still working on filling 10 positions which had resulted in failed searches. Senate is working with the ARC administration to prioritize these committees in order to have the positions filled by the start of the Spring Semester.
- At ARC’s first academic senate meeting, senators discussed potential priorities for the year which included scheduling with limited space and further discussions of AI.
- ARC Academic Senate hosted an ice cream social to welcome faculty back.

**Cosumnes River College Senate President, Jacob Velasquez, Reports:**
- The CRC Academic Senate was disturbed to learn that the district's ban on various images and reproductions fails to comply with the U.S. Constitution and applicable law, according to a letter the district received from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.
- The CRC Academic Senate was further disturbed to learn that given the facts and circumstances surrounding the ban, principles of academic freedom and academic governance within the district have been disregarded, according to a letter from the American Association of University Professors.

**Folsom Lake College Senate President, Eric Wada, Reports:**
- The FLC Academic Senate had our retreat during Flex week where we discussed topics such as implementing legislation impacting our system, faculty voice in dual enrollment, faculty hiring, empowering student voices, Zero Textbook Cost (ZTC) programs and Open Educational Resources (OER). We then held a joint session with the Associated Students of Folsom Lake College where we shared our Senate goals, reviewed the 9+1 and 10+1, and strategized ways to welcome and include diverse student voices in our college and district governance. Our college administration colleagues joined us for introductions, some updates from President Art Pimentel, followed by lunch and networking. We thank our Student Senate and College Administration for their participation and for supporting the event.

**Sacramento City College Senate President, Amy Strimling, Reports:**
- SCC Senate is proud to have a nearly full roster this year with only a few vacancies. We are committed to exploring and working through professional and academic matters this year.
- SCC Senate is already hard at work this semester. We are currently focused on our Faculty Hiring Prioritization process as we look ahead to new faculty hires for the 2025-2026 academic year. While we are excited to welcome 16 new full-time faculty members this year, we recognize that there is still a great need for more as we had 37 requests come through last year and we have 13 LTTs this semester.
- SCC Senate proudly supports the proposed equity institute at SCC as we continue to seek ways to intentionally support our most disproportionately impacted students.
