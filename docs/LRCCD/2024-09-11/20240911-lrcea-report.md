Good evening Los Rios Community College Board of Trustees,

I would like to first thank President Haynes and Trustee Ortiz for going on record at last month, at our August 2024 meeting, regarding your confusion into the way our LRCEA cola negotiations unfolded with LRCCD this year. I am sorry you were misled into possibly believing that my negotiations team took cola from our lowest earners and gave it our highest earners. For me that is a horrible and evil thought not possible to imagine. Yes, Trustee Ortiz, I have been speaking the truth (and from my heart) with all my words at all your meetings over the past two years.

This past cola negotiations you were informed that all LRCCD bargaining units received a 4% cola increase. Only LRCEA was able to buy, through negotiations, a permanent 4% salary increase Step 7 using 2.34% of new incoming cola. That left an additional 1.66% cola to be permanently added to our salary schedule as well. LRCEA’s permanent salary schedule grew by a total 5.66% this year. All other LRCCD’s bargaining units permanent salary schedule only increased by 4%, while LRCEA’s grew by 5.66%. This was a big win for us.

Please let me help provide context into our rationale for using 2.34% of our cola salary increase, to buy a 4% Step 7 salary increase. This 4% Step 7 salary increase benefited our longest serving employees, while encouraging retention in our younger serving employees. More than half of my membership is now receiving a snap 5.66% raise- 4% Step 7 and 1.66% cola. Looking at the economic future of California it is safe to say we might have some funding shortfalls ahead. Creating a 4% Step 7 will give newer employees a step raise in potential upcoming zero cola years. Also, having Step 7 actually more aligns us with other classified bargain units in LRCCD (LRSA & SEIU). Really this was a fortunate win/win for our members, and all other LRCCD bargaining units are asking us how we did it.

Personally, I am currently on Step 5 (having been reclassified from an Assistant to a low level Specialists, my Steps were reset a few years ago). It will be a couple of years before I personally benefit from the full amount of this years cola. Yes, a 4% Step 6 raise plus a 4% cola raise would have moved me into Sacramento house buying range this year (coupled with my handyman weekend side jobs). But using 2.34% cola to buy a 4% Step 7 wasn’t a personal choice or personally motivated, it was about the immediate and long term greater good for my union membership, and by extension, our district as a whole.

Thank you again for asking for clarity into our very successful cola negotiations this year. I’m sorry you were initially misled to think we would take advantage of our lowest earners. To be honest, it felt like a dig into my honor and integrity (but you don’t really know me, yet). I promise, all of you, I will never let our lowest paid employees be taken advantage of as long as I serve in this role.

President Haynes, ma’am, I am a product of LRCCD. Student alumni and career student services employee. I am what the equity justice warriors look like, produced by LRCCD. I fight for our underserved/undervalued employees, I fight income inequality and inequity in benefits that is cancer to any organization, and I will fight against all those that want to take advantage of our underserved/undervalued employees using income inequality and inequity to benefit themselves. I fight for the Los Rios Community College District, ma’am, because this is my home and has been for decades. If there is something broken in my home I’m not going to abandon it and move into a new one, I’m going to fix my home. If you give me time I will demonstrate to all of you that my moral compass never falters. I believe in Los Rios. Next time please don’t try to silence the voices of LRCCD bargaining unit leaders, by cutting us off while we address other board members and the public.

Now, lets call out the elephant in the room. You have two conflicting negotiation stories/versions here. I know all of you either know a union leader or have been one yourself. Please reach out to them and share paragraphs 2 and 3 of this email, and ask them if they would have done the same thing. You don’t have to trust me, or the district managers that led you to believe we were taking cola from our lowest earners to give it to our highest earners, trust a neutral third party friend.

Lastly, Trustee Ortiz, it was you who mentioned you were informed that LRCEA leadership was taking cola from our lowest paid employees and giving it to our highest paid employees. Seconded by you, President Haynes. I hope I have thoroughly debunked that false claim made up by district office managers, but I am at everyone’s disposal if you desire further conversations into this matter.

But for real context, please see below the people who immediately benefited from a 5.66% raise this year. I first bracketed out the positions in multiples of 10k up to 100k, then totaled all the position over 100k a year. Please remember these are the positions at Step 6, before their new step seven. This is not starting salary at Step 1, this after 6 years of service. I will let you decide on the break between the highest paid and lowest paid, and which group benefited the most.

Positions making under 60k a year- 39 people (Clerks and low level Technicians)  
Positions making over 60k but under 70k a year-183 people (this is where the bulk of our Administrative Assistants live)  
Positions making over 70k but under 80k a year- 10 (Assistants, higher level technicians, low level Specialist, low level IT)  
Positions making over 80k but under 90k a year- 35 (Senior IT, Higher Lever Specialists)  
Positions making over 90k but under 100k a year- 15 (Athletic Trainers)  
Positions making over 100k a year- 49 (All IT related positions)
