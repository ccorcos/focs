![LRCFT report to the LRCCD Board of Trustees September 11, 2024](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=LRCFT+report+to+the+LRCCD+Board+of+Trustees+September+11,+2024)

On Labor Day, the LRCFT joined union families at the Central Labor Councilâ€™s annual Labor Day picnic. The event was well attended, and I thank the trustees who were able to attend. I had productive conversations with both trustees Kelly Wilkerson and Deborah Ortiz about a variety of issues impacting faculty.

The LRCFT PAFC continues to interview candidates for endorsement in the upcoming November general elections. At our last meeting we endorsed incumbents Tami Nelson and Kelly Wilkerson for Los Rios trustee. We continue to campaign for Dr. Colette Harris Mathews for Los Rios trustee, Flo Cofer for Sacramento Mayor, and Porsche Middleton for AD 7. This month we will interview several candidates running in West Sacramento for mayor and city council.

This semester our Exec. Board will finalize a revamping of our internal policies, including the creation of a new district-wide stewards network to encourage more faculty to be involved in union activity.

We are also creating a new salary committee and AI committee to explore issues in both areas.

We continue to reach out to new full and part time faculty to answer their questions and encourage them to join our union. We will hold a membership gathering for part time faculty at our union hall on Friday, September 27.

In closing, I continue to have major concerns with the Moratorium task force on the use of human remains. We need to encourage all parties to reach a consensus and construct a new policy to help faculty navigate what has become a very complicated issue.

Thank you.

LRCFT President
