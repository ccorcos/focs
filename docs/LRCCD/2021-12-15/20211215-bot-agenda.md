CRC: CRC Music faculty Omari Tau and Zach Watkins will be featured in the nation’s longest running contemporary music festival, Festival of New American Music (FeNAM). Now in its 44th season, FeNAM celebrates new American classical music, its creators and performers. This year, the free program will present a virtual festival featuring our music faculty members in multiple events. On Friday, November 12, 2021, at 7pm, Professor Tau will sing with mezzo-soprano Linda Baird, the Chevalier String Quartet, and conductor Ryan Murray in a performance of As One, a chamber opera with music by Laura Kaminsky and libretto by Pulitzer Prize winner Mark Campbell and Kimberly Reed. This beautiful, moving, and groundbreaking work tells the story of a transgender woman as she comes to terms with who she truly is.

FLC: Folsom Lake College has been named a 2021 Equity Champion of Higher Education by the Campaign for College Opportunity. The college was recognized for its exemplary work in awarding Associate Degrees for Transfer (ADT) to Latinx students. “Across all California Community Colleges, your campus ensured that a high proportion of degree or transfer seeking Latinx students received an ADT in the 2019-2020 academic year,” shared Michele Siqueiros, President of the Campaign for College Opportunity. “This is a tremendous achievement and the real work of equity.” FLC will be honored at a virtual event, the Champions of Higher Education Celebration, on Tuesday, November 16.

SCC: SCC will be receiving $1 million in funds in this year’s State budget, earmarked by Asm. McCarty, for facilities upgrades for the Child Development Center. The upgrades will include lowering the ceiling and soundproofing walls to create a quieter environment for the infant and toddler program, which will be restarting thanks to a separate $224,000 US Department of Education CCAMPIS grant (renewable for five years) that we received recently. The infant and toddler program will serve our student-parents as a priority and will also be open to employees and community members if there are spaces available. Additionally, SCC has been selected for a $50,000 grant from New America’s Center on Education and Labor, as well as an opportunity to join the organization’s national New Models for Career Preparation cohort. SCC applied for the grant, which sought community colleges that are exemplary in non-degree workforce development.

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

will complete coursework with an emphasis on basic science, healthcare delivery and culturally competent patient care. Students completing the degree will be prepared to enter programs for careers in Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Medical Assisting, Health Information Technology, Nursing and others. Students may also choose to complete this degree in preparation for transfer to a Health Sciences Baccalaureate degree program. Completion of the degree does not guarantee enrollment in any health occupation program.

**Justification:** Most colleges have a pre-health major option as most health programs have coursework that needs to be completed prior to enrolling into the program. Currently ARC does not have any Pre-Health majors. Currently the majority of these students select General Science or Transfer to a 4 year as their major. Not having a pre-health major on campus creates several issues for the campus and the student. Our campus has created homebases on campus where students are placed into a particular homebase where they receive support based on their major. When there is no pre-health major students are forced to select general majors. As a result, this makes it difficult for the campus to appropriately identify these students and makes it more difficult for the campus to develop appropriate roadmaps for these students as well. The district is wanting to move to opt-out scheduling which won’t be possible if roadmaps are general in nature. Having specific coursework in a pre-health major also ensures that the students’ coursework will be Financial Aid applicable.

State of California – Department of General Services  
Office of Fleet and Asset Management  
DGS OFAM CASAS Debarment (Rev 05/2018)  

**CERTIFICATION REGARDING DEBARMENT, SUSPENSION, INELIGIBILITY AND VOLUNTARY EXCLUSION – LOWER TIER COVERED TRANSACTIONS**

This certification is required by the General Services Administration regulations implementing Executive Order 12549-41 CFR 105-68 – for all lower tier transactions meeting the requirements stated at 41 CFR 105-68.110.

**Instructions for Certification**

1. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective lower tier participant is providing the certification set out below.

2. The certification in this clause is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when this transaction was entered into. If it is later determined that the prospective lower tier participant knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department of agency with which this transaction originated may pursue available remedies, including suspension and/or debarment.

3. The prospective lower tier participant shall provide immediate written notice to the person to whom this proposal is submitted if at any time the prospective lower tier participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or had become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

4. The terms “covered transaction,” “debarred,” “suspended,” “ineligible,” “lower tier covered transaction,” “participant,” “person,” “primary covered transaction,” “principal,” “proposal,” and “voluntarily excluded,” as used in this clause, have the meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage section of rule implementing Executive Order 12549. You may contact the person to which this proposal is submitted for assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.

5. The prospective lower tier participant agrees by submitting this proposal that, should the proposed covered transaction be entered into, it shall not knowingly enter into any lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment under CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the department or agency with which this transaction originated.

6. The prospective lower tier participant further agrees by submitting this proposal that it will include this clause titled “Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion – Lower Tier Covered Transaction,” without modification, in all lower tier covered transactions and in all solicitation for lower tier covered transactions.

7. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered transaction that is not proposed for debarment under CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from covered transactions, unless it knows that the certification is erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.

8. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require the establishment of a system of records by a participant in order to be in good faith the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

9. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 5 of these instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or agency with which this transaction originated may pursue available remedies, including suspension and/or debarment.

**Certification**  
(1) The prospective lower tier participant certifies, by submission of this proposal, that neither it nor its principals is presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction by any Federal department or agency.

(2) Where the prospective lower tier participant is unable to certify to any of the statements in this certification, such prospective participant shall attach an explanation to this proposal.

These items have a value of less than $5,000.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** December 15, 2021  

**SUBJECT:** Pay Rate Schedules: LRCFT Final 2020-21 Revisions  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item I  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Vice Chancellor  
Finance & Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
In August of 2011, CalPERS issued regulations defining compensation for retirement benefit purposes that specify the requirements for Board approval of salary schedules for employees.  

**STATUS:**  
The regulations prescribe that the format identify the title for every job classification; the pay rate for each job classification; the time base (i.e. hourly, daily, monthly, etc.) and the effective date and date of any revisions. The 2020-21 final salary schedules follow the provisions of the compensation formula in the District’s collective bargaining agreements.  

Over the past several years, the state has made investments in faculty by providing direct allocations for faculty. Given these additional resources, a four percent (4%) improvement to the prior year interim salary schedule is being made for LRCFT to support faculty’s efforts to transition from online to on ground. Using these funds for payments to faculty is consistent with state directives. This four percent (4%) improvement is in addition to the 6% improvement made for fiscal year 2020-21 and approved by the Board of Trustees on August 11, 2021; a 10% total one-time improvement to the 20-21 interim salary schedules.  

This current year salary schedule improvement will be reported to CalSTRS but, for any faculty who are members of CalPERS, it is not reportable to the CalPERS retirement system. Payment is expected to be made on Friday, December 17, 2021. At this time, there are no revisions to the final 2020-21 salary schedules for Faculty Stipends and Employment Service Agreements.  

Proposed salary schedules are attached as well as a Memorandum of Understanding between the LRCFT unit and the District.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended the Board of Trustees adopt and approve the attached revisions to the 2020-21 final salary schedules for the LRCFT unit.

**Background**  
Due to the hold harmless provision in the Student Centered Funding Formula, strategic enrollment management and reporting of FTES, unused ongoing resources to meet the long-term increases for CalPERS and CalSTRS, and other resources, the unit had ample one-time only resources to issue a 6% one-time-only salary schedule improvement for fiscal year 2020-21.  

In addition, due to the state’s investment in faculty over the past several years with direct allocations for faculty, there are sufficient resources to provide payments to support faculty’s efforts to transition from online back to on ground. Using these funds for payments to faculty is consistent with state directives.  

**Prior Year Improvement**  
A four percent (4%) improvement to the 2020-21 interim salary schedule is being made for LRCFT to support faculty’s efforts to transition from online back to on ground.  

**The following is agreed to:**  
**2020-21 One-Time Only Salary schedule improvement**  
The 2020-21 interim salary schedules will be improved by 4% to compensate faculty members for converting both instruction and support services back to on ground. This is to be paid Friday, December 17, 2021.  

**For the LRCFT:**  
Belinda C. Lum, LRCFT Chief Negotiator  
Jason Newman, LRCFT President  

**For the District:**  
Chanelle Whitaker, AVC, HR  
Carrie Bray, AVC, Finance

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** December 15, 2021  

**SUBJECT:** Pay Rate Schedules: LRCFT Interim 2021-22 Revisions  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item J  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Mario Rodriguez, Vice Chancellor Finance and Administration  
**CONSENT/ROUTINE** X  
**FIRST READING**  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION**  
**INFORMATION**  

**BACKGROUND:**  
In August of 2011, CalPERS issued regulations defining compensation for retirement benefit purposes that specify the requirements for Board approval of salary schedules for employees.  

**STATUS:**  
The regulations prescribe that the format identify the title for every job classification; the pay rate for each job classification; the time base (i.e. hourly, daily, monthly, etc.) and the effective date and date of any revisions. The 2021-22 interim salary schedules follow the provisions of the compensation formula in the District’s collective bargaining agreements.  

At this time last year, continuing resources in each unit’s bucket was carried forward to mitigate predicted reductions to state revenues and the likelihood of increased health care premiums. Due to a conservative budgeting approach and a generous 2021-22 state budget providing a 5.07% cost of living adjustment (COLA), the units have continuing resources available. The initial improvement varies across the units dependent upon factors such as the level of medical contribution and/or residual funds from 2020-21.  

At the August 2021 board meeting, interim 2021-22 salary schedules for LRCFT were approved that reflected no continuing improvements above the 2020-21 interim orders. Over the past months, the LRCFT unit discussed how to best improve their salary schedules to meet the interests of its members. At this time, LRCFT and the District have agreed to a restructuring of the LRCFT Salary schedules that utilizes the continuing resources available to LRCFT and benefits their unit as a whole. Specific modifications are as follows: A reset of the grade/step increments to reflect a linear model with fixed, flat-amount increments, eliminating the two longevity increments and expanding the schedules from a maximum step of 15 to a maximum step of 25. If adopted, a payment will be made for the July through November 2021 services covered by these changes and subject to retroactive improvement. Payment will be made on Tuesday, February 22nd. This current year salary schedule improvement will be reported to CalSTRS and, for any faculty who are members of CalPERS, to the CalPERS retirement system, in accordance with each retirement systems’ regulations. At this time, there are no revisions to the interim 2021-22 salary schedules for Faculty Stipends and Employment Service Agreements.  

67
<!-- Page 68 -->
Proposed salary schedules are attached as well as a Memorandum of Understanding between the LRCFT unit and the District that clarifies salary placement with respect to these revisions.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended the Board of Trustees adopt and approve the attached revisions to the 2021-22 interim salary schedules for the LRCFT unit.

![LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT Memorandum of Understanding LRCFT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=LOS+RIOS+COMMUNITY+COLLEGE+DISTRICT+Memorandum+of+Understanding+LRCFT)

**Background**  
Due to the hold harmless provision in the Student Centered Funding Formula, strategic enrollment management and reporting of FTES, unused ongoing resources to meet the long-term increases for CalPERS and CalSTRS, and other resources, the unit has ample one-time only resources.

Due to the 2021-22 state budget providing a 5.07% cost of living adjustment (COLA), and due to our prudent budgeting practices, we are able to provide an ongoing schedule increase of up to 4% of unit resources.

In August 2021, the 2020-21 salary schedules were improved by a one-time only increase of 6% and LRCFT employees were paid this improvement that same month. An additional 4% improvement applied to the 2020-21 interim salary schedules will be made in December to compensate faculty for the conversion from online back to on-ground. This additional payment in December is possible due to the state’s continued investment in faculty through the Budget Adoption process.

LRCFT delayed any current year retro in order to thoroughly review options. Upon careful consideration of various methods to provide a current year improvement, the changes outlined below are agreed upon.

**Current Year Improvement**  
LRCFT has opted to restructure the 2021-22 A-164, A-174, B1-3 and Substitute Rate salary schedules in lieu of an across the board percentage improvement. This will allow more step movement on the salary schedule.

**A-164, A-174 Salary Schedules**  
- Folding of the A-164 Librarian schedule into the A-164 salary schedule  
- Addition of Step 15 for Classes I & II  
- Removal of Longevity 1 & 2 Steps  
- Addition of Steps 16-25 for all Classes.  
- For A-164, increment Steps 2 through 15, on all Classes, by $3,100  
- For A-164, increment Steps 16 through 25, on all Classes, by $620  
- For A-164, increment Classes II through V, on all Steps, by $5,000  
- A-174 is developed based on proportionate relationship to A-164.  

**B1-3 Salary Schedules**  
- Addition of Step 15 for Classes I & II  
- Removal of Longevity 1 & 2 Steps  
- Addition of Steps 16-25  
- Continue the relationship between the B1 salary schedule to the A-164 schedule in that the B1 hourly rate is derived by dividing the A-164 annual rate for that Step & Class by 720.  
- Continue the relationship between the B2 and B3 salary schedules to the A-174 schedule in that the B2 and B3 hourly rate is derived by dividing the A-174 annual rate for that Step & Class by 1,305.  

When placing LRCFT members on the new Class and Step, they will be credited with one step increment for every year of service with the Los Rios Community College District. The faculty member’s original step placement upon hire will be used and could be between Steps 1-8.

**Substitute Salary Schedules**  
- The substitute schedule rates are tied to our current B1_B2_B3 schedules, and although we typically do not retroactively improve substitute rates, an exception is being made.

with this salary schedule redesign and salaries will be retroactively improved, beginning with August substitute hours.

Copies of the revised schedules are attached for reference.

The following is agreed to:

**2021-22 Continuing Salary schedule improvement**

The 2021-22 interim salary schedules will be improved as bulleted above and shown attached to this MOU. This will be an advance against 2021-22 new revenue. The new schedule will go into effect for the December 2021 pay period. Any difference in pay between the faculty member’s payment off the old salary and the newly adopted salary schedule will be paid on Tuesday, February 22, 2022.

Any residual funds from the 2020-21 calculation for the 6% retroactive salary schedule improvement and 4% conversion between online and on ground already paid will be carried forward to 2021-22.

**For the LRCFT:**  
Belinda C. Lum, LRCFT Chief Negotiator  
Jason Newman, LRCFT President  

**For the District:**  
Chanelle Whittaker, AVC, HR  
Carrie Bray, AVC, Finance

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** December 15, 2021

---

**SUBJECT:** 2021-22 Program Development Funds  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Vice Chancellor  
Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
Program Development Funds, also referred to as PDF or 20% funds, are the District’s discretionary funds for allocation to continuing and one-time-only purposes. The funds are comprised of both prior and current year resources per established formulas. Schedule I summarizes the funds available for the 2021-22 allocation. The overall guidelines for PDF allocations are: 1) to be responsive to the District/Colleges’ planning process and related goals and objectives; 2) to address any current or future emphases directed by the Governing Board; 3) to fund mandates or new costs imposed upon the District; 4) to balance the distribution across District-wide needs; and 5) to maintain the District’s conservative fiscal practices.

A key factor in the distribution of the funds is matching the type of resource (continuing or one-time-only) to the nature of the allocation. The type of revenue establishes or limits the type of expenditure that can be funded.

For 2021-22, the District has $1,005,075 to allocate toward continuing costs, which includes funding from the Student Centered Funding Formula, less the deficit to PDF not expended in 2020-21. These estimates are consistent with those contained in the Adopted Budget approved at the September 2021 board meeting. If the funding formula yields additional on-going resources in 2021-22, those will be included in the 2022-23 Program Development Funds allocation.

The District also has $18.5 million available for one-time general-purpose use of which $10 million is allocated towards College Capital Outlay Projects.

---

**STATUS:**  
The proposed allocations contained in Schedule II are organized by the goals outlined in the District’s Strategic Plan. Of note, these allocations have been focused on maintaining core elements of the District’s services operations and include minimal new items of expenditure this year. Strategy A focuses on establishing pathways for access and success, which includes continued support for marketing and the Confidential WEAVE program. Strategy B focuses on ensuring equitable academic achievement; however, given the large investments made through

the federal stimulus funds already made in this area, we are not including additional allocations at this time.

Strategy C focuses on improving teaching and learning opportunities, which includes resources to support faculty reassignments supporting academic programs. Strategy D focuses on creating an outstanding working and learning environment, which includes resources for professional development, safety and security, facility improvement needs, miscellaneous organizational costs, and staff allocations to improve services. An allocation has been made to increase the salary schedules of our College Safety Officers, both regular and temporary, to support safety and security needs across the District.

The District Budget Committee has reviewed the resources and allocations schedules. The formal approval of the allocations will take place in February when the first budget revision for 2021-22 is brought to the Board; however, salary schedules necessary to implement the proposals contained in the Program Development Fund schedule need Board action in order to be effective January 1, 2022.

RECOMMENDATION:
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the proposed changes to the SEIU salary schedule to implement the proposals contained in the Program Development Funds effective January 1, 2022.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** December 15, 2021  

**SUBJECT:** Overview of the Redistricting Process and Discussion of Potential Changes to Trustee Area Boundaries  
**ATTACHMENT:** None  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Information Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Jacob Knapp, General Counsel  
**CONSENT/ROUTINE**  
**FIRST READING**  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION**  
**INFORMATION** X  

**BACKGROUND:**  
After each decennial U.S. Census, local public agencies with officers selected by or from geographical districts must “redistrict.” This requires review of the recent Census population data and, if necessary, adjustment of voting area boundaries to keep them as nearly equal in population as possible, allowing for certain variances due to geography, topography, communities of interest, and other factors, all as required by state and federal law. Los Rios district trustees by trustee area are required to follow this redistricting process.  

**STATUS:**  
The District has retained Redistricting Partners, a consulting firm with expertise in decennial redistricting, to assist with its redistricting effort. Redistricting Partners will analyze the District’s Census data, existing maps, and population demographics, and will develop revised trustee area maps for the Board's consideration. The redistricting process takes place over several public meetings, culminating in the Board’s adoption of revised trustee area maps and the filing of those revised maps with the relevant county officials.  

A general overview of the redistricting items that will be presented to the Board over the coming months follows below:  
- December 2021 – Board presentation to review basics of redistricting, demographic data, process, and timeline. Initial mapping options may be presented for information and discussion.  
- January 2022 – Board hearing on draft map proposals. Draft maps will be publically available and posted in advance of the hearing as required by law.  
- February 2022 – Board hearing to consider and adopt final maps.  
- March-April 2022 – District staff and Redistricting Partners will work with the county registrars to file the maps, metes and bounds, GIS submissions, and any other documents required by the counties.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees receive the presentation and overview of the redistricting process from Redistricting Partners.
