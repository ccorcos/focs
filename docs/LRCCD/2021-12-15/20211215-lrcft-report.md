Greetings President Ortiz, trustees, and Chancellor King: I have the honor to provide the LRCFT report:

This was a busy year for the LRCFT. The passing of our former leaders Dean Murakami and Paul Baltimore, helping faculty understand the new vaccine protocols and mandate, and presenting and securing faculty approval of our new salary schedules have made a lasting impression upon our board and leadership.

We held three faculty forums in November with several hundred faculty to present new salary schedules to our membership. The faculty response was overwhelming favorable with a vote count of 557-19. We thank Vice Chancellor Mario Rodriquez and his team for their crucial role in the process.

We continue to work with the District Academic Senate on mandatory equity training to be negotiated next semester.

We are also expanding our DACA work and recently finalized an MOU on the Prison and Reentry Education Program.

The LRCFT PAFC recently endorsed Dave Jones for SD6 and Jaclyn Moreno for Sac County Supervisor for District 5. We will be interviewing candidates for the Sac County DA race next semester.

The LRCFT PAFC also voted to endorse two of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., marches in January.

Our members and leadership took part this semester in sympathy strikes for workers at Kaiser, UC-AFT lecturers, and state college faculty in the CFA.

We continue to maintain our LRCFT faculty relief fund and recently donated to the SCLC x-mas drive to help laid off workers.

LRCFT has also joined a statewide campaign with our affiliate CFT to improve part time faculty access to health care.

We are also working with Wilton Rancheria tribal leaders regarding unionized jobs at the new Elk Grove casino.

This semester the LRCFT is also presiding over internal elections for campus union president at ARC.

The LRCFT sponsored faculty to take part in the Run to Feed the Hungry Race in Sacramento.

The LRCFT will continue to invite LRCCD trustees to our meetings over the next six months.

The LRCFT exec. board continues to conduct an Equity Audit of existing LRCFT board and union practices.

The LRCFT will conduct a retreat for our board members on January 10.

In closing, I would like to honor a former LRCFT member Lawrence Chase who passed away suddenly a few weeks ago. He taught part time in communications in Los Rios for years. He was a former Sac State professor who also advised many faculty colleagues in Los Rios. His wisdom and insight will be sorely missed by our faculty and students.

Thank you,

Jason Newman  
LRCFT President
