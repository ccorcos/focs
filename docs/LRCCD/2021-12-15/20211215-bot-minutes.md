### 9. REPORTS AND COMMENTS

The following constituency representatives presented reports to the Board:  
- Jenn Galinato, Student Trustee  
- Kristin Farlow, American River College Classified Senate  
- Julie Oliver, President, Districtwide Academic Senate  
- Jason Newman, President, LRCFT  

**Chancellor’s Report:**

Chancellor King acknowledged the hard work of the Board, faculty, and staff over the last twenty months of the pandemic and addressed the access and enrollment goals of the coming year which were discussed at last week’s board study session. He also took a moment to thank the Trustees and many of the districtwide leaders for the phenomenal job they’ve all done during these challenging times.

The report below from the colleges was shared with the Board electronically:

**ARC:** ARC's men's soccer and volleyball teams both competed at the highest level possible earlier this month: the California Community College Athletic Association State Championships. Men's soccer fell just short, losing 2-1 to eventual state champion Mt. San Antonio College in the first round. The squad made it to the state Final Four tournament by winning three regional playoff matches. Volleyball upset favored Bakersfield in the first round of the state tournament before falling to West Valley College in the Final Four. The Beavers earned their trip to the state tournament with a pair of regional playoff wins, including a road upset of Sierra College. ARC is very proud of its Beavers!

**CRC:** Fifty (50) CRC students will receive an annual subscription to MasterClass, an American online education subscription platform on which students can access tutorials and lectures pre-recorded by experts in various fields. A year ago, Photography Professor Jim West was looking for a way to serve CRC students better by learning outside the classroom and applied for a grant from the MasterClass organization. Last week, he learned that CRC would be getting 50 free annual memberships to offer those students who could benefit from the classes and who would normally not be able to afford the cost. Those students who receive a membership will be able to access an unlimited number of classes for the year.

**FLC:** Folsom Lake College Mathematics Professor Wayne Jensen has successfully completed the Racial Equity in Mathematics Leadership Institute offered by the University of Southern California Race and Equity Center. The Institute seeks to involve math faculty in California’s community colleges in a series of learning and leadership opportunities to advance equity-minded reform of mathematics pedagogy. Jensen was nominated for the program due to his demonstrated commitment to the success of Black, Latinx, Native American, Asian, and Pacific Islander students in introductory transfer-level mathematics courses. With the valuable insights and practical tools he learned as part of the Institute, along with his personal student success and equity data,

**December 15, 2021**  
**Page 10**

available through the FLC Faculty Data Dashboard, Jensen plans to reflect on and adjust how he engages students and prepares course materials to help address any equity gaps.

SCC: Dr. Miguel Molina, Dean of Connection and Onboarding at Sacramento City College, has received the Mexican government’s highest award given to individuals who have opened pathways to Mexicans abroad, specifically in the United States. Dr. Molina was presented with the Ohtli Award recently at a ceremony held by the Mexican Consulate in Sacramento. The prestigious recognition, he says, “means the most to me for the disproportionate students who I have served, who were predominantly low income, first generation and who often faced barriers from reaching their dreams through higher education but who have instead met the challenge and gone on to become professionals, mentors, educators and role models for the generations behind them."
