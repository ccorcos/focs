**Academic Senate Reports to the LRCCD Board of Trustees**  
Respectfully submitted by the Academic Senate Presidents  
December 15, 2021  

**District Academic Senate (DAS) President, Julie Oliver, Reports:**

- In light of the LRCCD Board of Trustees special session on December 8, 2021 focusing on “Increasing Student Access through Equity-Informed Strategic Enrollment Management”, the DAS would like to emphasize the need to maintain consultation with the academic senates (district and colleges) as conversations continue. Dual enrollment and online education, two areas of focus in the enrollment dialog, are both areas where academic and professional purview exists. Academic senate faculty leadership look forward to helping to facilitate conversations and decision making surrounding these areas.

- Professional development regarding dual enrollment and online education are critically important to help faculty provide the highest quality pathways, programs, and course possible for inclusion in dual enrollment and online education programming. Resources are needed for continued support of current professional development offerings and to expand professional development offerings in the future.

- The DAS supports the concept of mandatory equity training for faculty. The DAS encourages the LRCFT to commence with negotiations on the topic in the spring.

- Faculty across the district are considering new ways of delivering curriculum to students. A joint work group of the District Curriculum Coordinating Committee (DCCC) and the District Educational Technology Committee (DETC) created a document titled “Hyflex Report” to provide some guidance on various types of instructional modalities. The work group report is included at the end of this document. The report will now be shared with various groups (academic senates, curriculum committees, technology committees, etc.) at the colleges for feedback.

- Finally, the DAS recently approved new Constitution and Bylaws documents. These new documents reflected some basic edits and updates needed. Starting in the spring the DAS will engage in discussions regarding possible deeper edits and changes to our guiding documents.

# ARC Academic Senate President, Alisa Shubb, Reports:

- ARC Academic Senate voted unanimously in favor of proposed changes to LRCCD Equivalency Regulation 5123.
- Faculty have been applying to the ARC Open Educational Resources/Textbook Affordability program - special thanks to Librarian and Student Success Council Chair Sarah Lehmann and the Textbook Affordability Committee of the Academic Senate.
- Highlighting the tremendous work of the ARC Center for Teaching and Learning (co-coordinators Jennifer Laflam & Pam Chao) we would like to share a sampling of some of the Fall 2021 semester's offerings:
  - **Creating a Student-Ready Syllabus**
    - Series description: a student-ready syllabus prioritizes students, human relationships, and instructor support of student success. In this session designed for teaching faculty who are preparing for next semester, participants will engage in a process of inquiry to assess and revise their syllabus for student-readiness. Information on equity-minded and transformative syllabi from USC’s Center for Urban Education, Skyline College’s Equity Institute, and @ONE will be shared.
  - **Transforming Assignments through a Culturally and Historically Responsive Literacy Perspective**
    - Series description: Based on the work of Dr. Gholdy Muhammad and Kevin Gannon, this professional development series was designed with teaching faculty in mind. In this three-part series, we will have the opportunity to work in peer groups to transform our assignments by applying Gholdy Muhammad’s Equity Framework for Culturally and Historically Responsive Literacy.
  - **CTE/CTE Faculty PD Workshop: Grading to Sort or Grading for Equity?**
    - Series description: Did you know that our current grading system was created to sort students and uphold the caste system in America? Facilitator Asha Wilkerson will focus on the origins of our current grading system, discover its purpose, and how pieces and practices serve or detract from student learning. Together we’ll take a look at what grading for equity actually means and then analyze how we can revise our grading practices and policies to truly get to the heart of the matter, preparing students for the workforce. This is just the beginning of reimagining CE/CTE programs and the equitable impact they can have on ARC students.
  - **Alternatives to A-F Grading**
    - Series description: Facilitator and moderator, Asha Wilkerson (Legal Studies) will open the session with a discussion of alternative grading methods, and then faculty panelists Sonya Reichel (Math) and Kristina Rogers (English) will share their experiences using alternative grading methods in their classes. The conversation will focus on their processes of implementing new systems, student feedback, and the overall success of using grading alternatives to implement equity.
  - **Building Inclusive & Engaging Online Classrooms**
    - Series description: Facilitated by Dr Sharla Berry. Working in groups of no more than 35 people, faculty will learn strategies for building engaging online courses that are inclusive of students from diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Faculty will also spend time collaborating with each other to share successful tools, strategies, and practices for online learning.

# CRC Academic Senate President, Scott Crosier, Reports:

- CRC continues our efforts to support our African American and Latinx students through our We Won’t Fall campaign. The CRC Academic Senate values individuality in our college’s work as we strive to overcome the disparities we currently face across our society.
- CRC Academic Senate discussed and supported the proposed changes to LRCCD Equivalency Regulation 5123.
- CRC continues our work to develop and inventory open educational resources to provide additional courses of zero textbook costs. We have recently hired additional support professionals and will continue to ramp up the work in the Spring semester.
<!-- Page 3 -->
- CRC is excited to welcome 4 new faculty members in the Spring. We are coordinating efforts across the campus to support our new faculty with a successful mentorship program, campus orientation workshops and the CRC Equity Institute.

**FLC Academic Senate President, Eric Wada, Reports:**

- The FLC Academic Senate continues to sponsor a scholarship for students. This year’s scholarship has been named in memory of Professor Paul Baltimore. Criteria are being reimagined to ensure that student achievements are equitably recognized.
- We recently reviewed and affirmed minor revisions to the College Vision and Mission statement.
- As the college and district continues to explore options for dual enrollment (broadly defined), faculty are interested in ensuring that there is equitable access to dual enrollment opportunities, professional development for faculty to support delivering quality education, and consultation with faculty in the pursuit, planning, and implementation of dual enrollment programs.
- We are preparing for a mostly online suite of professional development events before the spring semester, with a fully online Friday schedule.
- Welcome to our new full-time faculty who will be engaged in a new faculty orientation.

**SCC Academic Senate President, Lori Petite, Reports:**

- Sandra Guzman, our SCC Academic Senate Vice President, Counselor, and Puente Program Coordinator, along with other members of the Los Rios Undocumented Student Task Force, facilitated an UndocuAlly Training for LRCCD LRMA, Supervisors, and Confidential Employees on December 1st. Presenters included SCC Faculty, Dr. Belinda Lum and Sandra Guzman, Deans, Dr. Miguel Molina and Andrea Gaytan from SCC, and Veronica Lopez from ARC. The goals of the workshop were to:
  1. Increase our understanding of the undocumented student and community experience.
  2. Introduce the resources, programs, and services available to support the undocumented community.
  3. Develop “Allyship in Action” at both individual and institutional levels.
  4. Inspire change.

With 58 participants at its peak, the workshop highlighted some of the changes in LRCCD in the last 10 years, including Emergency Funds, Free Legal Assistance and the emerging Undocumented Experience Programs. A notable concern is that our URP centers have, until now, been staffed with temporary positions and all four campuses currently have vacancies due to personnel seeking full-time positions within Los Rios. We hope this training brings more awareness to the staffing issues, the impacts to our students, and solutions needed to move the work forward.

- SCC’s Academic Senate is also extremely proud of the recent OHTLI Award presented to Dr. Miguel Molina of SCC by the Mexican Consulate. What a tremendous honor and so well-deserved. Congratulations, Dr. Molina!
- Our SCC Academic Senate Subcommittees are deeply engaged in promoting equity work across our college. This month, we highlight the work of our Curriculum Equity Sub-Committee (Curriculum Chair: Renee Medina, Equity Sub-Committee Co-Chairs: Marques Gales and Duane Leonard) to further equity-focused changes in our curriculum:
  - Course Outlines: Two faculty members per department have been assigned to assist local departments in making changes to their course outlines in Spring, including Business, Fashion, International Studies and Intercultural Studies.
  - Resources: Equity Coordinator and Chemistry Professor, Devoun Stewart’s “Culturally Relevant Pedagogy in STEM (and anywhere)”, “Approaches to Trauma-informed Teaching,” and New Faculty Academy (NFA) and Business Professor, Dr. Debra Crumpton’s “Open for Anti-Racism” (focus on non-disposable assignments) workshop materials have been collected and reviewed for promotion to departments. ASCCC’s Rostrum article on making curricular changes that support equity and anti-racism in the college has also been reviewed with the goal of aligning efforts with their recommendations.

![HyFlex Report](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=HyFlex+Report)

- **Articulation:** SCC's Articulation Officer, Shannon Gilley, provided a review on articulation policy so departments may be guided effectively to ensure articulation remains or is easier with curricular revisions (IGETC/CSU GE patterns, C-ID coding, Assist.org).
- **Professional Development:** This coming Spring, the Equity Subcommittee will host professional development opportunities to acquaint faculty and departments with the committee's work, highlighting resources and support available to assist departments in making curricular changes that include equity and anti-racist intentionality. The committee will also schedule department-specific workshops throughout the semester to facilitate and help to ensure that changes are implemented.

- **Tenure-track faculty:**
  - We are delighted to welcome new faculty to SCC including in Ethnic Studies, Biology, Chemistry, and Psychology, and whose names have been submitted to the Board for approval.
  - We are equally delighted for our faculty who have recently been recommended for tenure in their fourth year. We believe this cohort of faculty represent some of the finest equity champions for our students.

- **Board Study Session on dual enrollment and online instruction:** Faculty respectfully urge the Board to consider how to prioritize resources for faculty professional development related to online instruction. We believe that ongoing culturally-responsive, equity-focused, pedagogical, and technical training is critical so that faculty may be better equipped to meet the needs of our students. We would like to take the opportunity to wish the Board of Trustees a very happy and healthy holiday season.

**HyFlex Report**  
DETC-DCCC Joint Workgroup  
Dec 7, 2021  

The Los Rios district’s response to the recent pandemic has opened new doors in the delivery of educational opportunities to students. The following report is the result of a desire to meet students’ needs for flexibility in scheduling, provide quality learning modalities, balance faculty workloads, and secure equity across our student population. Additional "flex" modalities present an option to provide equitable access to courses, including learning opportunities, class materials, resources, and other success measures for students. Because the instructor and student are separated by distance and/or time, these “flex” modalities are classified as Distance Education (DE). Refer to the Appendix for a comparison chart.

Los Rios’ primary transfer institution, CSU Sacramento, has outlined available instructional modalities on their website. We have attempted to align our definitions of HyFlex and SyncFlex with those of CSUS to minimize confusion for students enrolling at both institutions simultaneously.

**HyFlex Modalities:** In-person, Synchronous online, Asynchronous online  
**Definition:** Students choose between three options of how, when, and where they attend class. Students can decide which option to select week-by-week throughout the semester.
- **Option 1:** Meet at the scheduled class time in person in an on-campus classroom.
- **Option 2:** Meet at the scheduled class time through a remote connection.
- **Option 3:** Attend asynchronously completing class sessions using online materials.

**Example:** Class meets MWF 9:00-9:50 AM in MND 1003 and via a live Zoom connection and available asynchronously via Canvas.
<!-- Page 5 -->
# SyncFlex

**Modalities: In-person and Synchronous Online**  
Notes: This modality differs from HyFlex in that there is no asynchronous online option. CSUS calls this “HerkyFlex” to fit within their mascot branding.  
**Definition:** Students choose between two options of how, when, and where they attend class. Students will make their selection about which option they will take upon enrolling in the class:  
- **Option 1:** Meet at scheduled class times, in-person, on campus.  
- **Option 2:** Meet at predetermined scheduled class times online through a remote connection.  

**Example:** Class meets MWF 9:00-9:50 M. in MND 1003 and via a live Zoom connection.

## HyFlex and SyncFlex Considerations:

Teaching the same group of students simultaneously using multiple modalities offers unique challenges. Faculty, students, and support staff should consult the following before opting-in to a HyFlex or SyncFlex course.

### Operational
- How will these modalities be coded? Fully online, partially online, or other form of DE?
- How will attendance be measured for students selecting the asynchronous option?
- How will attendance be measured if a student switches between modalities?
- How will retention be tracked for HyFlex and/or SyncFlex courses? How will your department know which of the three modalities had the poorest retention?
- How will vaccine mandates affect enrollment in HyFlex or SyncFlex courses?

### Instructors
- **Instructor Attendance:** on-campus presence at all scheduled meeting times is expected  
- **Workload:** if you’re not already comfortable teaching synchronous and/or asynchronous online modalities, this is a heavy lift.  
- **Technology:** how will instructors receive training for using the equipment?  
- **Classroom Management:** how will the instructor engage all synchronous students, both on-campus and via live remote connection.  
  - During class, how does the instructor make eye contact with all students if the camera is in one location and the Zoom screen is in another location, and neither within the same field of view as the in-person students?  
- **Regular and Effective Contact:** how will the instructor ensure regular and substantive interaction with students selecting the synchronous and/or asynchronous options?  
  - It’s tough for remote students to know who is speaking in the physical classroom because there is not a highlighted box around the speaker like there is for remote attendees.  
- **Course Design:** how will the instructor ensure that each modality provides students opportunities to develop skills necessary to achieve course outcomes?  
- **Equitable Learning Opportunities:** how will the instructor ensure that students will experience equitable learning opportunities regardless of the modality they select?  
- **Preparing Students:** how will students know what is expected of them?
<!-- Page 6 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

- **Student expectations of privacy:** will the camera in the room show what’s on the devices being used by in-person students?
- **Performance release:** If a session is recorded and put online, any students whose faces can be seen will need to sign a performance release.

### Students
- **Understanding Modalities:** how will the District ensure students understand these new modalities, and how they affect their course selection?
- **Access to Technology:** do students know the technology requirements for the course, and if so, do they have access to the required technology?
- **Comfort with Technology:** are students comfortable using webconferencing software, an online learning management system, and other technology tools to access course materials and interact with their peers and their instructor?
- **Student Engagement:** are students prepared to engage in course activities, even when accessing the course remotely or asynchronously?
- **Recordings:** are students comfortable with being recorded if they plan to attend the course synchronously or on-campus?

### Room Setup and Support
- **Does the room have a microphone** so that remote students can hear in-person students clearly, no matter where they are sitting in the room?
- **Does the room have a microphone capable of distinguishing the current speaker from the ambient noises** in the room, including side conversations among in-person students?
- **Will there be a screen at the back of the room** so the instructor can have the in-person students and remote students in their field of view? If so, will it be big enough so that the instructor can see remote attendees and whatever instructional material is being used?
- **What kind of support will be available in the classroom?** Will it be comparable to the support offered for ITV courses in the past?
  - ITV had at least two support people for each and every class.
  - “With proper support staff in the room each time.”
- **What kind of support will be available to students who access live sessions remotely?**
- **How do we properly and appropriately edit and archive recordings?**
  - Who will ensure recordings protect student’s right to privacy?
  - Who will archive?
  - Who will edit the videos (ex: length, removing down-time, etc.)?
  - Who will caption the videos?

### Final Thoughts
If Los Rios adopts this new model in an attempt to be more nimble in support of our students, its success will depend on continuous assessment and a willingness to be nimble in how “flex” our instructional modalities will be. This includes effective professional development for instructional faculty and the classified professionals that will likely be needed to support this mode. The most important consideration of supporting “flex” instructional modalities will of course be student enrollment, engagement, and success.

# Los Rios CCD Academic Senate Call to Action

**Approved Tuesday November 17, 2020**

The four Los Rios Colleges and the District Academic Senate support the Academic Senate of California Community Colleges (ASCCC) Fall 2019 Plenary Resolution “Support Infusing Anti-Racism/No Hate Education in Community Colleges”. Specifically, to the following Resolved statements from that resolution:

- denounce racism for its negative psychological, social, educational, and economic effects on human development throughout the lifespan;
- take steps to not only strive for a greater knowledge about and the celebration of diversity but also to support deeper training that reveals the inherent racism embedded in societal institutions in the United States, including the educational system, and asks individuals to examine their personal role in the support of racist structures and the commitment to work to dismantle structural racism; and
- infuse Anti- Racism/No Hate Education in all its activities and professional development opportunities to the degree that doing so is feasible.

To achieve this, our Academic Senates are committed to:
1. Include a discussion of anti-racism/no-hate education on agendas. Remembering that we do not have to have an answer to start a conversation.
2. Prioritize culturally responsive curricular redesign with our curriculum committees.
3. Acknowledge, without assigning blame, that the structure of our colleges houses the biases and prejudices of their founding times. Those biases have privileged some and disadvantaged others, particularly African American and LatinX communities.
4. Prioritize the evaluation of hiring and evaluation processes with an equity lens.
5. Request services from the ASCCC about any of these topics if needed.
6. Evaluate our academic senates and find the voices among our faculties missing in governance. Find ways to empower those voices.
7. Work with our administrations, classified professional colleagues, and students to find constructive ways students can express themselves about structural and historical biases that exist.
