# Board of Trustees Report – December 2021

## AMERICAN RIVER COLLEGE
**Kristin Farlow, Classified Senate President**

The ARC Classified Senate’s final fall meeting was Wednesday, December 8. Our Senate planned and hosted a community-building, virtual gathering yesterday, December 14th to provide Classified Professionals with a space to connect and celebrate the work of Fall Semester.

Senate will begin discussions around planning our Annual Spring PD Day beginning in January with the goal of hosting the event in-person. The day is sponsored by ARC Classified Senate for all Classified Professionals. Plans will need to remain flexible as Spring Semester on-ground offerings open up.

As a priority to increase communication, our Senate Vice President and Communications Officer will begin hosting a podcast for monthly updates and e-newsletter “bites” to keep Classified up to date. Officers have also re-formed a committee for our Classified Professional of the Year Award in an effort to increase recognition.

The CRC Classified Senate has been hard at work with end of fall semester activities, while also helping students prepare for the spring semester. All student support offices are serving students many ways in an effort to meet all students’ needs… virtually, by video with drop-in and appointment options, by phone and email, as well as offering in-person services.

Initial conversation has begun in relation to plans for a spring semester professional development day and/or institute.

The last of the senate monthly meetings for this semester took place Wednesday, December 8th. Vice President of Administration Theresa Tena kindly offered to attend to field questions related to the newly introduced Alternate Schedule and Remote Working Policy. The rest of the meeting time was spent connecting and fellowshipping as a community with holiday themed activities and games.
