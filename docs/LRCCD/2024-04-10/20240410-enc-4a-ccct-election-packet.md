**What are the major issues and activities that should be considered by the CCCT Board and the League in the next two years? (Please use 50 words or less. Any portion of the statement beyond this limit will not be included.)**  
The major issues and activities that the CCCT Board should consider in the next couple of years is first and foremost keeping a very close eye on the Governor's Budget and the impact it could have on Community Colleges. Secondly, is the decline in enrollment facing many colleges post COVID.  

**How do you feel you can contribute in these areas? (Please use 50 words or less. Any portion of the statement beyond this limit will not be included.)**  
As an active board member since 2013, we passed a $350 million dollar bond in 2016 with a 71% approval rating from the community. I was also the only Trustee at that time who was an educator. As an educator, I understand the importance of establishing DEIA at the college.

**What are the major issues and activities that should be considered by the CCCT Board and the League in the next two years? (Please use 50 words or less. Any portion of the statement beyond this limit will not be included.)**  
Shifting enrollments, looming ‘hold harmless’ timelines, and a very nuanced political landscape threaten community colleges. The Board and League must continue to fight for predictable and sustainable funding. We must engage and educate new and seasoned trustees. We must partner with allies to strengthen our advocacy efforts.  

**How do you feel you can contribute in these areas? (Please use 50 words or less. Any portion of the statement beyond this limit will not be included.)**  
My advocacy and passion for community colleges is informed by thirty years of community college experience and research. I have witnessed the positive impact of offering a baccalaureate degree program at an urban HSI college and the effectiveness of dual enrollment in small rural communities.
