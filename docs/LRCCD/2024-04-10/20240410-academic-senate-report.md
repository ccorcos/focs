# Academic Senates’ Reports to the LRCCD Board of Trustees
## April 2024

### District Academic Senate (DAS) President, Alisa Shubb, Reports

- The District Academic Senate forwarded the following recommendations for changes to CCCApply:
  - For students who select as their Educational Goal “obtain an associate degree and transfer to a 4-year institution.” Set "Special Filter" to Option A* (include ADTs and local degrees for transfer).
  - For students who select any other Educational Goal:
    - Add “Transfer to a 4-Year Institution” to the list of options for students (rather than “transfer without a degree”)
      - This option will maximize the opportunity for students to receive financial aid.
    - Add “undecided / undeclared” (rather than “undecided”) to the list of options for students and tie to the program code that bypasses the "major reselect hold" so that students are free to enroll in classes without selecting a major - and flag this option related to FA.
      - This option will reduce barriers for students whose educational goal does not include declaring a major.
- The DAS continues to solicit input and discuss LRCCD General Education & graduation requirement revisions needed to align with new Title 5 requirements.
- The DAS is continuing to work with our PREP standing committee to address concerns that PREP program administration is circumventing collegial consultation processes.
- The DAS has not yet had time to fully consider the public statement read by President Haynes on behalf of the entire Board at the March meeting and is still working on a formal response to each of the colleges' votes of no confidence in the Chancellor.

# CRC Academic Senate President, Jacob Velasquez, Reports:

- The CRC Academic Senate has worked diligently to improve and protect the educational opportunities offered at CRC. We’ve committed to understanding course success and taken steps to identify problems and design solutions to help our students succeed. We have discussed the new early alert system at CRC to ensure that it’s working well and to identify ways to improve it. We’ve worked toward cultivating a robust culture of academic integrity with the goal of enhancing our students’ learning environment. This work includes the creation of a workgroup, a faculty survey, and resource collections on generative AI tools, as well as initiating productive conversations with our Student Conduct Office to understand their process and suggest improvements. And with the aim of protecting our students’ access to an education of the highest quality, we’ve discussed the appropriateness of using course success rates in making scheduling decisions, and the appropriateness of including the Living Skills and the American Institutions requirements in the new general education pattern. In short, the CRC Academic Senate has done a lot to promote the educational well-being of the district.

We have, however, been hindered in our ability to carry out our work. We spent time and human resources on both the district administration’s mishandling of the Moratorium and the threat to CRC educational opportunities posed by it. We spent time and human resources on collegial-consultation issues raised locally and throughout the district. We also spent time and human resources on various resolutions of no confidence, which were themselves a result of district administrative leadership deficiencies. In fact, since November of 2023, all our meetings have had at least one agenda item dedicated to such issues. Imagine how much more we could have accomplished for our students if we weren’t forced to spend time on these issues and to address the threats to the district’s educational well-being that they engender.

The CRC Academic Senate recognizes the Board’s role in this. The first sentence on the Los Rios Board of Trustees website reads that “[t]he Board is responsible for the educational…well-being of the district.” Using the authority delegated to it by the Board of Trustees, the CRC Academic Senate has done its part to take responsibility for the district’s educational well-being. Now, as a part of our recently adopted Resolution of No Confidence in Chancellor Brian King, we urge the Board to do its part: we write, “Resolved, That the CRC Academic Senate urges the LRCCD Board of Trustees to put an end to Brian King’s service as Chancellor.”

- We continue reviewing the Los Rios GE pattern, and remain open to hearing from the Student Senate after they invited a presentation on the topic at one of their meetings in late February. We also seek faculty feedback before the item comes for a vote later this month.
- The structure of our New Faculty Orientation (previously New Faculty Academy) is being vetted by our Professional Development Committee. We continue to work with local administration to find ways to support new faculty and sustain the critical onboarding needed to recruit and retain faculty particularly faculty of color.
- We recently approved a dual enrollment and early college subcommittee of our Matriculation and Student Success Committee. The committee will be a place where faculty can be meaningfully and appropriately engaged in curricular offerings, program development, program review, professional development, and student preparation/success discussions as each of these areas is important to successfully implementing any dual enrollment or early college offering.

![SCC Academic Senate President (Interim), Amy Strimling, Reports:](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SCC+Academic+Senate+President+(Interim),+Amy+Strimling,+Reports:)

- SCC is nearing the end of the faculty hiring interviews. It is with pride that we finish this with a focus on cluster hires to support diversifying our faculty. As this process ends, we are reminded that there is still a great need for more full-time faculty in many departments as well as many adjunct faculty.
- We are accepting applications and will be completing interviews for faculty coordinator positions. This includes an Equity Pathways Coordinator as a part of the Culturally Responsive Pedagogy Inclusive Best Practices grant to develop DEIA-focused professional development opportunities for adjunct faculty.

# Resolution of No Confidence in Chancellor Brian King
S-01, Adopted by the CRC Academic Senate on March 22, 2024

WHEREAS, The ARC, FLC, and SCC Academic Senates have adopted resolutions of no confidence¹ which outline concerns about the leadership ability of Chancellor Brian King, including a pattern of practices resulting in insufficient collegial consultation dating back to 2019, a lack of college autonomy, and an ongoing lack of transparency in decision-making processes, and which indicate that students have been negatively impacted by failures of his leadership; and

WHEREAS, We at CRC have recently been made vividly aware of the Chancellor’s leadership deficiencies and their adverse impacts on students, due to recent events related to the improper implementation of the Moratorium on the Use of Human Remains, Native American Cultural Items, Images, and Reproductions of Native American Human Remains and Cultural Items at CRC²; and

WHEREAS, Concerns about the Chancellor and district administrative leadership more generally have been raised for years and continue to be raised, e.g., in various resolutions and white papers:
- the Fall 2018 SCC White Paper,
- the Spring 2021 SCC resolution,
- the Spring 2022 SCC White Paper,
- the Spring 2023 ARC resolution, and
- the Spring 2023 DAS resolution;

And this fact indicates that meaningful change is not forthcoming; therefore, be it

RESOLVED, That the CRC Academic Senate has no confidence in the leadership of Chancellor Brian King; and

RESOLVED, That the CRC Academic Senate urges the LRCCD Board of Trustees to put an end to Brian King’s service as Chancellor; and

RESOLVED, That the CRC Academic Senate supports a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Brian King should the LRCCD Academic Senate consider such a resolution.

¹ See the ARC Vote of No Confidence in Chancellor Brian King, the Vote of No Confidence in Los Rios Community College District (LRCCD) Chancellor, and the Folsom Lake College Academic Senate Resolution S24-01.

² Teaching materials outside the scope of the moratorium were improperly removed from the CRC Anthropology Department’s inventory, threatening hundreds of CRC students in their ability to learn and transfer. (See the Statement on Impacts to Anthropology Students.) Attempts to resolve the problem faced an unreasonable level of difficulty attributable to the Chancellor’s leadership style.
