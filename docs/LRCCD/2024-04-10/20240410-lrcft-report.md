LRCFT Report to the LRCCD Board of Trustees April 10, 2024

The LRCFT sponsored and participated in the Cesar Chavez day march, the largest annual labor event in Sacramento. Once again, one of the most rewarding aspects of the event are the conversations we had with Latino students who stopped by our table to talk about enrolling in classes in Los Rios.

The LRCFT later this month is sending a delegation of faculty union members to Cuba to participate in humanitarian and educational work.

Our board is in the process of creating a Dean Murakami award for LRCFT members.

Our PAFC will interview Maggie Krell for a potential endorsement in the AD 7 race.

The LRCFT will join the CFT for our collective lobby day with state legislators on April 24.

We will also join our classified CFT union siblings statewide for a classified day of action on May 22 in the Capitol. The LRCFT is increasingly reaching out to SEIU and LRCEA to build union solidarity in Los Rios.

Our faculty union picnic is May 17 from 1 to 5 pm at Sierra 2 Center for the Arts.

The LRCFT will send a group of our new faculty union leaders to CFTâ€™s Union summer school in June to become better trained in helping faculty.

We will also attend the AFT national convention in Houston in July.

In closing, this Friday the LRCFT will hold a debt clinic for faculty to assist with student loan forgiveness.

Thank you!
