## Los Rios Community College District Indigenous Land Acknowledgment Statement
In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

Board Report #4, an overview of the top 30 Career Technical Education (CTE) programs in Los Rios.

**B. Sacramento City College’s Mechanical Electrical Technology Program: An Example of Career Education Programming at Work**

Sacramento City College faculty, managers, and students highlighted the opportunities afforded to students via the Mechanical Electrical Technology Program, which provides courses in the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and refrigerating systems.

**6. BOARD MEMBER REPORTS**

President Haynes read the following statement on behalf of the Board of Trustees in response to the recent Votes of No Confidence in Chancellor King:

As part of my Board Report tonight, I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Los Rios Board of Trustees regarding the recent Resolutions of No Confidence in Chancellor King passed by Los Rios Academic Senates. Given the public nature of this critique of Chancellor King’s performance, we are taking the unusual step of making this public response.

We note that the past several years have been incredibly challenging for our district, as they have been for every community college district - and institution of higher education - in the State of California. In spite of the challenges placed upon us by many factors beyond our control, Chancellor King has led, and continues to ably lead our district. Our district continues to maintain a solid fiduciary and operational infrastructure, access to our colleges is growing and nearing pre-pandemic levels, our colleges were all recently successfully reaccredited, and Los Rios is widely considered among the leaders in some of the most innovative work happening around our state with student success initiatives.

Further, we appreciate that, in his efforts to guide our district through very challenging times and improve outcomes for students, Chancellor King has had to make a number of very difficult decisions. Chancellor King and his team have also demonstrated a consistent willingness to meet and engage with the Academic Senate, and other critical stakeholders, on contentious decisions.

The Board continues to have confidence in Chancellor King and his leadership team and for that reason, the Board has taken action to provide Chancellor King with a 4 percent raise, effective immediately.

**7. FUTURE AGENDA ITEMS**

No future agenda items were requested.

New to District Courses

American River College

1. CARPT 498 Work Experience in Carpenters Apprenticeship (0.50 - 4.00 units)

   Prerequisite: None.

   Enrollment Limitation: Indentured in the carpenters apprenticeship program.

   27.00 - 216.00 hours laboratory

   This course provides students the opportunity to work in the carpenters apprenticeship program for the purpose of developing specific skills to meet the goals and objectives of the carpenters Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee (J.A.T.C.). It is designed for students interested in apprenticeship programs in transfer-level degree occupational programs. Students complete work experience hours at approved training sites. During the semester, the student is required to complete 27 hours of related work experience for 0.5 unit. An additional 27 hours of related across all Work Experience course offerings. This course may be repeated when there are new or expanded learning objectives. Only one Work Experience course may be taken per semester.

   Justification: The Work Experience Education and Internship program is a unique academic program that provides apprentices the opportunity to gain on-the-job training (O.J.T.) that takes place under the supervision of an experienced supervisor or journeyworker with the goal of mastering specific training to prepare for career advancement in apprenticeship programs in transfer-level degree occupational programs.

Cosumnes River College

1. FMS 321 Film Genre: Horror (3.00 units)

   Prerequisite: None.

   54.00 hours lecture

   This course performs a close examination of popular horror films in order to understand how they function as representations of cultural fear and anxiety. Throughout the semester we will analyze the multiple functions of the genre, including its social significance, the different reasons why horror appeals to mass audiences, seminal theories of horror, and its overall development and impact on film history. The course will be divided into three sections: the first will cover the early period of physical monsters; the second will examine psychological monsters, slashers and body films; and the third will look at post-9/11 horror to investigate contemporary themes of identity.
<!-- Page 20 -->
![HOME](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Justification:** FMS 321 will supplement FMS 320 (which is written as a survey of all genres) and allow for a specific investigation of a film genre—in this case horror. Analyzing horror films offers insight into the fears and anxieties that arise in individuals, as well as the larger cultural consciousness. Confronting and examining these fears and anxieties provokes thought about difference and the experiences of Others, which is important for developing a more equitable society.

**Folsom Lake College**

1. **CHEM 339 Introduction to Fermentation Chemistry (4.00 units)**

   **Prerequisite:** None.

   54.00 hours lecture, 54.00 hours laboratory

   Students will be introduced to the chemical principles of fermentation as they apply to a variety of beverages and food products. Students will test hypotheses to explore the chemical, biochemical, and physicochemical properties of fermented products. Experimentation will be guided by a suite of chemical instrumentation. Specifically, the course will focus on the basic scientific methodology applied on beer brewing, enology and fermentation of fruits, vegetables, and dairy. Students are required to provide a bound laboratory notebook, apron, closed toe shoes, and gloves.

   **Justification:** This course in applied chemistry ties general chemistry principles to food science. This course is being written to allow students to fulfill their Area 5A, and Area 5C IGETC requirements. It will be offered as part of the Food Science A.S. degree and the Viticulture and Enology A.S. degree. This course will draw additional students into these two related degree programs resulting in an increase in enrollment in their respective required courses.

2. **CISD 305 Ethics and Artificial Intelligence (3.00 units)**

   **Prerequisite:** None.

   54.00 hours lecture

   This introductory course on Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics provides a comprehensive overview of ethical considerations in the domain of artificial intelligence. The course covers principles of AI ethics, strategies to foster fair and equitable AI systems, approaches to minimize biases, and methods to address key issues and establish user trust.

   **Justification:** AI ethics is crucial to ensure responsible and unbiased development and deployment of artificial intelligence while safeguarding humanity’s well-being. This course provides a fundamental understanding of ethical AI, its issues (applications and developments), and moral consideration while solving problems using AI technologies.
<!-- Page 21 -->
3. **MATH 11 Guided Individualized Support for Mathematics and Statistics (0.25 - 2.00 units)**

   **Prerequisite:** None.

   **Corequisite:** The student must be enrolled in a course with Math content. This includes, but is not limited to the designators, MATH, STAT, CHEM, PHYS, ASTR, BUS, ECON, and CISP.

   **13.50 - 108.00 hours laboratory**

   This course is open to all students currently enrolled in any course that uses or teaches mathematical concepts. The course enables students to build and review math topics that are necessary for success in any level of MATH, STAT, or other course. Learning objectives and the course topics will be designed based on the needs of each individual student with the guidance and support from the instructor and embedded tutors. This course cannot replace any existing mathematics course and is not used to satisfy any prerequisite. This class is open entry and is graded on a Pass/No Pass basis. This course may be taken up to three times but the total of all attempts cannot exceed 2.0 units.

   **Justification:** Concurrent support for our Math/Stat students who are underprepared has been focused on "support classes" for entire groups of students. It has not been possible to target the needs of specific students. This course will provide an individualized assessment along with a targeted set of topics designed to better fill in the needs for the particular transfer level course the student is enrolled in. The supplementary learning material (ALEKS) referred to in this outline is currently provided through a learning skills grant, so it is not mentioned in the course description. When advertised on campus, this course will have the nick name "Math Boot Camp."

4. **TAFILM 480 Honors Introduction to Film (3.00 units)**

   **Prerequisite:** None.

   **Advisory:** ENGWR 300, ENGWR 480, or ESLW 340 with a grade of "C" or better.

   **54.00 hours lecture**

   This honors course offers a rigorous study of the artistic, historic, and cultural elements of modern cinema, emphasizing critical analysis of film as an art form and product of society, beyond that offered in TAFILM 300. It examines components of movie making, such as acting, directing, cinematography, writing and editing. Film making techniques are analyzed, along with the impact and influences of motion pictures and the movie business. This advanced level course will involve an increased depth of study. Thus, examinations and papers will be graded rigorously. Students will also be required to complete at least two term papers in which they research and critically analyze films, using MLA citation methods. Honors students will also read extensive analytic essays, and complete rigorous projects and oral presentations. Students may only receive credit for TAFILM 300 or TAFILM 480, not both. This course is not open to students who have successfully completed TAFILM 300.
<!-- Page 22 -->
![HOME](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Justification:** As one of the few honors level courses offered at Folsom Lake College, this provides opportunity for advanced scholarship as well as increased transfer opportunity for students who are eligible for TAFILM 300. This honors course offers increased rigor and depth of study. It will count towards a future planned degree in film and a future planned honors certificate.

**SUBJECT:** Disposition of Surplus Equipment – Salvage Value Greater than $5,000  
**ATTACHMENT:** None  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item D  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration

Brian King, Chancellor

**BACKGROUND:**  
The Education Code regulates the procedure by which a community college district can dispose of real and personal property. Education Code section 81450-81450.5 provides that the governing board may, sell for cash, exchange for value, or donate any personal property belonging to the district if the property is not required for school purposes, or if it should be disposed of for the purpose of replacement, or if it is unsatisfactory or not suitable for school use. The methods for disposal differ based upon the estimated value of the equipment. Whereas most equipment is disposed of either through the State of California or, if the State will not accept, through a scrap dealer, items with a value greater than $5,000 either individually or in aggregate, require a public auction, noticed as required by law.

**STATUS:**  
The District will auction the following items which in aggregate have a value greater than $5,000:  
(2) 2005 Ford E250, 2002 Ford E250, (2) 2002 Toyota Prius, 2007 Toyota Prius. Due to the poor condition of each item, the equipment is no longer suitable for school use. The District, via public auction, intends to sell to the highest bidder or donate to an interested school/public entity.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the disposal of the listed items per Education Code section 81450-81450.5.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT
**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** April 10, 2024

**SUBJECT:** 2024-25 Sabbaticals/ Professional Development Leaves  
**ATTACHMENT:** None  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item J  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  
**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
The agreement with the Los Rios College Federation of Teachers (LRCFT) provides that at least ten (10) Type A sabbaticals and 2.1 FTE of Type B professional development leaves be granted each year. Type A leaves are leaves of one semester at full pay or one year at half pay. Type B leaves are reassigned time for up to 100% and for up to one year in duration.

The agreement with the LRCFT permits the Professional Standards Committee at each college to recommend the conversion of one or more Type A sabbaticals into equivalent FTE of Type B leaves.

Sabbatical/professional development leave recommendations are presented to the Board in April and November of each year.

The criteria for leaves, as stated in the LRCFT agreement are as follows:

1. Retraining of applicant to allow for new assignment(s) in a needed area as determined by college and District priorities.
2. Studies, projects or activities that provide staff with opportunities to upgrade academic, technical and vocational skills and knowledge for current or future assignments.
3. Studies, projects, or activities for the improvement and/or innovation of curriculum, educational delivery systems, student personnel services, or other support services.
4. Studies, projects or activities for development or revision of certificate or degree programs.
5. Studies, projects or activities related to feasibility or revision of new or existing programs.
6. Studies, projects or activities for the enhancement of student access and success at the course, department, program or institutional, or community college system levels.
7. Studies, projects, or activities that support completion of college and/or District goals, objectives and priorities.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the attached sabbatical/professional development leaves be approved by the Board of Trustees for the 2024-2025 year.

# Spring 2024 Board Agenda
## Sabbatical Leaves

### American River College

**Type A Leave:**
- Zero (0) Type A Leave requested
- Three (3) Type A Leaves converted to 1.500 Type B Leave

**Type B Leave:**
- 2.050 FTE Type B Leaves requested

### Type A Leave Time
**Annual FTE**
- One (1) Type A Leave Unused During 2023/24
- .500 FTE Type A Leave Remains Available for 2023/24 (per LRCFT Section 11.6.8.5)

### Type B Leave Time
**Annual FTE**

**Amanda Corcoran**  
English Professor  
20% Fall 2024  
.100 FTE  
**“Being Seen: The Impact of Mattering in the Classroom”**  
**Proposal:** Mattering, or “feeling valued and adding value” (“Mattering”), requires that we offer, that we insist on offering, students relentless and multiple opportunities for feeling welcomed, for feeling safely seen, and for laying the foundations for students to feel, little by little, an authentic sense of belonging and value to their learning community. Mattering requires two aspects of worth: feeling valued and feeling you’re adding value. Feeling valued arises when a student has confirmation of their worth in the classroom (“Feeling”). Adding value means that a student knows and believes that their presence and contribution make an authentic difference to the learning, welcoming, and safety of others in their community. I propose to investigate and explore successful and culturally responsive ways to build a sense of mattering in online and on ground classes in ways that support, engage, and center BIPOC/LGBTQIA+ students, rather than furthering their communities’, and too often their own, educational and societal trauma.

**Andrea Garvey**  
Psychology Professor  
80% Fall 2024  
.400 FTE  
**“Expanding Inclusivity in Human Development – A Lifespan Course: Final Topical Chapters”**  
**Proposal:** The present project aims to complete the research and writing of the accessible, culturally- and globally-inclusive OER textbook for the psychology course Human Development-A Lifespan (PSYC 370). This project constitutes the concluding, “final act” of last year’s Type A leave (awarded for Spring 2023) and Type B leave (awarded for Fall 2023). More specifically, the primary goal is to support the writing of the final four chapters of the OER textbook for PSYC 370 that will lead to the completion of the 15-chapter OER textbook. Seven (7) of the 10 completed chapters are currently being assigned in multiple sections of the course (sections I teach and sections currently taught by another colleague). It is my goal that, by the time I have completed this Spring semester and Summer term, I will be able to write at least another chapter as well as curate and create supplemental materials to accompany it. Consequently, by the start of Fall 2024, there would be only four chapters remaining for the completion of the 15-chapter OER textbook.

**Creating a Notes Outline and a Workbook as part of the Zero-Cost Textbook Program**  
**Proposal:** As the cost of course materials continue to rise and the disconnect between course design and what students need to succeed grows wider, we as community college instructors can support more affordable, effective teaching and learning by using Open Educational Resources (OER). Last fall we created free digital course materials for Calculus for Business and Economics (Math 340) as part of the zero-cost textbook program to make it more equitable for our low income, marginalized, and historically underserved students and to increase the success of all the students who take this class. The purpose of this project is to create a Notes Outline and a Workbook that follow the media lessons which students can use to take notes. These course materials would be similar in format to the Workbook that Shar McCarroll created for her Math 300 MOM courses. All materials will be free for students to use. We would also have hard copies printed and available for students. Rory is currently taking the Accessibility Course Creation Academy, which focuses on the skills we need to make our course compliant with ADA standards, technologically accessible, and culturally responsive for a broad range of students. Tanja has begun writing the Notes Outline and has been meeting with our Accessibility Liaison to discuss accessibility and universal design specifically for our project.

**Proposal:** This project will help address the resource needs of this course by identifying specific resources needed, developing a lab activity for student sheep brain dissections, and working with administration to address any health and safety issues resulting from lack of associated lab classrooms and storage facilities. Additionally, the creation of lab activity materials specific to sheep brain dissections that can be used by other faculty that may come in to teach this course in the future is critical to the ongoing sustainability of the course. The workload associated with developing lab materials is significant, and not something realistic to expect of PT or LTT faculty without adequate compensation. Thus, the development of these materials will make it easier to potentially have additional faculty take on teaching this course in the future.

**Developing ENGLT 334: Asian American Literature**  
**Proposal:** This request is for time to develop and prepare to teach ENGLT 334: Asian American Literature, a brand new course at ARC that I co-authored and helped move through the Curriculum Committee in 2021, but, unfortunately, have not had sufficient time to fully prepare.

**Proposal:** The proposed project aims to expand the availability of free, accessible instructional materials for the political science course Introduction to Government: California (POLS 304) and for topics covered in Introduction to Government: United States (POLS 301). More specifically, to develop a coherent collection of free, accessible, inclusive learning materials, assessments, and activities for eight topics common across introductory courses in California government and politics (such as POLS 304) and included in course curriculum for introductory courses in American government and politics which require the inclusion of California state and local government (such as POLS 301). Currently, there are a limited number of free instructional materials specific to California state and local government and suitable for college-level courses.

“Bridging DEIA gaps with Religious Studies (RLST): Navigating Religious Diversity in Curricular and CO-Curricular Settings”  
**Proposal:** Religious Studies programs across the state and country have changed dramatically in the last 15 years as employers, public life, and scholarship wrestle with the questions of navigating religiously diverse 21st-century American democracy. Yet, public perception has not caught up with these changes, to the detriment of students and staff. For example, although we have embraced robust diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) initiatives, navigating religious diversity has been largely omitted from these efforts. As a result, there is little to no training on religious diversity or how it relates to DEIA for either faculty or administrators. Subsequently, widespread religious illiteracy is a systemic barrier to the efforts to counter Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and related forms of discrimination and bias on our campuses. Nor are students being trained to navigate religiously diverse workplaces and public life in the US. In the Spring of 2023, I established the Religious Studies (RLST) designator as the next step in my department’s journey to address these issues consistent with current trends in the discipline, transfer pathways & partners, and our DEIA initiatives. I am requesting .8 release time in the form of Type-B leave for the Fall 2024 semester to bridge these gaps on campus.

**“Support for English Language Learners (ELL) in English Writing Courses”**  
**Proposal:** With this sabbatical I will develop a system of support for English language learners taking English Writing courses. This will address AB1705 and AB705, which include: implementing support for ELL students. To ensure their success in English Writing coursework, I will evaluate the current support given to ELLs at CRC, research best practices and existing successful programs, create ELL-friendly materials, explore the possibility of offering ENGWR sections designed for ELLs, and work with CRC Student Services to create a robust system of support for ELLs. This will help achieve the goal of AB705/1705 to have every student complete English composition in a timely manner.  
(Note that in this context, “ELL” is used for any English language learner who may or may not have attended high school here in the U.S., while “ESL” refers to students who learn English as a Second Language at CRC. The number of ELLs at CRC is much larger than ESL students.)

**“Navigating Photographic Frontiers: A Sabbatical Exploration into Underrepresented Practitioners and Culturally Relevant Pedagogy”**  
**Proposal:** My goal for a proposed Type B.2 sabbatical is to immerse myself into research that reveals the impact of underrepresented photographic practitioners, their contributions to current photographic trends and to the canon of photographic history while also investigating more culturally relevant pedagogy techniques that can be incorporated into future classes. All research and content produced will be housed in a Canvas shell available for AME faculty to access. I feel that this will ultimately benefit all CRC photography and photography related/adjacent courses.

“A Research and Study of Genetics, Molecules, and Genes at CSU”  
**Proposal:** This proposal involves auditing two courses at CSU Sacramento titled BIO 184: General Genetics and BIO 2: Cells, Molecules, and Genes. This endeavor is designed to fulfill three primary objectives: enrich knowledge in the rapid field of genetics and molecular biology, enhance curriculum alignment between CRC and local 4-year transfer institutions, and facilitating a smoother transition for our students from community college to university-level education. Firstly, it aims to align our current BIOL 400 (BIO 2 equivalent) course content with a regional transfer partner for many of our students. The plan is to be immersed in the curriculum and pedagogical practices at CSU Sacramento. This seeks to identify areas of improvement to better align CRC’s Principles of Biology course with the CSUS equivalent Cells, Molecules, and Genes. Secondly, this sabbatical presents an opportunity to deepen the understanding of the rapidly evolving field of genetics. Beyond personal growth, this sabbatical endeavor holds significant implications for our college and students. This proposal is aimed at professional development, curriculum enhancement, and transfer facilitation. This experience would serve as a testament to our institution's commitment to fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation in pursuit of student success.

“Every Costume Tells a Story: Understanding Traditional Folk Dress Through Ethnography”  
**Proposal:** This project has three parts: The first is to conduct ethnographic and archival research on traditional Greek folk dress and to participate in a series of folk dress/textile workshops hosted by the Benaki Museum and Hellenic Costume Society in Greece. The second part is to use the data and methods from this ethnographic project to enhance anthropology curriculum including lectures and assignments on field methods such as interviewing techniques and how to write “thick description”. The third, and final, part of this project would be to organize an exhibition of traditional folk costumes at CRC that would incorporate some of the project themes (connection to ethnic heritage, traditional handicraft skills, immigrant and community pride) and feature not only Greek folk dress but also traditional dress of other cultures represented on our campus such as Hmong, Cambodian, Ukrainian, Guatemalan, Nigerian, Norwegian, or Afghan dress. This would include collaboration with students through the Center for Inclusion and Belonging or clubs and colleagues in the campus community in providing a space to showcase the uniqueness of folk dress traditions while also highlighting how all human groups share a universal need to adorn and outfit the body for different purposes.

The new windows will also help provide a more comfortable learning and working environment for students, faculty, and staff. The project will also address certain ADA accessibility issues in and around the building. This project is funded through SMSR (Special Maintenance, Special Repairs).

This presentation was originally scheduled for the February 2024 Board meeting held at Cosumnes River College, as one of the college’s highlighted successful programs. Unfortunately, the faculty and staff involved in work were unavailable, so it was rescheduled for this meeting.

In the Fall of 2021, Cosumnes River College announced its ambitious goal to become a Zero Cost Textbook college, where no student would have to buy a book. Faculty, staff, and administrators have made extraordinary progress so far, with nearly 63% of classes reporting the use of Open Education Resource (OER) materials and/or Zero Cost Textbooks (ZTC) in the Spring of 2024. CRC is serving as a pilot institution in this effort, with the goal of replicating the college’s successes at the other three Los Rios colleges. In September 2023, the Los Rios Board of Trustees identified expanding the use of Open Education Resource (OER) materials and increasing the number of programs using Zero Cost Textbooks (ZTC) as one of its six goals for 2023-2026, reinforcing the Board’s commitment to this important work.

**STATUS:**  
CRC faculty, staff, and students will deliver a presentation highlighting the strategies implemented at CRC that have led to a marked increase in use of Open Education Resource (OER) materials and/or Zero Cost Textbooks (ZTC) at the college.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
This item is presented for the Board of Trustees’ information and discussion.
