**Key Definitions**

**Open Educational Resources (OER)**  
- Teaching and learning materials that reside in the public domain or under copyright with an open license (usually Creative Commons), which allows for no-cost access, re-use, re-purpose, adaptations, and redistribution.

**Zero Textbook Costs (ZTC)**  
- Teaching and learning materials that are free to students and may or may not be OER. When commercial publishing resources are used, the college absorbs the cost so that it is not passed onto the student. OER are the most sustainable way to maintain ZTC.

**Controlled Digital Lending (CDL)**  
- Commercially published materials that are not made available under a library electronic license. The library purchases physical copies, scans the material, and makes it available to checkout through the library's digital loan program. The library can only loan the exact number of copies it owns (e.g. 25 copies owed, 20 available for digital loan, 5 physical copies available for regular library checkout).

**More Student Feedback**

“Having access to free materials makes it a lot easier for me personally to be motivated to work as I don't have to put in the extra money towards a class.”  
~ Carsen, CRC Student

“It makes it easier to learn, especially since textbooks cost so much just to rent them. You won’t even use them afterwards even if you buy them, they're a short term thing and we shouldn't have to pay for something temporary that will most likely not be used much throughout the semester.”  
~ Michael, CRC Student

“It makes college much easier and more affordable. The nice part about these classes is that I can use the information that is given to me whenever I like compared to the online ebooks where I buy them and I have limited time to use them. With the free books I feel like I'm getting the same quality if not better learning experience.”  
~ Jaden, CRC Student
