**District Academic Senate (DAS) President, Alisa Shubb, Reports**

- The DAS makes the following recommendations for LRCCD General Education & graduation requirement revisions needed to align with new Title 5 requirements:
  1. Allow students the option to choose a transfer GE pattern (eg CalGETC) when working towards a local degree with the goal of transferring to a 4-year institution.
  2. Establish the New Local AA/AS GE Pattern as follows (note: Areas 1-6 are required by Title 5)

    Area 1* - English Communication, Oral Communication, and Critical Thinking  
    1 A. English Composition (3 units)  
    1 B. Oral Communication and Critical Thinking (3 units)  

    Area 2* - Mathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning (3 units)  

    Area 3* - Arts and Humanities (3 units)  

    Area 4* - Social and Behavioral Sciences (3 units)  

    Area 5* - Natural Sciences (3 units)  

    Area 6* - Ethnic Studies (3 units)  

    Area 7 - Living Skills (3 units) - with an exception for students with majors with 45 or more required units (“high unit majors”).

    *Areas 1-6 are all the requirements of Title 5.  
    The Living Skills local GE requirement is to be defined as per P-7241 as one physical education activity course (with ADAPT, DANCE, FITNS, PACT, SPORT, or TMACT designators) and a minimum of two (2) units from the other courses included in this category which may be selected from a number of different disciplines that help students to acquire skills and knowledge to understand themselves as whole persons (integral to their environment) and develop and maintain personal, social, physical and emotional well-being. Adapted physical education courses are available for students with documented physical disabilities.

- In response to concerns that PREP program administration is circumventing collegial consultation processes, the DAS passed a resolution recommending all professional development activities and/or trainings related to faculty participation in the PREP program within the LRCCD be required to be approved by the PREP Committee before being advertised or presented to the faculty (see pages 4-5). We are committed to restoring collegial consultation in all aspects of the PREP program.

- In response to each of the college Academic Senate votes of no confidence in the LRCCD Chancellor, the public statement of the Board regarding continued confidence in the Chancellor, and years of documented concern about inadequate collegial consultation in the district, the DAS passed a resolution of no confidence in the LRCCD Chancellor (see pages 6 - 9). We are committed to establishing, reestablishing, and maintaining effective collegial consultation within all levels of governance in Los Rios.

- The DAS Collegial Consultation Report semesterly report can be found on page 9 - 13.

- The DAS welcomes Paula Cardwell (FLC) who will now be serving as the District Academic Senate President.

  - District Academic Senate (DAS)
  - ARC Academic Senate
  - CRC Academic Senate
  - FLC Academic Senate
  - SCC Academic Senate
  - Academic Senate of California Community Colleges (ASCCC)

### ARC Academic Senate President, Brian Knirk, Reports:
- The ARC Senate has:
  - Chartered a new distance education committee for the ARC campus to work with the district distance education committee.
  - The Program Review Committee completed the program review presentations with new questions focused on equity and improving the success of our DI students.
  - Elected next year’s executive team: Brian Knirk, President, Veronica Lopez, Vice President, and Jeff Sacha, Secretary.

### CRC Academic Senate President, Jacob Velasquez, Reports:
- No report

### FLC Academic Senate President, Eric Wada, Reports:
- The Academic Senate has four committees: Matriculation, Curriculum, Professional Development, and Affordable Learning Materials. Below are samples of the good work the committees have accomplished or continue to work on:
  - The Matriculation Committee (Chaired by Bernadette Anayah in fall and Danielle Beck in spring) recently approved a subcommittee focused on dual enrollment. Dual Enrollment is an educational program that must consider and balance student success, preparation, and equitable access; therefore there are clear 10+1 matters associated with offering courses to CCAP and non-CCAP students, and early/middle college high school students.
<!-- Page 3 -->
- The Curriculum Committee (Chaired by Danny Siegfried) is working to manage the workload of implementing AB928, AB1111, and AB1705. They are also looking ahead to the work associated with implementing the new Los Rios GE pattern to align with Title 5 changes. The Student Learning Outcomes subcommittee of Curriculum has also offered a suggestion to reemphasize the importance of SLO assessment (as these outcomes are important for accreditation and they can be useful as a starting point for identifying equity gaps) by recommending a SLO coordinator with some reassigned time.
- The Professional Development Committee (PDC) (Chaired this year by Nino Conley in fall and Julie Collier in spring) is working on a new faculty academy for our new full-time faculty that, thanks to the collective and collaborative advocacy of the PDC, Academic Senate, and FLC Administration, we have learned will be equitably supported by the district next year.
- The Affordable Learning Materials Committee (Chaired by Jennifer Black) has been working on developing goals for Open Educational Resource (OER) and Zero-Textbook Cost (ZTC) development at FLC while balancing student equitable access to learning materials, academic freedom, educational quality, and the initial and continued reassigned time and financial support to develop and maintain OER/ZTCs.
- We thank Alisa Shubb for her skill and tact navigating the District Academic Senate through discussions around Los Rios GE patterns, various Board regulations, Prison and Re-Entry Program (PREP) (among many other topics), and for following district senate processes as colleges have brought up statements and/or resolutions of progressively increasing concern about district leadership’s lapses in collegial consultation. We are excited that our Past Senate President, Paula Cardwell, will be taking on the role of District Academic Senate President, and we hope that the Los Rios Board of Trustees and District Administration will join us in warmly welcoming a knowledgeable, respected, and collegial faculty leader.

SCC Academic Senate President (Interim), Amy Strimling, Reports:
- SCC created the Center for Online Teaching and Learning. This will support the DE work led by our DE faculty and staff as well as the goals of our DE subcommittee.
- The AI Task Force completed and submitted a robust report on Artificial Intelligence at SCC. This report can be found in our supporting documents from our April 16th meeting on BoardDocs.
- Our Program Review Committee completed a review of six reports that were submitted.
- The Curriculum Committee completed reviews of curriculum and programs this year. They have created a prioritization document for the 2024-25 academic year in response to changing legislation. The Equity Subcommittee continues the important work of helping departments embed IDEAA in course and program outlines.

# PREP Resolution on Professional Development

Adopted by the District Academic Senate Apr 16, 2024

WHEREAS, The LRCCD Prison & Reentry Program (PREP) serves incarcerated students in a unique environment which requires faculty training and specialized professional development with respect to appropriate classroom management, use of course materials, syllabi policies, and pedagogical/andragogical approaches to instruction;

WHEREAS, The administration has decided to implement a faculty professional development activity without collegial consultation, legally required by Title 5 and Los Rios Board Policy, by failing to seek a recommendation directly from DAS, or indirectly from the PREP Committee.

WHEREAS, Policies for faculty professional development are an academic and professional matter for which the Board of Trustees (or designee) must rely primarily on the advice and judgment of the District Academic Senate[1][2];

WHEREAS, The District Academic Senate Senate (DAS) is the recognized faculty body to make recommendations to the administration and Board of Trustees on district procedures with respect to academic and professional matters[3][4], and the PREP Committee is a standing committee that is empowered to work on behalf of the DAS as faculty experts on PREP related academic and professional matters;

RESOLVED, That the DAS recommends all professional development activities and/or trainings related to faculty participation in the PREP program within the LRCCD be required to be approved by the PREP Committee before being advertised or presented to the faculty;

RESOLVED, That the DAS recommends the PREP Lite Experience immediately be put on hold and remain on hold until the PREP Committee approves it as a faculty professional development activity.

![Resolution of No Confidence in Chancellor Brian King](https://example.com/image-url)

**Resolution of No Confidence in Chancellor Brian King**  
Adopted by the District Academic Senate May 7, 2024

WHEREAS, Collegial Consultation is a requirement of the law as established in AB 1725 and Title 5, and has been affirmed in our own LRCCD Board Policies and Regulations;

WHEREAS, Collegial consultation is the vital component of participatory governance that brings forward the unique perspectives and expertise of faculty who work closest with students, fosters transparency, builds stakeholder trust, effectively responds to external demands, and ensures collaborative decisions are made that align with student needs and promote student success;

WHEREAS, Since 2019 there has been no response to the request urged by the DAS resolution Creating Accountability for Collegial Consultation on Academic and Professional Matters to jointly reaffirm in writing our legal, ethical, and values-driven commitment to collegial consultation on academic and professional matters;

WHEREAS, In 2019 faculty leaders of the District Academic Senate participated with District Administration in an IBA mediated process to discuss the issues and identify a path forward, and seeing no meaningful change or accountability, in 2021 District Academic Senate hosted a ASCCC Collegiality in Action session to help administration understand collegial consultation and to help this District make decisions in accordance with the law. District Academic Senate leadership continued our education efforts by preparing a presentation for the Board on collegial consultation in June 2023;

WHEREAS, The District Academic Senate has worked without the benefit of cooperation or affirmation from the LRCCD Chancellor to develop and implement a system of mutual accountability with clear and measurable criteria for ensuring that collegial consultation on academic and professional matters occurs consistently;

WHEREAS, Failures by the LRCCD Chancellor to facilitate collegial consultation between the LRCCD Board of Trustees and the Academic Senate over an extended period have resulted in numerous attempts to course correct and bring about improvement through papers and resolutions issued by college Academic Senates including the:  
- FLC 2018 Resolution Collegial Consultation and Online College  
- 2021-02 Sacramento City College Resolution against Centralization without Consultation, adopted unanimously on May, 2021  
- 2022 Sacramento City College white paper District Leadership Review & Recommendations to the Board of Trustees, adopted Spring 2022  
- 2023 American River College Resolution on District Leadership Concerns, adopted unanimously on March, 23, 2023  
- 2023 Folsom Lake College Recommendation to the Los Rios Board of Trustees to Investigate Collegial Consultation and Participatory Governance Procedures, adopted March 28, 2023.
<!-- Page 7 -->
WHEREAS, The LRCCD Chancellor’s responses to the aforementioned written recommendations have been to provide justifications for the decisions described in the papers and resolutions, rather than address the underlying issues of dissatisfaction with the process by which these decisions were made, and in the process has failed to offer tangible solutions to improve decision making processes within the District.

WHEREAS, Despite these many attempts to course correct, the District Academic Senate was not afforded any opportunity to provide recommendations on a number of recent decisions on academic and professional matters such as the faculty hiring freeze in Fall ‘22, the District Strategic Enrollment Management Plan in Spring ‘23, the adoption of a Customer Relations Management (CRM) tool in Summer ‘23, processes for the closure of Davies Hall in Fall ‘23.

WHEREAS, Poor planning and/or organizational management under the Chancellor’s leadership has led to limited and insufficient opportunity for District Academic Senate to provide recommendations on many academic and professional matters including AB 705 implementation, faculty hiring allocations, adoption of education tools such as Pathway U, and not for credit educational programs.

WHEREAS, LRCCD Regulation 3411 stipulates that “in order to facilitate discussions, the Chancellor’s Cabinet shall operate to assure that all affected and appropriate constituencies have input and involvement in the resolution of” (1.2) issues of District-level significance, Academic Senate leadership is regularly unable to effectively “represent the interests of their constituencies” (1.2.1) and provide adequate input as members of Chancellor’s Cabinet when the meeting agendas are overly brief, not clearly descriptive or representative of the topics being discussed, adequate supporting materials have not been provided in advance, and often lack clarity as to whether items being discussed are informational or decision items.

WHEREAS, The American River College, Sacramento City College, Folsom Lake College, and Cosumnes River College Academic Senates have issued or supported votes of no confidence in the LRCCD Chancellor:
- American River College Vote of No Confidence in Chancellor Brian King, adopted November 9 2023
- Sacramento City College Vote of No Confidence in LRCCD Chancellor, affirmed December 5, 2023
- Folsom Lake College Academic Senate Resolution S24-01, adopted February 13, 2024
- Cosumnes River College Resolution of No Confidence in Chancellor Brian King S-01, adopted March 22, 2024

RESOLVED, That the Los Rios District Academic Senate asserts a vote of No Confidence in LRCCD Chancellor Brian King,

RESOLVED, That the Los Rios District Academic Senate affirms the importance of regular and effective collegial consultation at all levels of governance in LRCCD and urges the LRCCD Board of Trustees to work with the LRCCD Academic Senates to establish a foundation of mutual understanding of the criteria and practices that constitute effective collegial consultation within all levels of governance in Los Rios.
<!-- Page 8 -->
And  
RESOLVED, That the Los Rios District Academic Senate urges the LRCCD Board of Trustees to seek and retain a chancellor to serve as their designee who is committed to honoring collegial consultative processes as well as participatory governance processes as required by law,  

And  
RESOLVED, That the Los Rios District Academic Senate urges the LRCCD Board of Trustees to ensure, through robust accountability measures that this commitment to collegial consultation is realized now and in the future.
