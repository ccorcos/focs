# STARS:

“The Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System™ (STARS®) is a transparent, self-reporting framework for colleges and universities to measure their sustainability performance.

STARS is intended to engage and recognize the full spectrum of higher education institutions, from community colleges to research universities.

The framework encompasses long-term sustainability goals for already high-achieving institutions, as well as entry points of recognition for institutions that are taking first steps toward sustainability.”

# Electric Vehicle Charging Stations

## Plan Overview:

- Since 2018, all new construction projects have required the installation of EV charging stations.
- 113 EV charging stations district-wide either installed or under construction.
- Replace 45 existing EV chargers with networked units.
- Add additional EV chargers district-wide in addition to new construction requirement.
<!-- Page 11 -->
# Facilities Management Fleet Vehicles

- Current inventory is 68 fleet vehicles. Of that 9% are electric.
- Facilities Management will achieve 18% before the end of 2024.
<!-- Page 12 -->
# Grant Programs

- Giddy Up EV Level-3 charging stations
- Community in Charge Level-2 EV charging stations
- Sac Metro Air District
- GS$Mart
<!-- Page 13 -->
# Future Sustainability Efforts

- Continue to focus on and to actively pursue and exceed BOG Framework goals 2025, 2030, and 2035.
- Continue and expand conservation efforts in all areas.
- Additional water conservation projects.
- Seek funding for additional emerging technologies, and energy efficiency programs for existing buildings to reduce energy usage and GHG emissions.
- Increase renewable energy generation and participate in future programs like SMUD’s SolarShares Program, and Battery Storage.
