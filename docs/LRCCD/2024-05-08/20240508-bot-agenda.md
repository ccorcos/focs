**Los Rios Community College District Indigenous Land Acknowledgment Statement**  
In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** May 8, 2024

---

**SUBJECT:** Five Year Capital Outlay Plan  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** Five Year Plan  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** First Reading Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Mario Rodriguez, Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  
**CONSENT/ROUTINE**  
**FIRST READING** X  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION**  
**INFORMATION**  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
The State Chancellor’s Office (SCO) has a prescribed capital outlay process and calendar for requesting State funds for capital outlay projects. Each year the District must file a Five Year Capital Outlay Plan which lists all proposed projects, whether State funded or not. Final Project Proposals (FPPs), which are prepared to request State funding for projects listed in the Five Year Capital Outlay Plan, are also to be submitted with the Five Year Capital Outlay Plan each year. This information is due to the State Chancellor’s Office by July 1, 2024.

Although a district may qualify for State funding, all districts are competing for the limited funds available. Facility capacity/load ratios (enrollment growth) and local contribution of funds are key elements in the State’s prioritization of funding capital projects.

---

**STATUS:**  
In November 2016, Proposition 51 was passed authorizing $7 billion in general obligation bonds from the State. These funds are approaching full expenditure and have resulted in the construction of multiple facilities throughout the District. In February 2020, the State was unsuccessful in passing a new bond measure leaving the capital outlay process in an unfunded status. Regardless of the State’s capital outlay status, the District continues to participate in the capital outlay process in the hopes a future bond measure passing, allowing participation to resume. Additionally, due to the failure of the District’s local bond measure in 2020 and the requirement of a local contribution to obtain State funding, there will be no FPPs submitted in this year’s cycle. This year’s Five Year Capital Outlay Plan does, however, anticipate a future State and local bond and the timing of projects so that these funds can be combined and maximized.

This report is the first reading of the draft Five Year Capital Outlay Plan the Board will be asked to approve on June 12, 2024. The attached executive summary describes the Five Year Capital Outlay Plan and a Draft of this year’s Five Year Capital Outlay Plan has been distributed to Board Members.

---

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
This item is presented to the Board of Trustees for first reading. The final Five Year Capital Outlay Plan will be brought to the Board at June 12, 2024 for action.

**State Five Year Construction Plan:**

The basic intent and purpose of the Plan is to analyze enrollment forecasts and determine the amount and type of spaces that will be needed to meet increases changes in enrollment and changes in the educational program. The Plan is used to determine overall estimated costs and identify possible funding sources.

The major components of the Plan are: forecasted student load (enrollment/WSCH), facilities capacity to handle load, proposed new space, proposed modernizations and possible funding sources. The first three components are compiled into “capacity/load ratios”. Capacity/load ratios represent, as a percentage, the facilities capacity to handle forecasted student load (or demand). These capacity/load ratios are the primary tool used by the State to determine which projects will be approved. Also, the State has a priority system which causes districts to compete against each other to offer the State the least cost alternative. Because of this, most projects have a local contribution indicated. The local contribution is intended to make our projects more competitive for limited State funding.

This year’s State Five Year Capital Outlay Plan lists 45 projects, comprised mainly of modernization projects.

**Possible Sequencing of State Funded Projects**

In November 2016, the voters passed Proposition 51 authorizing $7 billion in general obligation bonds for new construction and modernization of K–12 public school facilities; charter schools and vocational education facilities; and $2 billion for California Community Colleges facilities. This influx of bond dollars allowed for a significant amount of FPPs to be funded. Proposition 51 currently contributes funding to several District projects in process.

However, due to no further State or local bond funds being available, there will be no FPP’s submitted this year.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** May 8, 2024  

**SUBJECT:** Revised Initial Collective Bargaining Proposal – SEIU 2024-27  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Collective Bargaining Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor of Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**STATUS:**  
See the attached revised list of interests identified by SEIU.  

**BACKGROUND:**  
Pursuant to Government Code Section 3547, et seq., all initial proposals of exclusive representatives of recognized employee groups and of the District are required to be presented at a public meeting of the District.  

The collective bargaining agreement with Service Employees International Union, Local 1021 (SEIU) expires on June 30, 2024. The Board and representatives of SEIU agreed to engage in a collaborative approach to negotiations. As part of the model of negotiations, the parties will identify their respective interests. The theory is that it is easier to reconcile interests than positions. Reconciling interests, rather than positions, affords both parties an opportunity to be heard throughout the negotiation process; therefore, the initial proposals are framed as interests as much as possible. The lists of interest for SEIU and LRCCD initially went to the Board of Trustees Meeting in December 2023, and a public hearing was held at the January 2024 Board Meeting to allow for public input regarding the proposals prior to commencing negotiations with the goal of attempting to reach agreement as early as possible before the contract expires.  

At the first negotiations meeting on April 18, 2024, SEIU presented a revised initial collective bargaining proposal. Consistent with the applicable code sections, the public has a right to be informed of those areas that the parties will be negotiating and to invite public comment at a meeting of the public school employer.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that a public hearing be scheduled at the June 2024 Board Meeting to allow for public input regarding the initial collective bargaining proposals submitted by SEIU.
