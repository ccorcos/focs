**Explain why this project is needed:**  
Davies Hall was constructed using lift slab construction in 1965, a type of construction classified as a DSA Category 2 building. In a letter from DSA to the District dated June 20, 2022, DSA stated that these types of buildings "may be inherently dangerous with the potential for catastrophic failure and progressive collapse if the building is subjected to differential movement (vertical or lateral), changes in loading, or alterations to the structure that it was not designed to withstand." A third-party Structural report confirmed the building is lift slab construction and that it does have the life safety deficiencies identified by DSA, along with some additional ones. The least cost permanent solution is to reconstruct Davies Hall on its current site. The new building will house the same uses, primarily instructional and faculty offices, but it will have a smaller ASF/GSF to address the lecture cap-loads.

## Planning
### Los Rios Community College District (230)
### American River College (231)

**District Priority & Project:** 4 Paramedics Classroom

**Project Type:** Replacement  
**Total Estimated Cost:** $6,419,983  
**Anticipated Source(s) of Funds:** Non-State  
**Type of Construction:**  
- Seismic Retrofit:  
- If Existing - Age:  
- If Existing - Condition:  

### Anticipated Time Schedule

| Estimated Cost | $0 | $249,145 | $181,691 | $5,989,147 | $0 |

### Explain why this project is needed:
The Paramedic program is currently housed in the former Child Development Center. This facility is scheduled to be demolished as part of a larger future project associated with Davies Hall. In addition to this fact, the current facility fails to meet the needs of this successful CTE program. This project will provide a permanent home for the Paramedic program which will improve the interior usage, access to technology, exterior quality and infrastructure stability. In addition, this project will be located immediately adjacent the Health Education complex which allows students and faculty improved access to departmental services.

### Explain why this project is needed:
The proposed project will construct a new affordable student housing complex on the American River College (ARC) campus. The new student housing complex will have the capacity to house 272 low-income students and will be approximately 37,909 Assignable Square Feet (ASF) / 50,040 Gross Square Feet (GSF). The complex is expected to be located south of campus at the southern end of Stadium Parking at the corner of College Oak Drive and Winding Way. The proposed housing complex is anticipated to include 1 unit – Resident Director Apartment (950-Square), 12 units – single occupancy (910-Sleep/Study without Toilet/Bath), and 130 units - double occupancy (910-Sleep/Study without Toilet/Bath). Common areas are to include toilet/bath, tutoring/workshop spaces, food pantry and mental health services specifically intended to support the basic needs and academic success of participating low-income students. The proposed affordable student housing complex is anticipated to have a total project cost of $48,136,000 (escalated to midpoint of construction). The College is proposing 100% of this development for low-income students and the entire complex is anticipated to be State-Substantial (0% Locally Funded). The College does not currently have sufficient local funds to augment or contribute to this project. Total project cost includes completion of design documents, legal/special services, permits/fees, project management, construction, and group II equipment. The primary goal of the proposed student housing project is to support student success by meeting students' essential physiological needs. By providing low-cost student housing and ancillary/student support services spaces, the College is looking to increase enrollment, Full Time Equivalent Students (FTES), retention, and engagement; along with cultivating diversity, inclusion and belonging on campus. Per the College's Institutional Equity Plan, "Equity is focused on providing educational opportunities and support that meet the needs of the community, especially those who are historically underserved, marginalized, and/or disproportionately impacted." Alleviating housing insecurities for students, faculty/staff, and the community will help close the equity gap and provide a holistic approach to student learning. Based on May 2022 California Department of Housing and Community Development data, Sacramento County's Area Median Income (AMI) for a single-room occupancy unit was $17,550. For the purposes of this Student Housing Grant Program, the maximum single-room monthly rental rate ARC could charge would be $894 per month ($71,550 x 50% = $10,733 annual rent / 12 months = $894 monthly rent). ARC plans to offer its traditional single occupancy units at $764.70 per bed to low-income students. The Resident Director apartment unit is anticipated to not generate revenue since the rent from this unit will be included within the employee compensation package. The College is committed to first offering housing to low-income students at a rental rate of approximately $765 per bed, which is approximately 14% below the $894 monthly rent bed maximum. As of July 2023, ARC has completed a student housing market feasibility study, financial feasibility analysis, and schematic building design efforts. Next steps for the proposed project will be to finish design documents, obtain Division of State Architect (DSA) approval, and start construction. Completing the design process is anticipated to take approximately 6 months and could be completed as early as December 2024. Following completion of construction documents, DSA review and approval of plans is anticipated to take approximately 6 months. Given the anticipated time schedule, the proposed project could be ready for construction groundbreaking as early as September 2025. The College is committed to requiring low-income students renting the proposed housing facility to enroll in a minimum average of 12 degree-applicable units per semester-term (or quarter-term equivalent) to facilitate timely degree completion. The minimum unit load requirement may be temporarily reduced if the College deems a student demonstrates an exceptional circumstance. Eligible low-income students renting the proposed facility will be permitted to live in the building for the full academic or calendar year, so long as the student remains enrolled at the College. Renewal of housing in the facility for subsequent academic or calendar years will require the student to demonstrate compliance with minimum average enrollment requirements.

### Explain why this project is needed:
Modernize the Library by replacing the old outdated and non-code compliant Library with a new modern, aesthetic and equitable Library building. The existing Library has multiple access compliance issues, unstable aged electrical and mechanical infrastructure, technology deficiencies, and inefficient circulation and space configurations which will be resolved by building a new replacement. The new building will house the same uses: Learning Resource, Classroom, Lab and Office spaces in the existing building's current location.

**Explain why this project is needed:**  
This project will modernize the Rodda Hall North building. The building was constructed in 1975 and has had no major renovations other than small tenant improvements in individual rooms. The existing HVAC, electrical and plumbing systems are old, outdated and energy inefficient. The building consists of modular style walls which has become uninhabitable and unreparable and contributes to poor acoustics and a depressing interior experience. The entire buildings assignable square footage (ASF) of 61,894 will be modernized and upon completion contain upgraded building systems, ADA accommodations and a student and staff experience matching the instruction delivered. The Facility Condition Index (FCI) for this building is 56.34 indicating a building in poor shape and needing renovation.

| Estimated Cost | $0 | $1,006,724 | $763,344 | $24,499,870 | $0 |

### Explain why this project is needed:
The entire building is in need of modernization, to improve needed classrooms and support spaces, along with better organization of the interior. The South Gymnasium needs a complete interior renovation. If modernization becomes a new building, some of the classroom spaces can move into the Business Building, and student organizations to the Student Union, to keep only athletic functions in the South Gym building, which would be connected to the Community Room that would remain in place. The new building footprint could be reduced and additional outdoor space could be developed between South Gym and Business Building. Consideration should be given to a relationship or connection between North Gym and South Gym buildings.
