# LRCFT Report to the LRCCD Board of Trustees  May 8, 2024

The LRCFT last week sent a delegation of faculty union members to Cuba to participate in humanitarian and educational work. We learned a wealth of information that we will apply to helping our 2,000 members in Los Rios.

The LRCFT on April 24 joined dozens of fellow CFT members for our collective lobby day with state legislators. We discussed a range of bills to help students, including a cap on district reserves.

Our PAFC on May 22 will interview women’s rights attorney Maggie Krell for a potential endorsement in the AD 7 race.

Our PAFC recently passed a very early endorsement of former LRCFT faculty union member Dr. Colette Harris Mathews for the Los Rios Trustee Area 5 position. We are in the process now of assisting her with the Sacramento Central Labor Council’s endorsement process.

We will join our classified CFT union siblings statewide for a classified day of action on May 21 in the Capitol. The LRCFT is increasingly reaching out to SEIU and LRCEA to build solidarity among the three unions in Los Rios.

Our faculty union picnic is May 17 from 1 to 5 pm at Sierra 2 Center for the Arts. We have invited the trustees and Chancellor to the event.

The LRCFT will send a group of new faculty union leaders to CFT’s Union summer school in June to become better trained in helping faculty.

The LRCFT recently held a clinic for faculty to assist with student loan forgiveness. I want to thank our new union board member Jacob Traugott for their concerted efforts to make this event a big success.

I want to thank VC Carrie Bray for helping to finalize a very successful culmination of negotiations surrounding the ARC Davies Hall closure.

We are also finalizing our negotiations regarding the Moratorium on the use of human remains, something we are proud to be part of in helping our tribal partners rebound from three centuries of US government-sponsored genocide.

We remain concerned about faculty participation in LRCCD’s Prison and Reentry Program. We look forward to a successful resolution of this on-going issue so that our faculty can continue to serve incarcerated students in this a well-known statewide program.

In closing, the voting members of our board just a few hours ago passed a resolution supporting the Academic Senate’s resolution passed yesterday of a vote of no confidence in the Chancellor. Although the LRCFT resolution was not passed in time to be electronically submitted with my report this evening, it will be sent to the clerk of the board and trustees tomorrow morning.

Thank you!

Jason Newman  
LRCFT President

![Resolution received by the Clerk of the Board on May 9, 2024](https://example.com/image.png)

**Resolution received by the Clerk of the Board on May 9, 2024**

In light of each of Los Rios’ Academic Senate’s Resolutions and Votes of No Confidence (VNC) in LRCCD Chancellor Brian King’s leadership, and the LRCCD Board of Trustees’ public statement in support of the Chancellor without engaging the substance of faculty concerns, the Los Rios College Federation of Teachers (LRCFT) believe that we must voice our support for and in solidarity with our Academic Senates.

**LRCFT Resolution Affirming Academic Senates’ Resolutions and Votes of No Confidence.**

Whereas, the principle of participatory governance in the California Community Colleges has been established and codified in law (AB1725) and only functions when it is practiced at all levels of the administration and faculty governing bodies;

Whereas, Article 15 of the LRCFT- LRCCD Collective Bargaining Agreement affirms the Academic Senate’s role of representing the faculty in making recommendations to the Administration and governing board with respect to District policies on academic and professional matters;

Whereas, the LRCFT Executive Board recognizes that participatory governance has ceased to function effectively across the District;

Whereas, the Chancellor’s pattern of insufficient and limited consultation on academic and professional matters as noted in the Academic Senates’ Resolutions and Votes of No Confidence (1) have direct implications on contractual issues including workload, working conditions, academic freedom, and professional responsibilities;

And whereas, the deliberate exclusion of faculty voices has a direct impact on the District and Colleges’ ability to sustain the mission of having “a vibrant learning environment that empowers all students to achieve their educational and career goals;” (2)

Therefore, be it resolved that the Executive Board of the LRCFT urges members of the Board of Trustees to review the substance of the Resolutions and Votes of No Confidence and engage faculty in discussions on their implications for participatory governance, academic and professional matters, and faculty labor conditions;

Be it further resolved that the Executive Board of the LRCFT affirms the District and College Academic Senates’ Resolutions and Votes of No Confidence;

Be it finally resolved that the Executive Board of the LRCFT directs President Jason Newman to forward this resolution to the LRCCD Chancellor and the LRCCD Board of Trustees and include the substance of this resolution in his LRCFT Report during the May 2024 Board of Trustee meeting.
