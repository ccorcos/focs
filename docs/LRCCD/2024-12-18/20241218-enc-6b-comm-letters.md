Board of Trustees  
Los Rios Community College District  
Sacramento, California  

We have audited the financial statements of Los Rios Community College District (the District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, and have issued our report thereon dated December 3, 2024. Professional standards require that we advise you of the following matters relating to our audit.

**Our Responsibility in Relation to the Financial Statement Audit under Generally Accepted Auditing Standards and Government Auditing Standards and our Compliance Audit under the Uniform Guidance**

As communicated in our letter dated August 15, 2024, our responsibility, as described by professional standards, is to form and express an opinion about whether the financial statements that have been prepared by management with your oversight are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to express an opinion on whether the District complied with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the District’s major federal programs. Our audit of the financial statements and major program compliance does not relieve you or management of its respective responsibilities.

Our responsibility, as prescribed by professional standards, is to plan and perform our audit to obtain reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, as part of our audit, we considered the internal control of District solely for the purpose of determining our audit procedures and not to provide any assurance concerning such internal control.

Our responsibility, as prescribed by professional standards as it relates to the audit of the District’s major federal program compliance, is to express an opinion on the compliance for each of the District’s major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. An audit of major program compliance includes consideration of the system of internal control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, as a part of our major program compliance audit, we considered the system of internal control over compliance for these purposes and not to provide any assurance on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control over compliance.

<!-- Page 2 -->
We are also responsible for communicating significant matters related to the audit that are, in our professional judgment, relevant to your responsibilities in overseeing the financial reporting process. However, we are not required to design procedures for the purpose of identifying other matters to communicate to you.

We have provided our comments regarding internal controls during our audit in our Independent Auditor’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards dated December 3, 2024. We have also provided our comments regarding compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above and internal controls over compliance during our audit in our Independent Auditor’s Report on Compliance with Each Major Federal Program and Report on Internal Control Over Compliance Required by the Uniform Guidance dated December 3, 2024.

**Planned Scope and Timing of the Audit**

We conducted our audit consistent with the planned scope and timing we previously communicated to you.

**Compliance with All Ethics Requirements Regarding Independence**

The engagement team, others in our firm, as appropriate, our firm, and other firms utilized in the engagement, if applicable, have complied with all relevant ethical requirements regarding independence.

**Qualitative Aspects of the District’s Significant Accounting Practices**

**Significant Accounting Policies**

Management has the responsibility to select and use appropriate accounting policies. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by District is included in Note 2 to the financial statements. There have been no initial selection of accounting policies and no changes in significant accounting policies or their application during the year ended June 30, 2024. No matters have come to our attention that would require us, under professional standards, to inform you about (1) the methods used to account for significant unusual transactions and (2) the effect of significant accounting policies in controversial or emerging areas for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus.

**Accounting Estimates**

Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based on management’s current judgments. Those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management’s current judgments.
<!-- Page 3 -->
![Financial Statement Estimates](https://example.com/image.png)

The most sensitive accounting estimates affecting the financial statements are:

Management’s estimate of the aggregate net pension liability, related deferred outflows of resources, deferred inflows of resources, and pension expense is based on the District’s proportionate share of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) estimated net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources, deferred inflows of resources, and pension expense, which were actuarially determined, utilizing projections of future contributions and future earnings, actuarial assumptions such as inflation, salary increases, mortality rates, and investment rate of return and discount rates in the determination of the final balances reported in the CalSTRS and CalPERS audited financial statements. The District’s proportionate share was determined by calculating the District’s share of contributions to the pension plan relative to the contributions of all participating entities in the plan.

Management’s estimate of the net other postemployment benefit (OPEB) asset/liability, related deferred outflows of resources, deferred inflows of resources, and OPEB expense is based on the work performed by an actuary, utilizing projections of future benefit costs, actuarial assumptions such as inflation, benefit cost increases, mortality rates, and discount rates.

Management’s estimate of the claims liability for the District’s self-insured liability program is based on the work performed by an actuary. We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the claims liability in determining that it is reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.

Financial Statement Disclosures

Certain financial statement disclosures involve significant judgment and are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statement users. There were no financial statement disclosures that we consider to be particularly sensitive or involve significant judgment.

Significant Difficulties Encountered during the Audit

We encountered no significant difficulties in dealing with management relating to the performance of the audit.

Uncorrected and Corrected Misstatements

For purposes of this communication, professional standards require us to accumulate all known and likely misstatements identified during the audit, other than those that we believe are trivial, and communicate them to the appropriate level of management. Further, professional standards require us to also communicate the effect of uncorrected misstatements related to prior periods on the relevant classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures, and the financial statements as a whole. Uncorrected misstatements or matters underlying those uncorrected misstatements could potentially cause future-period financial statements to be materially misstated, even though the uncorrected misstatements are immaterial to the financial statements currently under audit. There were no uncorrected or corrected misstatements identified as a result of our audit procedures.

Disagreements with Management

For purposes of this letter, professional standards define a disagreement with management as a matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction, concerning a financial accounting, reporting, or auditing matter, which could be significant to the financial statements or the auditor’s report. No such disagreements arose during the course of the audit.

**Circumstances that Affect the Form and Content of the Auditor’s Report**  
For purposes of this letter, professional standards require that we communicate any circumstances that affect the form and content of our auditor’s report. We did not identify any circumstances that affect the form and content of the auditor’s report.

**Representations Requested from Management**  
We have requested certain written representations from management which are included in the management representation letter dated December 3, 2024.

**Management’s Consultations with Other Accountants**  
In some cases, management may decide to consult with other accountants about auditing and accounting matters. Management informed us that, and to our knowledge, there were no consultations with other accountants regarding auditing and accounting matters.

**Other Significant Matters, Findings, or Issues**  
In the normal course of our professional association with District, we generally discuss a variety of matters, including the application of accounting principles and auditing standards, significant events or transactions that occurred during the year, operating conditions affecting the entity, and operating plans and strategies that may affect the risks of material misstatement. None of the matters discussed resulted in a condition to our retention as District’s auditors.

**Other Information Included in the Financial Statements**  
Pursuant to professional standards, our responsibility as auditors for other information, whether financial or nonfinancial, included in the District’s financial statements, does not extend beyond the financial information identified in the audit report, and we are not required to perform any procedures to corroborate such other information.

Our responsibility also includes communicating to you any information which we believe is a material misstatement of fact. Nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that such information, or its manner of presentation, is materially inconsistent with the information, or manner of its presentation, appearing in the financial statements.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of Trustees and management of District and is not intended to be, and should not be, used by anyone other than these specified parties.

To the Governing Board and Citizens Oversight Committee  
Los Rios Community College District  
Sacramento, California  

We have audited the financial statements of Los Rios Community College District’s (the District) General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, and have issued our report thereon dated November 27, 2024. We have also performed the performance audit of the District’s General Obligation Bond Construction Fund. Professional standards require that we advise you of the following matters relating to our audit.

**Our Responsibility in Relation to the Financial Statement Audit of the District’s General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M) under Generally Accepted Auditing Standards and Government Auditing Standards and the Performance Audit under Government Auditing Standards**

As communicated in our letter dated April 16, 2024, our responsibility, as described by professional standards, is to form and express an opinion about whether the financial statements that have been prepared by management with your oversight are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Additionally, our responsibility, as described by professional standards, is to conduct a performance audit in accordance with Government Auditing Standards. Our audit of the financial statements and performance audit does not relieve you or management of its respective responsibilities.

Our responsibility, as prescribed by professional standards, is to plan and perform our audit to obtain reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, as part of our audit, we considered the internal control of the District solely for the purpose of determining our audit procedures and not to provide any assurance concerning such internal control.

We are also responsible for communicating significant matters related to the audit that are, in our professional judgment, relevant to your responsibilities in overseeing the financial reporting process. However, we are not required to design procedures for the purpose of identifying other matters to communicate to you.

We have provided our comments regarding internal controls during our audit in our Independent Auditor’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards dated November 27, 2024.

**Emphasis of Matter**  
As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements present only the General Obligation Bond Construction Fund (Measure M), and do not purport to, and do not, present fairly the financial position of the District as of June 30, 2024, the changes in its financial position for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Board of Trustees  
Los Rios Community College District  
Retiree Health Benefits Trust  
Sacramento, California  

We have audited the financial statements of Los Rios Community College District Retiree Health Benefits Trust (the Trust) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and have issued our report thereon dated December 3, 2024. Professional standards require that we advise you of the following matters relating to our audit.

As communicated in our letter dated April 16, 2024, our responsibility, as described by professional standards, is to form and express an opinion about whether the financial statements that have been prepared by management with your oversight are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

![Significant Risks Identified](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Significant+Risks+Identified)

**Significant Risks Identified**

As stated in our auditor’s report, professional standards require us to design our audit to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free of material misstatement whether caused by fraud or error. In designing our audit procedures, professional standards require us to evaluate the financial statements and assess the risk that a material misstatement could occur. Areas that are potentially more susceptible to misstatements, and thereby require special audit considerations, are designated as “significant risks”. We have identified the following as significant risks.

- **Management Override of Controls** – Professional standards require auditors to address the possibility of management overriding controls. Accordingly, we identified as a significant risk that management of the Trust may have the ability to override controls that the organization has implemented. Management may override the Trust’s controls in order to modify the financial records with the intent of manipulating the consolidated financial statements to overstate the Trust’s financial performance or with the intent of concealing fraudulent transactions.

- **Revenue Recognition** – Under professional standards, revenue recognition is a presumed fraud risk. Accordingly, we identified revenue recognition as a significant risk due to financial and operational incentives for the Trust to overstate revenues.

**Qualitative Aspects of the Entity’s Significant Accounting Practices**

**Significant Accounting Policies**

Management has the responsibility to select and use appropriate accounting policies. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Trust is included in Note 1 to the financial statements. There have been no initial selection of accounting policies and no changes in significant accounting policies or their application during June 30, 2023. No matters have come to our attention that would require us, under professional standards, to inform you about (1) the methods used to account for significant unusual transactions and (2) the effect of significant accounting policies in controversial or emerging areas for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus.
