### Los Rios Community College District Indigenous Land Acknowledgment Statement
In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

Education Code section 81452 provides that the governing board may, by unanimous vote, dispose of items valued at $5,000 or less by private sale without advertising or selling the items at public auction.

The District has a quantity of surplus materials that needs to be disposed of, such as outdated desks and computers. The District has located a scrap dealer who will take selected surplus items for recycling. Any items remaining will be disposed.

The surplus items to be recycled or disposed of are either irreparable, obsolete, in poor condition or not needed for district/college operations and include the following: 17 Chromebooks; 202 computers; 11 document cameras; 134 laptops; 1 microfilm scanner; 37 monitors; 3 printers; 2 scanners; 20 servers; 3 switches; 1 tablet; 1 television; 6 thin clients; 6 bookshelves and 1 upright piano.

These items have a value of less than $5,000.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** December 18, 2024

---

**SUBJECT:** Student, Temporary Classified Employees - Special Rate, Temporary Interpreter, Clerical/Paraprofessional, & Maintenance/Service, and SEIU Classified Salary Schedules

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item K  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  
**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor

---

**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
The District salary schedule for Student Help employees needs to be improved to reflect the increase in the minimum wage to $16.50 per hour, which takes effect on January 1, 2025. In addition, the District’s Temporary Classified salary schedules, which includes Clerical/Paraprofessional and Maintenance/Service positions, were reviewed to ensure all classifications were above the minimum wage. Following our typical practice, the Medicare (1.45%) and PARS (3.75%) deduction offsets are applied which will bring the minimum temporary rate to $17.36 per hour. The District has historically tied the Clerical/Paraprofessional and Maintenance/Service Temporary Classified schedules to a % of the Step 1 rate for regular classifications. In the interest of attracting and retaining a qualified temporary workforce, this benchmark will remain at 80%. The LRCEA and SEIU units received improvements effective for fiscal year 2025, so maintaining this benchmark will cause an improvement to the temporary classified schedules. In addition, ranges 12-22 of the Clerical/Paraprofessional – Temporary Classified Salary Schedule deviate from the 80% benchmark to ensure the rate is not lower than $17.36. The Special Rate and Temporary Interpreter rates are generally set relative to the market rate for some of the classifications. The timing of these salary schedule improvements will occur at the start of the pay period in which the minimum wage increase becomes effective, which is December 25, 2024.

Our SEIU Local 1021 union requested a title change for the Physical Education/Athletic Attendant position to Kinesiology/Athletics Equipment Technician so the title would reflect the current terminology for such a position. The attached Maintenance/Service – Temporary Classified Employees salary schedule reflects these changes for the temporary regular and temporary lead positions with an effective date of December 25, 2024. In addition, the attached SEIU Classified salary schedule reflects the same title changes for the regular and lead positions with an effective date of January 1, 2025.

A title change for the College Work Study position to Federal Work Study is requested to reflect current terminology with an effective date of December 25, 2024.

STATUS:  
The Student Help schedule will be increased to the minimum wage of $16.50 per hour, effective December 25, 2024. Student help employees are not subject to OASDI and therefore the net wage for student employees is slightly higher than employment in the private sector. For temporary classified employment, the minimum hourly wage is set at $17.36 to offset the OASDI deduction. With the exception of some lower compensated ranges, the other ranges on the Clerical/Paraprofessional and Maintenance/Service Temporary Classified schedules will be set at the benchmark of 80% of step 1 for their regular classifications. Ranges 12 through 22 of the Clerical/Paraprofessional – Temporary Classified schedule will be slightly different due to the compressing impact that the minimum wage has on these lower compensated ranges. These ranges will be set at increments of $0.20 apart, with ranges 23 and above keeping the 80% benchmark mentioned prior. The minimum hourly rate for the Maintenance/Service positions is range 21 at $19.38. The hourly rates for classified temporary employment of the Special Rate and Interpreter Temporary schedules are set as described above with a minimum hourly rate of $17.36.

RECOMMENDATION:  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the attached Student Help/College Work Study Employees salary schedule along with title change for College Work Study to Federal Work Study, Temporary Classified Employees salary schedules – Special Rate, Temporary Interpreter, Clerical/Paraprofessional, and Maintenance/Service effective December 25, 2024. It is also recommended that the Board of trustees approve the attached SEIU Classified salary schedule showing the title change for the Physical Education/Athletic Attendant position to Kinesiology/Athletics Equipment Technician with an effective date of January 1, 2025.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** December 18, 2024

**SUBJECT:** Initial Collective Bargaining Proposals – LRCEA 2025-28  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Collective Bargaining Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**STATUS:**  
See attached list of interests identified by LRCEA and the District.  

**BACKGROUND:**  
Pursuant to Government Code Section 3547, et seq., all initial proposals of exclusive representatives of recognized employee groups and of the District are required to be presented at a public meeting of the District.

The Board and representatives of the Los Rios Classified Employees Association (LRCEA) have agreed to engage in negotiations. The collective bargaining agreement with LRCEA expires on June 30, 2025. The parties wish to commence negotiations as soon as possible, with the goal of attempting to reach agreement as early as possible before the contract expires.

As part of the model of negotiations, the parties will identify their respective interests. The theory is that it is easier to reconcile interests than positions. Reconciling interests, rather than positions, affords both parties an opportunity to be heard throughout the negotiation process. Therefore, the initial proposals will be framed as interests as much as possible.

Consistent with the applicable code sections, the public has a right to be informed of those areas that the parties will be negotiating and to invite public comment at a meeting of the public school employer.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
This item is presented for the Board of Trustees information and discussion. It is recommended that a public hearing be scheduled on January 8, 2025, to allow for public input regarding the initial collective bargaining proposals submitted by LRCEA and the District.

**SUBJECT:** American River College Davies Hall Health and Safety Replacement Project - Final Project Proposal (FPP)  
**ATTACHMENT:** None  
**ENCLOSURE:** Final Project Proposal (FPP)  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  
**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  

---

**STATUS:**  
Category A1 project-funding requests are given priority by the State Chancellor’s Office when competing for funding with requests in other categories. In a Category A1 request, districts are only required to contribute 25% of the required funds compared to at least 50% in other category projects. For the Davies Hall Category A1 FPP, health and safety of student, faculty and staff takes priority over capacity/load ratios and a higher local contribution of funds as the key element in the State’s prioritization of funding capital projects. Additionally, while our institution does not meet the specific criteria for a hardship exemption, we are planning to submit a waiver request to the state due to the atypical nature of this project. The goal is to advocate for relief from the local match requirement, although approval of such waivers is rare. In anticipation of the potential need to meet the 25% match requirement, the District is preparing to allocate approximately $20.2 million in local funding to cover our share of the $81 million project cost. To support this, the District has prioritized setting aside half of this amount, $10.1 million, this year through the program development fund. This step is especially critical, as we no longer have additional bond authorization available for such purposes. In addition to the state budget bill junior, which has made this project funding a possibility, the District will continue advocating for the ARC Davies Hall FPP’s inclusion in the 2025-26 state budget. Approval of this FPP will enable us to advance the project and demonstrate our readiness to address health and safety needs across our campus.

---

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the Final Project Proposal (FPP) for the American River College Davies Hall Health and Safety Replacement Project for submission to the State.

**BACKGROUND:**  
California Education Code § 84040 mandates that the governing board of each community college district must provide for an annual audit of all funds, books, and accounts of the district in accordance with regulations of the Board of Governors. The audit must be performed by certified public accountants licensed by the California Board of Accountancy. The audit consists of the examination of the District’s financial statements, a review of the systems of internal accounting controls, and a review of state and federal compliance areas mandated by the Federal Single Audit Act and the State Audit Manual.

Pursuant to Title 5 CCR § 59106, each district governing board must review the annual audit at a public meeting and submit the audit report to the California Community College Chancellor’s Office by December 31, unless an extension is granted as per the Chancellor’s Contracted District Audit Manual.

Eide Bailly LLP successfully completed the following audits for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024: the District's annual audit, the financial and performance audit of the Measure M bond fund, and the annual audit of the Foundation. Additionally, the firm completed the annual audit of the retiree health benefits trust for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. These audits were completed without any significant deficiencies, material weaknesses, or findings, marking the thirteenth consecutive fiscal year with clean audit results.

A representative from Eide Bailly LLP will be present to provide commentary and address any questions regarding the annual audits.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** December 18, 2024  

**SUBJECT:** 2024-25 Program Development Funds  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item C  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
Program Development Funds, also referred to as PDF or 20% funds, are the District’s discretionary funds for allocation to continuing and one-time-only purposes. The funds are comprised of both prior and current year resources per established formulas. Schedule I summarizes the funds available for the 2024-25 allocation. The overall guidelines for PDF allocations are: 1) to be responsive to the District/Colleges’ planning process and related goals and objectives; 2) to address any current or future emphases directed by the Governing Board; 3) to fund mandates or new costs imposed upon the District; 4) to balance the distribution across District-wide needs; and 5) to maintain the District’s conservative fiscal practices.

A key factor in the distribution of the funds is matching the type of resource (continuing or one-time-only) to the nature of the allocation. The type of revenue establishes or limits the type of expenditure that can be funded.

For 2024-25, the District has $6.3 million to allocate toward continuing costs, which includes funding from the Student Centered Funding Formula, plus the change in estimate to PDF in 2023-24. These estimates are consistent with those contained in the Adopted Budget approved at the September 2024 board meeting. If the funding formula yields additional on-going resources in 2024-25, those will be included in the 2025-26 Program Development Funds allocation.

The District also has $39.7 million available for one-time general-purpose of which $5.8 million is allocated towards College Capital Outlay Projects.

**STATUS:**  
The proposed allocations contained in Schedule II are organized by the goals outlined in the District’s Strategic Plan. Of note, these allocations have been focused on maintaining core elements of the District’s services operations and include minimal new items of expenditure this year. Strategy A focuses on establishing pathways for access and success. Strategy B emphasizes equitable academic achievement. Strategy C centers on improving teaching and learning.

The District Budget Committee has reviewed the resources and allocations schedules. The formal approval of the allocations will take place in February when the first budget revision for 2024-25 is brought to the Board.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the proposals contained in the Program Development Funds effective January 1, 2025.
