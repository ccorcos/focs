**Board of Trustees**  
Los Rios Community College District  
Sacramento, California  

## Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

### Opinions

We have audited the financial statements of the business-type activities, aggregate discretely presented component unit, and fiduciary activities of Los Rios Community College District (the District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the business-type activities, aggregate discretely presented component unit, and fiduciary activities of Los Rios Community College District as of June 30, 2024, and the respective changes in financial position, and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

### Basis for Opinions

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (Government Auditing Standards). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.

### Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the District’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter.

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.
- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the District’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

## Required Supplementary Information

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management’s discussion and analysis pages 4 through 12 and other required supplementary schedules as listed in the table of contents on pages 62 through 69 be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with GAAS, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because
<!-- Page 6 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

## Supplementary Information

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the District’s basic financial statements. The accompanying supplementary information, including the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards, as required by the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance), and other supplementary information listed in the table of contents, is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with GAAS. In our opinion, the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards and other supplementary information listed in the table of contents are fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

## Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated December 3, 2024 on our consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

# Los Rios Community College District
## Management’s Discussion and Analysis
### June 30, 2024

## DISTRICT BACKGROUND

The Los Rios Community College District (the District) was formed in 1965 as a result of the consolidation of ten separate K-12 “feeder” districts. The District initially consisted of two colleges: Sacramento City College (SCC), founded in 1916, and American River College (ARC), founded in 1955. Cosumnes River College (CRC) was established in 1970 to serve the southern portion of the District and in 2004 Folsom Lake College (FLC) achieved college status. The District also includes six education centers in Davis, El Dorado, Elk Grove, Natomas, Rancho Cordova, and West Sacramento.

With over 70,000 students enrolled during our primary terms, the District is the second-largest community college district in California and one of the largest in the nation. The District, covering approximately 2,440 square miles, includes most of Sacramento and El Dorado Counties and parts of Yolo, Placer, and Solano Counties.

### DISTRICT ENROLLMENT BY COLLEGE
#### FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS (FTES) 2023-24

- SCC, 12,056, 27%
- FLC, 6,172, 14%
- CRC, 9,288, 21%
- Other, 38%

## ATTENDANCE

The District’s achieved attendance increased by 11% in the current year compared to the prior year. The difference between reported and achieved FTES is due to the District shifting a portion of summer 2023 FTES to 2022-23. The increase in achieved attendance is an encouraging sign for the District, as it demonstrates that the District’s broad-based outreach and marketing efforts, designed to restore the District’s enrollment to pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels, are working. This effort includes a heavy focus on improving persistence among existing students as well as growing the number of Dual Enrollment students served by the District.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

**MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (explained)**

The District follows the financial reporting standards established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) provides an overview of the District’s financial position and activities. The MD&A, prepared by District management, should be read in conjunction with the financial statements. The purpose of the basic financial statements is to summarize the District’s financial status as a whole and to present a long-term view of the District’s finances.

The basic financial statements include four components:

1. **Statement of Net Position** presents the District’s assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, deferred inflows of resources and net position.

2. **Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position** presents the District’s revenues earned, expenses incurred and change in total net position.

3. **Statement of Cash Flows** presents information about the cash activities of the District during the year.

4. **Notes to the Financial Statements** provide additional information crucial for the review of the financial statements.

**FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**

The Student Centered Funding Formula (SCFF) is the formula used to allocate state general apportionment funding to California’s community colleges. SCFF retained the Basic Allocation established under Senate Bill (SB) 361 in the 2006-07 fiscal year, but at a significantly reduced rate. However, SCFF funds districts for outcomes and demographics, providing an incentive to improve students’ success, especially students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The SCFF allocations for fiscal year 2023-24 and their respective weightings consist of:

- **Base Allocation (70%)** – Similar to the pre-SCFF calculation and primarily driven by enrollment.
  
- **Supplemental Allocation (20%)** – Based on the number of low-income students served, as represented by students receiving a Pell or California College Promise Grant (CCPG), or an AB540 California Dream Act Nonresident Tuition Fee Waiver.
  
- **Student Success Allocation (10%)** – Based on eight defined student outcomes aligned with the California Community Colleges Vision for Success, with the highest value assigned to Associate Degrees for Transfer awarded to students who also received a Pell Grant and/or a CCPG.

The SCFF includes a hold harmless provision, which ensures districts receive funding at or above their fiscal year 2017-2018. The 2022 Budget Act extended the SCFF’s hold harmless provision by one year, through 2024-25. The District’s fiscal year 2023-24 SCFF allocation exceeded the hold harmless provision, as SCFF calculated funding ($407 million) was more than the calculated funding using the hold harmless provision ($390.6 million). It is important to take into consideration that SCFF funding is based on the availability of state general apportionment funding.

The District closed the year with unrestricted general fund reserves of $176 million, or 33% of expenditures, as well as available reserves in its unrestricted capital outlay projects fund. Cash balances in the unrestricted general fund and unrestricted capital outlay projects fund is $458 million.

As of June 30, 2022, the voters have approved two bond measures. The voters approved Measure A at $265 million on March 5, 2002 and Measure M at $475 million on November 4, 2008. The District has fully issued Measure A. On July 1, 2021, the District issued the fifth series of Measure M, Series E, for $130 million for a total Measure M issuance of $465 million. The District’s four colleges, the District Office, and other facilities providing District-wide services have utilized the bond issues to construct new facilities and modernize existing facilities. In total, the two bond measures have funded 102 capital facility projects, with an additional 18 projects currently in progress. As of June 30, 2024, Measure A was fully expended, and nearly all Measure M funds have been expended or committed.

### FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUMMARY

#### Statement of Net Position

The net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of the District’s financial position. The District’s assets and deferred outflows of resources exceed the liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $815.3 million.

| Noncurrent liabilities:                  |               |               |
| Net OPEB liability                       | 970,886       | 8,639,217     |
| Other long-term obligations              | 775,172,471   | 810,721,899   |
| **Total Liabilities**                    | **1,148,957,631** | **1,191,268,287** |
| **DEFERRED INFLOWS OF RESOURCES**       | 69,043,541    | 63,626,746    |
| **NET POSITION**                         |               |               |
| Net investment in capital assets         | 579,432,725   | 470,004,746   |

| **Total Net Position**                   | **$ 815,286,348** | **$ 648,620,397** |

The District’s $579.4 million net investment in capital assets (e.g., land, buildings and equipment) is a significant portion of net position. This amount is net of any outstanding debt used to acquire the capital assets. The District uses these assets to provide educational services; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending.

The restricted net position accounts for $102.5 million of net position. Restricted net position represents resources subject to external restrictions, constitutional provisions, or enabling legislation on their use.

| **Net Increase in Net Position** | **$166,665,951** | **$152,689,387** |

Certain reclassifications were applied to the 2023 groupings to align them with the classifications used in the 2024 Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position.

Net tuition and fees, included in operating revenue, increased by $2.8 million, primarily driven by an 11% increase in achieved FTES.

Grants and contracts, noncapital included in operating revenue, decreased by $59.1 million. This decline was primarily due to a $75 million reduction in recognized revenue from various federal categorical programs and grants, including $71 million from the COVID-19 Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF), which were fully utilized during the 2022-23 fiscal year. However, this overall decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from various state categorical programs and grants.
<!-- Page 12 -->
![Los Rios Community College District Management’s Discussion and Analysis June 30, 2024](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Los+Rios+Community+College+District+Management%E2%80%99s+Discussion+and+Analysis+June+30%2C+2024)

Ongoing salary schedule improvements, coupled with one-time only retroactive salary schedule improvements resulted in the $33.9 million increase in salaries.

Benefits expense increased by $10 million. Major drivers of this increase were:

- Pension and OPEB expense increased due to recording the related liability changes, deferred outflows, and inflows over and above the prior year.
- Mandated increases in CalPERS employer contribution rates.
- Increases in health insurance premiums across the District’s health care plans.
- The State’s on-behalf contributions to employee pension plans and proportionate share of related pension liabilities increased by $4.5 million. Accounting standards require equal and opposite reporting via revenue and expense for the on-behalf contributions from the State and any increase in their proportionate share of related pension liabilities; therefore, there is no impact to the bottom line (net position) resulting from these transactions as Lottery and other income is correspondingly increased dollar for dollar.

Student financial aid, included in operating expenses, decreased by $11.4 million. This reduction was primarily due to the absence of $37.7 million in HEERF student financial aid disbursed during the 2022-23 fiscal year, as HEERF funds were fully utilized in that period. However, the decline was partially offset by a $26.1 million increase in other federal and state financial aid, largely attributed to a significant rise in the number of students applying for and qualifying for Federal Pell Grants. This $26.1 million increase also accounts for the growth in Federal and state financial aid grants reported under nonoperating revenue.

State apportionments and EPA, noncapital increased by $36.8 million primarily due to the 8.22% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) applied to the SCFF.

Net investment income less interest expense increased by $14.2 million primarily due to rising interest rates resulting in increased interest income, coupled with increases in the District’s interest earning deposit and investment account balances.

State and local capital income increased by $18.9 million primarily due to the state funded portion of Measure M projects at American River College (Tech Ed Modernization), Folsom Lake College (New Science Building) and Natomas Center (Phase II and III).

**ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE FUTURE**

During the Covid-19 pandemic, the District (similar to most other districts in the state) experienced a decline in enrollment. As California Community College funding is predominantly based on enrollment, the enrollment declines would have resulted in a painful decrease in funding during the pandemic years. To address this impact the state implemented a hold-harmless funding provision, equal to a District’s 2017-2018 funding level, increased by any Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA). This current hold harmless provision is in place through 2024-2025.

Beginning with 2025-2026, a new hold harmless provision will fund Districts at the greater of their SCFF generated funding or their 2024-2025 funding. An important difference in this revised hold harmless provision is that the hold harmless funding level will remain static and will not be increased by any future COLAs. This will lead to tough decisions for any Districts that are unable to restore and increase their enrollment, as their cost to serve existing students will continue to rise, but their funding level will remain unchanged. Relative to many other districts in the state, the District is in a favorable position from a demographic standpoint, as we have comparably favorable population trends among our feeder high schools as well as in our regional adult population. With this in mind, the District dedicated significant resources to a multi-pronged marketing and outreach program designed to restore its enrollment to pre Covid-19 levels and beyond. Our current daily year-over-year tracking indicates a full restoration, with growth above our pre-pandemic FTES benchmark. The plan is working and the District is optimistic that it will meet its enrollment targets and continue to qualify for available COLAs once the new hold harmless provision goes into effect.

However, while the District remains optimistic about its future funding levels under the Student Centered Funding Formula (SCFF), the state’s ability to sustain this funding is dependent on income and property tax revenues, which are closely tied to economic conditions. According to the UCLA Anderson Forecast, California's GDP growth slowed from 3.7% in 2023 to 2.8% in mid-2024, slightly lagging the national average. Rising unemployment, which reached 5.4% in October 2024, along with sector-specific economic weaknesses, has contributed to this deceleration. Although the forecast anticipates that California’s economy will rebound and grow faster than the national average by 2025 and 2026, driven by technology and aerospace industries, the state’s near-term fiscal health remains vulnerable. This presents some risk to the state’s ability to fully meet its funding commitments, including those under SCFF, especially if economic conditions deteriorate further.

The District is well prepared for such a scenario as it has long practiced a prudent budgeting approach, which leaves it well-positioned to manage this economic uncertainty. This includes maintaining reserves that exceed those required by the California Community College Chancellor’s Office which are designed to allow the District to weather temporary decreases in its funding while maintaining student service levels and commitments to its employee groups.

The District continues to plan thoughtfully for the many challenges ahead and looks forward to the opportunity to expand and enhance access and success for the students, while improving the District’s financial position by systematically addressing pension and other liabilities and making investments in human, physical, and technology resources. Through the support of the Board members, staff, students, and community at large, the District, with its enviable reputation and unique place in the community, remains committed to academic excellence and fiscal stability.

Note 1 - Organization  
Los Rios Community College District (the District) was established on July 1, 1964 and commenced operations on July 1, 1965 as a political subdivision of the State and is a comprehensive, public, two-year institution offering educational services to residents of the surrounding area. The District operates under a locally elected seven-member Board of Trustees form of government, which establishes the policies and procedures by which the District operates. The Board must approve the annual budgets for the General Fund, special revenue funds, and capital project funds, but these budgets are managed at the department level. Currently, the District operates four colleges and six campuses located throughout the areas served in the counties of El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, Solano, and Yolo. While the District is a political subdivision of the State, it is legally separate and is independent of other State and local governments, and it is not a component unit of the State in accordance with the provisions of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The District is classified as a Public Educational Institution under Internal Revenue Code Section 115 and is, therefore, exempt from Federal taxes.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
Financial Reporting Entity  
GASB provides additional guidance to determine whether certain organizations, for which the District is not financially accountable, should be reported as component units based on the nature and significance of their relationship with the District. As defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and established by GASB, the financial reporting entity consists of the District as the primary government, and the Los Rios Colleges Foundation (the Foundation) as a component unit.  

The Foundation is a legally separate, tax-exempt component unit of the District. The Foundation acts primarily as a fundraising organization to provide grants and scholarships to students and support to employees, programs, and departments of the District. The board of the Foundation consists of community members, alumni, and other supporters of the Foundation. Although the District does not control the timing or amount of receipts from the Foundation, the majority of resources, or income thereon that the Foundation holds and invests, are restricted to the activities of the District by the donors. Because these restricted resources held by the Foundation can only be used by, or for the benefit of, the District, the Foundation is considered a component unit of the District with the inclusion of the statements as a discretely presented component unit. Complete financial statements for the Foundation can be obtained from the Foundation’s Business Office at 1919 Spanos Court, Sacramento, CA 95825.

## June 30, 2024

### Basis of Accounting

For financial reporting purposes, the District is considered a special-purpose government engaged only in business-type activities as defined by GASB. This presentation provides a comprehensive government-wide perspective of the District’s assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, deferred inflows of resources, activities, and cash flows and replaces the fund group perspective previously required. Fiduciary activities are excluded from the primary government financial statements. The District’s financial statements have been presented using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. The significant accounting policies followed by the District in preparing these financial statements are in accordance with the District’s policies comply with the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office Budget and Accounting Manual. Under the accrual basis, revenues are recognized when earned, and expenses are recorded when an obligation has been incurred. All material intra-agency and intra-fund transactions have been eliminated.

Revenues resulting from exchange transactions, in which each party gives and receives essentially equal value, is recorded on the accrual basis when the exchange takes place. Available means that the resources will be collected within the current fiscal year or are expected to be collected soon enough thereafter to be used to pay liabilities of the current fiscal year. Operating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of exchange transactions such as student tuition and fees, net of scholarship discounts and allowances, Federal, State, and local grants and contracts, and sales and services of auxiliary enterprises.

Nonexchange transactions, in which the District receives value without directly giving equal value in return are classified as nonoperating revenues. Nonoperating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of nonexchange transactions such as State apportionments, property taxes, investment income, gifts and contributions, and other revenue sources defined by GASB. Property tax revenue is recognized in the fiscal year received. State apportionment revenue is earned based upon criteria set by the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office and includes reporting of full-time equivalent students (FTES) attendance. The corresponding apportionment revenue is recognized in the period the FTES are generated.

Operating expenses include employee salaries and benefits, supplies, operating expenses, and student financial aid. All other expenses not meeting this definition are reported as nonoperating, and include interest expense and other expenses not directly related to the services of the District. Expenses are recorded on the accrual basis as they are incurred, when goods are received, or services are rendered.

Notes to Financial Statements  
June 30, 2024  

The business-type activities model followed by the District requires the following components of the District’s financial statements:

- Management’s Discussion and Analysis
- Basic Financial Statements for the District as a whole including:
  - Statement of Net Position - Primary Government
  - Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position - Primary Government
  - Statement of Cash Flows - Primary Government
- Financial Statements for the Fiduciary Funds including:
  - Statement of Fiduciary Net Position
  - Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position
- Notes to the Financial Statements

**Deposits**  
The District’s deposits are comprised of cash and cash equivalents which are considered to be cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term unrestricted investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Cash equivalents also include unrestricted cash with the Sacramento County Treasury (County Treasury) for purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows. Restricted cash and cash equivalents represent balances restricted by external sources such as grants and contracts or specifically restricted for the repayment of capital debt.

**Investments**  
Investments held at June 30, 2024 are stated at fair value. Fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices at year-end. Short-term investments have an original maturity date greater than three months, but less than one year at time of purchase. Long-term investments have an original maturity of greater than one year at the time of purchase.  

The District’s investments in the County treasury and State Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which is determined by the fair value per share of the underlying portfolios determined by the program sponsors. Positions in these investment pools are not required to be categorized within the fair value hierarchy.

**Accounts Receivable**  
Accounts receivable include amounts due from the Federal, State and/or local governments, or private sources, in connection with reimbursement of allowable expenditures made pursuant to the District’s grants and contracts. Accounts receivable also consist of tuition and fee charges to students and auxiliary enterprise services provided to students, faculty, and staff, the majority of each residing in the State of California. The District provides for an allowance for uncollectible accounts as an estimation of amounts that may not be received. This allowance is based upon management’s estimates and analysis. The allowance was estimated at $1,596,739 for the year ended June 30, 2024.

# Los Rios Community College District
## Notes to Financial Statements
### June 30, 2024

### Prepaid Expenses
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are recorded as prepaid items in the financial statements. The cost of prepaid items is recorded as an expense when consumed rather than when purchased.

### Capital Assets, Depreciation, and Amortization
Capital assets are long-lived assets of the District as a whole and include land, construction in progress, buildings, buildings and land improvements, and equipment. The District maintains an initial unit cost capitalization threshold of $5,000 and an estimated useful life greater than one year. Assets are recorded at historical cost, or estimated historical cost, when purchased or constructed. The District does not possess any infrastructure. Donated capital assets are recorded at fair value or appraised value at the date of donation. Improvements to buildings and land that significantly increase the value or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized; the costs of routine maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially extend an asset’s life are charged as an operating expense in the year in which the expense was incurred. Major outlays for capital improvements are capitalized as construction in progress as the projects are constructed.

Depreciation of capital assets is computed and recorded utilizing the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives of the various classes of depreciable capital assets are as follows: buildings - 50 years, portables - 15 years, land improvements - 10 years, equipment - 8 years, library books - 5 years, and technology equipment - 3 years.

The District records the value of right-to-use subscription IT assets based on the underlying subscription asset in accordance with GASB Statement No. 96, Subscription-Based Information Technology Arrangements. The right-to-use subscription IT asset is amortized each year for the term of the contract or useful life of the underlying asset.

The District records impairments of capital assets when it becomes probable that the carrying value of the assets will not be fully recovered over their estimated useful life. Impairments are recorded to reduce the carrying value of the assets to their net realizable value based on facts and circumstances in existence at the time of the determination. No impairments were recorded during the year ended June 30, 2024.

### Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the Statement of Net Position also reports deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element represents a consumption of net position that applies to a future period and will not be recognized as an expense until then. The District reports deferred outflows of resources related to debt refunding, for OPEB related items, and for pension related items. The deferred outflows of resources related to debt refunding resulted from the difference between the carrying value of the refunded debt and its reacquisition price. The amount is deferred and amortized over the shorter of the life of the refunded or refunding debt. The deferred amounts related to OPEB and pension related items are associated with differences between expected and actual earnings on plan investments, changes of assumptions, and other OPEB and pension related changes.

![Los Rios Community College District Notes to Financial Statements June 30, 2024](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Los+Rios+Community+College+District+Notes+to+Financial+Statements+June+30%2C+2024)

In addition to liabilities, the Statement of Net Position reports a separate section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element represents an acquisition of net position that applies to a future period and so will not be recognized as revenue until then. The District reports deferred inflows of resources for OPEB and pension related items.

### Debt Premiums and Discounts

Debt premiums and discounts are amortized over the life of the bonds using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. All other bond issuance costs are expensed when incurred.

### Compensated Absences and Load Banking

Accumulated unpaid employee vacation benefits are accrued as a liability as the benefits are earned. The entire compensated absence liability is reported on the government-wide financial statements. The current portion of unpaid compensated absences is recognized upon the occurrence of relevant events such as employee resignation and retirements that occur prior to year end and that have not yet been paid within the fund from which the employees who have accumulated the leave are paid. The District also participates in “load banking” with eligible academic employees whereby the employee may teach extra courses in one period in exchange for time off in another period. The liability for this benefit is reported on the government-wide financial statements.

Sick leave is accumulated without limit for each employee based upon negotiated contracts. Leave with pay is provided when employees are absent for health reasons; however, the employees do not gain a vested right to accumulated sick leave. Employees are never paid for any sick leave balance at termination of employment or any other time. Therefore, the value of accumulated sick leave is not recognized as a liability in the District’s financial statements. However, retirement credit for unused sick leave is applicable to all classified school members who retire after January 1, 1999. At retirement, each member will receive 0.004 year of service credit for each day of unused sick leave. Retirement credit for unused sick leave is applicable to all academic employees and is determined by dividing the number of unused sick days by the number of base service days required to complete the last school year, if employed full time.

### Subscription-based IT Arrangements

The District recognizes a subscription-based IT arrangement liability and an intangible right-to-use subscription IT asset (subscription IT asset) in the government-wide financial statements. The District measures the subscription-based IT arrangement liability at the present value of payments expected to be made during the subscription term. Subsequently, the subscription-based IT arrangement liability is reduced by the principal portion of subscription payments made. The right-to-use subscription IT asset is initially measured as the initial amount of the subscription-based IT arrangement liability, plus certain initial direct costs. Subsequently, the right-to-use subscription IT asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the subscription term or useful life of the underlying asset.

**Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions (OPEB)**

For purposes of measuring the net OPEB liability/asset, deferred outflows/inflows of resources related to OPEB, and OPEB expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the District Plan and the CalSTRS Medicare Premium Payment (MPP) Program and additions to/deductions from fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the District Plan and the MPP. For this purpose, the District Plan and the MPP recognize benefit payments when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value, except for money market investments and participating interest-earning investment contracts that have a maturity at the time of purchase of one year or less, which are reported at cost. The total OPEB liability attributable to the governmental activities will be paid primarily by the General Fund.

**Pensions**

For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows/inflows of resources related to pensions and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the California State Teachers Retirement System (CalSTRS) and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) plan for schools (Plans) and additions to/deductions from the Plans’ fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by CalSTRS and CalPERS. For this purpose, benefit payments (including funds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Member contributions are recognized in the period in which they are earned. Investments are reported at fair value. The aggregate net pension liability attributable to the governmental activities will be paid primarily by the fund in which the employee worked.

**Unearned Revenue**

Unearned revenues arise when resources are received by the District before it has a legal claim to them, such as when certain grants are received prior to the occurrence of qualifying expenditures. In the subsequent periods, when the District has a legal claim to the resources, the liability for unearned revenue is removed from the statement of net position and the revenue is recognized. Unearned revenue is primarily composed of (1) amounts received for tuition and fees prior to the end of the fiscal year that are related to the subsequent fiscal year, and (2) amounts received from Federal and State grants received before the eligibility requirements are met.

**Net Position**

Net position represents the difference between assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and deferred inflows of resources. Net position is classified according to imposed restrictions or availability of assets for satisfaction of District obligations according to the following net position categories:

Net Investment in Capital Assets consists of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization and outstanding principal balances of debt attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets. To the extent debt has been incurred, but not yet expended for capital assets, such accounts are not included as a component invested in capital assets.

**Restricted:** Net position is reported as restricted when there are limitations imposed on their use, either through enabling legislation adopted by the District, or through external restrictions imposed by creditors, grantors, or laws or regulations of other governments. The District first applies restricted resources when an expense is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted resources are available. None of the District’s restricted net position has resulted from enabling legislation adopted by the District.

**Unrestricted:** Net position that is not subject to externally imposed constraints. Unrestricted net position may be designated for specific purposes by action of the Board of Trustees or may otherwise be limited by contractual agreements with outside parties.

When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the District’s practice to use restricted resources first and the unrestricted resources when they are needed.

The Statement of Net Position – Primary Government report $102,540,601 of restricted net position, and the fiduciary funds financial statements report $161,635,698 of restricted net position.

**State Apportionments**

Certain current year apportionments from the State are based on financial and statistical information of the previous year. Any corrections due to the recalculation of the apportionment are made in February of the subsequent year and recorded in the District’s financial records when received. When known and measurable, these recalculations and corrections are accrued in the year in which the FTES are generated.

**Property Taxes**

Secured property taxes attach as an enforceable lien on property as of January 1. The County Assessor is responsible for assessment of all taxable real property. Taxes are payable in two installments on November 1 and February 1 and become delinquent on December 10 and April 10, respectively. Unsecured property taxes are payable in one installment on or before August 31. The Counties of El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, Solano, and Yolo bill and collect the taxes on behalf of the District. Local property tax revenues are recorded when received.

**Scholarship Discounts and Allowances**

Tuition and fee revenue is reported net of scholarship discounts and allowances. Fee waivers approved by the California Community College Board of Governors are included within the scholarship discounts and allowances in the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position. Scholarship discounts and allowances represent the difference between stated charges for enrollment fees and the amount that is paid by students or third parties making payments on the students’ behalf.

**Federal Financial Assistance Programs**

The District participates in federally funded Pell Grants, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG), and Federal Work-Study programs, as well as other programs funded by the Federal government and State of California. Financial aid to students is either reported as operating expenses or scholarship allowances, which reduce revenues. The amount reported as operating expense represents the portion of aid that was provided to the student in the form of cash. Scholarship allowances represent the portion of aid provided to students in the form of reduced tuition. These programs are audited in accordance with Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards.

**Estimates**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and those differences could be material.

**Note 3 - Deposits and Investments**

**Policies and Practices**

The District is authorized under California Government Code to make direct investments in local agency bonds, notes, or warrants within the State; U.S. Treasury instruments; registered State warrants or treasury notes; securities of the U.S. Government, or its agencies; bankers acceptances; commercial paper; certificates of deposit placed with commercial banks and/or savings and loan companies; repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements; medium term corporate notes; shares of beneficial interest issued by diversified investment companies, certificates of participation, obligations with first priority security; and collateralized mortgage obligations.

**Investment in County Treasury** - In accordance with the Budget and Accounting Manual, the District maintains substantially all of its cash in the County Treasury as part of the common investment pool. The District is considered to be an involuntary participant in an external investment pool. The fair value of the District’s investment in the pool is reported in the accompanying financial statements at amounts based upon the District’s pro-rata share of the fair value provided by the County Treasurer for the entire portfolio (in relation to the amortized cost of that portfolio). The balance available for withdrawal is based on the accounting records maintained by the County Treasurer, which is recorded on the amortized cost basis.

**Investment in the State Investment Pool** - The District is a voluntary participant in the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) that is regulated by California Government Code Section 16429 under the oversight of the Treasurer of the State of California. The fair value of the District’s investment in the pool is reported in the accompanying financial statements at amounts based upon the District’s pro-rata share of the fair value provided by LAIF for the entire LAIF portfolio (in relation to the amortized cost of that portfolio). The balance available for withdrawal is based on the accounting records maintained by LAIF, which is recorded on the amortized cost basis.

The investment policy for GO bonds is set forth in the bond indenture, which are limited to those authorized by California Government Code Section 53061 et seq. The County’s own investment policies may impose additional limitations beyond those required by Government Code.

### Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Generally, the longer the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value to changes in market interest rates. The District does not have a formal investment policy that limits investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. The District manages its exposure to interest rate risk by investing in the County Treasury Pool, LAIF, Government-sponsored enterprise notes, mutual funds, and other investments.

### Segmented Time Distribution

Information about the sensitivity of the fair values of the investments to market interest rate fluctuations is provided by the following schedule that shows the distribution of the investments by maturity:

| Investment Type                        | Fair Value         | Maturity in Years |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
|                                        |                    | 1-5               | >5                |
| Government-sponsored enterprise notes   | $ 99,270,162       | $ 99,270,162      | -                 |
| County Treasury pool                   | 744,413,287        | 744,413,287       | -                 |
| State Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF)| 5,552,971         | 5,552,971         | -                 |
| **Total**                              | **$ 849,236,420**  | **$ 849,236,420** | -                 |

The District’s investments in mutual funds do not have a maturity.

**Credit Risk**

Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment. This is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. Presented below is the minimum rating required by the California Government Code, the investment policy, or debt agreements, and the actual rating as of the year-end for each investment type.

| Investment Type                          | Fair Value     | Credit Rating |
|------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Government-sponsored enterprise notes     | $ 99,270,162   | AA+           |
| Mutual funds                              | 160,720,356    | Not rated     |
| Money market funds                        | 161,597        | Not rated     |
| County Treasury pool                     | 744,413,287    | Not rated     |
| State Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) | 5,552,971      | Not rated     |
| **Total**                                | **$ 1,010,118,373** |               |

**Concentration of Credit Risk**

The investment policy of the District contains no limitations on the amount that can be invested in any one issuer beyond the amount stipulated by the California Government Code. At June 30, 2024, no investments in a single issuer represented 5% or more of the total investments.

**Custodial Credit Risk – Deposits**

This is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the District’s deposits may not be returned to it. The District does not have a policy for custodial credit risk for deposits. However, the California Government Code requires that a financial institution secure deposits made by State or local governmental units by pledging securities in an undivided collateral pool held by a depository regulated under State law (unless so waived by the governmental unit). The market value of the pledged securities in the collateral pool must equal at least 110% of the total amount deposited by the public agency. California law also allows financial institutions to secure public deposits by pledging first trust deed mortgage notes having a value of 150% of the secured public deposits and letters of credit issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco having a value of 105% of the secured deposits.

As of June 30, 2024, District bank balances of approximately $36 million were exposed to custodial credit risk because they were uninsured and collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institution’s trust department or agent, but not in the name of the District.

**Note 4 - Fair Value Measurements**

The District categorizes the fair value measurements of its investments based on the hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value hierarchy, which has three levels, is based on the valuation inputs used to measure an asset’s fair value. The following provides a summary of the hierarchy used to measure fair value:

- **Level 1** - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the District has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 1 assets may include debt and equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market and that are

**Subscription-Based IT Arrangement (SBITA)**

The District entered into an SBITA for the use of Salesforce software. At June 30, 2024, the District has recognized a right-to-use subscription IT asset, net of accumulated amortization of $2,056,668 and a SBITA liability of $2,001,932 related to this agreement. During the fiscal year, the District recorded $514,167 in amortization expense. As the annual payments of $568,903 are due at the beginning of each contract year, the District did not recognize any interest expense during the initial year of the contract and the entire amount paid was applied to the principal balance of the SBITA obligation. The District used a discount rate of 5.33% based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as of the contract inception date of August 1, 2023, which approximates the District’s estimated incremental borrowing rate for financing over a similar time period.

The remaining principal and interest payment requirements for the SBITA obligation debt as of June 30, 2024, are as follows:

| Fiscal Year | Principal | Interest | Total |
|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 2025        | $ 462,200 | $ 106,703| $ 568,903 |
| 2026        | 486,835   | 82,068   | 568,903 |
| 2027        | 512,783   | 56,119   | 568,902 |
| 2028        | 540,114   | 28,788   | 568,902 |
| **Total**   | **$ 2,001,932** | **$ 273,678** | **$ 2,275,610** |

**Note 9 - Net Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB) Liability (Asset)**

For the year ended June 30, 2024, the District reported net OPEB liability (asset), deferred outflows of resources, deferred inflows of resources, and OPEB expense for the following plans:

| OPEB Plan | Aggregate Net OPEB Liability (Asset) | Deferred Outflows of Resources | Deferred Inflows of Resources | OPEB Expense |

### Actuarial Assumptions

The total OPEB liability in the June 30, 2023 actuarial valuation was determined using the following actuarial methods and assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement, unless otherwise specified:

- **Valuation date**: June 30, 2023
- **Measurement date**: June 30, 2023
- **Funding method**: Entry-age normal cost, level percent of pay
- **Asset valuation method**: Market value of assets

#### Actuarial assumptions:
- **Discount rate**: 5.75%
- **General inflation rate**: 2.50%
- **Salary increases** (1): 3.00%
- **Long-term return on assets** (2): 5.75%
- **Health care cost trends rates**: 6.5% in 2025, decreasing to 3.90% by 2076
- **Mortality**: CalPERS 2021 study; CalSTRS 2024 Study
- **Mortality improvement**: MacLeod Watts Scale 2022

(1) Since benefits do not depend on salary, this is only used to allocate the costs of benefits between service years.  
(2) Net of Plan investment expense; includes inflation.

The long-term expected rate of return on the OPEB Plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of the OPEB Plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighing the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and added expected inflation. Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return included in the target asset allocation as of June 30, 2023 are summarized in the following table:

| Portfolio Mix | Long-Term Expected Real Rate of Return |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1-Year        | 5.97%                                 |
| 3-Year        | 5.82%                                 |
| 5-Year        | 5.79%                                 |
| 10-Year       | 5.77%                                 |
| 20-Year       | 5.76%                                 |

## Notes to Financial Statements
### June 30, 2024

### Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total OPEB liability was 5.75%. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that the District continues to make regular, sufficient contributions to the OPEB Trust in order to prefund the total OPEB liability. Based on those assumptions, the OPEB Plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current OPEB Plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on OPEB Plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total OPEB liability.

### Changes in the Net OPEB Liability (Asset)

### Medicare Premium Payment (MPP) Program

**Plan Description**

The Medicare Premium Payment (MPP) Program is administered by the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS). The MPP Program is a cost-sharing multiple-employer other postemployment benefit plan (OPEB) established pursuant to Chapter 1032, Statutes 2000 (SB 1435). CalSTRS administers the MPP Program through the Teachers’ Health Benefits Fund (THBF).

A full description of the MPP Program regarding benefit provisions, assumptions (for funding, but not accounting purposes), and membership information is listed in the June 30, 2022 annual actuarial valuation report, Medicare Premium Payment Program Actuarial Valuation. This report and CalSTRS audited financial information are publicly available reports that can be found on the CalSTRS website under Publications at: http://www.calstrs.com/member-publications.

**Benefits Provided**

The MPP Program pays Medicare Part A premiums and Medicare Parts A and B late enrollment surcharges for eligible members of the State Teachers Retirement Plan (STRP) Defined Benefit (DB) Program who were retired or began receiving a disability allowance prior to July 1, 2012 and were not eligible for premium free Medicare Part A. The payments are made directly to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on a monthly basis.

The MPP Program is closed to new entrants as members who retire after July 1, 2012, are not eligible for coverage under the MPP Program.
<!-- Page 49 -->
![Los Rios Community College District Notes to Financial Statements June 30, 2024](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Los+Rios+Community+College+District+Notes+to+Financial+Statements+June+30%2C+2024)

The MPP Program is funded on a pay-as-you go basis from a portion of monthly District benefit payments. In accordance with California Education Code Section 25930, contributions that would otherwise be credited to the DB Program each month are instead credited to the MPP Program to fund monthly program and administrative costs. Total redirections to the MPP Program are monitored to ensure that total incurred costs do not exceed the amount initially identified as the cost of the program.

**Net OPEB Liability and OPEB Expense**

At June 30, 2024, the District reported a liability of $970,886 for its proportionate share of the net OPEB liability for the MPP Program. The net OPEB liability was measured as of June 30, 2023, and the total OPEB liability used to calculate the net OPEB liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2022. The District’s proportion of the net OPEB liability was based on a projection of the District’s long-term share of contributions to the OPEB Plan relative to the projected contributions of all participating entities, actuarially determined. The District’s proportionate share for the measurement periods of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, was 0.3347%, respectively, resulting in a net decrease of 0.0147% in the proportionate share.

For the year ended June 30, 2024, the District recognized OPEB expense of ($131,584).

**Actuarial Methods and Assumptions**

The June 30, 2023 total OPEB liability was determined by applying update procedures to the financial reporting actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2022, and rolling forward the total OPEB liability to June 30, 2023, using the assumptions listed in the following table:

| Measurement Date | June 30, 2023 |
|------------------|----------------|
| Valuation Date    | June 30, 2022 |
| Experience Study   | July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2018 |
| Actuarial Cost Method | Entry age normal |
| Investment Rate of Return | 3.65% |
| Medicare Part A Premium Cost Trend Rate | 4.50% |
| Medicare Part B Premium Cost Trend Rate | 5.40% |

For the valuation as of June 30, 2022, CalSTRS uses a generational mortality assumption, which involves the use of a base mortality table and projection scales to reflect expected annual reductions in mortality rates at each age, resulting in increases in life expectancies each year into the future. The base mortality tables are CalSTRS custom tables derived to best fit the patterns of mortality among members. The projection scale was set equal to 110% of the ultimate improvement factor from the Mortality Improvement Scale (MP-2019) table, issued by the Society of Actuaries.
<!-- Page 50 -->
![Los Rios Community College District](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Los+Rios+Community+College+District)

**Notes to Financial Statements**  
**June 30, 2024**

Assumptions were made about future participation (enrollment) into the MPP Program because CalSTRS is unable to determine which members not currently participating meet all eligibility criteria for enrollment in the future. Assumed enrollment rates were derived based on past experience and are stratified by age with the probability of enrollment diminishing as the members’ age increases. This estimated enrollment rate was then applied to the population of members who may meet criteria necessary for eligibility and are not currently enrolled in the MPP Program. Based on this, the estimated number of future enrollments used in the financial reporting valuation was 179 or an average of 0.13% of the potentially eligible population (138,780).

The MPP Program is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis with contributions generally being made at the same time and in the same amount as benefit payments and expenses coming due. Any funds within the MPP Program as of June 30, 2023, were to manage differences between estimated and actual amounts to be paid and were invested in the Surplus Money Investment Fund, which is a pooled investment program administered by the State Treasurer.

**Discount Rate**

As the MPP Program is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, the OPEB plan’s fiduciary net position was not projected to be sufficient to make projected future benefit payments. Therefore, the MPP Program used the Bond Buyer’s 20-Bond GO Index from Bondbuyer.com as of June 30, 2023, as the discount rate, which was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to measure the total OPEB liability. The discount rate as of June 30, 2023, was 3.65%, which is an increase of 0.11% from 3.54% as of June 30, 2022.

**Sensitivity of the District’s Proportionate Share of the Net OPEB Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate**

The following presents the District’s proportionate share of the net OPEB liability calculated using the current discount rate, as well as what the net OPEB liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is one percent lower or higher than the current rate:

| Discount Rate | Net OPEB Liability |
|---------------|---------------------|
| 1% decrease (2.65%) | $ 1,055,153 |
| Current discount rate (3.65%) | $ 970,886 |
| 1% increase (4.65%) | $ 897,615 |

### Sensitivity of the District’s Proportionate Share of the Net OPEB Liability to Changes in the Medicare Costs Trend Rates

The following presents the District’s proportionate share of the net OPEB liability calculated using the current Medicare costs trend rates, as well as what the net OPEB liability would be if it were calculated using Medicare costs trend rates that are one percent lower or higher than the current rates:

| Medicare Costs Trend Rates | Net OPEB Liability |
|----------------------------|--------------------|
| 1% decrease (3.50% Part A and 4.40% Part B) | $ 893,311 |
| Current Medicare costs trend rates (4.50% Part A and 5.40% Part B) | $ 970,886 |
| 1% increase (5.50% Part A and 6.40% Part B) | $ 1,058,465 |

### Note 10 - Risk Management

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of assets; errors and omissions; injuries to employees; and natural disasters.

The District participates in Statewide Association of Community Colleges (SWACC), a risk pooling solution, for excess coverage at a Member Retained Limit (MRL) of $250,000 per occurrence for property and $1,000,000 per occurrence for liability. The District self-insures its property claims up to $100,000 per occurrence and liability claims up to $250,000 per occurrence. SWACC pools for the first $250,000 of a property loss including the MRL and purchases reinsurance for property claims up to $235,000,000 in excess of $15,250,000. SWACC pools for the first $1,000,000 of a liability loss including the MRL and purchases reinsurance for liability claims up to $24 million in excess of $1 million including member’s MRL. SWACC also offers members of the program an additional $25 million in excess liability coverage for excess liability limits to $50 million. The District is self-insured for workers’ compensation claims on the first $500,000 of each claim.

SWACC also provides for additional insurance and risk management programs and services as well as a forum for discussion, study, development, and implementation of recommendations of mutual interest regarding self insurance for losses and other insurance and risk management programs and services.

### Workers’ Compensation

The District is self-insured for workers’ compensation claims on the first $500,000 of each claim. Coverage in excess of self-insurance limits for workers’ compensation is purchased through an insurance broker.

### Claims Liabilities

The District records an estimated liability for indemnity torts and other claims against the District. Claims liabilities are based on estimates of the ultimate costs of reported claims (including future claim adjustment expenses) and an estimate for claims incurred, but not reported based on historical experience.

The details of each plan are as follows:

**California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS)**

**CalSTRS Plan Description**

The District contributes to the State Teachers’ Retirement Plan (STRP) administered by CalSTRS. STRP is a cost-sharing multiple-employer public employee retirement system defined benefit pension plan. Benefit provisions are established by State statutes, as legislatively amended, within the State Teachers’ Retirement Law.

A full description of the pension plan regarding benefit provisions, assumptions (for funding, but not accounting purposes), and membership information is listed in the June 30, 2022, annual actuarial valuation report, Defined Benefit Program Actuarial Valuation. This report and CalSTRS audited financial information are publicly available reports that can be found on the CalSTRS website under Publications at: [http://www.calstrs.com/member-publications](http://www.calstrs.com/member-publications).

**CalSTRS Benefits Provided**

The STRP provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to beneficiaries. Benefits are based on members’ final compensation, age, and years of service credit. Members hired on or before December 31, 2012, with five years of credited service are eligible for the normal retirement benefit at age 60. Members hired on or after January 1, 2013, with five years of credited service are eligible for the normal retirement benefit at age 62. The normal retirement benefit is equal to 2.0% of final compensation for each year of credited service.

The STRP is comprised of four programs: Defined Benefit Program, Defined Benefit Supplement Program, Cash Balance Benefit Program, and Replacement Benefits Program. The STRP holds assets for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to members and beneficiaries of these programs. CalSTRS also uses plan assets to defray reasonable expenses of administering the STRP. Although CalSTRS is the administrator of the STRP, the State is the sponsor of the STRP and obligor of the trust. In addition, the State is both an employer and nonemployer contributing entity to the STRP.

The District contributes exclusively to the STRP Defined Benefit Program; thus disclosures are not included for the other plans.

The STRP provisions and benefits in effect at June 30, 2024, are summarized as follows:

| Hire date                     | On or before December 31, 2012 | On or after January 1, 2013 |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Benefit formula               | 2% at 60                        | 2% at 62                     |
| Benefit vesting schedule      | 5 years of service              | 5 years of service           |
| Benefit payments              | Monthly for life                | Monthly for life             |

**CalSTRS Contributions**

Required member, District, and State of California contribution rates are set by the California Legislature and Governor and are detailed in Teachers’ Retirement Law. The contribution rates are expressed as a level percentage of payroll using the entry age normal actuarial method. In accordance with California Assembly Bill 1469, employer contributions into the CalSTRS were to increase to a total of 19.1% of applicable member earnings phased over a seven-year period. The contribution rates for each plan for the year ended June 30, 2024, are presented above, and the District’s total contributions were $29,291,858.

**CalSTRS Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions**

At June 30, 2024, the District reported a liability for its proportionate share of the net pension liability that reflected a reduction for State pension support provided to the District. The amount recognized by the District as its proportionate share of the net pension liability, the related State support, and the total portion of the net pension liability that was associated with the District were as follows:

Total net pension liability, including State share:

- District's proportionate share of net pension liability: $164,750,361
- State's proportionate share of net pension liability associated with the District: $78,936,531

**Total:** $243,686,892

The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2023. The District’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on a projection of the District’s long-term share of contributions to the pension plan relative to the projected contributions of all participating college districts and the State, actuarially determined. The District’s proportionate share for the measurement periods of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, was 0.2163% and 0.2230%, respectively, resulting in a net decrease of 0.0067% in the proportionate share.

For the year ended June 30, 2024, the District recognized pension expense of $18,162,269. In addition, the District recognized pension expense and revenue of $10,737,549 for support provided by the State. At June 30, 2024, the District reported deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions from the following sources:

| Deferred Outflows of Resources | Deferred Inflows of Resources |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Pension contributions subsequent to measurement date | $ 29,291,858 | $ - |
| Change in proportion and differences between contributions made and District's proportionate share of contributions | 8,384,697 | 24,157,745 |
| Differences between projected and actual earnings on pension plan investments | 705,198 | - |
| Differences between expected and actual experience in the measurement of the total pension liability | 12,946,664 | 8,814,981 |
| Changes of assumptions | 953,965 | - |
| **Total** | **$ 52,282,382** | **$ 32,972,726** |

The deferred outflows of resources related to pensions resulting from District contributions subsequent to the measurement date will be recognized as a reduction of the net pension liability in the subsequent fiscal year.

The deferred inflows of resources related to the difference between projected and actual earning on pension plan investments will be amortized over a closed five-year period and will be recognized in pension expense as follows:

| Year Ended June 30, | Deferred Outflows/(Inflows) of Resources |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 2025                 | $ (5,183,172)                           |

The deferred outflow/(inflows) of resources related to the change in proportion and differences between contributions made and District’s proportionate share of contributions, differences between expected and actual experience in the measurement of the total pension liability, and changes of assumptions will be amortized over the Expected Average Remaining Service Life (EARSL) of all members that are provided benefits (active, inactive, and retirees) as of the beginning of the measurement period. The EARSL for the measurement period is seven years and will be recognized in pension expense as follows:

| **Total**            | $ (10,687,400)                          |

**CalSTRS Actuarial Methods and Assumptions**

Total pension liability for STRP was determined by applying update procedures to a financial reporting actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2022, and rolling forward the total pension liability to June 30, 2023. The financial reporting actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2022, used the following methods and assumptions, applied to all prior periods included in the measurement:

- **Valuation date:** June 30, 2022
- **Measurement date:** June 30, 2023
- **Experience study:** July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2018
- **Actuarial cost method:** Entry age normal
- **Discount rate:** 7.10%
- **Investment rate of return:** 7.10%
- **Consumer price inflation:** 2.75%
- **Wage growth:** 3.50%

CalSTRS uses a generational mortality assumption, which involves the use of a base mortality table and projection scales to reflect expected annual reductions in mortality rates at each age, resulting in increases in life expectancies each year into the future. The base mortality tables are CalSTRS custom tables derived to best fit the patterns of mortality among its members. The projection scale was set equal to 110% of the ultimate improvement factor from the Mortality Improvement Scale (MP-2019) table, issued by the Society of Actuaries.

**Notes to Financial Statements**  
**June 30, 2024**

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. The best estimate ranges were developed using capital market assumptions from CalSTRS general investment consultant as an input to the process. The actuarial investment rate of return assumption was adopted by the board in January 2020 in conjunction with the most recent experience study. For each current and future valuation, CalSTRS’ independent consulting actuary (Milliman) reviews the return assumption for reasonableness based on the most current capital market assumptions. Best estimates of expected 20-year geometrically-linked real rates of return and the assumed asset allocation for each major asset class for the year ended June 30, 2023, are summarized in the following table:

| Asset Class               | Assumed Asset Allocation | Long-Term Expected Real Rate of Return |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Public equity            | 38%                     | 5.25%                                 |
| Real estate              | 15%                     | 4.05%                                 |
| Private equity           | 14%                     | 6.75%                                 |
| Fixed income             | 14%                     | 2.45%                                 |
| Risk mitigating strategies| 10%                     | 2.25%                                 |
| Inflation sensitive      | 7%                      | 3.65%                                 |
| Cash/liquidity           | 2%                      | 0.05%                                 |

**CalSTRS Discount Rate**

The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.10%. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed the contributions from plan members and employers will be made at statutory contribution rates. Projected inflows from investment earnings were calculated using the long-term assumed investment rate of return (7.10%) and assuming that contributions, benefit payments, and administrative expense occurred midyear. Based on these assumptions, the STRP’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments to current plan members. Therefore, the long-term assumed investment rate of return was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine total pension liability.

The following presents the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability calculated using the current discount rate, as well as what the net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is one percent lower or higher than the current rate:

| Discount Rate            | Net Pension Liability    |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1% decrease (6.10%)     | $ 276,355,584           |
| Current discount rate (7.10%) | $ 164,750,361       |
| 1% increase (8.10%)     | $ 72,049,215            |

# California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS)

## CalPERS Plan Description

Qualified employees are eligible to participate in the School Employer Pool (SEP) under CalPERS, a cost-sharing multiple-employer public employee retirement system defined benefit pension plan administered by CalPERS. Benefit provisions are established by State statutes, as legislatively amended, within the Public Employees’ Retirement Law.

A full description of the pension plan regarding benefit provisions, assumptions (for funding, but not accounting purposes), and membership information is listed in the June 30, 2022, annual actuarial valuation report, Schools Pool Actuarial Valuation. This report and CalPERS audited financial information are publicly available reports that can be found on the CalPERS website under Forms and Publications at: [CalPERS Forms and Publications](https://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/forms-publications).

## CalPERS Benefits Provided

CalPERS provides service retirement and disability benefits, annual cost of living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members who must be public employees and beneficiaries. Benefits are based on years of service credit, a benefit factor, and the member’s final compensation. Members hired on or before December 31, 2012, with five years of total service are eligible to retire at age 50 with statutorily reduced benefits. Members hired on or after January 1, 2013, with five years of total service are eligible to retire at age 52 with statutorily reduced benefits. All members are eligible for non-duty disability benefits after five years of service. The Basic Death Benefit is paid to any member’s beneficiary if the member dies while actively employed. An employee’s eligible survivor may receive the 1957 Survivor Benefit if the member dies while actively employed, is at least age 50 (or age 52 for members hired on or after January 1, 2013), and has at least five years of credited service.

## CalPERS Contributions

Section 20814(c) of the California Public Employees’ Retirement Law requires that the employer contribution rates for all public employers be determined on an annual basis by the actuary and shall be effective on July 1 following notice of a change in the rate. Total plan contributions are calculated through the CalPERS annual actuarial valuation process. The actuarially determined rate is the estimated amount necessary to finance the costs of benefits earned by employees during the year, with an additional amount to finance any unfunded accrued liability. The District is required to contribute the difference between the actuarially determined rate and the contribution rate of employees. The contribution rates are expressed as a percentage of annual payroll. The contribution rates for each plan for the year ended June 30, 2024, are presented above, and the total District contributions were $27,012,588.

## CalPERS Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions

As of June 30, 2024, the District reported net pension liabilities for its proportionate share of the CalPERS net pension liability totaling $186,915,409. The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2023. The District’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on a projection of the District’s long-term share of contributions to the pension plan relative to the projected contributions of all participating colleges districts, actuarially determined. The District’s proportionate share for the measurement periods of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, was 0.5164 % and 0.5424%, respectively, resulting in a net decrease in the proportionate share of 0.0260%.

For the year ended June 30, 2024, the District recognized pension expense of $24,038,126. At June 30, 2024, the District reported deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions from the following sources:

# CalPERS Actuarial Methods and Assumptions

Total pension liability for the SEP was determined by applying updated procedures to a financial reporting actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2022, and rolling forward the total pension liability to June 30, 2023. The financial reporting actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2022, used the following methods and assumptions, applied to all prior periods included in the measurement:

| Valuation date                | June 30, 2022               |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Measurement date              | June 30, 2023               |
| Experience study              | July 1, 1997 through June 30, 2015 |
| Actuarial cost method         | Entry age normal             |
| Discount rate                 | 6.90%                        |
| Investment rate of return     | 6.90%                        |
| Consumer price inflation       | 2.30%                        |
| Wage growth                   | Varies by entry age and service |

The mortality table used was developed based on CalPERS-specific data. The rates incorporate Generational Mortality to capture ongoing mortality improvement using 80% of Scale MP-2020 published by the Society of Actuaries.

In determining the long-term expected rate of return, CalPERS took into account long-term market return expectations as well as the expected pension fund cash flows. Projected returns for all asset classes are estimated and, combined with risk estimates, are used to project compound (geometric) returns over the long term. The discount rate used to discount liabilities was informed by the long-term projected portfolio return. The target asset allocation and best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class are summarized in the following table:

| Asset Class                          | Assumed Asset Allocation | Long-Term Expected Real Rate of Return |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Global equity - cap-weighted         | 30%                     | 4.54%                                 |
| Global equity - non-cap-weighted     | 12%                     | 3.84%                                 |
| Private equity                        | 13%                     | 7.28%                                 |

**CalPERS Discount Rate**

The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 6.90%. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed the contributions from plan members and employers will be made at the current member contribution rates and that contributions from employers will be made at statutorily required rates, actuarially determined. Based on these assumptions, the School Employer Pool fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments to current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on the School Employer Pool investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine total pension liability.

The following presents the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability calculated using the current discount rate, as well as what the net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is one percent lower or higher than the current rate:

| Discount Rate         | Net Pension Liability |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| 1% decrease (5.90%)   | $ 270,231,367       |
| Current discount rate (6.90%) | $ 186,915,409       |
| 1% increase (7.90%)   | $ 118,056,666       |

**On Behalf Payments**

The State of California makes contributions to CalSTRS on behalf of the District. These payments consist of State General Fund contributions to CalSTRS in the amount of $14,715,280 (10.828% of annual payroll). Contributions are no longer appropriated in the annual Budget Act for the legislatively mandated benefits to CalPERS. Therefore, there is no on behalf contribution rate for CalPERS. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, these amounts are to be reported as revenues and expenditures. Accordingly, these amounts have been recorded in these financial statements.

**Tax Deferred Compensation**

As established by Federal law, all public sector employees who are not members of their employer’s existing retirement system (CalSTRS or CalPERS) must be covered by Social Security or an alternative plan. The District has elected to use the Public Agency Retirement Services (PARS) system as its alternative plan.

Los Rios Community College District  
Notes to Financial Statements  
June 30, 2024  

The District offers its employees a Public Agency Retirement System (PARS) administered 457 Deferred Compensation Program (the Program). The Plan participants are individuals employed in certain classified assignments who have worked for the District on or after July 1, 2008, provided that they are not covered by any other retirement program such as CalPERS or CalSTRS through District employment. The Plan requires a contribution of at least 7.5% of wages. The Contribution is split evenly with the employees contributing 3.75% and the District contributing 3.75%. The plan results in savings for both employees and the District. The District’s contribution to the Plan for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 was $434,858. Accounts are established in the name of each participant. Contributions are allocated directly to employee accounts. Participant account balances are fully vested and non-forfeitable. Participant account balances will be paid in a single distribution or direct rollover to another eligible retirement plan designated by the participant upon retirement or other termination. PARS issues a separate comprehensive annual financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information. Copies of the PARS annual financial report may be obtained from PARS, 5141 California Avenue, Suite 150, Irvine, California 92617-3069.

The District also contributes to the Los Rios Community College District 403(b) Tax Deferred Annuity Plan (TDA), which is a defined contribution pension plan. A defined contribution pension plan provides pension benefits in return for services rendered, provides an individual account for each participant, and specifies how contributions to the individual’s account are to be determined instead of specifying the amount of benefits the individual is to receive. Under a defined contribution pension plan, the benefits a participant will receive depend solely on the amount contributed to the participant’s account, the returns earned on investments of those contributions, and forfeitures of other participants’ benefits that may be allocated to such participant’s account.

**Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies**

**Grants**  
The District receives financial assistance from Federal and State agencies in the form of grants. The disbursement of funds received under these programs generally requires compliance with terms and conditions specified in the grant agreements and is subject to audit by the grantor agencies. Any disallowed claims resulting from such audits could become a liability of the District. However, in the opinion of management, any such disallowed claims will not have a material adverse effect on the overall financial position of the District at June 30, 2024.

**Litigation**  
The District is involved in various litigation arising from the normal course of business. In the opinion of management and legal counsel, the disposition of all litigation pending is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the overall financial position of the District at June 30, 2024.

**Construction Commitments**

As of June 30, 2024, the District had $100.4 million of commitments with respect to its unfinished capital projects. The projects are funded through a combination of general obligation bonds and capital project apportionments from the California State Chancellor’s Office.

**Lease Revenue Bonds**

The District and the State have entered into financing arrangements under which the State provides funds for the construction of certain facilities. The funds are proceeds from lease revenue bonds issued by the State of California, Public Works Board (the Board). The bonds are a special obligation of the Board payable from State General Fund revenues appropriated to the California Community Colleges Board of Governors who therein made adequate provision in the annual budget of the State for the debt services of such bonds. However, in the unlikely event that the State is unable to pay the semi-annual installment payment, the District would be responsible for the payments attributable to the District’s facilities. No amounts had been accrued for any contingent payments at June 30, 2024.

These facilities are included in the District’s capital assets on the Statement of Net Position. The Board leases the facilities contributed with these bonds to the District. Upon full repayment of the associated bonds, title to the facilities conveys to the District. The following facilities that were constructed under the provisions described above and have minimum annual payments remaining at June 30, 2024 were as follows:

| Facility                                   | Bond Debt Service Period | Proceeds from State | Funding Year | Minimum Annual Debt Service Payments |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| Folsom Lake College Instructional Facilities IB | 2005-2030                | $36,841,000         | 2001-02      | $809,709 to $2,499,000             |

**Note 13 - Subsequent Events**

On August 20, 2024, the District issued $56,590,000 of 2024 General Obligation Bonds Refunding Bonds, Series A and B with final maturities of August 1, 2026 and August 1, 2027, respectively. The bonds carry an interest rate of 5.00%. Interest is payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year.

**Note 1 - Purpose of Schedules**

**District Organization**  
This schedule provides information about the District’s governing board members, administration members, and auxiliary organizations in good standing as of June 30, 2024.

**Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards**  
**Basis of Presentation**  
The accompanying Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (the Schedule) includes the federal award activity of the District under programs of the federal government for the year ended June 30, 2024. The information is presented in accordance with the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Because the Schedule presents only a selected portion of the operations of the District, it is not intended to and does not present the financial position, changes in net position, or cash flows of the District.

**Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**  
Expenditures reported in the Schedule are reported on the modified accrual basis of accounting. When applicable, such expenditures are recognized following the cost principles contained in the Uniform Guidance, wherein certain types of expenditures are not allowable or are limited as to reimbursement. No federal financial assistance has been provided to a subrecipient.

**Indirect Cost Rate**  
The District has not elected to use the 10% de minimis cost rate.

**Schedule of Expenditures of State Awards**  
The accompanying Schedule of Expenditures of State Awards includes the State grant activity of the District and is presented on the modified accrual basis of accounting. Therefore, some amounts presented in this schedule may differ from amounts presented in, or used in the preparation of, the financial statements. The information in this schedule is presented to comply with reporting requirements of the California State Chancellor’s Office.

**Schedule of Workload Measures for State General Apportionment Annual (Actual) Attendance**  
FTES is a measurement of the number of pupils attending classes of the District. The purpose of attendance accounting from a fiscal standpoint is to provide the basis on which apportionments of State funds, including restricted categorical funding, are made to community college districts. This schedule provides information regarding the annual attendance measurements of students throughout the District.

**Reconciliation of Education Code Section (ECS) 84362 (50 Percent Law) Calculation**  
ECS 84362 requires the District to expend a minimum of 50% of the unrestricted General Fund monies on salaries of classroom instructors. This is reported annually to the State Chancellor’s Office. This schedule provides a reconciliation of the amount reported to the State Chancellor’s Office and the impact of any audit adjustments and/or corrections noted during the audit.

**Board of Trustees**  
Los Rios Community College District  
Sacramento, California  

We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (Government Auditing Standards), the financial statements of the business-type activities, aggregate discretely presented component units, and fiduciary activities of Los Rios Community College District (the District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s basic financial statements and have issued our report thereon dated December 3, 2024.

**Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting**  

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the District’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that have not been identified.

**Report on Compliance and Other Matters**

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

**Purpose of this Report**

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

![Independent Auditor’s Report on Compliance for the Major Federal Program; Report on Internal Control over Compliance Required by the Uniform Guidance](https://www.eidebailly.com/-/media/eidebailly/images/what-inspires-you-inspires-us-1.png)

**Board of Trustees**  
Los Rios Community College District  
Sacramento, California  

**Report on Compliance for the Major Federal Program**  

**Opinion on the Major Federal Program**  

We have audited Los Rios Community College District’s (the District) compliance with the types of compliance requirements identified as subject to audit in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on the District’s major federal program for the year ended June 30, 2024. The District’s major federal program was identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.  

In our opinion, Los Rios Community College District complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on its major federal program for the year ended June 30, 2024.  

**Basis for Opinion on the Major Federal Program**  

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS); the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (Government Auditing Standards); and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Our responsibilities under those standards and the Uniform Guidance are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.  

We are required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on compliance for the major federal program. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the District’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.

![Responsibilities of Management for Compliance](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Responsibilities+of+Management+for+Compliance)

**Responsibilities of Management for Compliance**

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the District’s federal programs.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the District’s compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the Uniform Guidance will always detect material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material, if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the District’s compliance with the requirements of each major federal program as a whole.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the Uniform Guidance, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the District’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
- Obtain an understanding of the District’s internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identified during the audit.

**Report on Internal Control over Compliance**

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control.

over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section above and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance may exist that were not identified.

Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements listed in the table below has occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the District’s compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the 2023-2024 California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office Contracted District Audit Manual will always detect material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material, if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the District’s compliance with the requirements listed in the table below.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the 2023-2024 California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office Contracted District Audit Manual, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the District’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
- Obtain an understanding of the District’s internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any material noncompliance that we identify during the audit.

## Compliance Requirements Tested

In connection with the audit referred to above, we selected and tested transactions and records to determine the District’s compliance with State laws and regulations applicable to the following:

- Section 411 SCFF Data Management Control Environment
- Section 412 SCFF Supplemental Allocation Metrics
- Section 413 SCFF Success Allocation Metrics
- Section 421 Salaries of Classroom Instructors (50 Percent Law)
