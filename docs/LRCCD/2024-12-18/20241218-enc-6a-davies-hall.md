COBCP - Narrative  
DF-151 (REV 07/21)  

## A. COBCP Abstract:  
Los Rios Community College District, American River College: Davies Hall Replacement Health and Safety Project - $61,033,000 for the state share of preliminary plans, working drawings and construction. The project includes the construction of a replacement building on the current Davies Hall site and associated site costs. The total project costs are estimated at $81,143,000 including preliminary plans $3,271,000 ($2,453,000 state, $818,000 district), working drawings $2,501,000 ($1,876,000 state, $625,000 district), and construction $75,371,000 ($56,704,000 state, $18,667,000 district). The construction amount includes $68,020,000 for construction contract, $3,401,000 for architectural and engineering services, $1,230,000 for tests and inspections, and $1,360,000 for construction management. The current project schedule estimates Preliminary Plans will begin in August 2025 and will be completed in January 2026. The Working Drawings are estimated to begin in January 2026 and will be completed in August 2026. Construction is scheduled to begin in June 2027 and will be completed in September 2029.

## B. Purpose of the Project:  
The California Community Colleges Board of Governors (BOG) has adopted priority funding categories and a scoring system to assist community college districts in their capital planning efforts so that capital outlay project proposals reflect the state’s priorities. The BOG’s priority funding categories give reference to projects that best meet the following priorities: life and safety, growth, and modernization. The proposed project successfully fulfills the BOG’s life and safety priority as a Health and Life Safety project.

Based on 2023-2024 data, American River College has 47,168 students enrolled in its instructional programs, 24,962 (53 percent) of whom are low income. In Fall 2023 American River College had 1,161 full-time equivalent campus employees providing administrative services, student services and instruction. Los Rios Community College District and American River College are located in the greater Sacramento Region (CCD North region), which is not identified as a region of low-performance in the California Community College Vision for Success.

The Los Rios Community College District, American River College Davies Hall Replacement Health and Safety Project will construct a new replacement building on the current Davies Hall site. The new 57,000 Gross Square Foot (GSF) replacement building will house 35,340 Assignable Square Feet (ASF), which is a smaller ASF and a more efficient GSF than the existing building. This is the least cost solution that permanently mitigates the life threatening structural issues, and restores the same uses, primarily instructional and faculty offices. The total ASF includes 20,000 ASF of Classroom, 1,414 ASF of Laboratory, 11,760 ASF of Library, 500 ASF of AV/TV and 942 ASF of Other support space.

### Health and Life Safety Issues  
Davies Hall was constructed using lift slab construction in 1965, a type of construction classified as a DSA Category 2 building. In a letter from DSA to the District dated June 20, 2022, DSA stated that these types of buildings "may be inherently dangerous with the potential for catastrophic failure and progressive collapse if the building is subjected to differential movement (vertical or lateral), changes in loading, or alterations to the structure that it was not designed to withstand." A second letter from DSA received in June 2023 and a third party Structural report commissioned by the District in July 2023 confirmed the building was constructed using lift slab construction and that it does pose a risk to life-safety during a seismic event as identified by DSA, along with some additional safety concerns.

The Bevier Structural Engineering Report dated July 19, 2023, concluded that "the reinforced concrete columns lack proper confinement reinforcement and therefore can fail and collapse from an abrupt"

shear failure. The existing shear walls that are intended to limit the building's lateral distortion lack adequate stiffness and strength and are likely to fail. In doing that, the lit slab collars will then likely induce a punching shear failure in the slab surrounding them and cause a potential “pancake” collapse of the floor and roof slabs.  

The Bevier Structural Engineering Report also outlined a proposed retrofit concept design. However, the “potential for sudden and unexpected failure that led to progressive collapse in entirety of two previous buildings using this same lit slab construction while they were being demolished as was detailed in the June 20, 2022 letter from DSA” makes a retrofit option unviable for it is too dangerous to implement (building could collapse while it’s being retrofitted).  

Upon receiving confirmation of the life threatening structural issues associated with the existing Davies Hall, the District shuttered this building and relocated programs into portables in the summer of 2023. Davies Hall houses the majority of the faculty offices and classrooms on campus, and housing these programs across dispersed portables is not a sustainable permanent solution.  

**Solution Criteria**  
To mitigate these life threatening structural issues, the district seeks a permanent, least-cost solution that meets the following criteria:  

- **Institutional Impacts** - Replaces instructional/faculty space that has been displaced into dispersed temporary space due to Davies Hall’ life threatening structural issues into permanent space.  
- **Educational and Institutional Impacts** - Minimizes disruption of educational and instructional campus activity during construction.  
- **Campus Integration** - Is consistent with the College’s Educational and Facilities Master Plans goals and objectives.  
- **Campus Safety/Security** - Improves instructional/faculty space to meet current code and protects the College from potential health and life safety dangers.  
- **Energy Efficiency** - Improves campus energy efficiency.  
- **Delivery Timeline** - Delivers a solution in the shortest time possible.  
- **Cost** - Is the least cost solution that permanently restores the instructional/faculty space.  
- **Total Cost of Ownership** - Is a solution that decreases maintenance and operations costs over time.  

**C. Relationship to the Strategic Plan:**  
The American River College Davies Hall Replacement Health and Safety Project will allow American River College to continue to fulfill its mission, vision and values without discontinuity of educational and support services, ensuring students stay on track to succeed in their educational and career goals, in alignment with the California Community Colleges Vision for Success. While providing structural safety is the primary objective, building a new replacement building to current code will also make the facility more accessible, sustainable, energy and water efficient, lower maintenance costs, and integrate the latest technology infrastructure. This will help meet the key priorities outlined in the College’s 2020 - 2031 Educational Master Plan Imperative 7 of increasing inclusivity, accessibility and technology. The project is also consistent with the College’s 2019 Facilities Master Plan and the College’s 2020-2024 Sustainability Plan.  

**D. Alternatives:**  
Not applicable.

## COBCP - Narrative
### DF-151 (REV 07/21)

### E. Recommended Solution:

1. **Which alternative and why?**
   
   Building a replacement facility is the only viable least cost solution to address the life threatening structural issues of the existing Davies Hall. This solution also meets all of the solution criteria outlined: it provides permanent space, minimally disrupts the campus, is consistent with the colleges educational and facilities master plans, improves campus safety and security, improves energy efficiency and reduces total cost of ownership, and is the least cost solution that can be delivered in the shortest time possible.

   The total estimated cost at CCI 9654 is **$81,143,000**.

2. **Detailed scope description.**

   The American River College Davies Hall Replacement Health and Safety Project proposes to construct a new replacement building on the current Davies Hall site. The new 57,000 Gross Square Foot (GSF) replacement building will house 35,340 Assignable Square Feet (ASF), which is a smaller ASF and a more efficient GSF than the existing building. The total ASF includes 20,000 ASF of Classroom (a reduction of 6,863 ASF), 1,414 ASF of Laboratory (same as existing), 11,760 ASF of Office (same as existing), 724 ASF of Library (same as existing), 500 ASF of AV/TV (same as existing) and 942 ASF of Other support space (same as existing).

   The Replacement facility will be 3-stories, similar to the existing facility, however, it will not have a basement. Due to a proposed increase in efficiency it will also have a smaller footprint than the existing building. The existing GSF is 85,556 and the new facility is proposed to be 57,000 GSF, which is a 28,556 reduction in GSF. The project includes the demolition of the existing Davies Hall, which will require a significant amount of secured site area around the building, along with special considerations for demolition, due to the collapsibility of the existing structure and the need to protect the historic Ranch House located in close proximity to the existing building. The existing basement will need to be filled in and site utilities will need to be re-routed with new connections. There is a significant amount of site area associated with this project that will need paving and landscaping site improvements to address the vacated building footprint and adjacent sitework that will be impacted by the demolition and construction of the replacement facility.

   The table below outlines the net effect of this project on campus ASF and capacity load ratios, which includes a reduction in the lecture capacity-load ratio:

   | Type      | Lecture | Lab  | Office | Library | AV/TV | Other | Total   |
   |-----------|---------|------|--------|---------|-------|-------|---------|
   | Primary   | 20,000  | 1,414| 11,760 | 724     | 500   | 942   | 35,340  |
   | Secondary | 26,863  | 1,414| 11,760 | 724     | 500   | 942   | 42,203  |
   | Net       | -6,863  | 0    | 0      | 0       | 0     | 0     | -6,863  |

   | Beg. Cap/Load Ratios (2021) | 214% | 102% | 98% | 70% | 10% | N/A | 98% |
   | End. Cap/Load Ratios (2024) | 180% | 102% | 95% | 74% | 11% | N/A | 92% |

3. **Basis for cost information.**

Cost estimates for hard construction costs were developed by engineering and construction management professionals utilizing conceptual drawings developed for this FPP and data from recently completed community college projects. The estimate is based on local prevailing wage construction costs at the time the estimate was prepared (September 2024) and does not include escalation. Pricing assumes competitive bidding for all sub-trades. Estimates for soft costs are based on state supportable cost allowances generated by the JCAF32 QUC Form at 9654 CCI.

The professional cost estimate includes a line item for photovoltaics (PVs) on the roof based on California Code requirements. The District believes that this requirement may be met by their existing SMUD (Sacramento Municipal Utility District)’s SolarShare Program agreement, which is why it has been excluded from this project.

4. **Factors/benefits for recommended solution other than the least expensive alternative.**

In addition to being the least cost solution, this solution will improve the accessibility, water use, energy efficiency, and technology infrastructure of this major instructional/faculty office building on campus. At a smaller ASF/GSF and equipped with more efficient building systems, as well as more durable and sustainable materials, it will also lower maintenance and operational costs and improve the campus’ sustainability.

5. **Complete description of impact on support budget.**

There are no program costs associated with the Davies Hall Replacement Health and Safety project because those programs and staff already exist and the project has no growth.

6. **Identify and explain any project risks.**

Per the June 2022 DSA letter there is a risk of collapse associated with the demolition of the existing Davies Hall. To mitigate this risk, the District will engage persons trained for such demolition work, who will implement necessary measures to minimize the risks, and the demolition will be scheduled to occur when the campus is unoccupied.

7. **List requested interdepartmental coordination and/or special project approval (including mandatory reviews and approvals, e.g. technology proposals).**

State Fire Marshal review for fire life safety, and Division of the State Architect for fire life safety, access compliance, structural reviews, and field reviews.

**F. Consistency with Government Code Section 65041.1:**

Does the recommended solution (project) promote infill development by rehabilitating existing infrastructure and how? Explain.

The California Community Colleges are exempt from the specific provisions of this Government Code Section.

Does the project improve the protection of environmental and agricultural resources by protecting and preserving the state’s most valuable natural resources? Explain.

The California Community Colleges are exempt from the specific provisions of this Government Code Section.

# 12.1 Justification for Additional Costs Exceeding Guidelines

- [ ] Construction (including Group 1 equipment)
- [ ] Equipment (Group 1 and Furniture)

**District:** Los Rios CCD  
**College:** American River College  

**Project:** Davies Hall Replacement Health and Safety  

Please use this and additional pages or diagrams to explain and justify items of cost not easily explained on other forms. Examples of items needing justification: site improvements, unusual or high-cost construction methods, or items of equipment that exceed ASF cost guidelines. This form, when completed, supplements both the “Quantities and Unit Costs Supporting the JCAF 32” and the “Guidelines-based Group 1 Equipment Cost Estimate” forms.

Cost estimates for hard construction costs were developed by engineering and construction management professionals utilizing conceptual drawings developed for this FPP and data from recently completed community college projects. The estimate is based on local prevailing wage construction costs and raw materials cost at the time the estimate was prepared (September 2024) and does not include escalation. Pricing assumes competitive bidding for all sub-trades. Estimates for soft costs are based on state supportable cost allowances generated by the JCAF32 QUC Form at 9654 CCI.

Estimated construction costs for the Davies Hall Replacement Health and Safety project exceed current state guidelines at CCI 9654. All proposed scope of work is state supported and the proposed project is estimated to exceed maximum state guidelines for hard construction by $19,445,783. These costs are related to the realities of the Sacramento construction market, reflecting the actual cost of raw materials and labor based on recent projects in the region.

State guidelines at CCI 9654 put the building related construction costs at $29,157,634 (New Construction is $28,585,916 and BOG Allowance is $571,718) in today’s dollars. According to the District’s 3rd Party professional Estimator the building related construction cost is $48,603,417 in today’s dollars. The difference between these two estimates is $19,445,783. A summary of the District’s 3rd Party Estimate is on the attached page, showing the costs by each trade/material category.

The professional cost estimate includes a line item for photovoltaics (PVs) on the roof based on California Code requirements. The District believes that this requirement may be met by their existing SMUD (Sacramento Municipal Utility District)’s SolarShare Program agreement, which is why it has been excluded from this project.
