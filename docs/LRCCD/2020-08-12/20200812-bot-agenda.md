**Chancellor's Report:**  

- **ARC:** ARC's Laurinda Reynolds is the recipient of the Gerontological Society of America's 2020 Rising Star Early Career Faculty Award. This national award recognizes new faculty whose teaching and/or leadership stands out as impactful and innovative. Reynolds was recognized for her work in contributing to the society's nationwide Ageism First Aid program, an online multi-module course designed to help change the common negative misconceptions and myths about aging by replacing them with facts that should be common knowledge. The course will support factual conversations about aging and spark widespread use of positive aging-related language among people in the health and helping professions. Reynolds was one of a select group of key contributors to the program curriculum.

- **CRC:** CRC’s Fire Tech program recently had our site visit to become an Accredited Regional Training Program (ARTP). The accrediting team is recommending regional accreditation after the program coordinator Kris Hubbard submitted a 400+ page self- study. The accreditation team toured the William Perry Schulze Training Center where we hold our training academy every fall.

- **FLC:** Dr. Mariko Peshon McGarry, Los Rios' Prison Reentry Education Program Director based out of Folsom Lake College, has joined the Alliance for Higher Education in Prison’s Executive Leadership Cohort, and is one of 30 leaders from around the country who are developing ways to face the challenge of maintaining higher education in prisons during the immediacy and aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak. Mari’s acceptance to this select group is a testament to the colleges’ excellent work on behalf of its incarcerated and reentry students.

- **SCC:** Sacramento City College staff, faculty and students have engaged in critical discussions over the past week. Separate spaces for faculty and staff entitled “Acknowledging the Moment” were held Friday and Tuesday, respectively, to discuss ways to meaningfully acknowledge the conditions under which our students, especially our African American students, are living and learning right now. The ASHE Center and SCC Black Student Union came together to host a Black Student Discussion that included two Black mental health experts who helped facilitate the

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** August 12, 2020  

**SUBJECT:** Los Rios Colleges Foundation – Quarterly Investment Report  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item C  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Vice Chancellor  
Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
In 1998, the District and Los Rios Colleges Foundation (Foundation) adopted a Master Agreement whereby the Foundation became an auxiliary organization of the District. All college foundations’ investment activities were combined under the Foundation. Morgan Stanley is the investment consultant for the Foundation.  

As an auxiliary organization, the Foundation is not required to operate under GC 53600 investment restrictions. The Foundation Board has a Statement of Rules, Objectives and Guidelines (Statement) to govern the investment of funds, last revised June 2018. The funds should be invested with care, skill, prudence and diligence with the goal of producing returns equal to or exceeding prevailing standards among foundations of similar asset size, as well as for the protection of funds held in perpetual duration. The Statement defines the investment guidelines for specified asset classes for endowed funds as follows: equities, defined as common stock, convertible preferred stock, convertible bonds, and convertible stock, shall represent 25-60% of the total fund assets; fixed-income securities, defined as investments with maturities greater than one year that pay a fixed rate of return, shall represent 17-50% of the total assets; alternative investments, defined as fund-of-fund investments, shall represent up to 20% of the total fund assets; and cash, defined as maturities shorter than one year, shall represent 2-10% of the total fund assets. In addition, the Statement provides guidelines for investing non-endowed funds based upon the purpose of the donation and the horizon of time for the use of funds. The three non-endowed portfolio funds available are cash management, fixed income and balanced funds.  

**STATUS:**  
This report represents the investment activity for the year ended June 30, 2020. The investments are directed by the Los Rios Colleges Foundation Finance Committee and realized and unrealized earnings are shown in the accompanying schedules. The return for the year ended June 30, 2020 for the endowed portfolio of $10.3 million was -2.29% compared to -2.96% for the composite benchmark. The return for the year ended June 30, 2020 for the total managed portfolio of $14.4 million was -0.34% compared to -0.85% for the composite benchmark. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, investments are restated to market value as of each fiscal year-end.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees receive the Foundation Quarterly Investment Report for the year ended June 30, 2020.

**INFORMATION**

**BACKGROUND:**  
The Budget and Accounting Manual issued by the System Office requires that all separate bank accounts be "…presented to the governing board for its review and confirmation of continuing need." This is the annual report submitted to the Board for such approval.

**STATUS:**  
There are forty-one (41) active accounts used by the district office, four colleges, and the centers. These accounts are necessary to carry out the many functions of the District. The various accounts include:

- **Demand Deposits:**  
  Checking accounts and the Local Agency Investment fund (LAIF) are accounts in which the funds are available on demand by the District. LAIF is a pooled fund managed by the State of California for local agencies.

- **Clearing Account:**  
  The District clearing account was established to handle direct deposits from the colleges and District office which are then sent to the Sacramento County Treasurer's Office.

- **Self-Insurance:**  
  The District is self-insured for certain prescribed losses. Monies are held in the Sacramento County Treasurer’s Pooled Investment Account and transferred to the District’s Workers’ Compensation and Liability/Property bank accounts to facilitate payments processed by third party administrators on behalf of the District.

- **Retiree Health Trust Account:**  
  The Retiree Heath Trust Account was established for purposes of investment and disbursement of funds irrevocably designated by the District to fund other post-employment benefits (OPEB).

### 2020 – 2021 SABBATICAL AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT LEAVE(S) – REVISIONS

The following are revisions from the 2020 - 21 Sabbatical and Professional Development Leaves approved by the Board of Trustees on May 13, 2020.

**Sacramento City College**

| Type A Leave Time | Annual FTE |
|-------------------|------------|
| Mark Dennis       | .500 FTE   |
| Psychology Professor 100% | Fall 2020  |
|                   | Spring 2021 |

**“An Exploration of Trauma and its Impact on Learning Among Community College Students”**

**Proposal:** The ultimate goal of this proposal is to afford the opportunity to conduct research on the prevalence of trauma in students attending public two-year community colleges. A greater understanding of the prevalence of trauma among community college students has the potential to serve as a catalyst for a radical re-imagining of community college curriculum, values, and mission and a transformation in the way we approach educating students. In addition to this research project, will also include planning and designing curriculum to teach students about trauma using Polyvagal Theory as the dominant theoretical frame and ways to treat, manage, and heal it.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** August 12, 2020  

**SUBJECT:** Pay Rate Schedules: Final 2019-20  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Vice Chancellor  
Finance & Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
In August of 2011, CalPERS issued regulations defining compensation for retirement benefit purposes that specify the requirements for Board approval of salary schedules for employees.  

**STATUS:**  
The regulations prescribe that the format identify the title for every job classification; the pay rate for each job classification; the time base (i.e. hourly, daily, monthly, etc.) & the effective date and date of any revisions. The 2019-20 final salary schedule improvements follow the provisions of the compensation formula in the District’s collective bargaining agreements.  

The 2019-20 salary schedules improvement varied across the units dependent upon factors such as the level of medical contribution and/or residual funds from 2018. However, over the last 12 months, the effects of COVID-19 and the corresponding economic realities limit our ability to retroactively improve the schedules for most units.  

The only unit with a substantial level of one-time resources is LRCFT. This funding is primarily attributed to the state’s investment in faculty in two of the past five years, which has been directly allocated to faculty and is consistent with state directives. The LRCFT unit is proposed to provide funding for a one-time 4% increase to the 2019-20 interim salary schedule. This increase is in recognition of the state’s direct allocation to faculty in recent years, and also recognizes the conversion of courses towards remote operations in the Spring term. In accordance with applicable CalSTRS laws, this increase is considered salary for LRCFT members.  

The District has completed the compensation calculation for 2019-20 and met with all employee groups to review the calculation and the recommended improvement. After funding the improvement, residual funds carry forward to the 2019-20 calculation for each unit.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt and approve the attached final salary schedules for all groups and individuals providing a 4% one-time salary schedule improvement for the LRCFT unit. It is also recommended that the Board of Trustees ratify the Memorandum of Understanding outlined above.

LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT  
AND  
LOS RIOS COLLEGE FEDERATION OF TEACHERS  

**8/5/2020**  
**MOU: 2019-20 Final Faculty Compensation**  

**Background:**  
Increased one-time only funding associated with state allocations directed to support faculty were deposited directly into the LRCFT bucket. The LRCFT and District agree that the LRCFT bucket contains sufficient resources to support a one-time payment of 4% for the 2019-2020 Academic year. This payment reflects, in part, faculty efforts to transition instruction and related student services to remote and online environment.  

**Agreement:**  
The 2019-20 faculty salary schedules will be improved by a one-time only increase of 4% to be paid in August 2020.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** August 12, 2020

---

**SUBJECT:** Pay Rate Schedules: Interim 2020-21  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item B  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Vice Chancellor  
Finance & Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
In August of 2011, CalPERS issued regulations defining compensation for retirement benefit purposes that specify the requirements for Board approval of salary schedules for employees.

**STATUS:**  
The regulations prescribe that the format identify the title for every job classification; the pay rate for each job classification; the time base (i.e. hourly, daily, monthly, etc.) and the effective date and date of any revisions. The 2020-21 interim salary schedule follow the provisions of the compensation formula in the District’s collective bargaining agreements. Because of the state’s public health, economic, and fiscal decline attributable to COVID-19, the 2020-21 interim salary schedule remains unchanged from the 2019-20 interim salary schedule. The remaining funding in each unit’s bucket will be carried forward to mitigate likely future reductions in state revenues and/or the likely increase in health care premiums.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended the Board of Trustees adopt and approve the attached 2020-21 interim salary schedules for all groups and individuals.
