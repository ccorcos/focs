**Chancellor's Report:**  
ARC: ARC's Kaneko Gallery is featuring "An Artist's Response" exhibition online at [Kaneko Gallery](https://sites.google.com/view/kanekogallery-anartistsresponse/home). The idea for the exhibition came after seeing so many artists on social media making art in response to the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery. This exhibition features works from current ARC students and alumni as well as local, regional and national artists that highlight the arts community's commitment to equity and social justice. The works vary from portraits of the victims of police brutality to abstraction. The Kaneko Gallery believes that art can be a catalyst for positive change and is creating spaces where these artworks can be viewed together to make a powerful statement.

CRC, now one of 26 community colleges involved in the Initiative, will be able to support the aspirations of our students in this area. The program which ties directly to the college’s mission and aligns with Guided Pathways, features exclusive partnerships with top tier undergraduate and graduate institutions, UC Davis, UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Irvine, USC, Loyola Marymount, Santa Clara University and USF. Taking advantage of this unique experience will allow students to be able to complete their degree at CRC in two years, while earning certification with the State Bar of California as a law pathway scholar. They will then transfer to one of the undergraduate programs within the partner network and then to law school; completing the entire academic journey in just seven years!

Challenge. The iOme Challenge is an annual national competition to raise awareness among college students about the impact of retirement security on the social and economic well-being of our society. David was selected as this year's winner for his essay titled “Reform for the Modern American Retirement System.” The Economics major, under the guidance of faculty advisor Dr. Joe Radding, is the first community college student to win since the competition’s inception in 2009. David presented his policy paper virtually at WISER’s 16th Annual Symposium, “New Perspectives: An Intergenerational Discussion on Retirement Solutions,” in late June.
