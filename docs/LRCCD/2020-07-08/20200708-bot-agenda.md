**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** July 8, 2020  

**SUBJECT:** Social Justice in Action  
**ATTACHMENT:** None  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Board Study Session Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
Los Rios made the decision to pivot to fully remote operations on March 13, 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is almost impossible to overstate the tremendous amount of change that has taken place in less than four months since the transition to remote operations. Almost overnight, faculty and staff converted courses and services from face-to-face to remote and online. As the impacts of COVID-19 have continued, Los Rios made the decision to continue remote operations for the Fall 2020 semester. On May 15, Governor Newsom provided his May Revise budget that reflected the reality that the state budget for the new fiscal year beginning July 1, 2020, will be drastically impacted by a decline in revenues caused by the ongoing pandemic. The death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020 and the wave of national protests that followed shined a spotlight on deep inequities based on race in the United States faced by our Black and African American students, faculty and staff. We recognize that similar inequities are also a reality for other racial and ethnic groups, including, but not limited to, our LatinX, indigenous, and LGBTQ+ students.  

**STATUS:**  
In most years, the July Board agenda is a fairly light agenda. For 2020, the confluence of dramatic events of recent months makes this July very unique and important. In recent weeks, the theme has emerged that this is a time for action. Words matter, but too many times before dialog and conversation have not resulted in courageous actions to make a difference in the lives of our students. Before the events of March 13, the Board planned for the July Study Session to address the Brown Act. In response to the confluence of historic events beginning March 13, the Board has requested that staff provide information on three very important topics of great significance:

1. Specific Targets to Improve Outcomes for Black and LatinX Students. Our four college presidents have worked together to identify important targets for Fall 2020 to improve outcomes for all students with a focus on Black and LatinX students. Our college presidents and Vice Chancellor Nye will present specific targets for the Fall 2020 semester and explain the importance of collegial consultation with faculty and collaboration with staff in meeting the ambitious targets.  
2. Reform of the Los Rios Police Department and Public Safety Education.
<!-- Page 3 -->
- Vice Chancellor Rodriguez and Chief Savidge will provide an overview of reforms underway in the LRPD and also share a summary of current public safety statistics and policies as requested by the Board of Trustees.
- Faculty and administrators will provide an overview of conversations underway to consider reform of Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) and other Public Safety programs across Los Rios.

3. Coordination and Alignment of Equity Work at the Los Rios Colleges. Associate Vice Chancellor Dixon will provide an overview of the role of consultants Cynthia Olivo and Lasana Hotep in coordinating and aligning equity work underway at the four colleges, including the colleges’ Student Equity Plans and the commitment to measurable targets to improve outcomes for Black and LatinX students.

RECOMMENDATION:  
This item is presented to the Board of Trustees for information and discussion.

FIRST READING  
ACTION x  
INFORMATION  

**BACKGROUND:**  
Each year, community college districts receive money from the California Community College Chancellor’s Office (CCCCO) Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Fund. The allocation of funding is contingent on compliance with the CCCCO EEO Fund model. This model was established to increase compliance with legal EEO requirements and to provide our students with the educational benefits of a diverse workforce. The CCCCO has identified nine best-practice areas for success in promoting EEO. These nine areas will serve as the “multiple methods” for allocating the EEO Fund to districts.

The District’s EEO Advisory Committee, chief human resources officer, chief executive officer and governing board must certify on the EEO Fund Multiple Method Allocation Model Certification Form (EEO Fund Certification Form) that the District met a minimum of the multiple method requirements in order to receive EEO funds.

**STATUS:**  
The Human Resources office prepared and presented the 2019-2020 EEO Fund Multiple Method Allocation Model Certification Form to the District’s EEO Advisory Committee. The District’s EEO Advisory Committee certified the 2019-2020 EEO Certification Form during their June 16, 2020 meeting, indicating that the District met each of the nine multiple method requirements. The chief human resources officer and chancellor have certified the EEO Fund Certification Form. The EEO Fund Multiple Method Allocation Model Certification Form is attached, with the associated District and college documents available for review in the Human Resources office.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve and certify the 2019-2020 EEO Fund Certification Form.

Multiple Method #9
- The District runs a very successful Faculty Diversity Internship Program (FDIP). The FDIP has traditionally included approximately 40 Interns per year who receive approximately thirty-five hours of training on community colleges and instruction during each fall semester. This year, Los Rios has increased the incoming FDIP class to approximately 50 interns. In the spring, the Interns are matched with a Faculty Mentor to assist in teaching a discipline related class. This program has resulted in many interns being hired as adjunct and/or tenure-track faculty (FDIP handbook is attached, 9.1).

- The District’s most diverse category of employees, classified, may also teach as adjunct faculty per Board Regulation 6326, Section 7.0 – Adjunct Faculty Assignment (attached, 9.2).

- The Classified employee union contract includes educational leave, which provides employees the opportunity to take paid leave (85% pay and full benefits) for up to five months to further their education. (Article 7.21 LRCEA Contract Staff Development Leave is attached, 9.3). Regular and ongoing Professional Development activities are also offered to classified personnel at no cost on each campus and at District.

- The District’s Doctoral Release Program offers administrators and confidential staff release time to work on advanced studies. Roughly 75% of enrollees in this program are of a diverse background. (Policy 9236; attached, 9.4).

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** July 8, 2020

**SUBJECT:** Resolution No. 2020-08: Five Year Capital Outlay Plan  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** Five Year Plan  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item B  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Vice Chancellor  
Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
The State Chancellor’s Office has a prescribed capital outlay process and calendar for requesting State funds for capital outlay projects. Each year the District must file a Five Year Capital Outlay Plan which lists all proposed projects, whether State funded or not. Final Project Proposals (FPPs), which are prepared to request State funding for projects that are listed in the Five Year Capital Outlay Plan, are also to be submitted with the Five Year Capital Outlay Plan each year. Typically this information is due by July 1 however this year the Chancellor’s office extended the deadline to August 1.

Although a district may qualify for State funding, all districts are competing with each other for the limited funds available. Facility capacity/load ratios (enrollment growth) and local contribution of funds are key elements in the State’s prioritization of funding capital projects.

**STATUS:**  
Last year the Chancellors Office carried forward the Davies Hall Modernization FPPs to compete for potential State funding in the Governor’s budget. Due to the failure of the District’s local bond measure, the District made the tough decision to forfeit the Davies Hall FPP from the pool of potential state funded projects and will not submit a FPP this year.

This report is a second reading of the draft Five Year Capital Outlay Plan that the Board is being asked to approve. The attached executive summary describes the Five Year Capital Outlay Plan.

A first reading of the draft plan was presented at the June Board meeting and is included as an enclosure to the agenda.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the Five Year Capital Outlay Plan and supporting Resolution No. 2020-08 for submission to the State.

State Five Year Capital Outlay Plan  
And  
Final Project Proposals  

**Executive Summary**  

**State Five Year Construction Plan:**  

The basic intent and purpose of the Plan is to analyze enrollment forecasts and determine the amount and type of spaces that will be needed to meet increases in enrollment and changes in the educational program. The Plan is used to determine overall estimated costs and identify possible funding sources.  

The major components of the Plan are: Forecasted student load (enrollment/WSCH), facilities capacity to handle load, proposed new space, proposed modernizations and possible funding sources. The first three components are compiled into “capacity/load ratios”. Capacity/load ratios represent, as a percentage, the facilities capacity to handle forecasted student load (or demand). These capacity/load ratios are the primary tool used by the State to determine which projects will be approved. Also the State has a priority system, which causes districts to compete against each other to offer the State the least cost alternative. Because of this many of the projects have a local contribution indicated. The local contribution is intended to make our projects more competitive for scarce State funding.  

This year’s State Five Year Capital Outlay Plan lists 18 projects, comprised mainly of new construction projects and modernization projects.  

**Possible Sequencing of State Funded Projects**  

In November 2016, the voters passed Proposition 51 authorizing $7 billion in general obligation bonds for new construction and modernization of K–12 public school facilities; charter schools and vocational education facilities; and $2 billion for California Community Colleges facilities. This influx of bond dollars has allowed for a backlog of FPPs to be eased. The current funding schedule for Los Rios FPPs could be as follows:  

FPPs previously submitted and scheduled for 2020 -2021 State funding  
• FLC Rancho Cordova Phase 2  

Following is a brief Description of this FPP:  

**FLC Rancho Cordova Center Phase 2** This project will provide approximately 14,200 ASF of new instructional and related support space at Rancho Cordova Center. This new building will be adjacent the existing Phase 1 building at Rancho Cordova. The estimated total cost of this project is $17,314,000. The total request for State funding is $8,898,000 for portions of the Preliminary Plans, Working Drawings and Construction of this project. Los Rios is proposing to fund the remaining cost of this project, to include portions of the Preliminary plans, Working drawings and Construction and all of the Equipment; for a total District contribution of $8,416,000.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** July 8, 2020

**SUBJECT:** Resolution No. 2020-09: Affirming our Commitment to Student Success for Black and African American Students  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item C  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  
**CONSENT/ROUTINE**  
**FIRST READING**  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION** X  
**INFORMATION**  

**BACKGROUND:**  
The Los Rios Colleges represent and serve a wonderfully diverse population in terms of race, ethnicity, language, culture, nationality, socio-economic class, age, physical ability, sexual orientation, and religious beliefs. Los Rios is committed to improving outcomes for all students and recognizes that many students of color face barriers to success that have resulted in troubling gaps when compared to other groups of students. On May 25, 2020, Mr. George Floyd, a black man in Minnesota, was killed, face down, under the knee of a white police officer. Almost three quarters of California’s Black undergraduates (72 percent) are enrolled in a California Community College, making the Community College system the primary source of higher education for members of this demographic group. The death of George Floyd has placed a spotlight on the unique and persistent challenges faced by our Black and African American students, faculty and staff.

**STATUS:**  
The attached Resolution No. 2020-09 reaffirms the Los Rios Community College District Board of Trustees’ commitment to remove systemic barriers for Black and African American students by working collaboratively with the California Community College system as well as local, state and federal governments, businesses and community-based organizations to examine our policies, practices, services and classroom instruction to ensure they are not negatively impacting Black community college students as they complete their academic programs and as Black students transition to a four-year college or university, or employment.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution 2020-09 affirming its commitment to student success for Black and African American students.

WHEREAS, on April 22, 2020, the African American Student Success Virtual Townhall was convened with over 1,000 California community college practitioners, policymakers, and national scholars to discuss financial aid reform, housing, food, technology and transportation insecurities, impacts of COVID-19 on African American students, and policy recommendations to support this student population; and  

WHEREAS, from April 27, 2020, through May 1, 2020, African American Success Week was held, with an average of 300 participants participating in daily webinars covering recommendations for Black student success, housing insecurity, COVID-19, and listening to Black student voices; and  

WHEREAS, on May 25, 2020, Mr. George Floyd, a black man in Minnesota, died, face down, under the knee of a white police officer; and  

WHEREAS, reactions to the unjust death of Mr. Floyd have varied, and the nation continues to witness the Black community pushed to the edge by systemic racism; and  

WHEREAS, California Community Colleges (CCC) represent and serve one of the most diverse populations in the world in terms of race, ethnicity, language, culture, nationality, socio-economic class, age, physical ability, sexual orientation, and religious beliefs; and  

WHEREAS, the California Community Colleges’ unwavering commitment to diversity and inclusion requires that we advocate and employ our collective voice to identify and eliminate barriers to equity and that we act deliberately to create a safe and inclusive environment where individual and group differences are valued and leveraged for our growth and understanding as an educational community; and  

WHEREAS, almost three-quarters of California’s Black undergraduates (72 percent) are enrolled in a California Community College, making the CCC system the primary source of higher education for members of this demographic group.  

WHEREAS, the overwhelming majority (77 percent) of Black students attend community college part-time (fewer than 12 units in a term) due to employment, family, and other commitments; and  

WHEREAS, most Black community college students are adult learners who work full-time while attending college part-time, have family commitments/responsibilities, and struggle with basic needs insecurities. The students who need the most get the least financial support; and

WHEREAS, 37 percent of Black community college students earn a degree, certificate, or transfer within six years; and only 3 percent of Black students in California Community Colleges (CCC) transfer within two years; and only 35 percent of Black students transfer to a public university within six years; and

WHEREAS, practitioners and policymakers will utilize race-conscious perspectives in making decisions to improve the success of Black students; and

WHEREAS, a race-conscious perspective is defined as being conscious of how institutional racism shapes educational access, educational trauma, opportunity, lack of culturally relevant practices, and success in the U.S. for people of color, justice-impacted families, and other minoritized groups; and

WHEREAS, the state of California and the California Community College system need to address structural inequities of Black student success by way of policy efforts and advocacy.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the Los Rios Community College District Board of Trustees, hereby reaffirm our commitment to remove systemic barriers for Black and African American students by working collaboratively with the California Community College system as well as local, state and federal governments, businesses and community-based organizations to examine our policies and practices to ensure they are not negatively impacting Black community college students as they complete academic programs and as Black students transition to a four-year college or university, or employment; and be it further

RESOLVED that we, the Los Rios Community College District Board of Trustees affirm our commitment to foster a culture in which all members of the Black and African American community, (1) feel safe, respected and valued; (2) are invited to participate fully, share their unique gifts, talents and backgrounds; (3) increasingly recognize the
