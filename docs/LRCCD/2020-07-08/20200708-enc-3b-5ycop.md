**Explain why this project is needed:**  
This project will modernize the Rhodda Hall North building. The building was constructed in 1975 and has had no major renovations other than small tenant improvements in individual rooms. The existing HVAC, electrical and plumbing systems are old, outdated and energy inefficient. The building consists of modular style wall system which has become unmodifiable and unreparable and contributes to poor acoustics and a depressing interior experience. The entire buildings assignable square footage (ASF) of 61,894 will be modernized and upon completion contain upgraded building systems, ADA accommodations and a student and staff experience matching the instruction delivered. The Facility Condition Index (FCI) for this building is 56.34 indicating a building in poor shape and needing renovation.
