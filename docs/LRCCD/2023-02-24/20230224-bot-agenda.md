## Los Rios Community College District Indigenous Land Acknowledgment Statement
In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.  

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

# LRCCD  
## Abbreviated External Scan  
### Executive Summary  

February 25, 2023  

Prepared by:  
The Research and Planning Group for the  
California Community Colleges  
<!-- Page 47 -->
![Executive Summary](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Executive+Summary)

The Los Rios Community College District (LRCCD) contracted with the Research and Planning Group for California Community Colleges (The RP Group) to review its enrollment management data and identify areas that need to be updated. The district has a robust institutional research operation that has produced scans and data dashboards to inform the district’s enrollment planning and strategies. After reviewing available data produced by LRCCD’s research office, The RP Group Team partnered with the district to update service area adult population estimates and demographics, high school graduate enrollment rates, and adult population forecasts.

This report provides a high-level summary of the following:

1. Enrollment trends over four points in time: fall 2009, fall 2014, fall 2019, and fall 2021
2. Adult population estimates and demographics for residents residing within the Sacramento-Yolo Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) and the LRCCD 3-County Service Area
3. LRCCD enrollments and adult participation rates by county of residence
4. High school graduate enrollment rates and public K-12 enrollment and graduation projections
5. Population forecasts from 2022 through 2040

The external scan data included in this report informs the district as it plans for its enrollments now and into the future. The RP Group Team recommends considering these data within the context of other internal and external data and the district’s priorities. For example, a key consideration is how the evolving role of distance education may refine how LRCCD defines its service area. Another important consideration is that term-to-term persistence contributes to increasing enrollments and facilitates completion; therefore, a deeper examination of loss points across the student journey (i.e., at which points do most students drop out) would help inform strategic enrollment management strategies.

The RP Group Team completed a companion report describing the themes of student focus groups conducted as part of this scope of work. While the two documents highlight key findings and identify implications for planning, the district will have more context and understanding for interpreting the results. Therefore, the implications for planning identified here are for consideration only.

**Key Findings**

**Enrollment Trends and Demographics**

The RP Group Team included enrollment information in this report for comparison to the external scan data. The district’s research office has well-established enrollment reports and has highlighted the following impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on enrollments:

- LRCCD has experienced enrollment decreases over time. Excluding apprentice students, the district experienced a 19.3% decline in enrollments between 2009 and 2019. The
<!-- Page 48 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this decline leading to an additional 14.6% decrease between 2019 and 2021.

- Prior to the pandemic, the district had grown its apprentice and dual/concurrent enrollment programs.
- The demographic profile of students served by the district is changing:
  - The number of students under the age of 18, likely dual and concurrently enrolled, has increased. This age group is the only one that did not experience a decrease during the pandemic.
  - Prior to the pandemic, the Hispanic/Latino student body increased and went from representing 23.4% in 2014 of the student body to 27.5% in 2019.
  - Prior to the pandemic, the Black/African American student body decreased and went from representing 10.2% in 2014 of the student body to 8.3% in 2019. Additionally, the White student body decreased and went from representing 39.7% in 2014 of the population to 33.3% in fall 2021.
  - Notably, while small in terms of volume, the American Indian/Alaskan Native student body decreased by 35% from 2014 to 2019.

Adult Population Estimates and Demographics

Examining adult (ages 18-64) population estimates and changing demographics helps districts gauge potential enrollments. The RP Group Team reviewed the 2014 through 2020 adult population estimates included in the United States Census Bureau’s 5-year American Community Survey for the Sacramento-Yolo CMSA and the LRCCD 3-County Service Area. Counties that make up the CMSA include: El Dorado, Sacramento, Yolo, and Placer. The LRCCD-3 County service area includes El Dorado, Sacramento, and Yolo.

- The Sacramento-Yolo CMSA is vast in terms of geographical area. It is home to more than 1.4 million adults.
- The service area population is growing slowly. From 2014 to 2020, adults ages 18-64 have grown at just under 1% annually.
  - Sacramento County is the county with the largest population in the CMSA by far and has grown by 4.6% over the six years examined.
  - Yolo and Placer County’s populations have grown by 6.1% and 4.8%, respectively.
  - El Dorado County’s population has decreased by 1.1%.
- The district’s service area demographics are shifting. Over the six years included in the study, The RP Group Team made the following observations:
  - Residents ages 18-20 have decreased by 6.2%, while residents ages 25-29 and 30-39 have grown by 10.5% and 12.6%, respectively.
  - Black/African American residents have grown at a very slow rate of 2.9%.
  - Asian and Hispanic/Latino residents make up a significant portion of the population and have grown over time. The Asian population has grown by almost 18.7% and the Hispanic/Latino population has grown by 14.9%.
  - Adults identifying as White have decreased by 3.2%.
  - American Indian/Alaskan Native adults have experienced the greatest decrease proportionally at 30.8%.

![LRCCD Enrollment by Location of Residence and Fall Term Adult Participation Rates](https://datamart.cccco.edu/Students/Unit_Load_Status.aspx)

**LRCCD Enrollment by Location of Residence and Fall Term Adult Participation Rates**

The RP Group Team reviewed enrollment by ZIP code of residence to understand where LRCCD students who live within the Sacramento-Yolo CMSA reside. This information is helpful for planning outreach and recruitment efforts.

- As the largest county served by LRCCD, most of the district’s students who live in the Sacramento-Yolo CMSA come from Sacramento County (82.8% in fall 2021).
- While relatively small regarding volume, the percentage of students coming from El Dorado County has declined the most (32.2%) between fall 2009 and fall 2019; however, students coming from Placer County increased by 5.0% between 2014 and 2019.

Participation rates represent the number of students per 1,000 adults in a specified service area. Districts examine participation rates as part of their long-range planning. As a district’s service area adult population grows and evolves, participation rates can be helpful for establishing target enrollment rates overall and across specific student groups (e.g., age, race/ethnicity). Also, they can be used as one metric for consideration when forecasting enrollments.

As enrollments have declined, participation rates across student categories have also declined. However, The RP Group Team noted the following interesting comparisons:

- Females traditionally have higher participation rates than males. During the pandemic, male participation rates dropped more than females.
- Participation rates for White adults are lower than those of other racial/ethnic categories. Hispanic/Latino and Asian participation rates have the highest rates.
- Participation rates for Black/African American adults decreased significantly over the time studied. For example, they went from 73 per 1,000 adults in fall 2014 to 43 per 1,000 adults in fall 2021. This same pattern was observed for the district’s Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander adults. Participation rates for this student group went from 72 per 1,000 in fall 2014 to 39 per 1,000 adults in fall 2021.

**High School Enrollment Rates (High School-to-College Pipeline)**

Recent high school graduates or direct matriculants represent a target enrollment population throughout community colleges. Students who enter a community college directly after graduating from high school take more units on average and generate more FTES (drawn from the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office Data Mart [https://datamart.cccco.edu/Students/Unit_Load_Status.aspx](https://datamart.cccco.edu/Students/Unit_Load_Status.aspx)). The high school graduate enrollment rate (HSG enrollment rate) is one measure that allows the district to assess its partnerships with local high schools. Key findings are:

- High schools within the Sacramento-Yolo CMSA graduate nearly 27,000 students annually.
- According to the California Department of Education, public K-12 enrollments within the Sacramento-Yolo CMSA are expected to decrease over the next decade, while the
<!-- Page 50 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)

number of high school graduates are expected to remain relatively stable with increases in some years and decreases in others.
- Prior to the pandemic, LRCCD enrolled 21.2% of high school graduates the fall immediately following their graduation. In 2021, this rate dropped slightly to 18.8%.
- Participation rates across high schools vary. Likely, these differences are related to the proximity of a specific high school to LRCCD colleges and the relationship between the colleges and their target feeder high schools.

## Adult Population Projections

Adult population projections help districts plan for future enrollment and establish target student enrollment groups for outreach, programming, and services. The RP Group Team examined adult population projections produced by the California Department of Finance and the Sacramento Association of Governments through 2040.

- Adult population projections show the counties served by LRCCD will continue to grow at a slow rate (less than 1% annually). The adult population from El Dorado County is expected to grow much more slowly than the other counties.
- Most of the growth in the adult population is expected to come from working adults (defined by LRCCD as population ages 25-64) ages 30-39 and 40-49. The number of traditional college age adults (ages 18-24) is expected to decrease slightly.
- The Hispanic/Latino population will continue to grow and represent more of the population over time.

## Implications for Planning

Findings from this abbreviated external scan provide implications for the district’s strategic enrollment efforts. Specifically, The RP Group Team suggests the district consider how it can strengthen the high school to LRCCD pipeline, examine how it can increase and serve adult learners, integrate its enrollment management efforts with its equity plans, and refine its examination of service areas by segmenting Sacramento County by region or city and including additional external factors that will influence and impact student enrollment. Each suggestion is further described below.

### Strengthening the High School to LRCCD Pipeline

Adults ages 18-20 are a key target enrollment group for LRCCD as they typically represent direct matriculants who enroll in more units and generate more FTES on average than other student groups. Adults in the population ages 18-20 have decreased over time and forecasts suggest this trend will continue. In addition, the number of high school graduates is not expected to increase or decrease significantly. If the district seeks to increase the number of students within this age group, it will need to identify targeted strategies as growth will not come from this age group increasing in the population.

District efforts to outreach to and enroll students while they are still in high school (e.g., through dual/concurrent enrollment programs) are a good strategy to increase high school graduate
<!-- Page 51 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)

enrollment rates. Special admit (K-12) students are funded at a higher rate in the Student Centered Funding Formula. Also, this strategy may help strengthen the pipeline from high school to college as once enrolled, special admit students may be more likely to attend a district location after graduation.

Enrollment rates for several high schools are well over 30%. These rates could be due to the location and relationships LRCCD has established with these feeder high schools. Assessing what is working at the high schools with higher enrollment rates and developing strategic partnerships with other high schools served by LRCCD remains an important strategy moving forward.

### A Focus on Adult Learners

Between 2014 and 2020, the number of residents ages 25-39 in the service area has increased and represents one-third of all adults. Further, adult projections suggest that growth will come primarily from residents ages 30-49. Residents ages 18-24 are projected to decline.

Adult learners continue to be a target student enrollment group for the district. The district has many career education programs in place to meet their needs and has participated in program mapping throughout the region. Pre-pandemic enrollment counts show that, in general, the district lost students over the age of 25 at a higher rate than students under the age of 25. Continued review of how the district serves adult learners could include examining outreach, programming, and other enrollment strategies specific to this population. With a growing and more diverse older population, another target student group could be noncredit student learners seeking to strengthen their job skills.

### Responding to Changing Demographics and Their Impact on Enrollment

Asian (including Filipino) and Hispanic/Latino adults who reside within the district’s service area make up a significant portion of the population. They have grown over time and are projected to continue to grow. More than half of the enrollments in the California Community Colleges system self-report as Asian, Black/African American, or Hispanic (California Community College’s Chancellor’s Office Data Mart). Prior to the pandemic, LRCCD had experienced an increase in enrollment of Hispanic/Latino students; however, the student population identifying as Asian (including Filipino) had not increased at a similar rate.

Further, while Black/African American adults have experienced slow growth within the service area, the greater decline in enrollments (and participation rates) should be examined. Reviewing expected growth in the population and aligning the district’s strategic enrollment management efforts with its equity plans could be useful. Discussion of declining enrollment (aligned with declining adult population estimates) of American Indian/Alaskan Natives as well as the decreases in participation rates for Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students could lead to further tailored outreach and support for these student groups as well. Importantly, LRCCD’s equity plans address not just access, but persistence and completion. Increasing persistence from semester to semester serves to increase both enrollment and facilitate student completion.

# Further Study

The RP Group Team suggests further study of the external scan data. Specifically, the external data should be discussed and considered within the context of internal scan data as well as other planning considerations, such as the role and status of distance education going forward. Additional external scan metrics such as the percentage of the population over age 25 who have a college degree also would be helpful in establishing student groups to target for Strategic Enrollment Management efforts.

Sacramento County’s population is significant in size. The RP Group Team notes that the district could further define and segment specific service areas for each of LRCCD’s colleges to refine its assessment of external scan data. Further, examining population estimates, enrollment, and program participation by city within Sacramento County may be useful for determining tailored outreach at the colleges.
