# “Good News”

- **Fully funded COLA**
  - Much smaller than previous years at 0.76%
  - Corresponds with lower year-over-year inflation estimates

- **Student housing commitment continues**
  - Yet not solved, so could be cost pressures
  - Believed it would be further along at this point

- **School facilities bond appears to be supported**
  - Primarily depends if UC/CSU are included
  - Debate will be resolved in the next few months

# “Bad News”

- **Revenue forecast is going from bad to worse**
  - Early January - Governor’s Budget solves for $58 billion problem
  - Late January - LAO believes there is an additional $3 billion gap
  - Early February - Speaker believes there is an additional $6 billion gap
  - Mid February - LAO updates forecast to project an additional $24 billion gap

- **Main solution for P98 reduction in 2022-23 is unclear**
  - “The budget proposes statutory changes to address roughly $8 billion of this decrease to avoid impacting existing school and community college district budgets”
  - Unclear how legislature and stakeholder community will react

- **Using one-time solutions for ongoing budget problems**
  - $722 million of reserves used to fund SCFF (about 8% of SCFF)

![What Could Be Next?](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=What+Could+Be+Next%3F)

- Adjust/reject Governor’s Budget spending  
  ○ COLA on SCFF and/or categorical programs, nursing grant, etc.  
- Clawback recent one-time grants or programs  
  ○ Grants related to pandemic recovery, deferred maintenance, etc.  
- Re-consider recent ongoing program expansion  
  ○ Recently increase in special population programs  
- Further reduce the P98 rainy day fund  
  ○ Used $5.7 billion, but still has $3.9 billion remaining  
  ○ Using reserves while in strong economic times is questionable  
- Payment deferrals  
  ○ Borrowing issues now, and stagnant growth later  

*Likely scenario will be a combination of many concepts*
