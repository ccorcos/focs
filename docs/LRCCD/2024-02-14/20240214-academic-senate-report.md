**District Academic Senate (DAS) President, Alisa Shubb, Reports**

- DAS is working diligently to provide the best possible recommendation about required changes to district’s General Education (GE) and AA-AS degree requirements. We hosted a faculty-led webinar to discuss proposed changes and choices, which is posted on our informational website: [New General Education Pattern](https://employees.losrios.edu/our-organization/committees/district-curriculum-coordinating-committee/new-general-education-pattern). We also worked with the District Research office to send out a survey to all faculty. We are hoping to receive feedback from students through Student Senate.

Our goal is to have recommendations before the end of the semester which will include whether to:

1. allow students working toward an AA or AS degree to choose between using the new local GE pattern or a transfer GE pattern (eg Cal-GETC, CSU GE Breadth, or IGETC), which would require updating Board policy and regulations.
2. adopt an associate degree GE pattern that consists from one of the following options:

   - **Option A:** Keep the associate degree at 21 units with no additional GE requirements.
   - **Option B:** Add a 3-unit Living Skills requirement identical to the current area IIIa and IIIb requirements (see P-7241, section 2.3.3.6), bringing the GE requirements to 24 units total.
   - **Option C:** Add a 3-unit American Institutions requirement identical to the current area Va (see P-7241, section 2.3.3.3), bringing the GE requirements to 24 units total.
   - **Option D:** Add both a 3-unit Living Skills requirement identical to the current area IIIa and IIIb, and a 3-unit American Institutions requirement identical to the current area Va, bringing the GE requirements to 27 units total.

- DAS discussed the ARC and SCC votes of no confidence and the Chancellor’s proposal for a collegial consultation action plan.

![ARC Academic Senate President, Brian Knirk, Reports:](https://via.placeholder.com/150)
- With a goal of reaching the State Chancellor’s Vision 2030, ARC’s Senate chartered a task force to explore the faculty and student experience in Dual Enrollment to make recommendations for potential improvements to ensure student success.
- Recognizing the board president’s commitment to our nursing programs and the vital role they play in the community and recognizing ARC’s exceedingly high pass rate for nursing students, the ARC Senate lamented the programmatic challenges faced by the department due to low pay as compared to industry. This discussion was brought forward as the nursing department was forced to request a critical hire (the 5th in just over 2 years) due to a newly hired faculty’s resignation.
- It was noted by the ARC faculty that despite the college’s commitment to equity and diversity in hiring and intentional representation on hiring committees, that the final impressions/interview panel for the district police chief appears to be all male and mostly white.

![CRC Academic Senate President, Jacob Velasquez, Reports:](https://via.placeholder.com/150)
- No report

![FLC Academic Senate President, Eric Wada, Reports:](https://via.placeholder.com/150)
- We continue discussions about the structure of Dual Enrollment governance and practices for informing our service area about the amount of access and support parents/guardians have to faculty and student services. These governance structures are a necessary shift towards involving faculty having more intentional, organized, and focused dual enrollment discussions related to equitable student access, educational program development, student success, professional development, and curriculum.
- FLC will continue reviewing and vetting the proposals for changes to the Los Rios GE pattern.
- We are dedicating time to thoughtfully consider what collegial consultation has looked like at FLC and at the district level including the efforts across the district over the last five years to highlight the areas of growth, the results of those efforts, and the options available for moving forward.
- The FLC Academic Senate unanimously passed a resolution of no confidence in the current LRCCD Chancellor.

![SCC Academic Senate President (Interim), Amy Strimling, Reports:](https://via.placeholder.com/150)
- SCC had a change in the Senate Executive Team with Amy Strimling serving as Interim President and Nadine Kirkpatrick serving as Interim Secretary. We will follow our normal election process this spring to elect officers and new senators to begin in fall 2024.
- SCC is piloting the use of cluster hires for our faculty hires this Spring.

# Folsom Lake College Academic Senate Resolution S24-01

Whereas, concerns related to a lack of collegial consultation¹² have long been shared with Los Rios Community College district administration, particularly the Chancellor and Board of Trustees;

Whereas, the repeated attempts by all four colleges to improve collegial consultation³ between the Chancellor and the Academic Senates have not been successful, leading locally to a Folsom Lake College Academic Senate resolution⁴ insisting that the Los Rios Board of Trustees ensure that collegial consultation occurs, and ultimately culminated in votes of no confidence in the Chancellor by the Academic Senates of American River College⁵ and Sacramento City College⁶;

Whereas, in January 2024 the Chancellor stated that there are "differences in perspectives" in collegial consultation before suggesting a Collegial Consultation Action Plan that conflates acting and communicating with constituents in a collegial manner with the legal definition of collegial consultation, which is to rely primarily, or mutually agree with, faculty input with regards to academic and professional matters;

Whereas, recent inaction or delayed action, in the communication, threat assessment, and closure of Davies Hall at American River College and implementing the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act by the district has resulted in high fiscal liability⁷ and negative impacts on students, staff, and faculty;

Resolved, that the Folsom Lake College Academic Senate urges our District Academic Senate and Los Rios Board of Trustees to recognize the years-long progressively worsening trend of incorrigible behavior exhibited by our Chancellor and either willful or negligent inaction that has put our district's fiscal standing and reputation at risk, and

Resolved, that the Folsom Lake College Academic Senate supports the Academic Senates of American River College and Sacramento City College votes of no confidence in the Los Rios Community College District Chancellor, and

Resolved, that the Folsom Lake College Academic Senate supports a vote of no confidence in the Los Rios Community College District Chancellor should the Los Rios District Academic Senate consider such a resolution or recommendation to the Los Rios Board of Trustees.
