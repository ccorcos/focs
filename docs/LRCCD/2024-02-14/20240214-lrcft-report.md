# LRCFT Report to the Los Rios Board of Trustees  
**Feb. 14, 2024**

The LRCFT is helping to sponsor an upcoming student event, **The March in March** for affordable and accessible higher education. The event takes place in Sacramento on March 7 and includes a 2,000 student march across the Tower Bridge for a rally at the Capitol. The theme of the event is **Securing Students’ Future**. This event will bring thirty buses of community college students from around the state to the Capitol. We are also organizing students in Los Rios to attend the march. The event is sponsored by the California Federation of Teachers.

The LRCFT continues to campaign for our endorsed candidates in the mayor, city council, and Assembly races in Sacramento. We recently voted to endorse Eric Guerra for city council.

The LRCFT held elections in November for the college president position. Three new presidents were elected: Kalinda Jones (FLC), Bill Miller (SCC), and Art Jenkins (ARC). We also created new Vice President positions at each campus. Our new vice presidents are: LaQuisha Beckum (ARC), Linda Sneed (CRC), Kalee Christensen (FLC), and Rebecca Goodchild (SCC).

The LRCFT has also met productively with the District in recent weeks to finalize negotiations regarding the ARC Davies Hall closure and the District-wide Moratorium on the use of human remains.

In January, the LRCFT participated in the region’s MLK Day activities. We are now making plans for the Cesar Chavez day march, the largest annual labor event in Sacramento.

The LRCFT would like to congratulate one of our board members, Iris Dimond, as well as the CRC ECE department for recent coverage of the ECE program in an episode on PBS produced by Inside California Education.

In closing, the LRCFT is holding our annual membership picnic on May 17 and extend an invitation to the board, chancellor, and staff to attend.

Thank you!  
Jason Newman  
LRCFT President
