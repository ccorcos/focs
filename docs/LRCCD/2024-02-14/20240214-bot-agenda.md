**Los Rios Community College District Indigenous Land Acknowledgment Statement**  
In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our four colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.  

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

This Statement of Legislative Principles is adopted by the Board of Trustees for the Los Rios Community College District on behalf of itself and its four separately accredited Colleges (American River College, Cosumnes River College, Folsom Lake College and Sacramento City College) under Board Policy P-3115. This Statement is intended to support the District’s Strategic Goals: to establish effective pathways that optimize student access and success; to ensure equitable academic achievement across all racial, ethnic, socioeconomic and gender groups; to provide exemplary teaching and learning opportunities; to lead the region in workforce development; and to foster an outstanding working and learning environment.

This Statement of Legislative Principles provides guidelines for the Chancellor when addressing matters before the California Legislature and Congress, and constitutes the core principles guiding the development of the District’s position on legislation.

The District shall not support or oppose legislation unless the outcome will have a significant effect on the District, its students or its employees. The District will remain neutral on most matters affecting local collective bargaining. However, the District will take appropriate positions where that legislation will have a material impact on the District. The District will remain neutral on matters affecting only another single district or small group of district(s), except where policy precedents, or resource allocations, have the significant potential of affecting the Los Rios Community College District or the California Community College System generally. Where issues are raised in the budget process, the District shall seek legislative support or opposition in accordance with the principles established in this document. Where legislation is likely to impede the policy principles set forth, the District is likely to oppose that legislation unless there are significant countervailing reasons.

The Board of Trustees’ Legislative Principles align with the District’s Vision, Mission, Values, Goals and Strategies, as enumerated in the District’s Strategic Plan, as follows, but do not reflect every strategy under each goal area. The District will support those legislative efforts enumerated under each Goal.

1. ESTABLISH EFFECTIVE PATHWAYS THAT OPTIMIZE STUDENT ACCESS AND SUCCESS.
   - Obtain resources to support pathway programs.
   - Implement appropriate measures to improve student success.
   - Support the provision of comprehensive student support services.
   - Strengthen the academic preparation of K-12 students to support success at a community college.

- Assist students with the application process for attending a community college and transferring to a four-year institution of higher education.

- Integrate community colleges in the Workforce Investment Board and provide for community college courses to qualify for state and federal funding of workforce development activities.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** February 14, 2024  

**SUBJECT:** 2023-24 Budget Revision № 1  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item F  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez,  
Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**STATUS:**  
Revisions to the adopted budget for the General Fund are necessary for the following reasons:  

1. Schedule I summarizes changes to revenues, appropriations, and fund balance for the general fund. The change in restricted fund balance is the appropriation of restricted lottery funds.  
2. Schedule II provides specific adjustments to restricted and special program revenues. Restricted revenues reflect new awards for Federal and State programs, as well as augmentations to existing programs for federal, state, and local. The changes in appropriations reflect the allocation of those additional resources as well as re-alignment across object codes as expenditure plans are formalized.  

**BACKGROUND:**  
On September 13, 2023, the Governing Board adopted the 2023-24 maximum funding level (Z Budget) for the General Fund. The attached Schedule I details modifications to this funding level since adoption. General Fund revenues and appropriations are budgeted $76.5 million higher than the adopted level due to the recognition of additional general purpose, and restricted/special programs revenues. General fund unrestricted revenue increased by $20.5 million, which is predominantly due to the allocation of the Program Development Funds presented to the Governing Board at the December 13, 2023 meeting. Restricted revenues increased by $56.0 million, which is predominantly due to additional awards received since the budget was adopted as shown on Schedule II.  

Neither the final calculation for fiscal year 2022-23 nor the first principal apportionment (P1) for 2023-24 have been released as of February 2, 2024. The P1 is based upon attendance reporting submitted January 15th along with projected enrollment fee and property tax revenues. Under the new formula, attendance, outcomes, and demographic data from the three most recent prior years are used to calculate the District’s entitlement. The District’s 2023-24 adopted X budget was established under the assumption that there would be no change in full-time equivalent students from the 2022-23 fiscal year, and this assumption remains unchanged. Upon issuance of P1, the staff will revise the 2023-24 projections, and any necessary adjustments will be incorporated into the second budget revision, scheduled for presentation at the June meeting. As usual, the District continues to operate at the X budget level.  

**Revisions to other District funds due to:** 26
<!-- Page 27 -->
![HOME](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

3. Instructionally-Related Activities (Schedule III): Changes to revenue and the appropriation of uncommitted fund balance.  
4. Child Development (Schedule IV): The increase in revenue can be attributed to the receipt of additional awards subsequent to the adoption of the budget, coupled with an increase in reimbursement rates facilitated by the Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA).  
5. Capital Outlay Projects (Schedule V): Changes reflect the budgeting of program development funds designated for capital outlay and other miscellaneous spending plan adjustments.  
6. Self Insurance (Schedule VI): There has been a rise in insurance premiums, accompanied by minor adjustments in funding and appropriations for the dental program.  
7. Student Financial Aid (Schedule VII): There is an increase in State Categorical programs transferred from the General Fund.  
8. Regional Performing Arts Center (Schedule VIII): Adjustments reflect the updated forecast of events and activities taking place at the Center.  
9. Student Association Trust (Schedule IX): Changes reflect the appropriation of beginning fund balance.  
10. Los Rios Colleges Foundation (Schedule X): There is a boost in projected donations, accompanied by revisions to the associated fund balance.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the revised budgets for the General, Instructionally Related Activities, Child Development, Capital Outlay Projects, Self Insurance, Student Financial Aid, Regional Performing Arts Center, Student Associations Trust, and Los Rios Colleges Foundation funds shown on the attached schedules, and that the related documents be filed with the County Superintendent of Schools.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** February 14, 2024

---

**SUBJECT:** 2024-25 Nonresident Tuition and Student Capital Outlay Fees  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 1  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item G  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
Education Code 76140 requires governing boards to establish a nonresident tuition fee for the succeeding fiscal year no later than March 1st of each year. Since the District does not receive any State funds for the education of out-of-state and international students, the District is required to assess these students for the cost of their education.

As prescribed in statute, the governing board may choose between these six (6) specified fee calculation options:  
1. Los Rios' Current Expense for Education (CEE) per unit of Full-Time Equivalent Students (FTES) for 2022-23, increased by the projected compounded factor for the increase in the U.S. Consumer Price Index (USCPI) for the current and succeeding fiscal years (two-year-period).  
2. The statewide average CEE per unit of FTES (2022-23) increased by the two-year projected USCPI increase.  
3. A unit rate no greater than a contiguous district's established rate.  
4. A unit rate greater than the statewide average and less than the district’s calculated rate. (This option is only available to districts whose calculated rate is greater than the statewide average rate.)  
5. Highest statewide calculated average rate for the succeeding, current and the past four years (highest calculated rate during these six years).  
6. No more than the average of the nonresident tuition fees of public community colleges in no less than 12 states that are comparable to California in cost of living.  

Districts may also elect to charge a capital outlay fee to nonresident students.

The District’s 2023-24 nonresident tuition is $414 per unit and the 2023-24 capital outlay fee is $20 per unit.

**STATUS:**

A. The calculated 2024-25 nonresident tuition rate per the six options above are:

1. Los Rios Current Expense of Education (CEE), per unit $380
2. Statewide average CEE unit rate $406
3. No more than a contiguous district’s established rate, or as recommended to its governing board (additional information below) n/a
4. Any rate greater than option 2 and less than option 1
5. Highest of the statewide calculated average rates for last six years (2019-20 to 2024-25) $414
6. No more than the average of the nonresident tuition fees of public community colleges in no less than 12 comparable states (calculated by CCCCO) $432

| Option 3 | Nonresident Tuition |
|----------|---------------------|
| Contiguous Districts | Current Rate (2023-24) | Proposed Rate (2024-25) |
| Lake Tahoe | $414* | TBD* |
| San Joaquin Delta | $292 | TBD |
| Sierra Joint | $414 | TBD |
| Solano County | $368 | TBD |
| Yuba | $295 | TBD |

*Semester-equivalent unit rate, converted from the actual quarterly unit rate.

The rates proposed for 2024-25 by contiguous districts were not available at the time the agenda was prepared.

Since at least the 2011-12 academic year, the Board has adopted nonresident tuition rates based on option 5. Historically, both option 2 and option 5 have produced similar outcomes, demonstrating consistent stability with moderate increases. However, the anticipated two-year USCPI projection for 2024-25 has decreased from the previously projected 9.7% for 2023-24 to 5.4%, resulting in a lower rate for option 2. Option 1 has spiked up and down in recent years due to fluctuations in Full-Time Equivalent Students (FTES) and categorical funding. The unpredictable nature of these fluctuations renders Option 1 less desirable as an option. Option 6 historically has not aligned with the District's goal of providing access to nonresident students to enhance the diversity of our student body; consequently, we have not considered that a viable option. The recommendation is to opt for option 2 at a rate of $406 per unit. This decision sets a slightly lower rate than option 5, effectively optimizing a pathway for student access and success, all while ensuring reasonable rate stability.

B. Capital Outlay Fee:

In addition to the nonresident tuition fee, Education Code 76141 authorizes districts to charge nonresident students a capital outlay fee not to exceed the prior year’s expenditures for capital outlay per unit of instruction. The calculated capital outlay fee for 2024-25 is $45 per unit, which is the maximum rate that may be used. It is recommended that the capital outlay fee be set at the rate of $20 for 2024-25.

Historical data regarding nonresident tuition and international student capital outlay fee and other informational schedules are attached.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt for 2024-25, a nonresident tuition fee rate of $406 per unit effective for the summer 2024 term. In addition, it is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt for 2024-25, the student capital outlay fee of $20 per unit to be assessed to all nonresident students also effective for the summer 2024 term.

These items have a value of less than $5,000.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** February 14, 2024

---

**SUBJECT:** LRCEA Classified Salary Schedule Revision, Interim 2023-2024  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

---

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item N  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance & Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

---

**STATUS:**  
Effective January 1, 2024, the proposed Interim 2023-2024 LRCEA Classified Salary Schedule would be modified as reflected in the attachment.

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
The LRCEA and District representatives of the Joint Job Classification Review Committee met to review the Athletic Trainer job description. The committee recognized the evolving challenges with the Athletic Trainer classification, including but not limited to, the increase in minimum qualifications for Athletic Trainer certification, the critical role of the Athletic Trainer to provide immediate emergency care at athletic games, the role in risk management mitigation, and the continued difficulty to recruit for permanent and part-time positions in order to meet the requirement that an Athletic Trainer be in attendance at all intercollegiate sports activities.

As a result of these challenges and after a salary review of similar positions in higher education, the committee agreed to the salary change to the Athletic Trainer position in order to be more competitive and to increase applicant pools for both temporary and regular positions. The District proposes to increase the pay from Range 37 (Annual Salary $66,404 - $80,790) to Range 41 (Annual Salary $72,727 - $88,483).

---

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the revised Interim 2023-2024 LRCEA Classified Salary Schedule with the classification changes.

**SUBJECT:** Ratification of Emergency Repair – SCC Garage Elevator  
**ATTACHMENT:** None  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
On September 25, 2023, Facilities Maintenance was notified of excessive water in the elevator shaft of two passenger elevators at the southeast corner of Sacramento City College parking structure. Further investigation revealed that water infiltration damaged several mechanical and electronic components needed for the proper and safe operation of the elevators. Facility Maintenance determined that repairing the elevators was an emergency given the parking structure is five-stories high, are used daily by students and staff, and are needed to keep the facility in compliance with state and county ADA regulations. On January 26, 2024, Facilities Maintenance initiated a purchase order/contract with Elevator Industries in an amount not to exceed $200,000 for emergency repair of the two passenger elevators due to water damage. The repairs are still pending.

Consistent with the California Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act, Administrative Regulation 8312 authorizes, in cases of emergency, the repair or replacement of public facilities without plans, specifications, details, or notice of bids to let contracts. The Board has authorized the Chancellor or designee to enter into emergency contracts for the repair or replacement of Los Rios public facilities.

Administrative Regulation 8321, Section 3.1 requires the board to be noticed of emergency repairs within 7 days or at its next regularly scheduled meeting which shall be no more than 14 days after the action was taken. The Chancellor or designee must report on the emergency repair at each subsequent meeting until the contract is completed or terminated.

---

**STATUS:**  
Pursuant to Public Contract Code, section 22050(b)(1) the emergency transaction herein listed is presented for approval and/or ratification.

**BACKGROUND:**  
On August 15, 2023, Facilities Maintenance discovered water damage to the wheelchair lift at the Cosumnes River College soccer/football stadium due to exposure to weather. Water infiltration damaged several mechanical and electronic components needed for the proper and safe operation of the lift. Facility Maintenance determined that repairing the lift was an emergency given it is the only wheelchair lift serving the stadium and is needed to keep the facility in compliance with state and county ADA regulations. On January 31, 2024, Facilities Maintenance initiated a purchase order/contract with Elevator Industries in an amount not to exceed $200,000 for emergency repair of the wheelchair lift due to water damage. The repairs are still pending.

Consistent with the California Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act, Administrative Regulation 8312 authorizes, in cases of emergency, the repair or replacement of public facilities without plans, specifications, details, or notice of bids to let contracts. The Board has authorized the Chancellor or designee to enter into emergency contracts for the repair or replacement of Los Rios public facilities.

Administrative Regulation 8321, Section 3.1 requires the board to be noticed of emergency repairs within 7 days or at its next regularly scheduled meeting which shall be no more than 14 days after the action was taken. The Chancellor or designee must report on the emergency repair at each subsequent meeting until the contract is completed or terminated.

**STATUS:**  
Pursuant to Public Contract Code, section 22050(b)(1) the emergency transaction herein listed is presented for approval and/or ratification.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** February 14, 2024

**SUBJECT:** CRC’s Efforts to Serve Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Students  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 2, 3  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Information Item B  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Ed Bush, President  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
With a focus on Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI), the APIDA HAWKS Center fosters a welcoming environment where students can proudly celebrate their cultural heritage and express their authentic selves through various programs and activities. Cultural celebrations organized by the APIDA HAWKS Center serve as powerful affirmations of CRC AANHPI students' identities. These programs encourage students to explore their intersecting identities, both formally through programs and informally through community interactions. The CRC AANAPISI and HSI are setting a unique example of collaboration among Minority Serving Institutions. Unlike many other dual-designated Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) that often operate independently, CRC fosters close collaboration between the APIDA HAWKS and MI CASA centers. Beyond campus, the APIDA HAWKS Center plays a leading role in the largest AANAPISI Cooperative in the nation. This leadership culminated in hosting the first Student Leadership Conference, which brought together over 200 AANHPI participants from seven different colleges. In addition, the APIDA HAWKS Center actively builds partnerships with AANHPI organizations and businesses to support CRC AANHPI students.

**STATUS:**  
CRC students, faculty, classified staff, and managers will deliver a presentation highlighting the comprehensive support services available to students identifying with the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) community at Cosumnes River College. The presentation will encompass a holistic approach to serving the AANHPI community, featuring disaggregated data, specific services provided, and student testimonials.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
This item is presented for the Board of Trustees’ information and discussion.
