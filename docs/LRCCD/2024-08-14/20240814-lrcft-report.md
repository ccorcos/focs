**LRCFT report to the LRCCD Board of Trustees**  
**August 14, 2024**

It has been a long, busy, and successful summer for the LRCFT.

We met weekly with our LRCCD partners in the past three months to reach a new agreement to maintain faculty participation in the District’s Prison and Reentry Education Program. We are happy to report that our new and lengthy MOU promises to provide greater protections for our faculty who teach in the program.

We also appreciate recent negotiations surrounding our 4% COLA and 11% Retro.

In July, the LRCFT Exec. Board attended the AFT convention in Houston, Texas. We witnessed the AFT endorse Kamala Harris for President, the first national union to do so.

The LRCFT PAC continues to interview candidates for endorsement in the upcoming November general elections. We did an early endorsement in May of Dr. Colette Harris Mathews for Los Rios trustee, and will this month endorse other trustees who have reached out to us.

In September we will join 90 other unions and their family members in Sacramento at the Central Labor Council’s annual Labor Day picnic.

This semester our Exec. Board will finalize a revamping of our internal policies, including the creation of a new district-wide stewards network to encourage more faculty to be involved in union activity.

The LRCFT has joined our union siblings SEIU and LRCEA in signing on to a joint letter attached to my board report. I look forward to answering any questions or taking part in discussion arising from this document in the future.

Thank you.

**JOINT STATEMENT FROM SEIU 1021, LRCFT, & LRCEA**  
**August 17th, 2024**

**BUCKET STATEMENT**

All Unions at Los Rios (SEIU 1021, LRCFT, and LRCEA) jointly propose that the bargaining units’ share of revenue be increased from eighty percent (80%) to eighty-five percent (85%) of District revenue. We propose that each bargaining unit receive its proportionate share of eighty-five (85%) of certain new or increased unrestricted revenue that is above the established based amounts. This adjustment is necessary to ensure that the employees who serve the students and the citizens of the Los Rios Community College District are able to keep up with regional increases in the costs of healthcare, housing, gas, groceries, childcare, and college costs. The District should be able to maintain its fiscal.

**HEALTHCARE**

All unions at Los Rios (SEIU 1021, LRCFT, and LRCEA) jointly propose to economically analyze and negotiate regarding new healthcare design. Our new healthcare plan would start in October of 2025. The District shall work with the Unions to design and pay for a fiscal analysis of a system such as UC Davis where there are both salary/classification tiers and dependent tiers. We would negotiate during academic calendar year 24-25 with the goal of implementing by open enrollment of 2025-26. (October 2025). We believe this can be done with or without impacting the bucket system.

**STREAMING BOARD MEETINGS**

The Los Rios Community College District Board of Trustees meets monthly to discharge its public duty of transparent and open stewardship of the state’s second-largest community college district. In the interests of maximizing student, employee, and public awareness of the Board’s deliberations and actions, the employee unions at Los Rios (SEIU 1021, LRCFT, and LRCEA) request that the Board approve live internet streaming of its monthly meetings. This would allow Los Rios students and employees, as well as the citizens served by the college district, to more easily follow the workings of this socially, economically, and educationally indispensable public institution.
