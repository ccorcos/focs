In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.  

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

The funds should be invested with care, skill, prudence, and diligence with the goal of producing returns equal to or exceeding prevailing standards among foundations of similar asset size, as well as for the protection of funds held in perpetual duration. The Statement defines the investment guidelines for specified asset classes for endowed funds as follows: equities, defined as common stock, convertible preferred stock, convertible bonds, and convertible stock, shall represent 25-60% of the total fund assets; fixed-income securities, defined as investments with maturities greater than one year that pay a fixed rate of return, shall represent 17-50% of the total assets; alternative investments, defined as fund-of-fund investments, shall represent up to 20% of the total fund assets; and cash, defined as maturities shorter than one year, shall represent 2-10% of the total fund assets. In addition, the Statement provides guidelines for investing non-endowed funds based upon the purpose of the donation and the horizon of time for the use of funds. The three non-endowed portfolio funds available are cash management, fixed income, and balanced funds.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** August 14, 2024

---

**SUBJECT:** Disposition of Surplus Equipment – Salvage Value Greater than $5,000  
**ATTACHMENT:** None  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item E  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
The Education Code regulates the procedure by which a community college district can dispose of real and personal property. Education Code section 81450-81450.5 provides that the governing board may, sell for cash, exchange for value or donate any personal property belonging to the district if the property is not required for school purposes, or if it should be disposed of for the purpose of replacement, or if it is unsatisfactory or not suitable for school use. The methods for disposal differ based upon the estimated value of the equipment. Whereas most equipment is disposed of either through the State of California or, if the State will not accept, through a scrap dealer, items with a value greater than $5,000 either individually or in aggregate, require a public auction, noticed as required by law.

**STATUS:**  
The District will auction the following items which in aggregate have a value greater than $5,000:  
- (2) 2001 Toyota Prius  
- 2003 Crown Victoria  
- (3) 2005 Ford E-250  
- 2000 Ford E-150  
- 1991 EZ-GO Electric Cart  
- 2000 Taylor Dunn B2-10  
- 1975 GMC Dump Truck  
- 2008 Dodge Charger  
- 1998 Ford E-150  
- 2007 Ford E-250  
- (2) 2003 Ford E-250  
- 2006 Ford F-350  
- 2006 Ford F-250  
- 1998 Chevrolet 2500 P.U.  
- 2001 Ford F-150  
- 1999 Ford Ranger  
- (5) 2005 Ford F-250  
- 2005 Ford Ranger  
- 2007 Ford Ranger  
- 2006 Ford E-250  
- 2009 Toyota Prius.  

Due to the poor condition of each item, the equipment is no longer suitable for school use. The District, via public auction, intends to sell to the highest bidder or donate to an interested school/public entity.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the disposal of the listed items per Education Code section 81450-81450.5.

**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**STATUS:**  
The Education Code regulates the procedures by which a Community College District can dispose of real and personal property. Education Code section 81452 provides that the governing board may, by unanimous vote, dispose of items valued at $5,000 or less by private sale without advertising or selling the items at public auction. The District has held previous auctions, but they have generally cost more than they have netted for the District.

The District has a quantity of surplus materials that needs to be disposed of, such as outdated desks and computers. The District has located a scrap dealer who will take selected surplus items for recycling. Any items remaining will be disposed of.

The surplus items to be recycled or disposed of are either irreparable, obsolete, in poor condition or not needed for district/college operations and include the following: 3 Chromebooks; 38 computers; 21 laptops; 27 monitors; 1 network analyzer; 2 printers; 1 Probook and 1 UPS unit.

These items have a value of less than $5,000.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the disposal of the listed items per Education Code section 81452.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** August 14, 2024

**SUBJECT:** Pay Rate Schedules for 2024-25 and Final Salary Improvement for 2023-24  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
In August 2011, CalPERS established regulations outlining a “publicly available pay schedule” required for calculating base salary in retirement benefits. One of these requirements is that the Board approves salary schedules. Additionally, CalPERS defined a “labor policy or agreement” for substantiating special compensation items, which must specify the exact conditions of payment. Any document, including a publicly available pay schedule, can be considered a “labor policy or agreement” if it meets the specified requirements.

For CalSTRS members, one-time off-salary schedule payments based on additional or remaining funds at the year-end, in accordance with Education Code section 22119.2 and California Code of Regulations, Title 5, Section 27401, qualify as remuneration in addition to salary, which is treated differently from ongoing salary for purposes of pension calculations. Such payments are reportable for CalSTRS Classic Members (2% at 60) but not for CalSTRS PEPRA members (2% at 62).

**STATUS:**  
The regulations require the identification of job classification titles, pay rates for each job classification, time base (e.g., annual), and effective dates, including any revisions. The 2024-25 salary schedules adhere to the District's collective bargaining agreements' compensation formula.

The 2024-25 state budget includes a 1.07% cost of living adjustment (COLA), and with strategic enrollment management, FTES reporting, and prudent budgeting practices, units have continuing resources. LRCEA is adding a seventh (7th) step at 4% before applying a continuing improvement to the salary schedule. The recommended continuing improvements to the salary schedule are: LRCFT, LRSA, SEIU, Confidentials, and Management at 4%, and LRCEA at 1.66%, in addition to the 7th step. Upon adopting the attached salary schedules, a retroactive payment for services in July 2024 will be processed by August 23rd, with potential delays for the LRCEA 7th step until September.

Additionally, units have sufficient resources to provide an 11% retroactive salary schedule improvement for fiscal year 2023-24. This retroactive improvement will be reported as limited-term remuneration for CalSTRS Classic Members and is not reportable to CalSTRS PEPRA and CalPERS members.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
It is recommended the Board of Trustees adopt and approve the attached 2023-24 and 2024-25 salary schedules for all groups and individuals and the MOUs for each represented unit.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT
## Memorandum of Understanding
### RetroActive Salary Schedule Improvement 2023-24 and Continuing 2024-25 Improvement
### LRCEA

**Background**

Due to the hold harmless provision in the Student Centered Funding Formula, strategic enrollment management, reporting of FTES, and our prudent budgeting practices, we are able to provide an ongoing schedule increase for the fiscal year 2024-25. For LRCEA, the recommendation includes an ongoing schedule improvement of 1.66%. The available 4% improvement is reduced by the addition of a seventh step at 4%, estimated to cost 2.34% of the total available improvement. For 2024-25, LRCEA will not be including any substantial amounts not previously agreed upon to offset the anticipated increased medical premiums.

Any residual funds from the 2023-24 compensation calculation will be carried forward to 2024-25 and any residual 2024-25 funds will be carried forward to 2025-26. Those funds will be available to the units to support compensation cost increases/improvements in 2025-26.

**The following is agreed to:**

### 2023-24 Retroactive salary schedule improvement

The 2023-24 off salary schedule payments will be calculated at 11% of the interim salary schedule. This will be paid in August 2024 and is the final improvement for the 2023-24 year.

Any residual funds from 2023-24 will be carried forward to 2024-25.

### 2024-25 Continuing Salary schedule improvement

The 2023-24 base salary schedules will be improved by a 1.66% advance against 2024-25 new revenue with an effective date of 7/1/2024 and payments updated in August 2024.

Step 7 will be added to the salary schedule at 4%, at an estimated cost of $1,344,693, with an effective date of 7/1/2024 and payments updated in September 2024.

Residual funds from the 2024-25 calculation will be carried forward to 2025-26.

## Memorandum of Understanding
### RetroActive Salary Schedule Improvement 2023-24 and Continuing 2024-25 Improvement
#### SEIU

**Background**

Due to the hold harmless provision in the Student Centered Funding Formula, strategic enrollment management, reporting of FTES, unused ongoing resources to address long-term increases for CalPERS and CalSTRS, and other resources, the unit has ample one-time resources available.

The District is recommending to all units a one-time salary schedule improvement of 11% for 2023-24.

Due to the 2024-25 state budget providing a 1.07% cost of living adjustment (COLA), along with strategic enrollment management, reporting of FTES, and our prudent budgeting practices, we are able to provide a 4% ongoing schedule increase for the fiscal year 2024-25. For 2024-25, SEIU will not be including any additional substantial amounts not previously agreed upon to offset the anticipated increased medical premiums.

Any residual funds from the 2023-24 compensation calculation will be carried forward to 2024-25 and any residual 2024-25 funds will be carried forward to 2025-26. Those funds will be available to the units to support compensation cost increases/improvements in 2025-26.

## Memorandum of Understanding
### RetroActive Salary Schedule Improvement 2023-24 and Continuing 2024-25 Improvement
### LRSA

### Background
Due to the hold harmless provision in the Student Centered Funding Formula, strategic enrollment management, reporting of FTES, unused ongoing resources to address long-term increases for CalPERS and CalSTRS, and other resources, the unit has ample one-time resources available.

The District is recommending to all units a one-time salary schedule improvement of 11% for 2023-24 salary.

Due to the 2024-25 state budget providing a 1.07% cost of living adjustment (COLA), along with strategic enrollment management, reporting of FTES, and our prudent budgeting practices, we are able to provide a 4% ongoing schedule increase for the fiscal year 2024-25. For 2024-25, LRSA will not be including any substantial amounts not previously agreed upon to offset the anticipated increased medical premiums.

Any residual funds from the 2023-24 compensation calculation will be carried forward to 2024-25 and any residual 2024-25 funds will be carried forward to 2025-26. Those funds will be available to the units to support compensation cost increases/improvements in 2025-26.

### The following is agreed to:

#### 2023-24 Retroactive salary schedule improvement
The 2023-24 off salary schedule payments will be calculated at 11% of the interim salary schedule. This will be paid in August 2024 and is the final improvement for the 2023-24 year.

Any residual funds from 2023-24 will be carried forward to 2024-25.

#### 2024-25 Continuing Salary schedule improvement
The 2024-25 base salary schedules will be improved by a 4% advance against 2024-25 new revenue with effective date of 7/1/2024 and payments updated in August 2024.

Residual funds from the 2024-25 calculation will be carried forward to 2025-26.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** August 14, 2024

---

**SUBJECT:** Resolution 2024-09: Cosumnes River College – Culinary Arts Remodel  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item B  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
Public Contract Code Section 20659 allows change orders for the change or alteration of a contract in the amount up to ten percent (10%) of the original contract price without competitively bidding the change. In the case of *Grayson v. Pasadena*, the court recognized an exception to this rule in special circumstances where the requirements of the bidding would not be useful or would produce no advantage and therefore would be undesirable, impractical or impossible. In that case, the court allowed the county to issue a change order to a construction contract more than 10% without competitively bidding the change.

**STATUS:**  
In April 2023, the Board approved a contract for the remodel of the Cosumnes River College Culinary Arts facility for $5,564,000. It is a campus-funded project that reconfigures the existing kitchen to provide a clear separation between the food service area and the Culinary Arts program. It also includes reconfiguring two existing spaces into a working restaurant-quality teaching kitchen and dining room. To date, approximately 8.2% of change orders have been authorized to address unexpected situations and other modifications. These change orders were required primarily due to inaccurate as-built documents and minor undocumented building modifications over the years.

The project is now 75% complete and we have encountered several significant unforeseen conditions in the building’s existing utility infrastructure and structure. Correction of these conditions is required for the work to proceed. These corrections include the replacement and repairing of approximately one hundred lineal feet of broken under-slab sewer lines, the repair of unrevealed roof leaks and replacement of several hundred square feet of roofing, roofing substrate and structural wood beams to address the dry rot caused by the leak. These unknowns along with multiple smaller items have resulted in the project having reached the ten percent (10%) maximum allowable change order threshold allowed by the District. To complete the project, we estimate the

District will need to approve a maximum of thirteen percent (13%) in change order percentage (3% over the existing 10% limit). For reference, the original contract amount is $5,564,000 and with thirteen percent (13%) in change orders, the total to complete the project would be $6,287,320. As with all change orders, the contractor’s pricing is reviewed and validated by the District staff as well as the project’s architect and engineers.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve Resolution No. 2024:09, authorizing the Chancellor or designee to approve the change orders to the Cosumnes River College Culinary Arts Remodel project exceeding the 10% threshold not-to-exceed 13.

# RESOLUTION
No 2024:09

## COSUMNES RIVER COLLEGE CULINARY ARTS REMODEL CHANGE ORDER

WHEREAS, Public Contract Code Section 20659 requires that changes to a community college public construction contract in excess of ten percent (10%) of the original contract price must be competitively bid; and

WHEREAS, California Courts have provide a limited exception of the bidding requirements if competitive proposals would not be useful, or would not produce an advantage, and would thus be undesirable, impractical or impossible (see Graydon v. Pasadena Redevelopment Agency (1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 631); and

WHEREAS, there are sufficient facts relating to this project to make the findings necessary under the Graydon case to approve a change order in excess of 10% of the original contract price without going out to competitive bid;

BE IT RESOLVED as follows:

1. The above-recited facts are true and correct.

2. The facts upon which the Board makes the findings necessary under the Graydon case are as follows:
   a. On April 2023, the Board of Trustees authorized entering into a contract with F&H Construction in the amount of $5,564,000 for the remodel of the Culinary Arts facility at Cosumnes River College; and
   b. This project has experienced several unusual events requiring adjustments during the course of construction due to inaccurate as-built drawings from the initial construction and other undocumented alterations; and
   c. In addition, several unforeseen conditions have been discovered requiring extensive corrective and repair work; and
   d. These changes and complications with under-slab work and the building’s roof structure require significant additional costs in order to complete the project and will result in change orders that will cause the cost of the project to exceed 10% of the contract amount.

3. Based upon the foregoing facts, this Board hereby finds that putting change order work exceeding the 10% threshold out to bid would not be useful or produce an advantage and therefore is undesirable and impractical; and  

4. The Board further finds and declares that it is the best interest of the District and its taxpayers that the competitive bidding requirements for the work associated with change orders exceeding the 10% threshold are dispensed with. The Board hereby authorizes the Chancellor or designee to approve change orders with F&H Construction in the total amount up to $723,320, thereby exceeding the 10% threshold by an amount not-to-exceed $116,920.  

PASSED AND ADOPTED as Los Rios Community College District Resolution № 2024:09 this fourteenth day of August 2024, by the following called vote:  

AYES  NOES  ABSENT  

Pam Haynes, Board President

Brian King  
Chancellor and Secretary to the Board
