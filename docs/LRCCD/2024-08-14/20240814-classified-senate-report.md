At FLC our classified staff are gearing up for the Fall semester and getting ready to welcome our students, staff and faculty back to campus. We have had some very successful outreach recruiting with Super Saturday that was held on Saturday Aug 10th. We also held Super Thursday events at RCC & EDC on July 18th & July 25th. These are enrollment fairs that our Student Services departments have hosted for new and prospective students. These events were created to help prospective students navigate enrollment as well as have info for all the wrap around services available on campus.

We will also be holding Falcon Launch for all our first time students to get orientated to campus and the many services available to them. For the first time, we will be holding Falcon Launch over 2 days since we filled up with reservations so early.

The El Dorado Center welcomes the Mountainside Middle College High School during the first week of August. Mountainside students will officially start high school classes on Monday Aug. 12th and the Freshman class will all have dual enrollment classes in HCD, Library Science & Fitness, as part of their schedule. So far, we have an additional 41 students enrolled in dual enrollment classes of their choosing. We may still be processing more applications before FLC Fall semester starts. It has been a great partnership with EDCOE, and we are very excited to welcome Mountainside Middle College High School to our campus.

As classified staff are looking forward to a very successful Fall semester as well as celebrating our 20th anniversary at FLC in September, and our 30th anniversary at EDC in October.

The SCC Classified Senate hosted a popsicle social at the end of July to celebrate the end of summer with over 75 Classified Professionals being able to enjoy the treat. The executive team plans to host in-person activities throughout the year as we continue to engage on campus more. The Senate also contacted all Classified Professionals to encourage participation on committees for various activities, as all are welcome to volunteer for planning and facilitation of events.
