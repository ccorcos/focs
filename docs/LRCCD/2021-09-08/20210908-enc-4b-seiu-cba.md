The Union shall provide the District with a schedule of such dues for nine-month, ten-month, eleven-month, and twelve-month employees covered by this Agreement.

(c) Requests to authorize dues/other deduction(s) or requests to change status regarding such deductions, shall be directed to the Union rather than the employer. The District shall rely on the Union’s explanations in a certified list, submitted by a representative of the Union who has authority to bind the Union, regarding whether an authorization/change in deduction(s) has been requested by the employee.

The District shall deduct from pay of Union members and pay the Union the normal and regular monthly Union member dues, assessments, and initiation fees. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to have altered the district’s current obligation to make insurance program deductions when requested by the employee or political action deductions when requested by the Union.

(d) The Union shall not provide the employer a copy of the employee’s authorization unless a dispute arises about the existence or terms of the authorization.

The Union and the District have agreed that the Union shall provide the District a current statement of membership dues. Such statement of membership dues shall be amended as necessary. The District may take up to 30 days from date of receipt of the amended statement of membership dues to implement such changes.

(e) The District and the Union agree that each party will mutually cooperate in ensuring that all provisions of this Article 5 are implemented in a timely and comprehensive manner.

The District shall, at the time of any individual’s initial employment/transfer to a job covered by a unit classification, furnish to that employee the membership enrollment card or other Union membership application/authorization, addressed to the Union (prepared and furnished by the Union).

# Article 9: Leaves With Pay

For leave reporting purposes under Article 9, reference to a day means an eight (8) hour day, or a pro-rata thereof if the employee works less than eight (8) hours in a given day. If the employee works an alternate work schedule, thereby working more than eight (8) hours in a given day, the word “day” is not intended to include the additional hours, except in the Articles related to Industrial Accident and Illness, Short-term Military Leave, Bereavement, Birth of Child, Critical Illness and Quarantine leaves. This definition is not intended to change the meaning of a ‘calendar day.’

## 9.1 Sick Leave – Personal Illness

### 9.1.1 Sick Leave Accrual
A regular full-time classified employee covered by this Agreement shall earn one (1) day of sick leave for each full month of completed service (75% or more of the paid-status days in a calendar month). For less than seventy-five percent (75%) time, the employee will receive a pro rata amount. Regular part-time employees earn sick leave in proportion to the ratio their total work week hours bear to a 40-hour week. [Example: Part-time employee working twenty (20) hours per week, twelve (12) months a year, earns forty-eight (48) hours or six (6) days a year.]

### 9.1.2 Use of Accrued Sick Leave
Earned or advanced sick leave will be allowed when an employee is unable to work because of illness, pregnancy, or injury. Unused sick leave may be accrued indefinitely and, upon retirement, may or may not be added to retirement benefits depending upon PERS regulations in effect upon retirement.

#### 9.1.2.1
Absence(s) which are chargeable to sick leave are the actual hours which the employee would have worked had the employee served during the day.

#### 9.1.2.2
An employee with more than six (6) months' service who has used all accrued sick leave will be advanced as much sick leave as the person could earn during the remainder of the fiscal year. An employee with six (6) or less months of service will be advanced the remainder of six (6) days of earnable sick leave.

#### 9.1.2.3
An employee who at the time of termination has taken more sick leave than he/she has accrued shall reimburse the District for the value of the difference. Whenever an employee is reemployed within a twelve-month period following termination of services, unused sick leave from the prior period of employment shall be reinstated.

### 9.1.3 Advance Notice
An employee shall notify his/her supervisor of the illness at least two (2) hours prior to the beginning of the assigned shifts. Except for Police Officers, if the supervisor (or designee) is not present or at a work site where notification cannot be left on voice mail, the employee shall notify the respective supervisor (or designee) as soon as possible but prior to the beginning of his/her shift. For notification of absence due to illness, Police Officers shall speak with Dispatch at least two (2) hours prior to the beginning of the assigned shift.

9.10.3 Jury duty is an essential civic service and only in those cases where an employee's absence would result in a serious handicap to the specific operating unit will the Director of Human Resources, upon the advice of the administrative officer or facility director, request the jury commissioner to consider deferment of said employee's obligation to serve. In no case will the employee's supervisor instruct the employee to obtain an exemption, except that the Board may, however, provide by rule that only a percentage of its classified staff, which percentage shall not be less than two percent (2%), shall be granted such leave with pay at any one time.

## 11.4 Longevity Increment
### 11.4.1
A regular employee who has satisfactorily served the District for ten (10) full years will receive a longevity increment of four percent (4%). An add. 

Optional longevity increment of four percent (4%) after fifteen (15) years of service will also be provided.

## 11.7 Working Out of Classification
### 11.7.1

11.7.2 Employees so assigned will be paid at Step 1 of the appropriate range for the position that the employee is filling on a temporary basis or at an increase of one step above the monthly salary earned in his/her regularly assigned position, whichever is greater.

11.7.3 The District shall not be capricious in making assignments out of classification.

11.7.4 The employee working out of classification will be returned to regular classification with attending changes in rate of pay upon completion of the temporary assignment or in case it is necessary to replace the temporarily assigned employee because of illness or annual vacation.

11.7.5 Out of Class Assignments  
When supervisors assign employees to work out of class for an extended period [more than five (5) days in a fifteen (15) day period or longer], every effort shall be made to ensure that any contiguous assignment be given to a single employee and not be divided between different employees.

When the District discovers the error, the Human Resources or Payroll Department shall notify the employee in writing of the nature of the overpayment and the amount owed. The employee will be provided options for repaying the amount due. Employees who do not respond to such request may have their debt referred to a collection agency.

### 11.10.2  
Any amounts due the District and noted below will be deducted from future salary warrants:

11.10.2.1 when the overpayment is due to union or health premiums not being deducted in the prior month; or  

11.10.2.2 when the overpayment is the result of overuse of leave privileges; or  

11.10.2.3 when the overpayment is an adjustment related to military duty leave differential pay referenced in Article 9.9; or  

11.10.2.4 when the overpayment is a statutory deduction (e.g. – CalSTRS, CalPERS, taxes, etc.).

### 11.10.3  
If the employee terminates employment with the District, the remaining balance will be deducted in full from the final pay warrant, any retroactive salary schedule improvement payment and/or the payment for any outstanding vacation day accruals.

### 11.10.4  
Regular employees working less than twelve (12) months a year will continue any repayment plan during their non-scheduled months by remitting the appropriate payment to the District Payroll Department by the first of each month, unless other arrangements have been made.

# Article 12: Fringe Benefits & Insurance Programs

## 12.1 Medical/Dental (Health) Insurance

### 12.1.1 
The District shall provide coverage for medical and dental insurance for members of the unit through plans recommended by the Insurance Review Committee (IRC) and adopted by the District. The SEIU unit may appoint a unit member as their representative to this committee.

### 12.1.2 
The District shall make a monthly contribution for the employee and dependent(s) medical and dental insurance coverage. Any change in the contribution will be agreed to by the District and SEIU prior to the annual open enrollment period each year for the coverage year starting July 1st. Should the premium rate structure for District medical and/or dental plans be changed to a tiered structure, the District shall meet and confer with Union representatives regarding the effects of such a change.

### 12.1.3 
The established District contribution levels as described in Appendix A for medical and dental coverage for full-time unit shall be applied towards the premium cost of the selected plan to each participating unit member who has a regularly assigned work year of fifty (50%) or more of a full-time equivalent (FTE) position.

#### 12.1.3.1 
A full-time equivalent position is based upon an assigned twelve (12) month work year and regularly scheduled to work forty (40) hours per week.

#### 12.1.3.2 
The determination of the less than full-time equivalent factor shall be based upon the authorized FTE level established for the position. Intermittent or nonregularly scheduled hourly work which may occur during non-regular paid periods shall not be used in the determination of the FTE factor or the related District contribution level.

#### 12.1.3.3 
For each participating member whose regularly assigned work schedule is less than fifty percent (50%) of a full-time equivalent (FTE) position, the District contribution level shall be a proportionate amount of the maximum amount per section 12.1.3 above. For example, the District contribution level for a regular employee working ten hours per week for ten months would be twenty one percent (21%), which is computed as follows:

10 hours/40 hours = 25%

10 months/12 months = 83%

25% x 83% = 20.8% of the maximum District contribution level.

#### 12.1.3.4 
Participating unit members who incur a loss of pay in which the time off is not covered under Five Month Law leave or State or Federal leaves, such as FMLA/CFRA, will receive a District contribution towards

12.1.3.5 At the time of separation from service, unit members will receive the District contribution level for medical and dental coverage in paid status or covered under Five Month Leave, or State or Federal leaves such as FMLA/CFRA, for at least 50% of the full-time hours payable in that month. Participating unit members who are in paid status for less than 50% of the payable full-time hours of the last month worked will receive a proportionate share of the District contribution based on the number of hours the employee is in paid status or covered under Five Month Leave, or State or Federal leaves such as FMLA/CFRA, compared to the number of full-time hours payable in that month.

12.1.4 The District contribution for medical premiums will be made to the District’s carriers. The carriers and medical plan options are reviewed annually by the Insurance Review Committee.

12.1.5 The District will pay the above-stated premium for medical insurance coverage for the employee as long as he/she remains in the paid status. Premiums for nine-, ten-, and eleven-month employees will be paid by the District during regular non-pay months as prescribed in Section 12.1.3. Any out-of-pocket costs for the selected medical insurance shall be deducted over the pay period of the employee.

12.1.6 Unit members who terminate employment may continue in the District's health/medical programs in accordance with policy provisions at the member’s own expense.

12.2 Dental Insurance

12.2.1 The District shall provide coverage for dental insurance for members of the unit through plans recommended by the unit representatives on the District Insurance Review Committee and adopted by the District.

12.2.2 The established District contribution for full-time unit members as described in Appendix A for dental coverage shall be applied towards the premium cost of the District's Dental program.

12.2.3 Unit members working less than full time shall receive a proportionate share of the amount of District contribution as the number of hours worked by the employee in one month bears to the number of hours worked by a full-time employee, provided the employee agrees in writing to have the remaining amount deducted from his/her monthly warrant. Any out-of-pocket costs for dental coverage shall be deducted over the pay period of the less-than-full-time regular employees.

12.2.4 The District will pay the above-stated premium for dental insurance coverage for the employee as long as he/she remains in paid status. Premiums for nine-, ten-, and eleven-month employees will be paid by the District during regular non-pay months as prescribed in Sections 12.2.1, 12.2.2, and 12.2.3. Any out-of-pocket costs for dental coverage for less-than-twelve-month employees shall be deducted over the pay period of the employee.

The District will allow a regular employee who has never been enrolled in the District's health plans to enroll in the existing medical and/or dental insurance programs when the employee has been assigned a permanent increase in hours of employment resulting in eligibility for an increased District contribution for medical or dental insurance. Conversely, the District will allow a regular employee who is enrolled to disenroll in existing medical and/or dental insurance programs and other optional benefits when the employee realizes a reduction in District contribution due to a permanent decrease in hours of employment.

12.3.1 The District will notify the employee in writing of the provisions of this section. The employee must then request enrollment in writing and within sixty (60) days of the effective date of the increased assignment.

12.3.2 Coverage for this benefit is effective the first day of the second month following written submission of enrollment application(s) to the District's Employee Benefits Department.

12.4 Section 125 Plan: Premium Only Plan, Dependent Care Assistance Program and Flexible Spending Accounts

12.4.1 Section 125 Plan - Medical & Dental Premiums (Premium Only Plan)  
The pre-tax effect for out-of-pocket costs paid by SEIU members for medical and dental premiums has been implemented by the District.

12.4.2 Section 125 Plan - Dependent Care Assistance Program  
A Dependent Care Assistance Program as permitted by Internal Revenue Code Section 125 is available to SEIU members. This plan allows employees to annually elect to have a specified amount withheld from their pay for dependent care costs before income taxes are calculated. Employees may then file claims for reimbursement with the District when eligible costs have been incurred. This plan allows employees to pay for dependent care costs with pre-tax dollars.

12.4.3 Section 125 Plan Flexible Spending Accounts  
The District offers a Medical Expense Flexible Spending Account (FSA) plan. The plan enables employees to fund eligible uncovered medical/dental/vision expenses with pre-tax dollars. Typical out of pocket expenses eligible under this plan include, but are not limited to, vision care expenses such as eyeglasses and contact lenses, orthodontia, medical and dental co-pays. A Limited Use FSA is also provided which allows employees who have a Health Savings Account to fund eligible uncovered dental/vision expenses with pre-tax dollars.

12.5 Participation Requirements for Section 125 Plan

12.5.1 All regular employees of the SEIU unit are eligible to participate in any of the three (3) components of the District’s 125 Plan.

12.5.2 The District may charge participants a cost-covering fee to cover the costs of administering the program. SEIU shall participate in the selection of a new third party administrator through the District Insurance Review Committee, in the event there is a desire to replace our current vendor.

12.5.3 A detailed description of plan benefits, eligible costs, and requirements can be found in the Participants Handbook for the Dependent Care Assistance Plan. Employees should consult this handbook before electing to participate in the Dependent Care Assistance Plan, the Medical Expense FSA, or the Limited Use FSA.

SEIU Agreement: 2021-2024 Page 57

12.5.4 Participation in the plan requires an annual election made at the time of hire during the open enrollment period each year, or if the employee has a qualifying event.

12.5.5 Continuation of this plan is subject to the Internal Revenue Code. Should the code be changed or modified in any way, the plan shall be amended to comply with any federal and state changes and as determined by the District Insurance Review Committee.

12.6 Disability Income Protection

The District will maintain its current contribution and coverage level for long-term disability insurance through the life of this contract for unit members who work fifty percent (50%) or more of full-time. For purposes of disability income coverage, fifty percent (50%) or more is based upon a minimum twenty (20) hours or more a week for a nine-, ten- or eleven-month unit member. Such coverage is generally defined as two-thirds of the unit member’s monthly salary to a maximum of $12,000/month, whichever is less.

12.6.1 Unit members who receive payment under the terms of the policy of the District's disability income protection plan shall be provided the same level of District medical benefits that they were receiving at the time of disability for the period not to exceed a twelve (12) month period following the expiration of employee’s paid leaves. This benefit is provided to eligible employees for a maximum of twelve (12) months only during his/her employment with the District.

12.6.2 If any benefit, such as life insurance, can be continued but are not coordinated through COBRA, payment arrangement for any monthly out-of-pocket premium costs in excess of the established District contribution must be made with the Employee Benefits Department at the District Office. Any out-of-pocket premium costs must be paid by the first day of each month or coverage will lapse.

12.6.3 If the disability payments should stop for any reason during the one-year period and the employee has not returned to work, the District contribution subsidy toward COBRA will terminate on the last day of the month in which the disability payments cease. The unit member shall immediately notify the District if disability payments cease.

12.6.4 After the twelve-month period, unit members qualifying to receive payment under the terms of the policy for disability income protection may continue to be covered under the District's medical benefits program through COBRA at the employee's expense provided that the program or policy permits such participation. Payment arrangements for benefits continued through Los Rios must continue to be made with the Employee Benefits Department at the District Office.

12.6.5 Employees who elect to retire during this one-year period and who qualify for the retiree medical District contribution shall immediately be subject to the rules governing retiree District contributions.

12.7 Reimbursement to the District for Summer Insurance Premiums

Nine-, ten-, and eleven-month employees who terminate their employment with the District at the end of the summer recess shall reimburse the District for the full cost of insurance premiums which may be due for the non-work period.

SEIU Agreement: 2021-2024 Page 58
<!-- Page 63 -->
12.8 Unemployment Insurance  
The District participates in the statewide program of unemployment insurance for classified employees. Eligibility of employees to receive benefits during periods of layoff or upon termination of employment is determined by the State Employment Development Department. Regular employees on a nine-, ten-, or eleven-month work year are not eligible for unemployment insurance during the months of non-employment.

12.9 Parking Fees  
Access to parking lots on District properties is provided to SEIU unit members as a fringe benefit. Costs for this parking shall not be chargeable to monies assigned to SEIU per the compensation formula as defined in Appendix A.

12.10 Health Care Benefit for Retirees  
To be eligible for retirement, the employee must have the equivalent of five years of full-time service with Los Rios, be vested in either CalSTRS or CalPERS and (a) be at least age fifty-five (55), or (b) between the ages of fifty (50) and fifty-five (55) and receiving disability income under the District’s Disability Income Protection Plan immediately prior to retirement. Retirement from the District requires that the employee submit a request for retirement to Human Resources and receives approval of the request by the Chancellor, or designee.

12.10.1 The District shall make monthly contributions for regular members of the bargaining unit age 55 and over who have seven (7) full-time prior years of service with the District at the time of retirement and who retire during the term of this contract. Contributions will be prorated as a percentage of the seven (7) year cumulative base assignment in proportion to the hours the base assignment is to full time over the seven (7) year period for the number of months employed before June 30, 1990.

12.10.2 For full-time regular members of the bargaining unit who were hired after June 30, 1990, the District shall make monthly contributions for full-time regular members of the bargaining unit, who retire from the District as defined above and who are age 55 and over and have fifteen (15) full-time prior years of service with the District at the time of retirement.

12.10.3 The current District contribution of up to $306 per month for eligible unit members shall be made toward the premium cost of medical insurance for the retiree only.

12.10.3.1 Dependents of retirees are eligible to participate in the District’s plan, as long as the retiree is also a participant and may enroll at the same time as the retiree or during any open enrollment period. Enrolled dependents may continue to participate in the District plan following the retiree’s death, but may not re-enter the plan if they dis-enroll after the retiree death.

12.10.4 Contributions shall be established by the Board of Trustees and shall be provided for the premium cost of medical insurance for the retiree only. The amount of the District contribution toward retiree health care benefits may exceed the above amount if such increase is determined by policies publicly adopted by the Board of Trustees (Policy 6622). The maximum monthly contribution is the lesser of the amount determined by the Board, or the total combined health care and Medicare premiums for the individual retiree.

12.10.6 In order to receive the District contribution from the District, the employee must be vested in either the California Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) or the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (STRS) and be collecting retirement benefits from either PERS or STRS.

<!-- Page 64 -->
12.10.7 The monthly District contribution for health care benefits for the retiree shall be processed electronically utilizing the retiree's selected financial institution. If the retiree enrolls in a medical plan outside of the Los Rios plans, the retiree is eligible for monthly reimbursement of premiums up to the District contribution. If the retiree enrolls in a Los Rios medical plan, the premium owed will be reduced by the District contribution. If the premium is greater than the District contribution, a monthly withdrawal will be made from the retiree’s bank account for the difference. If there are two or more failed transactions due to lack of funds, this will result in termination of coverage and the loss of the ability to be covered under a Los Rios plan, except as provided in 12.10.11. If the premium owed is less than the District contribution, the retiree will be eligible for reimbursement of other medical premiums such as Medicare Part B or D, provided proof/evidence of premium cost is received.

12.10.7.1 Documentation for retirees with coverage outside the District's plans must be submitted annually verifying that the retiree is covered by health insurance and the monthly cost the retiree’s insurance.

12.10.7.2 If the monthly contribution is stopped due to lack of proof/evidence of premium cost, a closed bank account, etc., the contribution will be restarted prospectively only.

12.10.8 The District monthly contribution as defined in Section 12.10 shall also apply to eligible members of the bargaining unit who retire between the ages of 50 and 55 if the unit member was receiving disability income under the District's disability income protection plan just prior to retirement and the qualifying years of service have been met.

12.10.9 Employees who retire from the District as specified in 12.10 above, and who have the equivalent of ten (10) prior years of full-time service with the District at the time of retirement, may enroll in a retiree medical plan upon retirement even if they are not eligible for the District monthly contribution referenced in this Article.

12.10.10 Retirees may enroll or change plans at the time of retirement if allowed by the medical carriers. Once enrolled, retirees must participate continuously in the retiree group plan in order to remain in the selected District health plan, except as outlined in Articles 12.10.11.1, 12.10.11.2 and 12.10.11.3. The participating retiree will be provided the opportunity to change to a different District health plan during each annual open enrollment period.

12.10.11 The retiring employee may elect to be covered by a health plan other than a District health plan and the established monthly District contribution level shall apply if the retiree is eligible for the District contribution and incurs an out-of-pocket expense. Except as outlined in Articles 12.10.11.1, 12.10.11.2 and 12.10.11.3, once a health plan other than the District’s plan is selected, the retiring employee or retiree will not be allowed to re-enroll in a District health plan.

12.10.11.1 Retirees who retire before the age of sixty-five (65) may choose a health plan other than a District health plan either at the time of retirement or during retirement without forfeiting their ability to enroll in a District health plan upon turning sixty-five (65).

12.10.11.2 The retiree must elect a District Health Plan upon turning sixty-five (65), or otherwise becoming eligible for Medicare. If such enrollment paperwork is not received in Employee Benefits within the 7-month period following eligibility, the retiree will lose the ability to enroll in a District health plan.

12.10.11 Medicare Enrollment

12.10.11.1 If a retiree does not enroll in the Los Rios plan during the 7-month window of turning sixty-five (65), the retiree will not be able to enroll at a later date. The 7-month window coincides with the Medicare enrollment window and includes the three months prior to turning sixty-five (65), the month of turning sixty-five (65), and the three months after turning sixty-five (65). Enrollment in the Los Rios plan must coincide with enrollment in MediCare. The retiree must provide evidence they are enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. The retiree must provide evidence of continued coverage from the date of retirement, or cancellation of the Los Rios coverage, to the age of sixty-five (65), as well as provide evidence of enrollment in Medicare, to enroll in a District health plan. It is the retiree's responsibility to monitor this and contact the Los Rios Employee Benefits department and submit required paperwork within the timeline allowed.

12.10.11.2 Los Rios retirees who do not qualify for the District contribution have the same rights outlined above in Articles 12.10.11.1 and 12.10.11.2.

12.10.11.3 Article 12.10.11 is intended to apply to retirees who become Medicare eligible for a health-related, or any other, reason prior to turning age sixty-five (65). The same requirements apply as stated in Article 12.10.11.2.

![Article 17: Layoff and Effects of Layoff](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Article+17:+Layoff+and+Effects+of+Layoff)

17.1 Definitions

17.1.1 Employees shall be subject to layoff for lack of work and/or lack of funds as determined by the governing board. The definition of lack of work and lack of funds and the determination of which positions are affected are reserved by the District.

17.1.2 A layoff, for purposes of this article, shall be considered an involuntary separation or reduction in hours or the work year of an employee because of lack of work and/or lack of funds. Any voluntary reduction in regularly assigned time or assignment to a class lower than that in which the employee has permanence in lieu of layoff shall be considered a layoff for purposes of this article.

17.1.3 A seniority roster of regular classified staff will be maintained by the District Office and updated at the end of the fiscal year.

17.1.4 Employees will be given an opportunity to verify placement on the seniority roster.

17.1.5 When the positions to be eliminated have been determined, the Chancellor (or designee) shall update the seniority list for each position classification of all the regular employees assigned to that classification in the District, regardless of location.

17.1.6 Class is defined as each existing job title with applicable job description within the Los Rios District classification system at the time of seniority roster updating.

17.1.7 Higher class is determined by placement on the unit salary schedule. Determination of what constitutes a higher class from one unit to another will be the exclusive right of the Chancellor (or designee).

17.2 Order of Lay-Off

17.2.1 Within each class to be vacated, employees shall be laid off in the following order:

17.2.1.1 Probationary employees whose last overall performance rating was less than standard;

17.2.1.2 Other probationary employees;

17.2.1.3 Permanent employees.

17.2.2 The order of reduction of permanent employees shall be based on length of service or seniority in the position class plus higher classes. The employee, who has been employed the shortest time in the class, plus higher classes, shall be laid off first. Reemployment shall be in the reverse order of layoff. (Education Code 88127)

17.2.3 If two (2) or more employees subject to layoff have equal seniority in class plus higher classes, the determination of which is to be laid off first shall be made on the basis of the greater hire date (District seniority). If that is equal, the District will make the determination in consideration of District needs, including affirmative action.

17.3 Replacement Privilege  
17.3.1 Permanent employees shall be given the opportunity of replacing, in a lower or lateral classification, an employee with less seniority under the following conditions.  
17.3.1.1 The employee with greater seniority meets the minimum qualifications specified in the position specifications; and  
17.3.1.2 The employee has previously served in the class as a permanent employee and has had standard performance rating(s) in the lower or lateral class.  
17.3.2 In the event a layoff in one employee/bargaining unit results in replacement in another unit, the effects of the layoff will be presumed to have been bargained.  

17.4 Computation of Seniority  
17.4.1 In computing years of District service for purposes of layoff, time in paid status as a regular permanent or probationary employee will be counted. Certain types of service/non-service will not count toward seniority, including:  
17.4.1.1 Employment as a temporary or substitute employee (Education Code 88127);  
17.4.1.2 Non-paid status such as Board-granted unpaid leaves or loss-of-pay absences. (Exception stated in Section 17.4.2)  
17.4.2 The District shall compute time worked prior to July 1, 1971, on an annual hours basis as though each unit member had worked full time. Board-granted unpaid leaves and loss-of-pay absences will be disregarded during this period. Computation after July 1, 1971, will be based on actual hours in paid status, excluding overtime. All computations are subject to the exclusions stated under this section. (88027)  
17.4.3 Time worked in temporary reclassification will not count as seniority in a higher class.  

17.5 Notification of Layoff (Procedure)  
17.5.1 The District shall notify the affected employees, in writing, a minimum of thirty (30) calendar days prior to the date of any layoffs, except in the event of an actual and existing financial inability to pay salaries to classified employees or for causes not foreseeable or preventable by the governing board, where less than thirty (30) days' notice may be given. (Education Code 88017)  
17.5.2 The employee who receives notice of layoff will be given an opportunity to verify accuracy of computation. Failure to notify the Human Resources of possible errors shall constitute a waiver. Any errors that may be discovered after the fact shall not be used as a means of reinstatement of the affected employee.  

17.6 Reemployment Lists  
17.6.1 Thirty-nine (39) Months (Education Code 88117)  
<!-- Page 88 -->
![SEIU Agreement: 2021-2024 Page 84](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SEIU+Agreement:+2021-2024+Page+84)

The names of employees who are laid off because of lack of work or funds shall be placed on a re-employment list for thirty-nine (39) months for the class in which they hold permanent status and shall be reemployed as positions become vacant in their class in the inverse order of layoff.

17.6.2 Sixty-three (63) Months  
Employees who take voluntary demotions or voluntary reduction in assigned time in lieu of layoff to remain in their present position rather than be reclassified or reassigned shall be granted the same rights as persons laid off and shall retain eligibility to be considered for reemployment to their former position class or for increased time as it becomes available for an additional period of up to twenty-four (24) months, provided that the same qualifications under which they qualified for appointment to the class shall still apply.

17.6.3 An employee who is laid off and is subsequently eligible for reemployment shall be notified in writing by the District of an opening. Such notice shall be sent by certified mail to the last address given to the District by the employee.

17.6.4 Names shall be removed from the reemployment list for the following reasons:

17.6.4.1 Written request of the individual;  
17.6.4.2 Failure to respond within ten (10) working days to an inquiry regarding availability for employment. (Inquiries will be sent annually during term of reemployment list);  
17.6.4.3 Failure to accept within ten (10) working days an offer of employment in the same class as that of previous assignment;  
17.6.4.4 Lapse of thirty-nine (39) months following layoff;  
17.6.4.5 Reinstatement in former position or equivalent.

17.6.5 Employees shall be reemployed in the same classification from which they were laid off in accordance with their length of service in the class from which they were laid off, plus higher classes. Employees who accept a position lower than their former class shall retain their original thirty-nine (39) month rights to the position classification from which they were laid off. Employees have the right to choose layoff in lieu of a lower classification and still maintain 39-month reemployment rights.

17.6.6 Eligible employees may choose retirement in lieu of layoff and still retain 39-month reemployment rights.

17.6.7 Unused sick leave benefits accumulated prior to layoff will be reinstated upon return to work. No service credit or benefits will be earned by or paid to an employee during layoff nor will an employee earn time towards seniority.

17.7 Salary Placement Upon Reinstatement

17.7.1 Whenever a permanent employee has been laid off because of lack of work or funds and is reinstated within thirty-nine (39) months from the date of termination, the employee shall be entitled to continue on the salary step held prior to reinstatement until prior service subsequent to a salary step increment and additional service shall, when added together, constitute another year.

17.7.2 A new anniversary date shall be established for reinstated employees laid off for lack of funds or work based on one year of service disregarding the break in employment.

17.8 Termination Date  
The effective date of temporary termination of service shall be the last day of paid status with the District (last day of employment plus accumulated days of vacation).

17.9 Effect of Agreement  
17.9.1 This is the full and complete agreement of the parties as it relates to all aspects of layoff including, but not limited to, the decision to lay off by complete separation or reduction in hours or work year and the effects of those decisions.  
17.9.2 By this Agreement, the Union understands that layoffs and their effects shall not be subject to further negotiations, but shall be governed by the provisions of this Agreement. With respect to any aspect of layoffs or their effects not addressed in this Article, management agrees to meet with the Union Representative, on demand, for additional negotiations at the time a layoff is contemplated. The parties agree that these additional negotiations shall not preclude the initiation or actual layoff of an employee pursuant to this Article, even if the parties have not come to agreement prior to the effective date of layoff.  
17.9.3 The reason for layoff (lack of work or lack of funds) shall not be subject to negotiation or to the grievance procedure.

# Appendix A: Salary & Benefits

## A.1 Funding Sources for Salary & Benefit Improvements
The bargaining unit shall receive its proportionate share of eighty percent (80%) of certain new or increased unrestricted revenue which is above an established base amount.

The bargaining unit's proportionate share of such revenues is based upon:

1) The unit's total salary and benefit cost, including the cost of District contribution towards health coverage for all authorized/filled positions associated with the SEIU unit which is compared to the total District salary, benefit, and District contribution costs for authorized/filled positions of all District employee groups.

2) Authorized/filled positions which are funded from special programs/categorical funds are excluded from calculations of both SEIU unit's cost and other employee group costs.

3) The salary and benefit costs including the District contribution costs associated with contract managers are also excluded.

4) “Contract year” consists of the fiscal years 2021-22, 2022-23, 2023-24.

5) Any reference to prior year refers to the fiscal year preceding one of the contract years stated above.

The determination as to whether such defined revenues are continuing or one-time only is defined below but may be modified during the term of this contract due to new State law or regulations. Such revenues and related base amounts associated with such revenues are defined as follows:

### A.1.1 Base Revenues (Basic Allocation plus Base Full-Time Equivalent Students; funded by State General Apportionment, Property Taxes, Education Protection Account (EPA) and Student Enrollment Fees)
The base amount for the contract year is the revenue level recognized in the prior fiscal year that was used for retroactive salary improvement calculations for that year including any prior year Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA), and prior year Growth Funds and reduced by any State deficit, which may be applied retroactively. Base revenues are generally considered continuing funds and shall be used to fund continuing salary and benefit costs applicable to SEIU unit members.

### A.1.2 COLA
New or increased revenues above the base amount are generally derived from two primary sources: 1) Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA); and 2) Growth Funds. The determination, availability, and distribution of the bargaining units proportionate share of new or increased revenues due to the COLA factor applied to Base Revenue is dependent upon the final adoption of the State budget and the reliability of receiving such entitlements. An initial salary schedule improvement may be implemented for the fiscal year based upon COLA funds authorized in the State budget for community colleges provided that such COLA revenues are reliable (no projected State funding deficit) and subject to the use of such funds as provided in section A.2.

A.1.3 Growth Funds  
After providing for specified costs associated with student growth, as described in Attachment 1, net Growth funds are considered “continuous” funds and are proportionately allocated to the unit. Growth funds are attributed to either an increase in funded Full-Time Equivalent Students (FTES) or an increase in the District’s Basic Allocation  

A.1.3.1 Cost Reduction  
As described in Attachment 1, any cost savings which were previously funded from student growth funds shall be included in the calculation of net available Growth Funds.  

A.1.4 Lottery Revenue  
The initial base amount for Lottery revenue is established at $3.3M. Effective July 1, 2000, fifty percent (50%) of lottery revenues above 1997-98 revenues are restricted per the conditions set forth in Proposition 20. Such restricted amounts may not be used for salaries and benefits and, therefore, are excluded from the provisions of this section.  

In 2014-15 the base amount for unrestricted Lottery revenue was increased by $2.6M to a new established base of $5.9M. Eighty percent (80%), which is $2.08M of the increase, was considered a continuing resource and the proportionate amount of such funds was provided to SEIU through the proportionate share calculation as a continuing resource.  

Lottery revenues below the base amount of $5.9M shall reduce available continuing funds.  

Any revenue received above the established base of $5.9M is considered one-time-only revenue and the proportionate amount of eighty percent (80%) of such funds provided to SEIU as a non-continuing resource.  

A.1.5 State Mandates  
Mandate Block Grant is unrestricted funding provided to districts that elect to receive a block grant in lieu of filing claims seeking reimbursement for mandated activities for a specific fiscal year. If the State budget includes mandate block grant funding during the contract year and the District elects to receive the block grant in lieu of filing a claim, eighty percent (80%) of that amount will be allocated to the compensation calculation to be distributed to the SEIU unit based upon its proportionate share. This resource is categorized as one-time only funding.  

A.1.6 District Contribution Reduction  
Should the District contribution for medical and dental coverage be reduced in a contract year below the preceding years established level, the related reduction in District contribution costs for unit members shall be returned to the unit as a source of funds which is available for redistribution.  

A.1.6.1 The amount of funds attributed to any premium reduction in a contract year shall be distributed to unit members in combination with any Growth funds.  

A.1.7 Salary Savings (Decrements)  
Any net salary savings after replacement costs are considered resulting from unit member  

SEIU Agreement: 2017-2020 Page 95
<!-- Page 100 -->
![SEIU Agreement: 2017-2020 Page 96](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SEIU+Agreement:+2017-2020+Page+96)

A.1.7  
Retirements or resignations will be included as a resource for the unit. Replacement cost is typically step one (1) for the vacated position but can be higher if the person hired to fill the vacated position is placed at a higher step. Savings for a position that is not filled within the year of vacancy will be calculated based upon the step 1 value for that position’s classification. Net salary savings may be used to:

A.1.7.1 Address the unit’s proportionate share of any reductions in Base revenues below the defined base, and

A.1.7.2 Remaining salary savings shall be available to the unit as another source of revenue.

A.1.8  
State Revenue Recalculations  
Should Base, COLA, Growth or Lottery revenues be increased or reduced as a result of retroactive calculations performed by the State Chancellor’s Office (February of the following year. Recalculation for prior year revenues or other state computations), such revenue adjustments for prior year shall be applied to current year revenue computations as per Section A.1.

A.1.9  
Carryforward of Funds from Prior Years  
Should the Unit and the District agree to defer either continuing or one-time funds from a prior year calculation such funds will be combined with other available resources for the following contract year.

A.2  
Distribution or Allocation of Funds  
The Unit’s proportionate share of such additional funds shall be applied in the following priority order:

A.2.1  
The cost of step increments for a contract year for SEIU members and any prior year step increment or other costs which were not adequately funded from prior years’ continuing funds; then

A.2.2  
Any increased District cost of providing disability insurance coverage, unemployment insurance coverage, or other increased payroll-related benefits to unit members in a contract year; then

A.2.3  
The increased cost over the prior year level of providing the District contribution for medical coverage up to the amount agreed to per Article 12.1.2.

A.2.3.1  
For 2021-22, the maximum District contribution amount is currently established at $1,358.28 per month (12 month basis). The contribution level is only made up to the premium level for the plan selected.

A.2.3.1.1  
The District may contribute to a Health Savings Account (H.S.A.) for regular employees who select a high deductible health plan. The maximum contribution level is dependent upon single or family coverage. The contribution will remain in effect for the contract term unless the HDHP is discontinued or as long as the HDHP premium plus the H.S.A. contribution is less than or equal to the District contribution.

A.2.4  
The increased cost in a contract year, if any, for increasing the prior year
<!-- Page 101 -->
District contribution for monthly dental premium up to the contract year monthly premium amount. For 2021-22, the District contribution level is currently established at $133.00 (12 month basis);

A.2.5 Premium increases above $6.75 per month per participant (guaranteed through 2021-22) for $50,000 in term life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment coverage.

A.2.6 Any increase in the annual cost of the additional shift differential/range provided to eligible unit members per Section 11.7; then,

A.2.7 Remaining funds shall be used to compute the salary and payroll-related fringe benefit improvements on an annual basis for the current year and shall be effective for services rendered as of July 1, of the current year, unless the District and the Unit agree to defer remaining funds, if any, to future years. The PERS rate to be used for determining continuing salary schedule improvements shall be the projected PERS rate for 2024-25 at the time of the calculation. The cost of any salary schedule improvements provided in advance of the final determination of revenues available to SEIU shall be considered in the retroactive salary calculations. If no salary improvement has been advanced, then any retroactive salary payments for services rendered for the contract year will be paid as a one-time improvement for that year.

A. 2.7.1 The District and SEIU unit representatives will meet following the close of the District's financial records to review the calculation. Any continuing improvements from the remaining funds to either salary or benefits for unit members must be supported by continuing resources.

A.3 Any improvements in District contribution levels toward medical and dental premiums will be effective July 1, of the contract year.

A.4 The costs defined in Sections A.2 are considered continuing costs and require continuing funds (as defined in Sections A.1) in order to continue the funding support of such costs in succeeding fiscal years. Any of the above costs funded in a contract year from one-time-only revenues (as defined in Sections A.1) shall be considered one-time-only distributions/improvements for the contract year.

A.5 The District and SEIU shall meet, if requested by either party by February 1st, each Spring of the 2021-24 contract to discuss possible options for the redistribution of SEIU's proportionate share of available revenues defined per Appendix A of the 2017-20 Agreement.

A.5.1 It is understood that the cost of funding annual step increments shall have first priority on such available funds.

A.6 Scheduled Distribution of Lottery Revenues The increase in funds attributable to lottery revenues above the base amount stated in Section A.1.4 shall be considered one-time-only payments and will be distributed to SEIU unit members on an annual basis with other retroactive salary compensation for the fiscal year.

A.6.1 If lottery revenues can be reasonably estimated at the time of processing any retroactive salary payments, such lottery funds shall be included in the scheduled.

A.6.2 The District Office Business Services staff shall inform SEIU of the lottery amount received annually.

A.7 Distribution of Available Resources  
The distribution of net resources as defined in A.2.7 shall be distributed no later than sixty (60) days after the final status of such funds is determined by the California Community Colleges Office, or the close of the District’s fiscal year, whichever is later.

A.8 Salary Savings (Other)  
A.8.1 Salary savings resulting from unclaimed Dependent Care Assistance Program or Flexible Spending Plan elections by SEIU unit members will revert to unit member who participated in the plan(s) per Internal Revenue Service code net of any costs associated with the plan administration.

A.9 Other Unrestricted Funds  
Should other new state unrestricted revenues become available in a contract year as a result of changes in funding legislation or excess unrestricted funds above the state's appropriation limit, such new revenue source(s) shall be subject to further negotiations.  
A.9.1 The District shall notify the SEIU unit of such new unrestricted revenues which are subject to further negotiations.

A.10 Excluded Revenue/Funding Sources  
Other state revenues not defined herein and other categorical apportionment funds, state apprenticeship, and other restricted or designated revenue sources shall be excluded from any computations of the bargaining unit's proportionate share of funds.

A.11 Ten Percent (10%) Limitation  
Should the contract year revenues as defined above provide sufficient funding for salary, fringe, and health benefit improvements, including step changes, and other mutually agreed upon allocations which result in a distribution in excess of ten percent (10%), such excess funds above ten percent (10%) shall be subject to further negotiations for the contract year.  
A.11.1 The District shall notify the SEIU unit of such excess funds above the ten percent (10%) level as it relates to the revenues defined herein.

A.12 Review of District Records  
Records maintained by the District Office Business Services Department which relate to the implementation and calculation of SEIU's proportionate share of the defined funds shall be available for review by representatives designated by the SEIU Executive Board. SEIU and Business Services representatives shall meet at a mutually agreeable time. Business services representatives will provide copies of any records upon the request of the designated representatives during their review of the records.

Annual reports which summarize the calculation of SEIU's proportionate share of defined funds and the allocation/distribution of such funds shall be prepared by Business Services representatives. All such summary reports relating to the implementation of Articles 11 and 12 and this Appendix shall be provided to designated representatives of SEIU.
<!-- Page 103 -->
A.13 Changes in Funding Formulas for Community Colleges  
Should the funding formula for community colleges change substantially which affects the application of the contract provisions, the above Sections A.1 to A.4 shall not apply. Such new unrestricted funding provisions shall be subject to further negotiation for the contract year.  

A.14 Reduction or Insufficient Defined Revenues  
Should the total of all defined revenue/resources for a contract year be less than or equal to the various specified base amounts stated section A.1 including all sub-sections, SEIU unit members' shall bear their proportionate share of such reduced or insufficient funding levels. SEIU’s proportionate share reduction shall be based upon its share of eighty percent (80%) of Base, COLA, Growth and/or other revenue reductions.  

A.14.1 SEIU’s proportionate share of computed revenue reductions shall be applied, but not limited to: a) salary schedule adjustments; b) workload adjustments; c) suspension of salary schedule step advancements; or d) other adjustments as mutually agreed to by SEIU and the District.  

A.14.2 If the District and SEIU cannot agree on a plan for implementing SEIU’s proportionate share of defined revenue reductions, the District may implement the reduction in accordance with items outlined in A.14.1. Any implemented reductions form the base for the succeeding years.  

A.15 Cost and Salary Savings  
Any cost savings realized per the calculation specified in Attachment 1 and salary savings (decrements) as defined in A.1.7 will offset either the overall reduction in resources or the unit’s specific costs for that year.  

A.16 Layoff Provision  
No unit member will be laid off for fiscal reasons during the contract year if all the following conditions exist: 1) District revenues (Basic Allocation, COLA, and Growth provisions) for the contract year are maintained at the amount received in the prior year; 2) categorical funding remains at the same level for the contract year as the prior year; and 3) there are no operational deficits in the contract year for auxiliary services.  

A.17 Cost Advances  
The cost of a contract year step increments and other additional payroll related benefit costs for a contract year which are insufficiently funded shall then be considered advanced by the District for the contract year. Any costs advanced shall have first priority in the utilization of SEIU’s proportionate share of defined revenues in future years.

1. **Calculation of Available Growth Revenues**

   Eighty percent (80%) of growth funds as defined in Appendix A received in a contract year shall be initially appropriated in the following manner:

   1.1 The increased costs associated with each year’s actual full-time equivalent (FTE) instructional level above the previous year’s actual instructional staffing level.

   1.1.1 The actual instructional staffing level for each year shall be determined after the end of the third week of spring and shall be based upon the average of the Fall/Spring instructional FTE level for that year plus the change in FTE for the summer term above the base level of 122.34. For this provision, the summer term is the term occurring prior to the fall term for the fiscal year.

   1.1.1.1 To calculate the growth in instructional FTE for the summer term, a productivity level of 450 will be used. If the actual summer term productivity is below 450, growth funds will not be charged for FTE utilized below the 450 level.

   1.1.2 The cost for the additional FTE will be based upon the standard adjunct cost for the contract year, except the standard adjunct cost for summer term instruction will not include health and welfare benefit costs. In computing the standard adjunct cost for the purposes of this calculation, the 2024-25 STRS rate of 19.10% for employer contribution will be used in place of the rate in effect for the contract year. This is done to set-aside the increased pension costs for these additional positions. The 2020-21 rate using the 2024-25 rates is $62,780 and

   1) for 2021-22, the standard rate as determined by averaging the fall 2021 actual payments for adjunct and overload instructional assignments and the standard benefit rate for part-time instructional service as adjusted for the 2024-25 STRS rate; then

   2) for 2022-23, the standard rate as determined by averaging the fall 2022 actual payments for adjunct and overload instructional assignments and the standard benefit rate for part-time instructional service as adjusted for the 2024-25 STRS rate; then

   3) for 2023-24, the standard rate as determined by averaging the fall 2023 actual payments for adjunct and overload instructional assignments and the standard benefit rate for part-time instructional service.

1.2 The increased cost over the previous year’s cost related to contracted instruction such as public safety instructional programs and other contracts.

1.3 The determination of actual staffing level utilized, increased contracted instruction costs and actual enrollment growth revenues received for the contract year shall be made no later than sixty (60) days following the close of the District’s fiscal year-end. Potential state funding deficits may reduce expected growth revenue. The records maintained by the District Office Business Services Department shall be used to determine actual staffing levels.

1.4 The cost of additional counselors required to maintain a counselor/student ratio of 1:900. The cost will be based upon the average salary and fringe benefit annual contract cost in the contract year for adjunct and overload counselors using the 2024-25 STRS rate.

1.4.1 Such positions shall be authorized as a continuing appropriation for the start of the following fiscal year; and

1.4.2 Continuing growth funds committed for the additional authorized counseling positions and set aside for this purpose in the contract year shall be proportionately distributed to the unit on a one-time-only basis; then

1.5 The cost of additional full-time faculty required to be hired as specified in Title V provisions (faculty obligation number). The incremental salary and fringe benefits costs due to conversion of part-time instructional and counseling FTE to regular instructional and counseling positions and salary and benefit costs of other non-classroom faculty positions shall be funded from Growth funds. The 2020-21 rate for converted instructional FTE using the 2024-25 STRS employer rate is $32,911. The 2020-21 rate for new or re-authorized regular faculty positions (164 or 174 day), using the increase pension rates is $90,945 or $106,555 respectively. The established District contribution costs towards health benefits shall also be considered. Calculated standard costs for required faculty hired pursuant to Title V provisions shall be determined annually and typically increases by salary schedule and fringe benefit improvements provided in 2021-22 through 2023-24, as applicable;

1.5.1 Continuing growth funds shall be committed for any positions authorized in the contract year and;

1.5.2 The salary and benefit costs of the additional full-time faculty hired shall consider whether such hires were for the start of the spring semester or the following fall semester. Any unused continuing growth funds set aside for this purpose in the contract year shall be proportionately distributed to the unit on a one-time-only basis; then

1.6 The salary and fringe benefit cost of additional classified positions which are needed as a result of District enrollment growth or new educational sites.

1.6.1 The maximum number of additional full-time equivalent (FTE) classified staff required due to enrollment growth shall be based upon the District’s current growth factor percentage assigned by the state multiplied by the total classified FTE level authorized for the year. Authorized classified FTE includes White Collar, Blue Collar, Supervisory and Confidential positions funded with general purpose revenues. Classified positions (FTE) which
<!-- Page 107 -->
```
are funded with categorical resources/revenues are excluded from this computation.

1.6.2 For any given contract year, it is the District's intent to distribute the additional classified staff funded from growth funds across all classified units; then

1.6.3 The additional classified FTE shall be in place no earlier than the spring semester of the contract year or July 1 of the succeeding year.

1.6.4 The actual number of additional classified staff (FTE) authorized for the contract year and the related salary and benefit costs of such positions shall be funded from continuing growth funds.

1.6.5 The cost of any retroactive salary improvements for the additional classified positions which are authorized in a given contract year shall be provided from growth funds at $87,000 per FTE, based on the average salary from the prior year 1% calculation and the 2024-25 PERS projected rate of 27.70%; and

1.6.6 Any unused continuing growth funds in the contract year shall be proportionately distributed to the unit on a one-time-only basis.

1.7 Additional administrative positions shall not be funded from growth funds.

1.8 The net growth funds shall be proportionally allocated to SEIU in accordance with Appendix A. The difference between the current employer contributions for STRS and PERS and the rates used in 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6 shall be credited back as a one-time resource until required.

1.9 The cost savings or cost reductions related to those items listed below shall be calculated and applied as an additional source of funds. Items previously funded from growth revenues are:

1.9.1 Cost reductions associated with the actual instructional FTE utilized for the academic year based upon the average of the Fall/Spring third week instructional FTE level which is below the previous year's actual instructional staffing level. The standard 2020-21 part-time cost per FTE of $63,780, as defined per Section 1.1, shall be used to determine instructional cost savings, and

1.9.2 Cost reductions in the contract year attributed to the annual salary and fringe benefit cost due to a reduced number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) counselors required per the terms of the LRCFT contract. The previous year's required counseling FTE shall be used as a base to determine the net reduction in FTE for the current contract year. The standard 2020-21 counseling part-time cost per FTE ($174 days) using the increased pension rates is $86,132. Actual counselor staffing FTE levels above the required staffing level shall be used in the determination of cost if such levels are greater.

1.9.3 Any other cost reductions due to staffing changes (reduction) previously funded from growth funds as further described in Sections 1.1 to 1.6.
```
<!-- Page 108 -->

# Counseling Memo/Letter of Reprimand P-6913
## 6900 EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE
## 6910 Disciplinary Procedures

### 1.0 Purpose
1.1 Every effort shall be made to promote harmonious relationships and open communication. The purpose of this policy is to provide resolutions to problems at the first level of supervision without imposing severe discipline.  
1.1.1 Supervisors should attempt to resolve problems informally through counseling meetings before issuing either a Counseling Memo or Letter of Reprimand. However, serious violations may lead to severe discipline without prior counseling.

### 2.0 Counseling Memo/Letter of Reprimand
2.1 If a problem(s) has not been resolved through informal discussion meetings, the supervisor/administrator of the operating unit, following consultation with the administrative officer, may deliver a written counseling memo or letter of reprimand to the employee detailing the area(s) of concern. Letters of reprimand shall be considered more severe than counseling memos.  
2.2 The District shall establish regulations addressing employee rights to object and appeal as applied to this section.
