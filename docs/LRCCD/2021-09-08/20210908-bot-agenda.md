**Chancellor’s Report:**

**ARC:** Thanks to the tireless and innovative leadership and direction of Music Professor Dr. Art LaPierre, ARC's Vocal Jazz Ensembles both won international honors in the 44th annual Downbeat magazine competition, earning the college its 20th and 21st Downbeat awards! Overcoming the disruption of moving instruction to online, ARC Vocal Jazz II won the National Student Music Achievement Competition and ARC Vocal Jazz I won Outstanding Performance merit for their recording submission in the Asynchronous Community College Small Vocal Ensemble Category. In addition, the Ensembles have been selected to perform at the prestigious American Choral Directors Association Western Region Conference in March 2022.

**CRC:** CRC’s Fire Intern Academy class of 2019-20 was finally able to graduate at their academy grounds in Elk Grove earlier this month. Although the class started with 20 students, only 12 finished, but those who did persevered through the major obstacles, including the pandemic. Supporters from the Cosumnes Fire Department, where some of these graduates will end up working, showed their support by coming out to the grounds to congratulate each graduate. Fifteen students graduated from CRC’s Diagnostic Medical Technology program last week. They were recognized for completing a rigorous program, and the additional challenge of completing during a pandemic. Each graduate was presented with a certificate, a DMS patch and a pin. This is the program’s 4th cohort to graduate.

**FLC:** Intel is partnering with Folsom Lake College to grow its Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Workforce Program. This national program expansion, which includes a total of 18 community colleges across 11 states, will train tens of thousands of students, putting them on track for careers in high-tech, healthcare, automotive, industrial, and aerospace fields. The program’s objective is to provide access and opportunities to students from all backgrounds who may be interested in these fields, helping to diversify AI, while offering the hands-on technical skills needed for the current and future job market. FLC is the only community college in the Sacramento region to be part of the expanded AI for Workforce Program. The college will offer its first AI course this fall.

**SCC:** Sacramento City College’s ASHE Center today (8/11) hosted “Welcome Black @ City,” a fall semester kickoff event for our Black student community. The event aims to help students feel connected and know they have support as they work toward achieving their goals. Event highlights include meeting their success team, learning about campus resources, as well as fun games, swag and music by DJ Remme.

**BACKGROUND:**  
Proposition 30, The Schools and Local Public Safety Protection Act of 2012 temporarily raised the State sales and use tax by .25 cents for four years and raised the income tax rate for high income earners ($250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for couples) for seven years to provide continuing funding for local school districts and community colleges. In November 2018, voters passed proposition 55, the Children’s Education and Health Care Protection Act. Proposition 55 extended the personal income tax increase under proposition 30 through 2030-31. The accounting and reporting requirements under proposition 55 are the same as under Proposition 30.

Under proposition 30, the State established the Education Protection Account (EPA) to receive and disburse the tax revenues derived from proposition 30 and subsequently proposition 55. Funds from the EPA are not new or increased resources for districts. Rather EPA replaced base State General apportionment. In essence, the three revenue sources traditionally supporting California Community Colleges: general apportionment, local property taxes, and student enrollment fees, now include a fourth source, EPA. EPA funds are paid quarterly.

Districts have sole authority to determine how moneys received from the EPA are spent. The governing board must make the spending determination in open session of a public meeting of the board and with the limitation that EPA funds cannot be used to pay administrative salaries and benefits and other administrative costs. Each entity receiving funds must annually publish on its website an accounting of how much money was received from the EPA and how that money was spent. Additionally, the annual independent financial and compliance audit required of community colleges shall ascertain and verify whether the funds provided from the EPA have been properly disbursed and expended as required by law. Expenses incurred to comply with these additional audit requirements may be paid from the EPA.

---

**STATUS:**  
The California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office (CCCCO) distributes EPA funds to districts based upon their proportionate share of total computational revenue. This basis results in a more equitable distribution of EPA rather than distributing on the relative share of general apportionment.  

---  

18
<!-- Page 19 -->
For 2021-22, the projected amount of EPA funds the District is scheduled to receive is $57,865,247. As was the case in prior years, the amount may change as the year progresses and entitlements are modified. However, our overall apportionment entitlement under the state's funding formula will generally be fully funded even if our share of EPA funds are reduced.

The Board must adopt its plan for the use of the funds as described in the background section relying on the best information available. Consistent with the message to voters that Proposition 30 would allow districts to maintain their instructional programs and the requirement that EPA not be used for administrative costs; staff recommends that EPA funds be designated as supporting compensation costs for classroom instruction services for both faculty and classified staff. Classroom instructional salaries and benefits up to the actual amount received for EPA will be transferred to separate accounts within the unrestricted general fund to identify those costs as funded by EPA.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt for the 2021-22 fiscal year the plan to designate compensation costs for classroom instruction as funded by EPA. Upon approval, the District will update its website to reflect the Board’s action.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**

**SUBJECT:** District Annual Investment Report  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item D  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Vice Chancellor

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**

**BACKGROUND:**  
As specified in Board Policy P-8252, within three months of the close of each fiscal year, an annual investment report of all District directed investments shall be presented to the Board of Trustees.

The purpose of the investment report is to inform the Board regarding District directed investments, consisting primarily of assets of the Retiree Health Benefits Trust, Bookstore, and certain fiduciary funds. The majority of the District’s monetary assets – cash, cash equivalents, and investments – are required to be held in appropriate Sacramento County Treasury accounts and investments of such assets are directed by the County. For comparative purposes and a complete overview of investment and interest income earned by the District in 2020-21, the attached annual investment report shows both District and County directed monetary assets and their earnings.

---

**STATUS:**  
District directed assets were invested in compliance with Board Policy P-8252. Detail regarding those investments for the year ended June 30, 2021 follows.

**Retiree Health Benefits Trust (Trust):**  
On November 7, 2007 the Board established an irrevocable trust in response to accounting standards issued by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), specifically GASB 43 and 45. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. was appointed trustee and investment manager of the Trust. As the sponsor and sole contributor of monies to the Trust, the District has primary responsibility for the management of the Trust for the benefit of its current and future retirees. Under review by the Oversight Committee, established by the Board, and within investment guidelines and restrictions of Board Policy P-8252, the Wells Fargo Bank investment manager has invested Trust monies in various mutual and index funds. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 70% of the $161.6 million portfolio was invested in bond funds and 30.0% in equity funds. The Committee meets quarterly with the investment manager to review the portfolio. As is good practice, returns are evaluated against benchmarks for similar investments.
<!-- Page 21 -->
Due to the consistency of the bond market and the continued strength of equity markets during the past fiscal year, the Trust had a net gain of $18.6 million or approximately a 12.6% gain in asset value. The net return for the past five years is 7.6% and the return since inception of the trust is 5.9%. The District goal for average return is currently 5%. An actuarial study is required every two years which allows for current economic conditions to be factored into the goal for annual returns.

**Annual Investment Report:**
The first page of the attached report summarizes both District and County directed investment balances as of June 30, 2021 and the related earnings during fiscal year 2020-21. Only $7.5 million of the total District funds (excluding Retiree Health) of nearly $439.2 million is directed by the District. District funds have earned a weighted average annual percentage rate (APR) of .63%. Most of the District directed assets are invested in the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF).

The second page provides more detailed information about District directed investments. This includes trust assets that are professionally managed by Wells Fargo Bank since inception. The investment advisor meets regularly with the Retiree Health Benefits Trust Oversight Committee.

The third page of the report shows similar information regarding County and Escrow directed investments. Except for the Bond Projects and Bond Interest and Redemption Funds, County directed assets are invested in the County’s pooled account, which earned .66% in 2020-21. Proceeds from the District’s sale of General Obligation (GO) Bonds are separately invested by the County in commercial paper, government agency notes and other authorized investment instruments. Earnings on these separately invested GO Bond monies ranged from .94% - 1.96% in fiscal year 2020-21. Investment earnings for the Bond Projects or Bond Interest and Redemption funds may only be expended for bond project costs or bond debt service, respectively.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees accept the District’s Annual Investment Report for fiscal year 2020-21.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** September 8, 2021  

**SUBJECT:** Disposition of Surplus Equipment

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item E  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**

Mario Rodriguez, Vice Chancellor  
Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
The Education Code regulates the procedures by which a Community College District can dispose of real and personal property. Education Code section 81452 provides that the governing board may, by unanimous vote, dispose of items valued at $5,000 or less by private sale without advertising or selling the items at public auction. The District has held previous auctions, but they have generally cost more than they have netted for the District.  

**STATUS:**  
The District has a quantity of surplus materials that needs to be disposed of, such as outdated desks and computers. The District has located a scrap dealer who will take selected surplus items for recycling. Any items remaining will be disposed.  

The surplus items to be recycled or disposed of are either irreparable, obsolete, in poor condition or not needed for district/college operations and include the following: 21 computers, 3 gurneys and 27 monitors.  

These items have a value of less than $5,000.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the disposal of the listed items per Education Code section 81452.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** September 8, 2021  

**SUBJECT:** Special Rate and Y-Rated Salary Schedule revisions.  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item I  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Vice Chancellor  
Finance & Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
The District has had difficulty in recruiting qualified Campus Patrol employees. Temporary Campus Patrol are vital to the safety of our college campuses and help alleviate the workload of our sworn police personnel. It is in the interest of our police department to increase the compensation for this temporary classification to attract qualified applicants.

The Y-rated salary schedule was originally implemented in fiscal year 2020-21 per guidance from CalPERS and requirements of California Code of Regulations (CCR) section 570.5. The agency must continue to reflect the eliminated position(s) and its pay rate(s) on a pay schedule(s), including a notation of when the position was “eliminated and y-rated.” With recent continuing salary improvements to most of the units, some positions that were previously Y-rated can now be removed since the compensation of the positions incumbents were transferred to have exceeded the individual’s present rate of pay and now bring the employee within the regular plan.

**STATUS:**  
Effective September 25, 2021, the Special Rate Salary Schedule will be updated to include the new hourly pay rate for our Campus Patrol employees at $18.30/hour. The Y-rated salary schedule will be modified to include the positions currently held in Y-rated status for fiscal year 2021-22.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the attached salary schedules, the Special Rate salary schedule effective September 25, 2021 and the Y-rated salary schedule effective July 1, 2021.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** September 8, 2021  

**SUBJECT:** SEIU 2021 Collective Bargaining Agreement 2021-2024 Public Disclosure and Approval  
**ATTACHMENT:** None  
**ENCLOSURE:** SEIU Contract  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Collective Bargaining Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Jamey Nye, Deputy Chancellor  
**FIRST READING**  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  
**ACTION** X  
**INFORMATION**  

**BACKGROUND/STATUS:**  
Per Section 3547.5 of the Government Code, prior to entering into a written agreement with an exclusive representative covering matters within the scope of representation, all public school employers are required to disclose the major provisions of the agreement, including but not limited to, the costs associated with the agreement. Although the State Chancellor’s Office has stated community colleges are not covered by this statute, we are required to disclose similar information to the State Chancellor’s Office on certain financial reports. Given the significance of these agreements, public disclosure, even if not specifically required, is still appropriate and prudent.

Negotiations were postponed in 2020 due to COVID-19, and the parties agreed to extend the 2017-20 Service Employees International Union Local 1021 (SEIU) collective bargaining agreement through June 30, 2021. In Spring 2021, SEIU and District representatives resumed negotiations remotely via Zoom to discuss the establishment of a new collective bargaining contract for the next three year period (2021-24). Negotiations were conducted in accordance with applicable law, including Government Code 3547, regulations of the Public Employment Relations Board, and Los Rios Board Policies and Administrative Regulations.

The District has reached a tentative agreement with SEIU for the contract effective July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2024. Throughout the agreement, references to dates have been updated as well as clarification to language when necessary. In addition, provisions from memorandums of understanding (MOUs) agreed to during the current contract term have been incorporated. A summarization of the major provisions of the agreement is as follows:

- **Article 2: Union Rights** - Updated language to reflect changes due to Janus ruling.
- **Article 5: Union Dues and Other Deductions** - Updated language to reflect changes due to Janus ruling.
- **Article 6: Personnel Policies** - Clarification that performance evaluations with an rating of less than “competent” will be accompanied by documentation supporting the.

- **Article 7: Evaluation Process** – Clarification of the long-standing practice that employees will be evaluated annually, working with the employee until they achieve an overall “competent” rating or higher. Expansion of the definition of administratively initiated transfers to include no transfer will be made for arbitrary or punitive reasons, or to avoid filling a vacancy with an employee voluntarily applying for a transfer or promotion, with an opportunity to appeal to the administrative officer. Formalization of the practice of District notification to SEIU 1021 when an employee is placed on administrative leave.
  
- **Article 8: Work Schedules and Overtime** – Implementation of an annual shift bid process for Police Officers.

- **Article 11: Compensation** – Salary improvements for advanced education degrees and certificates relevant to an employee’s position were identified as possible options for discussion of the distribution of SEIU’s proportionate share of available revenues.

- **Article 12: Fringe Benefits and Insurance Programs** – The District shall request actuarial studies from CalPERS for safety retirement benefit packages, to be discussed with SEIU.

- **Article 15: Uniforms** – The uniform allowance for police increased from $675 to $725, to be paid biannually. The three separate classes of police uniforms and related equipment are defined. For non-police department employees, work style shorts may be worn throughout the year, when appropriate.

- **Article 16: Miscellaneous Provisions** – The District agrees to support SEIU by participating in salary surveys and/or compensation studies as appropriate, to be addressed through annual budget discussions regarding funds available to SEIU through the unit’s proportionate share of available resources.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees accept the disclosure information and approve the contract agreement with the Service Employees International Union Local 1021 for the period of July 1, 2021 – June 30, 2024.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** September 8, 2021

**SUBJECT:** Public Hearing: Adoption of 2021-22 Proposed Budgets  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** Budget Book  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Vice Chancellor  
Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**ACTION** X  
**CONSENT/ROUTINE**  
**FIRST READING**  
**INFORMATION**  

---

**BACKGROUND:**

The 2021-22 General fund tentative budget, adopted by the Board of Trustees in June, has been revised to reflect the enacted State budget. The Board is required to hold a public hearing on the proposed budget for the fiscal year on or before the 15th day of September. Budget revisions will be brought to the Board as needed, typically at least twice during the year.

The Governor’s May Revise proposal for California’s Community Colleges was the basis for the tentative budget. The enacted State budget increases overall funding for community colleges by more than $3.5 billion over 2020-21 levels through a combination of ongoing and one-time funds. It fully pays off the deferral from 2020-21, and makes a number of investments, including in dual enrollment, deferred maintenance, student basic needs, and support for faculty. Many of the new investments are one-time, focused on needs revealed or exacerbated by the pandemic.

The enacted budget increases the Tentative Budget by approximately $3 million under the Student Centered Funding Formula, which is the hold harmless level. All three budgets project the formula would yield the same funding as 2020-21, with the addition of the COLA. The X budget assumes no change over reported full-time equivalent students from the emergency conditions provisions due to the pandemic, the Y budget assumes a 2.5% increase in full-time equivalent students, and the Z budget assumes a 5% increase in full-time equivalent students. Given the state’s allowance for emergency conditions for this year, the decline since the pandemic will not impact our overall apportionment from the state; however, it will impact the level of funding we believe will be on-going and will force us to ensure our on-going expenditures match our projections of on-going revenues.

The District’s fiscal health is strong. The budget is balanced and reserves are in line with board policy. The District is strategically using funds provided by the federal government and state government to mitigate and offset impacts caused by the disruption. Additionally, the District continues to fund and refine projections to mitigate the impact of increasing employer contributions required by CalPERS and CalSTRS.

STATUS:  
The budget scenarios for the General Fund are titled the X, Y, and Z budgets. All three budgets project the formula would yield the same funding as 2020-21, which is the hold harmless level, with the addition of the 5.07% COLA. The X budget assumes no change over reported full-time equivalent students from the emergency conditions provisions due to the pandemic, the Y budget assumes a 2.5% increase in full-time equivalent students, and the Z budget assumes a 5% increase in full-time equivalent students.  

The variations in the X, Y and Z budgets are captured in the appropriation area entitled Program and Salary Improvement and the three budgets are summarized on the attached General Fund schedule. The District is currently operating at the X budget level.  

RECOMMENDATION:  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees conduct a public hearing to receive comments on the proposed budgets and adopt the 2021-22 proposed budgets for the General Fund (Z budget), Instructionally-Related, Special Revenue, Capital Projects, Debt Service, Enterprise, Internal Service, Fiduciary, Trust and Auxiliary Funds of the District for filing with the appropriate County/State agencies.

# Introduction
Measure M, a $475 million authorization, was approved by the voters on November 4, 2008. The proceeds are to be used for construction of new facilities and modernization of existing facilities at the District’s four colleges and District Office/District-wide services. The elections were conducted under Proposition 39, which requires the establishment of a Citizens' Bond Oversight Committee. The Committee, representing various constituents of the community and appointed by the Board of Trustees, is responsible for the review of bond expenditures and the presentation of an annual report.

This publication is intended to present to the community a cumulative summary of the expenditures of the District's bond measures, as well as the Committee’s activities for the preceding year.

# Oversight Committee Activities
The District issued Series A of Measure M bonds in October 2010 in the amount of $130 million, issued Series B for $60 million in June 2013, issued Series C $65 million in February 2018 and issued Series D for $80 million in June 2018. In November 2017, the District refunded $106.9 million of Measure M, Series A resulting in savings to our taxpayers of approximately $12.8 million (NPV).

During the past year, the Committee reviewed the financial activity for capital projects funded by bond proceeds. The Committee also received the District’s Independent Auditor’s reports, financial statements, and performance audit for the bond funds as of June 30, 2020. These reports fulfill the requirement for separate review of the financial activity per the provisions of Proposition 39. The Committee received updates on the District’s budget, Scheduled Maintenance and Special Repair (SMSR) funding, the District’s Facilities Master Plan, and the status of bond funded projects in progress during the year.

# Summary
All expenditures authorized by the School Facilities Bonds have been reviewed by the Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee to ensure the money has been spent only on school facility improvements authorized by the Bond Act. All funds expended from Measure M are audited annually by an independent audit firm. The Oversight Committee has reviewed expenditures and projects and believes the District is in compliance with the requirements of Article XIII A Section 1(b)(3) of the California Constitution and consistent with the District’s approved local bond measures. Implementation of the District’s long-term capital plans continues to progress. For Measure M, $340 million has been appropriated for sixty-two projects including funding for infrastructure improvements at three of the colleges and District wide. Detailed information regarding the projects for both measures is provided on the following pages. The expenditures are cumulative through May 31, 2021.
