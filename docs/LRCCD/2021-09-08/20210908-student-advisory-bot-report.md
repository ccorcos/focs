**Report provided by ASO Student Senate President/Representative: ARC Club and Events Board President Mark Sheppard**

Below is a list of highlighted activities, accomplishments and events at each of the colleges within the Los Rios District. This report is to be used as a guide for the Student Advisory Committee representative and the Student Trustee in providing the monthly LRCCD student report at the LRCCD Board of Trustee (BoT) meetings. Only the information on this report will be used. Not all areas need to be completed; rather, this is a guide on topics to consider. Approved/signed college reports are due to the Student Trustee one week prior to each scheduled BoT meeting. The Student Trustee in consultation with the SAC Advisor will compile these submissions for one comprehensive report which is due to District Advisor Dr. Rosario, the designated student speaker, and SAC Advisor by noon the Friday before the BOT meeting. Late submissions/unauthorized reports will not be presented at the BOT meeting.
