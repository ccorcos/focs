**Chancellor’s Report:**

**ARC:** ARC is collaborating with SCC on an innovative project to help CalWORKs and CalFresh eligible students learn how to stretch their food budgets, apply for and maximize food benefits like CalFresh, acquire culinary skills, and utilize money- and time-saving techniques. This will result in more time, money, and resources and lead to healthier lifestyle and food choices as well as continuing access to sound food and nutrition resources. ARC’s Hospitality Management/Culinary Arts program - led by Professor Teresa Urkofsky - is supporting the project with videos, engaging instruction, and more. The project will include Canvas modules and lots of interaction with students.

**CRC:** CRC CIS Professor Markus Geissler and Professor Cara Tang of Portland Community College recently had their co-authored paper titled "Strategies for Integrating Two-Year Information Technology and Cybersecurity Programs" accepted for presentation at the 22nd ACM Annual Conference on Information Technology Education (SIGITE 2021), which will be co-hosted by Brigham Young University and Utah Valley University at Snowbird, Utah on October 6-9, 2021.

**FLC:** Folsom Lake College’s El Dorado Center (EDC) is currently serving as a Local Assistance Center for El Dorado County residents impacted by the Caldor Fire. Services are provided by state and county emergency personnel inside EDC's Fitness Center. The location serves as a one-stop-shop for residents to connect with critical government services, replace lost or destroyed vital documents, and get connected with support services. Members of the FLC community have also donated bottled water, clothing, diapers, and more to the location to help those in need. In addition, shower, laundry, and kitchen facilities were made available at the Main Folsom campus for affected students and employees. Donations were collected to purchase gift cards for essential needs for evacuated employees, and $6,600 was raised for the Falcon Cares program to provide financial assistance to students who have been impacted by the fire.

**SCC:** SCC’s student services area has created new success webpages for our LGBTQ+, Black, Latino/a, Asian Pacific Islander, and Native American students. Each success page connects students to programs, resources and opportunities to enhance their experience and success.
