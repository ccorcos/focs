# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT CLASSIFIED SENATE
## Board of Trustees Report – Sep 2021

### AMERICAN RIVER COLLEGE
**Kristin Farlow, Classified Senate President**

The ARC Classified Senate hosted a “Classified Meet Up” event the day before Convocation on August 19th highlighting or upcoming professional development opportunities. Classified Professionals got a chance to meet and mingle and ask questions – virtually. The event went over time due to many questions that are still coming to Senate representatives surrounding our vaccine mandate. We continue to engage our LRCEA partners with those communications.

The Classified Senate is holding our annual Retreat in various zoom meetings this week to train new Senators, solidify our vision and goals for the year, and dive into our Senate work for the year filling committees.

### COSUMNES RIVER COLLEGE
**Clark, Tiffany, Classified Senate President**

There’s been some changes within the Classified Senate executive team, a new secretary was appointed due to a team member stepping down and the need for a new past president arose because of a position change. April Robinson is serving as the secretary and Jennifer Patrick (Classified Senate President 2017-2019) as past president.

The Classified Senate hosted a lunch time virtual Meet and Greet session Friday, August 20th as part of flex week activities. The session was well-attended. The first Classified Senate meeting for the 21/22 academic year is scheduled for September 8th at 2:00pm.
