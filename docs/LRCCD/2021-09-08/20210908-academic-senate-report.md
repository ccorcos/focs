**LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT ACADEMIC SENATE**

**Academic Senate Reports to the LRCCD Board of Trustees Respectfully submitted by the Academic Senate Presidents Sept 8, 2021 (ConferZoom)**

**District Academic Senate (DAS) President, Julie Oliver, Reports:**

- In collaboration with representatives from LRCFT, the DAS President joined in a May presentation and an August FLEX week presentation explaining the newly negotiated Equity Reflection which faculty need to complete in association with their performance review cycle. The DAS stressed the importance of question number three which asks for recommended professional development opportunities to help support faculty in their equity growth and development. At the DAS meeting on Tues Sept 7- a discussion will occur about how to collect and use the data from this question to support professional development scheduling.

- College Academic Senate Presidents all participated in local processes to determine which full time tenure track faculty positions to hire in an expedited process this fall. College Academic Senates will also be participating this fall in the regular full time tenure track faculty hiring prioritization process to determine which positions will be hired this spring. Everyone is extremely grateful for the funding from the state for these full-time tenure track faculty hires.

- As a part of the expedited full time tenure track faculty hiring this fall, ethnic studies faculty will be hired at ARC, CRC, and SCC this fall (FLC has already determined a FT faculty for ES, see Eric Wada’s FLC report). Also, each college is in the process or completed the process of creating an ethnic studies department. The Los Rios Faculty Ethnic Studies Council should be commended for all their hard work since being formed in December 2020, and the council will be focused on continued curricular development this fall. The DAS and all college Academic Senates have been very supportive of the work of the council in elevating ethnic studies in LRCCD.

- At the two September DAS meetings, the body will be discussing how to meet Brown Act requirements after the governor’s executive orders expire September 30th. All Brown Act compliant groups will need to have a plan for meetings starting in October to return to meeting in person, perhaps using the teleconferencing options, as outlined in the law.

- On August 17th the DAS held a retreat with invited guests from ASCCC to facilitate a discussion about what is and what is not “10+1” or academic and professional matters.

**California Title 5 §53200 “10+1”: 1. Curriculum, including establishing prerequisites 2. Degree and certificate requirements 3. Grading policies 4. Educational program development 5. Standards or policies regarding student preparation and success 6. College governance structures, as related to faculty roles 7. Faculty roles and involvement in the accreditation process 8. Policies for faculty professional development activities 9. Processes for program review 10. Processes for institutional planning and budget development 11. Other academic and professional matters as mutually agreed upon.**

### ARC Academic Senate President, Alisa Shubb, Reports:

- At the first meeting of the ARC Academic Senate we heard concerns for our Afghan students on Special Immigrant Visas, particularly how they may be vulnerable to being tracked digitally as being affiliated with the US thus making their family members in Afghanistan targets of violence.
- ARC Academic Senate is also addressing
  - academic & professional impacts as relates to mask & vaccine requirements
  - revising the faculty hiring prioritization process to align priorities with College Equity goals
  - establishing courageous conversation community guidelines for Academic Senate meetings
- ARC is excited to have received the MESA grant
- There is significant concern about the status of the Brown Act special permissions that allow for remote meetings, particularly as we have seen a distinct improvement in meeting accessibility and attendance while conducting meetings via zoom.

### CRC Academic Senate President, Scott Crosier, Reports:

- Cosumnes River College has had a successful launch to another Fall semester.
- We are pleased to hear of our Chancellor’s recovery. We hope for his continued health and strength. It is sobering to see one’s leader, even one who had been vaccinated, still taken down by this pandemic.
- To date, there have been no incidents with students or staff at CRC resisting the current mask mandate. We have also continued messaging students regarding the October 1st deadline for vaccination and hope for continued success and cooperation.
- There is significant concern among the Brown Act compliant committees regarding the need to return to face-to-face meetings. The overall sentiment is that we are still in a pandemic and that returning to such gatherings raises the risk of transmission, even for those who are already vaccinated.
- With significant trepidation, we plan for a Spring semester utilizing much more in-person, on-campus classes. Over the past several years we have been working on our agility and flexibility and will try to continue to remain so as we move into a very uncertain future.

- Our Senate and an ad hoc Faculty Hiring Prioritization Committee held special meetings to forward a recommendation on fall faculty hiring to our College President.
- The Senate recognizes that Ethnic Studies will be a fast-growing discipline at the college and in Los Rios. Dr. Tamara (Tami) Cheshire will chair our new Ethnic Studies department. She has, in less than an academic year, established herself as a leader at our college, in the district as co-chair of the Los Rios Ethnic Studies Faculty Council (ESFC), and in the state with her involvement with the CCC ESFC.
- Some of our faculty have been affected by the Caldor fire. Some have been evacuated from their homes. Those who teach in-person at the El Dorado Center have had to switch to remote or alternative sites for instruction due to poor air quality.

![SCC Academic Senate President, Lori Petite, Reports:](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

- On August 24*, the SCC Academic Senate paid tribute to the life and legacy of Professor Tanya Rodriguez, who passed away suddenly in early August. Tanya was a gifted Philosophy professor, collaborative colleague, and equity champion. She served on our SESI Professional Learning Community, multiple committees, and the SCC Academic Senate. Tanya was respected and loved by her students and our college community. A scholarship in her honor is currently in the planning stages.
- Efforts have continued by Senate representatives, Ethnic Studies faculty, and our college administration to establish a formal Ethnic Studies Department at SCC this Fall. We appreciate the District's prioritization of the hiring of a full-time Ethnic Studies faculty member at each of the colleges, in addition to the other faculty hiring opportunities recently announced for this calendar year.
- Our Staff Resource Center provided an outstanding schedule of professional development options as faculty returned for Professional Development week. Numerous offerings focused on equity, student success, and successful teaching practices in the online environment.
- We appreciate the address by Deputy Chancellor Nye during the SCC Convocation and send best wishes to Chancellor King for health and healing.

![Los Rios CCD Academic Senate Call to Action](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

Approved Tuesday November 17, 2020

The four Los Rios Colleges and the District Academic Senate support the Academic Senate of California Community Colleges (ASCCC) Fall 2019 Plenary Resolution “Support Infusing Anti-Racism/No Hate Education in Community Colleges”. Specifically, to the following Resolved statements from that resolution:
- denounce racism for its negative psychological, social, educational, and economic effects on human development throughout the lifespan;
- take steps to not only strive for a greater knowledge about and the celebration of diversity but also to support deeper training that reveals the inherent racism embedded in societal institutions in the United States, including the educational system, and asks individuals to examine their personal role in the support of racist structures and the commitment to work to dismantle structural racism; and
<!-- Page 4 -->
- infuse Anti- Racism/No Hate Education in all its activities and professional development opportunities to the degree that doing so is feasible.

To achieve this, our Academic Senates are committed to:
1. Include a discussion of anti-racism/no-hate education on agendas. Remembering that we do not have to have an answer to start a conversation.
2. Prioritize culturally responsive curricular redesign with our curriculum committees.
3. Acknowledge, without assigning blame, that the structure of our colleges houses the biases and prejudices of their founding times. Those biases have privileged some and disadvantaged others, particularly African American and LatinX communities.
4. Prioritize the evaluation of hiring and evaluation processes with an equity lens.
5. Request services from the ASCCC about any of these topics if needed.
6. Evaluate our academic senates and find the voices among our faculties missing in governance. Find ways to empower those voices.
7. Work with our administrations, classified professional colleagues, and students to find constructive ways students can express themselves about structural and historical biases that exist.
