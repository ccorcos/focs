FLC held a lunch-n-learn hosted by Schools First FCU on Tuesday November 12th on “Take Control of your Finances, with SchoolsFirst.” In this workshop, we reviewed the fundamentals of budgeting, share best practices to be successful at reaching your financial goals, and share tips and tools for taking control of your finances to improve your overall financial well-being. It was a successful event with attendance of 17 classified staff.

Our equity center held a very successful Diwali event and our student service team helped to set up Dia de Los Muertos ofrendas ( altars) with offerings and personal items at main campus as well as RCC & EDC in celebration of our loved ones and ancestors who have passed.
