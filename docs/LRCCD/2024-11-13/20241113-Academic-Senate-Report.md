# Academic Senates’ Reports to the LRCCD Board of Trustees
## October 2024

### District Academic Senate (DAS) President, Paula Cardwell, Reports:
- The District Academic Senate will be considering the recommendation of our first Noncredit Task Force to follow up on more specific feasibility concerns at our November 19th meeting. We will also be considering regulation changes regarding our International Education programs, which separate consortium-based international education programs from college-based international education programs.
- The Artificial Intelligence Summit has exceeded attendance capacity and we are very excited about Friday’s program, which was curated to assist faculty and our community wherever they may stand on the issue of AI. Representatives from the Khan Academy, Intel, the State Chancellor’s Office, UC Regent Lark Park, Accenture, and members of our own faculty will be presenting on a broad range of topics related to AI, and Dr. Candace Thille of Stanford will be kicking the day off with a presentation on “The Science of Human Learning.”
- Our NAGPRA task force met for an all-day writing retreat on October 25th. We made significant progress on our draft policy and hope to complete and share the draft with DAS and our tribal partners before the end of the semester.
- Several members of the DAS attended our plenary session in Visalia from Nov. 7-9. Eric Wada, Wayne Jensen, Lori Petite, adjunct professor of business Sylvester White of SCC and myself were able to attend in person and Jacob Velasquez and Brian Knirk were in attendance remotely. The program and venue were excellent and resolutions regarding Common Course numbering, AI, Legislation and Advocacy, and Open Educational Materials, among others, were passed. We thank the Board for your continued support of our attendance at Plenary.

### American River College Senate President, Brian Knirk, Reports:
- ARC’s Oct. 24 meeting was entirely focused on faculty hiring prioritizations with presentations by faculty and attended by ARC Deans, Vice Presidents and the President. There are 45 requests for between 20-30 positions.

- ARC has voted to participate in cluster hiring for the next round of faculty hires. Supplemental questions for the hiring process were approved at the November 7th meeting.

**Folsom Lake College Senate President, Eric Wada, Reports:**
- As of this writing, we are in the process of prioritizing full-time faculty positions for the 2024-25 hiring cycle. The Senate has seen the Board retreat reports on classified, management, and faculty hiring across the district including the relative proportion of faculty hires over the years compared to, for example, management hires.
- We continue to work well with our college administration to find ways to continue to sustain support for both faculty professional development and onboarding and orientation support for new full-time faculty. Like any equity-focused effort, the equitable gains and institutional change that result from faculty hiring can only be sustained if we continue to support faculty through their first year and beyond.
- Discussions about how to center college faculty in making recommendations about dual enrollment and PREP offerings continue in our Dual Enrollment subcommittee.
- Our faculty are also busy engaging in hiring for our new VPSS and VPI positions.
- Our college is also engaging in a facilities repurposing discussion regarding secondary effects of Chemistry and Biology labs moving into the new science building resulting in vacant spaces that are sought after by several departments/units.

**Sacramento City College Senate President, Amy Strimling, Reports:**
- SCC completed the faculty hiring prioritization process. There were 36 position requests submitted for the 5 - 10 positions we are told to expect to be hired.
- SCC faculty have shared concerns regarding the Chatbot feature on the campus websites as well as the search engine. The search engine has very limited capabilities. Spelling words wrong results in a failed search. This can impact anyone but brings additional challenges for our English Language Learners on campus. One search example for “bereavement support” brings up “Community Resources for LGBTQ students”. Many would consider this a microaggression. We hope more attention can be given to this.
