Los Rios Community College District Indigenous Land Acknowledgment Statement  
In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.  

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** November 13, 2024  

**SUBJECT:** Los Rios Colleges Foundation – Quarterly Investment Report  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item E  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez,  
Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
In 1998, the District and Los Rios Colleges Foundation (Foundation) adopted a Master Agreement whereby the Foundation became an auxiliary organization of the district. All college foundations’ investment activities were combined under the Foundation. Morgan Stanley is the investment consultant for the Foundation.  

As an auxiliary organization, the Foundation is not required to operate under GC 53600 investment restrictions. The Foundation Board has a Statement of Rules, Objectives and Guidelines (Statement) to govern the investment of funds, last revised June 2018. The funds should be invested with care, skill, prudence, and diligence with the goal of producing returns equal to or exceeding prevailing standards among foundations of similar asset size, as well as for the protection of funds held in perpetual duration. The Statement defines the investment guidelines for specified asset classes for endowed funds as follows: equities, defined as common stock, convertible preferred stock, convertible bonds, and convertible stock, shall represent 25-60% of the total fund assets; fixed-income securities, defined as investments with maturities greater than one year that pay a fixed rate of return, shall represent 17-50% of the total assets; alternative investments, defined as fund-of-fund investments, shall represent up to 20% of the total fund assets; and cash, defined as maturities shorter than one year, shall represent 2-10% of the total fund assets. In addition, the Statement provides guidelines for investing non-endowed funds based upon the purpose of the donation and the horizon of time for the use of funds. The three non-endowed portfolio funds available are cash management, fixed income, and balanced funds.  

**STATUS:**  
The Foundation Quarterly Investment Report, including realized and unrealized earnings, represents the investment activity for the quarter ended September 30th. The Los Rios Colleges Foundation Finance Committee directs the investments of the Foundation. The return for the quarter ended for the endowed portfolio of $20 million was 5.81% compared to 6.29% for the composite benchmark. The return for the quarter ended for the total managed portfolio of $27.2 million was 4.78% compared to 5.21% for the composite benchmark. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, investments are restated to market value as of each fiscal year-end.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees receive the Foundation Quarterly Investment Report for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

**BACKGROUND:**  
The Education Code regulates the procedures by which a Community College District can dispose of real and personal property. Education Code section 81452 provides that the governing board may, by unanimous vote, dispose of items valued at $5,000 or less by private sale without advertising or selling the items at public auction. The District has held previous auctions, but they have generally cost more than they have netted for the District.

**STATUS:**  
The District has a quantity of surplus materials that need to be disposed of, such as outdated desks and computers. The District has located a scrap dealer who will take selected surplus items for recycling. Any items remaining will be disposed.

The surplus items to be recycled or disposed of are either irreparable, obsolete, in poor condition or not needed for district/college operations and include the following:  
- 4 baker’s racks  
- 6 Chromebooks  
- 1 closed-circuit television  
- 4 computers  
- 1 DVD writer  
- 2 filing cabinets  
- 5 laptops  
- 1 laser engraver  
- 1 monitor  
- 4 printers  
- 2 scanners  

These items have a value of less than $5,000.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the disposal of the listed items per Education Code section 81452.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** November 13, 2024  

**SUBJECT:** 2024-2025 Sabbaticals/Professional Development Leaves  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 3  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item L  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor of Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
The agreement with the Los Rios College Federation of Teachers (LRCFT) provides that at least ten (10) Type A sabbaticals and 2.1 FTE of Type B professional development leaves be granted each year. Type A leaves are leaves of one semester at full pay or one year at half pay. Type B leaves are reassigned time for up to 100% and for up to one year in duration.

The agreement with the LRCFT permits the Professional Standards Committee at each college to recommend the conversion of one or more Type A sabbaticals into equivalent FTE of Type B leaves.

Sabbatical/professional development leave recommendations are presented to the Board in April and November of each year.

The purpose and scope for leaves, as stated in the LRCFT agreement (11.6.4) are as follows:  
1. Retraining of applicant to allow for new assignment(s) in a needed area as determined by College and District priorities.  
2. Studies, projects or activities that provide staff with opportunities to upgrade academic, technical, and vocational skills and knowledge for current or future assignments.  
3. Studies, projects, or activities for the improvement and/or innovation of curriculum, educational delivery systems, student personnel services, or other support services.  
4. Studies, projects, or activities for development or revision of certificate or degree programs.  
5. Studies, projects, or activities related to feasibility or revision of new or existing programs.  
6. Studies, projects, or activities for the enhancement of student access and success at the course, department program or institutional, or community college system levels.  
7. Studies, projects, or activities that support completion of college and/or District goals, objectives and priorities.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the attached sabbatical/professional development leaves be approved by the Board of Trustees for the 2024-2025 year.

“Acen Accreditation”  
Proposal: Our nursing program is not nationally accredited. We are starting the process of obtaining national accreditation through the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN). ACEN accreditation is necessary to demonstrate that our program has clear and appropriate educational objectives and that we are working to achieve these objectives. Many hiring organizations require national accreditation to hire our new graduate nurses.  

**Joshua Weiner**  
History Professor 40% Spring 2025 .200 FTE  
“Sourcebook of Modern World History: Alternate Pasts/Better Futures”  
Proposal: Equitable and anti-racist education is a crucial component of ARC’s mission. Low or zero cost textbooks can be a means of addressing equity, but that alone is insufficient unless the content is inclusive and addresses the challenge of anti-racism head on. Based on my earlier work on an OER world history textbook dedicated to equity, anti-racism, and social justice, I propose to create an OER Primary Source reader for the Modern World History survey. I am proposing a primary source reader instead of a textbook for several reasons: first, because of its versatility. Instructors can use it as their main text, as a supplement to other materials, or even just use it as a resource for themselves but not something they assign. Primary sources also bring the voices of historical actors directly to students instead of being mediated by textbook authors. Additionally, a reader allows me to carefully select the sources to emphasize people and perspectives that have typically been ignored or underrepresented in more traditional materials. A final benefit comes from the fact that the reader will be housed in a digital environment. That will allow me to provide students with a range of sources in multiple mediums: written documents, art and architecture, photographs, artifacts, and even films and recorded speeches. For the project I will take on the significant task of curating a collection of primary sources organized into chapters that are structured around specific themes. I will begin each chapter with an introductory essay laying out those themes.

“Set Up of Newly Renovated Culinary Arts Management Lab Space”  
**Proposal:** Set Up of Newly Renovated Culinary Arts Management Lab Space is a crucial component in the transformation of the CAM program. For the last eight years, Michael has been working diligently to upgrade curriculum and plan for this lab space which includes three unique components - an instructional kitchen, restaurant simulation kitchen, and dining room lab. As the only full-time faculty member in CAM, the daunting task of overseeing the lab set up falls to Michael, with instructional outfitting and organizing these new spaces with all the necessary items to reflect industry standards. Once operational, the lab will provide students with a safe, high-quality experience as they complete their CAM courses and prepare for entering the work force. The committee was impressed with Michael's careful planning and thoughtful consideration of how to complete the renovation with minimal impact to student learning. Although the committee was unanimous in its support of Michael's proposal, we also believe that such necessary work as lab set up (particularly after a $6 million renovation!) should be supported by the college through a one-time FTE allotment.

“Curating and creating OER Materials for PSYC 312 Biological Psychology Lab”  
**Proposal:** I propose to create OER content for PSYC 312 which is a class that currently has no appropriate OER materials or even commercially produced lab manuals. Creating manuals for science and experimental lab courses is a tremendous undertaking and one that falls well outside of regular faculty duties. Once completed, the new lab manual and associated faculty handbook will be a crucial resource for our students and faculty and help address equity gaps by making the content freely accessible. In addition, PSYC 312 is a hands-on learning opportunity, something most students don't experience until they transfer to a four-year university. The committee appreciates Naomi's efforts to create and share materials that will benefit both Psychology majors and non-majors alike.

**Holly Piscopo**  
History Professor  
100%  
Spring 2025  
.500 FTE  
**Proposal:** My focus is to explore how community college history teachers utilize AI tools like ChatGPT in their classes, particularly in online classes. Despite the prevailing polarization between AI enthusiasts and skeptics, students are using AI. That's not the question. What I want to do is research how other teachers are using AI and then adapt my classes with AI tools to make learning history more interesting, informative, and engaging. Finally, I want to do all of this while inviting into my class’s conversations about the high human value of not sounding like a soulless chatbot.

1.2 The Associate in Arts degree and the Associate in Science degree may be conferred upon students qualified to transfer to a four-year college or university as well as upon those completing their formal education in a two-year vocational program as outlined in the catalog of any of the Colleges of the District. The Associate in Arts for Transfer degree and the Associate in Science for Transfer degree were created by SB 1440 (2010) to allow students to transfer to the California State University with junior status upon the completion of prescribed requirements.

1.3 In accordance with law and with the rules and regulations of the California Community College Board of Governors and the Los Rios Community College District Board of Trustees, the requirements for the degree Associate in Arts, Associate in Arts for Transfer, Associate in Science, or Associate in Science for Transfer are defined below.

### 2.0 Associate in Arts or the Associate in Science Graduation Requirements

#### 2.1 Number of Units
2.1.1 Satisfactory completion of a minimum of sixty (60) units of collegiate work degree-applicable lower-division credit courses with a “C” (2.0) grade point average, in a curriculum which the District accepts toward the degree; provided that twelve (12) units must be earned in residence at the College recommending the degree.

1.3.1 All reference to “units” in this policy is to “semester units.”

2.1.2 Units of credit are assigned to courses based on the “Carnegie unit,” which assigns one unit of credit for three (3) hours of work by the student per week. Usually this means one (1) hour of lecture or discussion led by the instructor and two (2) hours of outside preparation by the student. In laboratory courses, three (3) hours of work in the laboratory are normally assigned one (1) unit of credit which may include some additional preparation outside of class time.

from those specified in the catalog of each College with a minimum grade of “C” or the equivalent for any class in a major field of study.

#### 2.2.1.1 A “major” is a focused program of study within a specific discipline, which may include some coursework outside the primary discipline.  
#### 2.2.1.2 An “area of emphasis” is an interdisciplinary program of study encompassing a broad range of courses from multiple related academic disciplines, providing students with an academic pathway broader than a specific major but more focused than general education.

### 2.3 General Education Requirements
2.3.1 Each College of the District will publish in its catalog a specific philosophy of general education. The following will serve as a pattern for the Colleges in the development of their individual philosophy statements.

#### 2.3.1.1 The primary function of education is to transmit from each generation to the next the knowledge and skills requisite to enlarge the comprehension of our place in the universe. Los Rios Colleges are committed to the principle of providing general education which includes: English Composition, Oral Communication and Critical Thinking; Mathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning; Arts and Humanities; Social and Behavioral Sciences; Natural Sciences; Ethnic Studies, Natural Science, Social and Behavioral Science, Humanities and the Arts, Language and Critical Thinking, and other courses that provide for life-long learning and understanding, and that explore the significance of work, production, consumption and leisure in the lives of individuals. All of these are basic and necessary to participate in and contribute to a balanced life in a democratic society that is diverse in its social, cultural, and educational backgrounds.

#### 2.3.1.2 A comprehensive education serves to develop the creativity, critical thinking, ethical behavior, and self-understanding which are essential to the attainment of personal goals and to participate in a society characterized by increasing global interdependence and by rapid and significant change.

#### 2.3.1.3 Therefore, the purpose of general education is to give breadth to the college experience, enhance the ability to learn, and insure an appropriate level of competency. The general education program thus provides coherence to undergraduate education and affords students the opportunity to develop an integrated overview of the diverse fields of human knowledge.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** November 13, 2024  

**SUBJECT:** Public Hearing: College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP)  
Memorandum of Understanding: Rex & Margaret Fortune Early College High School  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Edward Bush, President  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
With the passage of Assembly Bill 102, California community college districts are authorized to enter into a College and Career Access Pathways Partnership with a charter school to expand opportunities for high school students to take college courses during the regular school day and for community colleges to claim apportionment. To go forward with this program, the law requires community college districts and charter schools to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding approved by the governing boards of both the community college district and the charter school.  

**STATUS:**  
The proposed College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is between the Los Rios Community College District and Rex & Margaret Fortune Early College High School. There are no significant differences between this MOU and our standard CCAP MOU template. This MOU will replace the current non-CCAP MOU that expires in June of 2025. The purpose of the MOU is to offer and expand dual enrollment opportunities for students who may not already be college bound or who are underrepresented in higher education, with the goal of developing seamless pathways from high school to community college. Beginning Spring 2025, classes will be offered to High School students attending Rex & Margaret Fortune Early College High School. At the completion of these classes, students will earn credit toward multiple degree or certificate programs within their relevant college’s catalog.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees conduct a public hearing; adopt the proposed CCAP MOU between the Los Rios Community College District and Rex & Margaret Fortune Early College High School and authorize the Chancellor or his designee(s) to execute the MOU and any future augmentations, amendments, renewals, extensions, or other modifications to the MOU.
