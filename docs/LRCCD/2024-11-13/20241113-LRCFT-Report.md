# LRCFT report to the LRCCD Trustees  
**Nov. 13, 2024**

The LRCFT is pleased to report that several of our locally endorsed candidates were elected to office. They include Maggie Krell for AD 6, Martha Guerrero for mayor in West Sacramento, Roger Dickinson for Sacramento City Council D2, Michael Benjamin for Sac Unified School Board, and Dr. Colette Harris Mathews for Los Rios trustee Area 5.

Our members knocked on doors, made phone calls, and sent text messages to elect these candidates. Some of us also went to Reno in October to canvass for state and national races.

The LRCFT is also participating in our own internal elections this semester. Our members will vote to elect the positions of campus representative, Treasurer, and LRCFT President.

This Friday, the LRCFT executive board will meet at American River College’s Oak Café for a team building event and group dinner hosted by Professor Teresa Urkofsky in the culinary arts department.

We are also attending the Sacramento Central Labor Council’s Salute to labor dinner this week honoring women in the labor movement.

Looking ahead to 2025, we are in the planning stages for the statewide student March in March for Affordable and Accessible Higher Education. The event takes place in Sacramento on March 5 and is sponsored by the CFT.

In closing, the LRCFT will join faculty from throughout the District at the AI summit held at FLC on Friday. Faculty are increasingly approaching us with concerns about the workload impacts of AI.

Thank you!
