**Los Rios Community College District Indigenous Land Acknowledgment Statement**  
In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.  

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** June 12, 2024

**SUBJECT:** Resolution No. 2024-05: 2024-25 Appropriation Limitation  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item B  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez,  
Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
Pursuant to Article XIII-B of the Constitution and Government Code Section 7900, all community college districts are required to compute an annual appropriation limit. That appropriation limit is adjusted annually for changes in price index, population, and other applicable factors. This requirement is also known as the Gann Limit.

Due to recent legislative updates to the Gann limit, districts with excess limit should adopt a new appropriations limit equal to their proceeds of taxes, thereby transferring any available limit to the State of California. Staff has calculated the 2024-25 appropriation limit as specified in the Government Code Section 7908. The calculated spending limit is $443,616,720. The District’s 2024-25 appropriations subject to this limit are calculated at $417,194,940, which indicates that the District does not have excess limit, since its tentative budget is $26,421,780 below its appropriation limit. For 2023-24 the District’s appropriations subject to the limit were $21,518,532 above the appropriation limit of $366,938,794.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
Since the District does not have an excess limit, it is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the appropriation limitation of $443,616,720 for 2024-25 by adopting the attached Resolution No. 2024-05.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** June 12, 2024

**SUBJECT:** 2023-24 Budget Revision № 2  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Consent Item C  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**STATUS:**  
Revisions to the adopted budget for the General Fund are necessary for the following reasons:

1. Schedule I summarizes changes to revenues, appropriations, and fund balance for the general fund. General Fund revenues and appropriations are budgeted $27.9 million more than the budget revision #1 level due to changes in general purpose, and restricted/special programs revenues. General Fund unrestricted revenue increased by $4.4 million, which is mainly due to changes in apportionment estimates and anticipated interest income. Restricted revenues increased by $23.6 million, which is predominantly due to additional State awards received since the budget was last revised, as shown on Schedule II.
2. Schedule II provides specific adjustments to restricted and special program revenues. Restricted revenues reflect new awards for Federal and State programs, as well as augmentations to existing programs for federal, state and local. The changes in appropriations reflect the allocation of those additional resources as well as re-alignment across object codes as expenditure plans are formalized.

Revisions to other District funds due to:

3. Instructionally-Related Activities (Schedule III): There is an increase in budgeted local revenue and interfund transfers. The changes in appropriations reflect the allocation of additional resources.
4. Child Development Fund (Schedule IV): The budget modifications primarily involve a re-alignment of appropriations to meet the program needs.
5. Capital Outlay Projects (Schedule V): The changes mostly reflect the budgeting of program.

4. Student Financial Aid (Schedule VIII): Increase in state and federal grants and an increase in State Categorical programs transferred from the General Fund.
5. Regional Performing Arts Center—Enterprise Fund (Schedule IX): Adjustments reflect the updated forecast of events and activities taking place at the Center.
6. Student Association Trust Fund (Schedule X): Minimal adjustments to revenues and appropriations.
7. Scholarship & Loan Trust Fund (Schedule XI): Increase in projected interest income.
8. Los Rios Colleges Foundation (Schedule XII): There is a boost in projected donations, accompanied by revisions to the associated fund balance.

# Percentage of Contractor’s Funded Enrollment

In accordance with EC sections 8208(c)(1) and (d)(2)(A), a percentage of the contractor’s funded enrollment will be set aside specifically to allow children with exceptional needs, including children with severe disabilities, to be enrolled until the set aside is filled.

Please indicate the total percentage of children with exceptional needs (including severe disabilities) that are currently being served under your CSPP enrollment.

**3.00 %**

If your program is not meeting the required set aside percentage at this time, what strategies will you implement to increase enrollment of children with exceptional needs?

The CDC Supervisors continue to work with community agencies to recruit more children with special needs. Additionally, we are currently working with several children that we believe may need referrals according to teachers’ observations, however do not have a current IEP.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** June 12, 2024

**SUBJECT:** Resolution 2024:06: Five Year Capital Outlay Plan  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** Five Year Plan  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  
**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
The State Chancellor’s Office (SCO) has a prescribed capital outlay process and calendar for requesting State funds for capital outlay projects. Each year the District must file a Five Year Capital Outlay Plan which lists all proposed projects, whether State funded or not. Final Project Proposals (FPPs), which are prepared to request State funding for projects listed in the Five Year Capital Outlay Plan, are also to be submitted with the Five Year Capital Outlay Plan each year. This information is due to the State Chancellor’s Office by July 1, 2024.

Although a district may qualify for State funding, all districts are competing for the limited funds available. Facility capacity/load ratios (enrollment growth) and local contribution of funds are key elements in the State’s prioritization of funding capital projects.

---

**STATUS:**  
In November 2016, Proposition 51 was passed authorizing $7 billion in general obligation bonds from the State. These funds are approaching full expenditure and have resulted in the construction of multiple facilities throughout the District. In February 2020, the State was unsuccessful in passing a new bond measure leaving the capital outlay process in an unfunded status. Regardless of the State’s capital outlay status, the District continues to participate in the capital outlay process in the hopes a future bond measures passing, allowing participation to resume. Additionally, due to the failure of the District’s local bond measure in 2020 and the requirement of a local contribution to obtain State funding, there will be no FPP’s submitted in this year’s cycle. This year’s Five Year Capital Outlay Plan does, however, anticipate a future State and local bond and the timing of projects so that these funds can be combined and maximized.

This is the second reading of the draft Five Year Capital Outlay Plan that the Board is asked to approve. The attached executive summary describes the Five Year Capital Outlay Plan. A first reading of the draft plan was presented at the May Board meeting and is included as an enclosure to the agenda.

---

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the Five Year Capital Outlay Plan and supporting Resolution No. 2024-06 for submission to the State.

**State Five Year Construction Plan:**

The basic intent and purpose of the Plan is to analyze enrollment forecasts and determine the amount and type of spaces that will be needed to meet increases changes in enrollment and changes in the educational program. The Plan is used to determine overall estimated costs and identify possible funding sources.

The major components of the Plan are: forecasted student load (enrollment/WSCH), facilities capacity to handle load, proposed new space, proposed modernizations and possible funding sources. The first three components are compiled into “capacity/load ratios”. Capacity/load ratios represent, as a percentage, the facilities capacity to handle forecasted student load (or demand). These capacity/load ratios are the primary tool used by the State to determine which projects will be approved. Also, the State has a priority system which causes districts to compete against each other to offer the State the least cost alternative. Because of this, most projects have a local contribution indicated. The local contribution is intended to make our projects more competitive for limited State funding. This year’s State Five Year Capital Outlay Plan lists 45 projects, comprised mainly of modernization projects.

**Possible Sequencing of State Funded Projects**

In November 2016, the voters passed Proposition 51 authorizing $7 billion in general obligation bonds for new construction and modernization of K–12 public school facilities; charter schools and vocational education facilities; and $2 billion for California Community Colleges facilities. This influx of bond dollars allowed for a significant amount of FPPs to be funded. Proposition 51 currently contributes funding to several District projects in process. However, due to no further State or local bond funds being available, there will be no FPP’s submitted this year.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** June 12, 2024  

**SUBJECT:** 2024-25 District Tentative Budgets  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** Budget Book  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item B  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Mario Rodriguez,  
Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
The State of California is statutorily required to enact a State Budget by June 30th. Similarly, the Board of Trustees is required by law to adopt a tentative budget for the upcoming fiscal year no later than July 1st for all district funds.

On May 10, 2024, Governor Newsom released his May Revision for budget year 2024-25. The overall state budget is projected to decrease by approximately 7% to $288 billion, compared to the January proposal, due to a projected budget deficit of $45 billion. General Fund spending is expected to decrease by about $25 billion (11.1%) to $201 billion. The budget shortfall results due to corrections in revenue estimates from the 2022-23 Budget Act related to personal income tax underperformance, recent inflationary trends, and subdued economic indicators. The Governor proposes to close the budget gap through the partial use of reserves, spending cuts, and delays and deferrals of spending authorized in earlier years.

The budget proposal for Community Colleges prioritized stability amidst a significant state budget deficit. Rather than making major core reductions to programs or services, it relies on reserves and operational savings to balance the budget. The Governor’s May Revision proposes modest ongoing resources for California Community Colleges, amounting to approximately $142 million for appropriations and categorical programs. Revised proposals for ongoing spending include about $100 million for a 1.07% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), $13 million for COLAs and adjustments to certain categorical programs, and $28 million for systemwide enrollment growth of .05%.

Los Rios’s tentative budget is based on the Governor’s May Revision. It is critical to acknowledge that the Enacted Budget may differ from the May Revision. The May Revision still includes borrowing nearly $9 million from future non-Proposition 98 sources, a move that has been criticized from both the Legislative Analyst’s Office and various K-14 stakeholder groups. If the Legislation rejects the idea of borrowing from future non-Proposition 98 sources, it could result in programmatic reductions and/or deferrals. There are ongoing discussions around alternative budget solutions. Changes resulting from the State’s Enacted budget will be incorporated into Los Rios’s Adopted Budget in September.

![HOME](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**STATUS:**  
Los Rios’s budget process uses three potential revenue assumptions. The revenue assumptions have a base level expenditure plan (X budget), at which Los Rios operates. The Y and Z budgets are improved based upon projections. Los Rios has authority to operate at the Z budget level. For 2024-25, all three budgets will assume at least full restoration of FTES from the 2019-20 fiscal year. The current trend we are witnessing from daily year-over-year tracking is a full restoration, with the possibility of growth of a few percentage points over our pre-pandemic FTES benchmark.

The 2024-25 tentative budget is balanced. There is no draw on reserves projected nor reliance on one-time funds to support on-going costs at this time. The variations in the X, Y and Z budgets are captured in the appropriation area entitled Program and Salary Improvement and the three budgets are summarized on the attached General Fund schedule. Los Rios will start the year operating at the X budget level.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Governing Board adopt the 2024-24 tentative budgets for the General Fund (Z budget), Instructionally-Related Sub-Fund, Special Revenue, Capital Projects, Debt Service, Enterprise, Internal Service, Fiduciary, Trust and Auxiliary Funds of the District for filing with the appropriate County/State agencies.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** June 12, 2024

**SUBJECT:** Folsom Lake College: Renaming the Rancho Cordova Center to the FLC Rancho Cordova Center - Empowered by Sutter Health  
**ATTACHMENT:** None  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 1,2,3, 4, 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item C  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Art Pimentel, President  
Folsom Lake College  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
Founded almost a century ago and headquartered in Sacramento, Sutter Health provides coordinated care to more than 3 million Californians, including many Los Rios employees. Their integrated network has created a connected model of care that is delivering coordinated healthcare when, where, and how people need it. They are committed to ensuring healthcare is accessible and inclusive to all by offering comprehensive services and quality health programs tailored to the diverse communities they serve. In 2022, Sutter Health invested $899 million in the community, including traditional charity to organizations like Los Rios, the unreimbursed costs of providing care to Medi-Cal patients, and investments in community health programs. In addition, Sutter Health extends their care beyond their facilities by investing in community-based services, mobile clinics, transportation services, prevention and wellness programs and more.

---

**STATUS:**  
Since 2003, Sutter Health has been an incredibly generous investor and partner with Los Rios, providing over $1.2 million in direct support to students to remove financial barriers through scholarships and sponsorships. In 2003, Sutter Health donated $200,000 to establish the Sutter Scholars Program, an endowment to fund scholarships to students in healthcare programs at all Los Rios colleges. Since then, 85 students have received scholarships totaling $170,000; the current endowed balance is $293,487. In 2020 Sutter Health made a $500,000 gift commitment to establish the Los Rios Promise Scholarship and inspired others to give to this initiative. By the end of 2025, over 900 Los Rios students with the largest unmet financial need will have received a $500 flexible scholarship. To ensure this opportunity is available to students in perpetuity, 10% of their gift was allocated to an endowment and the current endowed balance of the Los Rios Promise Scholarship is $71,623.

To expand on their partnership with Los Rios and their commitment to high quality accessible education, Sutter Health has committed an additional gift of $1.7 million to expand and implement the Emergency Medical Technology (EMT), Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) and Radiology Technician (RT) programs at FLC’s Rancho Cordova Center. The $1.7 million in funding will be used  

---  

105
<!-- Page 106 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+not+displayed)

to remodel classroom(s) at the Rancho Cordova Center to support the CNA, EMT, and RT programs. With the renovation of this space, it is estimated FLC will have the ability to offer the program to up to 84 graduates a year, comprised of two cohorts of 15 students per semester in the CNA and EMT programs, four cohorts of 20 students a year for EMT, and 24 students a year for RT.

An additional local benefit to the project will be the expansion of partnerships with Cordova High School, a feeder school roughly two miles away from the Center. Housing the CAN and RT programs at the Center will enable students in Cordova High School’s “Patient Care Pathway” to move seamlessly from high school into the programs, thus providing streamlined access to well-paying jobs to local students who are recent high school graduates. This pathway will be further strengthened by FLC’s partnership with the City of Rancho Cordova, which has created a “Promise Program” guaranteeing assistance with tuition and fees to Rancho Cordova residents who have recently graduated high school and are attending FLC.

These programs offer accelerated pathways into better paying jobs for students in Allied Health careers. Immediate benefits to students will include access to well-paying jobs with short-term certificates at the many healthcare institutions in the Los Rios service area.

CONSIDERATIONS:
LRCF closely follows Board Policies when soliciting and accepting significant gifts that could result in a naming opportunity. To that end and based on recommendations pursuant to Board Policy 8431:

2.1 Buildings and areas may be named in honor of friends, benefactors, and persons who have made significant contributions to the College, the District, or to education in California or the nation.
- The $1.7 million donation qualifies as a basis to honor Sutter Health pursuant to BP 8431 2.1 as a “significant contribution.” This is the largest donation in history made by a living donor to Los Rios.

2.3 Buildings and areas may be named for persons who: have rendered significant, permanent service to education in California or the nation; who have distinguished themselves in the work of a College, campus, discipline, or department within the District; who are indigenous to the area and hold a unique place in history; or have made a substantial gift to the College or the District through its official fundraising arm, the Los Rios Colleges Foundation.
- FLC, LRCCD, and LRCF staff concluded that Sutter Health’s past donations (over $1.2 million) and current commitment of $1.7 million provides a policy basis for naming opportunities based upon “a substantial gift” to a college, the District, or the Foundation. We believe $1.7 million is a substantial gift and exceeds the value of other recent building namings approved by the Board; however, we recognize the dollar amount of “substantial” is not specified by policy.

3.1 Names of facilities or areas should lend prestige to the District/College, and to staff, students, and community. The credentials, character, and reputation of each individual for whom the naming of a building is being considered shall be carefully scrutinized and evaluated. Nominations submitted to the Board of Trustees for consideration shall be accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation.
- The FLC, LRCCD, and LRCF staff recommendation concluded that Sutter Health’s standing and longevity in the community as articulated in the Background section of this agenda item, meets the criteria of BP 8431 3.1.

### ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
The need for healthcare workers will continue to grow as our population ages, so Los Rios graduates will be guaranteed better job security when they enter a career in a healthcare field. With Sutter Health’s support, Los Rios’s Allied Health programs will play an important role in producing the people who will fill those jobs and take care of our citizens region wide. Recognizing this gift with the renaming of the Rancho Cordova Center is a testament to Sutter Health’s partnership with Los Rios and our commitment to educating our community together.

### RECOMMENDATION:
It is recommended the Board of Trustees approve the renaming of the Rancho Cordova Center as the FLC Rancho Cordova Center - Empowered by Sutter Health, in recognition of Sutter Health’s gift and incredible support they have provided to all Los Rios colleges.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** June 12, 2024  

**SUBJECT:** Public Hearing: College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) Memorandum of Understanding: Black Oak Mine Unified School District  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 1,2,3  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item D  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:** Dr. Art Pimentel, Folsom Lake College President  
**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:** Brian King, Chancellor  

**STATUS:**  
With the passage of Assembly Bill 102, California community college districts are authorized to enter into a College and Career Access Pathways Partnership with a high school district to expand opportunities for high school students to take college courses during the regular school day and for community colleges to claim apportionment. To go forward with this program, the law requires community college districts and high school districts to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding approved by the governing boards of both the community college district and the high school district.  

The proposed College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is between the Los Rios Community College District and Black Oak Mine Unified School District. There are no significant differences between this MOU and our standard CCAP MOU template. The purpose of the MOU is to offer and expand dual enrollment opportunities for students who may not already be college bound or who are underrepresented in higher education, with the goal of developing seamless pathways from high school to community college. Beginning Fall 2024, classes will be offered to high school students attending Black Oak Mine Unified School District High Schools. At the completion of these classes, students will earn credit toward multiple degree or certificate programs within their relevant college’s catalog.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees conduct a public hearing; adopt the proposed CCAP MOU between the Los Rios Community College District and Black Oak Mine Unified School District and authorize the Chancellor or his designee(s) to execute the MOU and any future augmentations, amendments, renewals, extensions, or other modifications to the MOU.

**ACTION** X  
**INFORMATION**  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
With the passage of Assembly Bill 102, California community college districts are authorized to enter into a College and Career Access Pathways Partnership with a charter school to expand opportunities for high school students to take college courses during the regular school day and for community colleges to claim apportionment. To go forward with this program, the law requires community college districts and charter schools to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding approved by the governing boards of both the community college district and the charter school.

**STATUS:**  
The proposed College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is between the Los Rios Community College District and Rio Valley Charter School. There are minor language changes regarding location and facilities in this MOU compared to our standard CCAP MOU template. The purpose of the MOU is to offer and expand dual enrollment opportunities for students who may not already be college bound or who are underrepresented in higher education, with the goal of developing seamless pathways from high school to community college. Beginning Fall 2024, classes will be offered to high school students attending Rio Valley Charter School. At the completion of these classes, students will earn credit toward multiple degree or certificate programs within their relevant college’s catalog.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees conduct a public hearing; adopt the proposed CCAP MOU between the Los Rios Community College District and Rio Valley Charter School and authorize the Chancellor or his designee(s) to execute the MOU and any future augmentations, amendments, renewals, extensions, or other modifications to the MOU.

**OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT/PRESIDENT**

December 8, 2023

Jamey Nye, Deputy Chancellor  
Los Rios Community College District (LRCCD)  
1919 Spanos Court  
Sacramento, CA 95825  

Re: Out of Service Area Dual Enrollment Agreement  

Dear LRCCD,

California Education Code, section 76004(e), states that “a community college district shall not enter into a CCAP partnership with a school district within the service area of another community college district, except where an agreement exists, or is established, between those community college districts authorizing that CCAP partnership.”

This letter confirms that San Joaquin Delta College agrees to the CCAP partnership between Sacramento City College (SCC) and Pacific Charter Institute (PCI) where students from PCI schools that are located outside of San Joaquin Delta College service area will be served by SCC in the following program and terms:

- College and Career Readiness Pathway, starting Fall 2024

San Joaquin Delta Community College retains the right to terminate this agreement during any subsequent term. If further information from me is needed, you may contact me via email at lisa.lawrenson@deltacollege.edu.

Sincerely,  
Lisa Aguilera Lawrenson, Ph.D.  
Superintendent/President
