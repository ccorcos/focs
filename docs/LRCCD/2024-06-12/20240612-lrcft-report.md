**June 12, 2024**

The LRCFT picnic was a great success and I want to thank the trustees, Chancellor King, and members of the Los Rios administration for attending.

The LRCFT recently joined the LRCEA for a CFT-sponsored event, the **Classified Day of Action**, held at the Capitol. The rally included legislators and the President of the CLF joining classified professionals from Los Rios and districts throughout the state. The goal was to call attention to legislation to improve classified professional working conditions.

Faculty union members this past Sunday carried the LRCFT banner in the **Sacramento Pride Festival and March**. Our union participated to call attention to the struggles of LGBTQ+ people for social justice and safe working conditions.

Our LRCFT PAFC recently endorsed Maggy Krell for AD 6. We are also ramping up efforts to campaign for Roger Dickinson (Sac City D2), Flo Cofer (mayor), Porsche Middleton (AD 7), and Colette Harris Mathews (Los Rios Trustee A5).

The LRCFT in July is sending a group of 8 faculty to attend the AFTâ€™s national convention in Houston, Texas.

In closing, the LRCFT is now negotiating with LRCCD regarding the Prison and Reentry Program. We remain optimistic that a successful resolution of disagreements over the program will take place this summer.

Thank you!

**Jason Newman**  
LRCFT President
