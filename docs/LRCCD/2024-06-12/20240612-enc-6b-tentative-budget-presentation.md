# Timing of Proposals

- **November**
  - LAO forecasts the budget deficit at $68 billion
- **January**
  - Governor released his budget with $38 billion deficit and contains a complicated P98 funding maneuver
- **February**
  - LAO says the budget deficit in Governor’s Budget is actually $58 billion and there is likely another $15 billion decline in revenues ($73 billion deficit)
- **April**
  - Legislature took action to mitigate $17 billion of deficit with an “early action” plan
- **May**
  - Governor releases May Revision addressing a $55 billion deficit and still uses the P98 maneuver
  - Governor agrees to P98 maneuver solution with CTA
  - Legislature agrees to a two-party budget solution that includes a solution for 2024-25 and 2025-26 with proper calculation of P98

# Economic Forecast

- **Slow, but steady economic growth through 2027**
  - Driven by strong personal consumption, but will moderate with restrictive monetary policy

- **Job growth to return to steady state**
  - Technology layoffs, a high interest rate environment, and already nearing pre-pandemic employment result in less projected job growth

- **Inflation is expected to cool**
  - Slows to historical inflation rates of around 2% by early 2025 due to fiscal and monetary policy changes since the end of the pandemic
