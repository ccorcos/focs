**Los Rios Community College District Indigenous Land Acknowledgment Statement**  
In the spirit of community and social justice, we acknowledge the land on which our four colleges reside as the traditional homelands of the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations. These sovereign people have been the caretakers of the health of the rivers, the wildlife, the plant life, and the overall eco-social balance in the greater Sacramento region since time immemorial.  

Despite centuries of genocide and occupation, the Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok continue as vibrant and resilient tribes and bands, both Federally recognized and unrecognized. Tribal citizens of these nations continue to be an active and important part of our Los Rios college community. We take this opportunity to acknowledge the land and our responsibility to the original peoples, the present-day Nisenan, Maidu, and Miwok tribal nations.

   **Justification:** This course is no longer a part of the accounting certificate. This change was made some time ago. Since the change enrollments have dropped. The relevant curriculum has been added to BUSTEC 307. This course is no longer part of any degrees/certificates. There are no longer any current articulation agreements with local high schools for this course. The BUSTEC department at FLC has decided to delete this course.

2. **BUSTEC 110 Business Procedures for Professional Success (3 units)**  
   **Justification:** As part of a district wide review of curriculum in the BUSTEC department, we have decided to delete this course. BUSTEC 305 will be the replacement class when needed. BUSTEC 305 has been recently updated. This class is not listed in any cataloged degrees or certificates.

3. **ENGLT 313 Arthurian and Chivalric Literature (3 units)**  
   **Justification:** Course has reached its 6 year revision cycle and has not been taught since last revision. The person who taught it was fairly specific to the class (author I believe) and will not be teaching it again. Because of its specificity, it is unlikely to be taught by our other faculty. It is also on our General Electives list for degrees and poses a liability as it goes out of compliance.

4. **FITNS 352 Core Conditioning IV: Power Sculpting (1 unit)**

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**STATUS:**  
The Education Code regulates the procedures by which a Community College District can dispose of real and personal property. Education Code section 81452 provides that the governing board may, by unanimous vote, dispose of items valued at $5,000 or less by private sale without advertising or selling the items at public auction. The District has held previous auctions, but they have generally cost more than they have netted for the District.

The District has a quantity of surplus materials that needs to be disposed of, such as outdated desks and computers. The District has located a scrap dealer who will take selected surplus items for recycling. Any items remaining will be disposed.

The surplus items to be recycled or disposed of are either irreparable, obsolete, in poor condition or not needed for district/college operations and include the following:  
- 1 bookshelf  
- 4 Cloud clients  
- 8 computers  
- 1 credenza  
- 2 filing cabinets  
- 4 laptops  
- 3 monitors  
- 2 printers  
- 1 scanner  
- 2 table tops  
- 1 tablet  
- 2 televisions  

These items have a value of less than $5,000.  

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the disposal of the listed items per Education Code section 81452.

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** October 16, 2024

**SUBJECT:** Resolution No. 2024-14: Authorizing a Contract with CalPERS and Resolution No. 2024-15: Employer Pick-Up for CalPERS Safety pension  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item A  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

---

**BACKGROUND:**  
At the September 11, 2024 Board Meeting, the Board of Trustees voted on the intention to enter into a contract with CalPERS to provide School Safety Members pension. The future annual cost was shared with the Board, as well as the contract provisions and a summary of the major provisions of the plan. After Board approval, an employee election by secret ballot was to be held to determine if a majority of the employees affected by this change voted in favor or against it.

**STATUS:**  
On September 12, 2024, a secret ballot was sent to current employees in the Los Rios Police Department Office, Captain and Sergeant positions. Voting was open until September 30, 2024. On September 30, 2024, 13 of 14 employees had voted. Eight (8) votes in favor were needed for the provision to pass. Thirteen (13) votes were cast in favor of the change. The effective date of the change will be December 1, 2024. To move forward, the Board must approve the final Resolution authorizing a contract.

For the employee PERS contributions to be processed as pre-tax deductions, the Board must pass a Resolution for Employer Pick-up.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the attached Resolution No. 2024-14, Authorizing a Contract and approve the attached Resolution No. 2024-15, for Employer Pick-Up.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** October 16, 2024

**SUBJECT:** Resolution No. 2024-16: Kindergarten Through Grade 12 Schools and Local Community College Public Education Facilities, Modernization, Repair, and Safety Bond Act of 2024  
**ATTACHMENT:** Yes  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 5  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item B  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Mario Rodriguez, Executive Vice Chancellor, Finance and Administration  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**BACKGROUND:**  
The State has fully allocated the remaining funds from Proposition 51, passed in 2016, which provided bond authorizations for educational facilities. As a result, no further state funding is available to support critical projects addressing health and safety, modernization, and growth needs across the system.

**STATUS:**  
For Los Rios, the passage of Proposition 2 would have a direct and significant impact, particularly on the health and safety renovation project for Davies Hall at American River College. Due to a lack of remaining funds from our local bond authorization, state support is essential to meet these facilities' needs.

**RECOMMENDATION:**  
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees adopt Resolution 2024-16 supporting the passage of Proposition 2, School and Community College Bond.

№ 2024-16

**Proposition 2: Kindergarten Through Grade 12 Schools and Local Community College Public Education Facilities, Modernization, Repair, and Safety Bond Act of 2024**

WHEREAS, the California Community College system is the largest postsecondary system of education in the world, enrolling approximately 2 million students each year; and

WHEREAS, California’s 116 community colleges and 72 centers are located in nearly every community in the state, serving more than 70 percent of California’s public postsecondary undergraduate students; and

WHEREAS, the primary mission of the California Community Colleges is to offer academic and vocational instruction, by granting certificates, associate degrees, and select Baccalaureate degrees, and providing transfer opportunities to four-year institutions; and

WHEREAS, the California Community College Chancellor’s Office estimates unmet community college facilities needs of approximately $27.5 billion over the next five years; and

WHEREAS, Proposition 2, the Kindergarten Through Grade 12 Schools and Local Community College Public Education Facilities, Modernization, Repair and Safety Bond Act of 2024, provides $1.5 billion to community colleges for constructing new classrooms to accommodate growth and provide job training, repairing health and safety issues, renovating facilities, and equipping learning spaces with essential technology; and

WHEREAS, facilities support student success and basic needs for our students, providing spaces to access important services like food, health care, counseling and financial aid; and

WHEREAS, 13,000 middle class jobs, including almost all building trades, are created for each $1 billion in school facility infrastructure investments; and

WHEREAS, quality community college facilities enhance the education and training of a skilled 21st Century workforce, in furtherance of the State’s academic and economic goals; and

WHEREAS, Proposition 2 will not raise State taxes, and state matching funds reduce the need for additional local property taxes for college facilities: Now, therefore,

**BE IT RESOLVED**, that the Board of Trustees of the Los Rios Community College District supports Proposition 2, The Kindergarten Through Grade 12 Schools and Local Community College Public Education Facilities Modernization, Repair, and Safety Bond Act of 2024.

# LOS RIOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT

**PRESENTED TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES**  
**DATE:** October 16, 2024

**SUBJECT:** American River College: Naming the Veteran’s Resource Center the Col. Joseph Mohamed, Sr. Veteran’s Resource Center  
**ATTACHMENT:** None  
**ENCLOSURE:** None  
**STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL(S):** 2  

**AGENDA ITEM:** Action Item C  
**TYPE OF BOARD CONSIDERATION:**  

**RECOMMENDED BY:**  
Lisa Cardoza, President,  
American River College  

**APPROVED FOR CONSIDERATION:**  
Brian King, Chancellor  

**STATUS:**  
Joseph Mohamed grew up on a family farm in the Lodi area where they raised row crops and had a dairy. He started a landscape and construction business in 1959 while attending American River College and was hired by the college to pour the concrete in front of the Bill J. Priest Administration building. Joe transferred to Sacramento State University where he graduated with a BS in Business Administration. He retired as an Army Colonel with 32 years of service, including 2 years of active duty and 30 years in the Army Reserve. Joe also attended the Army War College and was actively involved with a Civil Affairs Unit. Joe had a successful career in construction, finance, and real estate development in subdivisions, commercial and residential. In 1999 he was honored with the Distinguished Service Award by CSUS. Joe was actively involved in military and community organizations, and he also served as a Reserve Depot Sheriff for over 40 years.

Joseph Mohamed served on the American River College Foundation board from 1998 to 2005. During this time, he and his wife, Shirley, donated nearly $20,000 and actively supported various college events, including hosting the ARC culinary arts fundraisers at their home. In 2022, they donated a property to ARC as an unrestricted gift that was valued at $660,000 and sold in 2024 with sales proceeds of $403,346. After his passing in 2023 at the age of 94, Shirley requested that the college name the Veteran's Resource Center in Joe's honor to recognize his legacy as a veteran and generous alumnus.

The proceeds from the sale of the property will be used primarily for direct student support, including "welcome backpacks," tutoring services, and book vouchers. Additionally, they will cover professional development opportunities, such as attending the Veterans in Business Network conference, and support various events like the veteran’s graduation ceremony, PTSD Awareness Month, and Fall Welcome Back Month. Some funds may also be allocated for furniture and technology for the expanded space.

**CONSIDERATIONS:**
LRCC closely follows Board Policies when soliciting and accepting significant gifts that could result in a naming opportunity. To that end and based on recommendations pursuant to Board Policy 8431:

2.1 Buildings and areas may be named in honor of friends, benefactors, and persons who have made significant contributions to the College, the District, or to education in California or the nation.
- The real estate donation, initially valued at $660,000, with sales proceeds of $403,346, qualifies as a basis to honor Col. Joseph Mohamed, Sr. pursuant to BP 8431 2.1 as a “significant contribution.”

2.3 Buildings and areas may be named for persons who: have rendered significant, permanent service to education in California or the nation; who have distinguished themselves in the work of a College, campus, discipline, or department within the District; who are indigenous to the area and hold a unique place in history; or have made a substantial gift to the College or the District through its official fundraising arm, the Los Rios Colleges Foundation.
- ARC, LRCCD, and LRCF staff concluded that the Mohamed family's real estate donation to American River College, originally valued at $660,000 and later sold with sales proceeds of $403,346, qualifies as a "substantial gift." This donation, along with Joe Mohamed's personal connections to the college and community contributions, supports the policy basis for naming opportunities at the college. However, staff notes that the policy does not specify a precise dollar amount that defines "substantial."

3.1 Names of facilities or areas should lend prestige to the District/College, and to staff, students, and community. The credentials, character, and reputation of each individual for whom the naming of a building is being considered shall be carefully scrutinized and evaluated. Nominations submitted to the Board of Trustees for consideration shall be accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation.
- ARC, LRCCD, and LRCF staff concluded that Joseph Mohamed’s military service, long-standing connection to and support of American River College, and his standing in the community meet the criteria outlined in BP 8431 3.1.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
It is recommended that the Board of Trustees approve the naming of the American River College Veteran’s Resource Center as the Col. Joseph Mohamed, Sr. Veteran’s Resource Center in recognition of Joseph and Shirley Mohamed’s generous gifts and passion for American River College.

**BACKGROUND:**  
The Department of Theatre and Cinema Arts offers a dynamic range of classes in theatre and cinema, including an AA-T in Theatre Arts and a unique Technical Theatre Certificate program. With a full production and class schedule, the department provides students with a comprehensive foundation in theatre history, diversity, and production techniques.

Students gain hands-on experience in the state-of-the-art Harris Center for the Arts, a world-class facility that prepares them for real-world opportunities. The Technical Theatre Certificate program equips students with specialized skills in stagecraft, welding, scenic painting, CNC design and operation, lighting, audio, video, and scenic automation. The program culminates in a paid internship allowing students to work alongside industry professionals on touring productions and to gain invaluable journeyman-level experience. Graduates thus are well-prepared to begin their careers in the entertainment industry.

The department’s productions offer students exceptional opportunities to apply their performance, design, and technical skills. Highlights include a touring children’s theatre show for local elementary schools, an outdoor Shakespeare production performed at a picturesque El Dorado County winery, and mainstage performances in Stage 1 and Stage 2 at the Harris Center.
