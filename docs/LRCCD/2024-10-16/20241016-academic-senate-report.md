# Academic Senates’ Reports to the LRCCD Board of Trustees
## October 2024

### District Academic Senate (DAS) President, Paula Cardwell, Reports:
- **AI Summit:** The District Academic Senate is partnering with FLC’s newly-formed Artificial Intelligence Department to host a district-wide AI Summit, to be held Friday, November 15 from 9 am - 3 pm at Folsom Lake College. Three hundred faculty, students and staff from around the district expressed interest in attending the event. We are inviting academic and industry leaders, as well as our own amazing faculty and staff, to facilitate discussions around where we are with AI, where we need to be, and how Los Rios can get to where we need to be.
- **NAGPRA Policy Update:** Our task force is working collaboratively and leaning heavily upon the CSU System Policy to guide our efforts. We currently have an all-day writing retreat scheduled for Friday, October 25.
- **Plenary:** The Academic Senate of California Community Colleges will host its Fall 24 Plenary session November 7-10 in Visalia, California. Many of our DAS leaders will be attending this event remotely and in-person. On October 18, we will be attending statewide and Area A meetings to review resolutions in advance of our Plenary session.
- **IEPI:** Our district Institutional Effectiveness Partnership Initiative meeting will also take place on Friday, October 18. District Academic Senate leaders will be collaborating and testing our flexibility as we effectively cover both events simultaneously! We look forward to offering input on and exploring effective conflict resolution strategies that may provide a better solution for Los Rios.

### American River College Senate President, Brian Knirk, Reports:
- **ARC Senate** is working with administration to understand and improve classroom inventory and scheduling, given that without Davies hall, the college is at full capacity during peak times and many departments are offering sections online due to lack of room space.
- **ARC Senate** approved a resolution requesting researching into the failed faculty searches from last Spring in an attempt to better understand where our process can be improved and help to ensure larger and more diverse applicant pools in the future.

**Folsom Lake College Senate President, Eric Wada, Reports:**
- The FLC Academic Senate has recently made some recommendations on faculty office assignment criteria for single offices and a process for faculty office space in the new science building.
- We recommended two new academic departments in Artificial Intelligence and Public Safety.
- We continue to discuss ongoing and institutional support for both faculty professional development coordination and new faculty orientation. As the discussions continue around diversifying faculty, our hiring processes must be properly resourced to include outreach and retention of diverse faculty.

- The SCC Academic Senate is planning for another round of faculty new hires while using the principles of cluster hiring to support our DEIAA efforts on our campus.
- We continue to have robust conversations on issues related to curriculum, including the potential for noncredit course offerings in the future.
