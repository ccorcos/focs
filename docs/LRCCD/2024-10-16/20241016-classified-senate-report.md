The SCC Classified Senate recently kicked off monthly activities to boost camaraderie among Classified Professionals, starting with a coffee break in September. The next event is a fundraiser with Panda Express to raise funds for student scholarships and future professional development opportunities. The fundraiser will be on October 24th, at any location nationwide. These efforts aim to strengthen the community while providing growth and networking opportunities for staff and support for students.
