**Note:** Regarding Sick-Leave hours, a Regular Full-Time employee may choose the Sick Leave payout option and utilize a maximum of 320 hours (as identified within the table above) which will be compensated at 50% of the employee's current hourly rate of pay. However, upon retirement from the District, a Regular Full-Time employee December choose to utilize their accrued Sick Leave toward CalPERS service credit with no maximum limit. Employees whose Sick Leave hours exceed 320 hours are noted but the hours in excess of 320 not calculated as a liability in the table above. A Regular Part-Time employee will be compensated for a maximum of 160 hours of sick leave at 50% of the employees rate of pay upon termination.

**Change Order Request No. 5**  
**VILLAGE PARK**  
Fair Oaks, California  
MPE No. 04780-02  

June 3, 2024  

Based on our review of the most recent set of project minutes and additional correspondence, we are submitting this Change Order No. 5.

The most recent project minutes from Bobo Construction indicate the project will be substantially complete by November 2024 with final project close-out by March 2025. Based on this and assuming our work will ramp up for a few months then significantly wind-down but continue intermittently through March 2025, we roughly estimate an average monthly billing $5000 per month for 8 months ($40,000) for work during June through November plus February and March. We anticipate that our work during December and January will be much less due to weather and winding down of work to be completed requiring our testing; therefore, we have excluded these months from our change order request. Additionally, we have an outstanding Invoice 20240851 in the amount of $1136.75 that needs to be included in this change order to facilitate payment.

Therefore, we are requesting a Change Order No. 5 in the amount of $41,136.75 to pay Invoice 20240851 and to facilitate the projected estimated additional work to complete the project through the end of March 2025.

If this change order is acceptable, please indicate so by issuing a Contract amendment referencing this change order. Thank you for your consideration in this matter and we appreciate this opportunity to be of service. If you have any questions, please contact our office.

# STAFF REPORT

**Meeting Date:** July 17, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Discussion and Possible Action Regarding Approval of Change Order for Bobo Construction in the Amount of $399,777 for the Village Park Renovation Project  

## I. Recommendation  
Authorize the District Administrator to work with Legal Counsel to review the contract (Attachment A) and Construction Manual (Attachment B) for the Village Park Renovation Project. Legal Counsel will be tasked with providing a recommendation on the next course of action regarding Change Order No. 165 (Attachment C).  

## II. Background  
Measure J, approved by voters in November 2018, provided funding for various park improvements, including the Village Park Renovation Project. This measure has been instrumental in enabling the District to undertake substantial enhancements across multiple park facilities.  
The Village Park Renovation Project is an ongoing effort to improve and modernize the facilities at Village Park. Bobo Construction Inc. has been contracted to carry out these renovations.  
The Board of Directors has authorized the District Administrator to approve changes to the project up to $70,000. However, Change Order No. 165, which involves an additional cost of $399,777 and an extension of 168 days, exceeds that limit and requires Board approval.  
At the June 26, 2024, Board Meeting, the Board voted to defer the decision on this item to the July 17 Board Meeting. On July 11, the Construction Ad-Hoc Committee, consisting of Director Raymond James Irwin and Board Chair Ralph Carhart, met to discuss the Change Order and identify additional options and how to proceed. The Ad-Hoc Committee
<!-- Page 133 -->
### III. Problem / Situation / Request
The Construction Ad-Hoc Committee has identified the need for a thorough legal review of the contract and Construction Manual to ensure that the District's interests are protected and that any actions taken regarding Change Order No. 165 are in compliance with the contract terms and legal requirements. Engaging Legal Counsel to review the documents and provide a recommendation on the next course of action is deemed to be in the best interest of the District.

### V. Financial Analysis
Attorney fees for the legal review are expected but have not yet been determined. These fees will be necessary to ensure that the District's interests are protected and that any actions taken are in compliance with the contract terms and legal requirements.

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator  

### Attachment:
- Bobo Contract (A)
- Construction Manual (B)
- Change Order 165 (C)

This endorsement modifies insurance provided under the following:

**COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE PART**

It is understood and agreed as follows:

I. The **WHO IS AN INSURED** section is amended to add as an Insured any person or organization whom the Named Insured is required by written contract to add as an additional insured on this coverage part, including any such person or organization, if any, specifically set forth on the Schedule attachment to this endorsement. However, such person or organization is an Insured only with respect to such person or organization’s liability for:

A. unless paragraph B, below applies,

1. bodily injury, property damage, or personal and advertising injury caused in whole or in part by the acts or omissions by or on behalf of the Named Insured and in the performance of such Named Insured’s ongoing operations as specified in such written contract; or

2. bodily injury or property damage caused in whole or in part by your work and included in the products-completed operations hazard, and only if

   a. the written contract requires the Named Insured to provide the additional insured such coverage; and

   b. this coverage part provides such coverage.

B. bodily injury, property damage, or personal and advertising injury arising out of your work described in such written contract, but only if:

1. this coverage part provides coverage for bodily injury or property damage included within the products completed operations hazard; and

2. the written contract specifically requires the Named Insured to provide additional insured coverage under the 11-85 or 10-01 edition of CG2010 or the 10-01 edition of CG2037.

II. Subject always to the terms and conditions of this policy, including the limits of insurance, the Insurer will not provide such additional insured with:

A. coverage broader than required by the written contract; or

B. a higher limit of insurance than required by the written contract.

III. The insurance granted by this endorsement to the additional insured does not apply to bodily injury, property damage, or personal and advertising injury arising out of:

A. the rendering of, or the failure to render, any professional architectural, engineering, or surveying services, including:

1. the preparing, approving, or failing to prepare or approve maps, shop drawings, opinions, reports, surveys, field orders, change orders or drawings and specifications; and

2. supervisory, inspection, architectural or engineering activities; or

B. any premises or work for which the additional insured is specifically listed as an additional insured on another endorsement attached to this coverage part.

IV. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the section entitled **COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY CONDITIONS**, the Condition entitled **Other Insurance**, this insurance is excess of all other insurance available to the additional insured whether on a primary, excess, contingent or any other basis. However, if this insurance

is required by written contract to be primary and non-contributory, this insurance will be primary and non-contributory relative solely to insurance on which the additional insured is a named insured.

V. Solely with respect to the insurance granted by this endorsement, the section entitled COMMERCIAL GENERAL LIABILITY CONDITIONS is amended as follows:

The Condition entitled Duties In The Event of Occurrence, Offense, Claim or Suit is amended with the addition of the following:

Any additional insured pursuant to this endorsement will as soon as practicable:
1. give the Insurer written notice of any claim, or any occurrence or offense which may result in a claim;
2. except as provided in Paragraph IV. of this endorsement, agree to make available any other insurance the additional insured has for any loss covered under this coverage part;
3. send the Insurer copies of all legal papers received, and otherwise cooperate with the Insurer in the investigation, defense, or settlement of the claim; and
4. tender the defense and indemnity of any claim to any other insurer or self insurer whose policy or program applies to a loss that the Insurer covers under this coverage part. However, if the written contract requires this insurance to be primary and non-contributory, this paragraph (4) does not apply to insurance on which the additional insured is a named insured.

The Insurer has no duty to defend or indemnify an additional insured under this endorsement until the Insurer receives written notice of a claim from the additional insured.

VI. Solely with respect to the insurance granted by this endorsement, the section entitled DEFINITIONS is amended to add the following definition:

Written contract means a written contract or written agreement that requires the Named Insured to make a person or organization an additional insured on this coverage part, provided the contract or agreement:
A. is currently in effect or becomes effective during the term of this policy; and
B. was executed prior to:

representation express or implied, that such information is correctly shown or indicated. This information is verifiable by independent investigation and Bidder is required to make such verification as a condition to bidding. In submitting its Bid, Bidder shall rely on the results of its own independent investigation. In submitting its Bid, Bidder shall not rely on District-supplied information regarding above-ground conditions or as-built conditions.

(2) As to any subsurface condition shown or indicated in the Contract Documents, Bidder may rely only upon the general accuracy of actual reported depths, actual reported character of materials, actual reported soil types, actual reported water conditions, or actual obstructions shown or indicated. District is not responsible for the completeness of such information for bidding or construction; nor is District responsible in any way for any conclusions or opinions that the Bidder has drawn from such information; nor is the District responsible for subsurface conditions that are not specifically shown (for example, District is not responsible for soil conditions in areas contiguous to areas where a subsurface condition is shown).

(2) Physical Conditions: Those drawings of physical conditions in or relating to existing surface or subsurface structures at or contiguous to the Site that has been utilized by Architect in preparing the Contract Documents.

(3) These reports and drawings are not Contract Documents and, except for any “technical” data regarding subsurface conditions specifically identified in Geotechnical Data and Existing Conditions, and underground facilities data, Bidder may not in any manner rely on the information in these reports and drawings. Subject to the foregoing, Bidder must make its own independent investigation of all conditions affecting the Work and must not rely on information provided by District.

19. Bids shall be based on products and systems specified in Contract Documents or listed by name in Addenda. Whenever in the Specifications any materials, process, or article is indicated or specified by grade, patent, or proprietary name, or by name of manufacturer, that Specification shall be deemed to be followed by the words “or equal.” Bidder may, unless otherwise stated, offer any material, process, or article that shall be substantially equal or better in every respect to that so indicated or specified. The District is not responsible and/or liable in any way for a Contractor’s damages and/or claims related, in any way, to that Contractor’s basing its bid on any requested substitution that the District has not approved in advance and in writing. Contractors and materials suppliers who submit requests for substitutions prior to the award of the Contract must do so in writing and in compliance with Public Contract Code section 3400.

25. The District shall award the Contract, if it awards it at all, to the lowest responsive responsible bidder based on the criteria as indicated in the Notice to Bidders.

a. Only a Bidder who has actually submitted a bid, and who could be awarded the Contract if the bid protest is upheld, is eligible to submit a bid protest. Subcontractors are not eligible to submit bid protests. A Bidder may not rely on the bid protest submitted by another Bidder.

c. The protest must refer to the specific portions of all documents that form the basis for the protest.

(1) Without limitation to any other basis for protest, an inadvertent error in listing the subcontractor’s license number on the Designated Subcontractor List shall not be grounds for filing a bid protest or grounds for considering the bid nonresponsive if the correct contractor’s license number is submitted to the District within 24 hours after the bid opening and the corrected number corresponds with the submitted name and location for that subcontractor.

(2) Without limitation to any other basis for protest, an inadvertent error listing an unregistered subcontractor shall not be grounds for filing a bid protest or grounds for considering the bid nonresponsive provided that any of the following apply:

(i) The subcontractor is registered prior to the bid opening.

   When Contractor deposits the securities as a substitute for Contract earnings (first option), Escrow Agent shall notify District within ten (10) calendar days of the deposit. The market value of the securities at the time of substitution and at all times from substitution until the termination of the Escrow Agreement shall be at least equal to the cash amount then required to be withheld as retention under the terms of the Contract between District and Contractor.

   Securities shall be held in the name of Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks District, and shall designate Contractor as beneficial owner.

2. District shall make progress payments to Contractor for those funds which otherwise would be withheld from progress payments pursuant to Contract provisions, provided that Escrow Agent holds securities in form and amount specified above.

# ARTICLE 5. INTERPRETATION OF DRAWINGS AND SPECIFICATIONS

**Section 5.01. Familiarity with Project Site Conditions and Contract Documents.**  
Submission of a bid by the Contractor is a representation that the Contractor has visited the Site, is satisfied as to the nature and location of the Work, is satisfied as to the character, quality and quantity of the Work, has become familiar with the local conditions under which the Work is to be performed, has made whatever contact and investigation with utility companies that it deems necessary, and has correlated its site observations with the requirements of the Contract Documents. Failure to visit the Site will not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for observing and considering those conditions which a qualified contractor would have observed.

**Section 5.02. Subsurface Conditions.**  
Where investigations of subsurface conditions have been made by or on behalf of the District with respect to subsurface conditions, utilities, foundations, or other structural designs, and that information is shown on the Drawings or Plans, it represents only a statement by the District as to the character of the materials which have been encountered by the District’s investigation. This information is only included for the convenience of bidders, including the Contractor.

Investigations of subsurface conditions are made for the purpose of design only. The District assumes no responsibility with respect to the sufficiency or accuracy of borings or of the log of test borings or other preliminary investigations or of the interpretation thereof. There is no guaranty, express or implied, that the conditions indicated are representative of those existing throughout the Project or the Work, or any part of the Project or the Work, or that unanticipated conditions may not occur. When a log of test borings, soils studies and/or any other report of subsurface conditions is included with the Drawings or Plans, it is expressly stated that such log, soils studies and/or report of subsurface conditions does not constitute a part of the Contract Documents, represents only an opinion of the District as to the character of the materials to be encountered, and is intended to be used in the Drawings and Plans by the Contractor. Making such information available to bidders, including Contractor, is not to be construed in any way as a waiver of the provisions of these General Conditions, and bidders, including Contractor, must satisfy themselves through their own investigations as to the conditions to be encountered.

**Section 5.03. Sections of Drawings and Specifications.**  
For convenience, the specifications and drawings in the Contract Documents are arranged in several sections, but this separation shall not be considered as the limits of the work required of any separate trade. The scope of work is that indicated in Specification 00 73 00 Special Provisions, Article 1, Scope of Work. The terms and conditions of the work to be performed by any Subcontractor are strictly between the Contractor and the Subcontractor.

**Section 5.04. Diagrammatic Drawings.**  
Drawings showing the locations of equipment, wiring, piping, etc., unless dimensioned, are diagrammatic, and conditions will not always permit their installation in the exact location shown. In such event, the Contractor shall submit an RFI and obtain a response before proceeding with the work in question. Unless there is a material increase in the Contractor’s scope of work, installation as specified in the response to the RFI shall be without any additional compensation to the Contractor and without any increase in the Contract Time. Any work done after discovery of the issue, until authorization to proceed based on the response to the RFI, will be done at the Contractor’s risk.

**Section 5.05. Interpretation and Additional Instructions.**  
Should the Contractor discover any conflicts, omissions, or errors in the Contract Documents, or have any question concerning interpretation or clarification of the Contract Documents, or if it appears that the Work to be done or any matters relative thereto are not sufficiently detailed or explained in the Contract Documents, then before proceeding with the work affected, the Contractor shall within 48 hours notify the District Representative in writing and request interpretation, clarification, or additional detailed instructions and/or drawings concerning the work. All such questions shall be resolved and instructions to the Contractor issued by the Architect/Engineer.

Should the Contractor proceed with the work affected before receipt of instructions from the Architect, and, in the case of a change to the Work, before receipt of authorization to proceed, it shall remove and replace or adjust any work which is not in accordance therewith, and it shall be responsible for any resultant damage, defect, or added cost without an extension of the Contract time.

**Section 5.06. Architect/Engineer Instruction Bulletins and Drawings.**  
In addition to the Drawings incorporated in the Contract Documents, the Architect/Engineer, through the District Representative, may furnish such supplemental drawings or instructions from time to time as may be necessary to make clear or to define in greater detail the intent of the Contract Drawings and Specifications. In furnishing additional drawings or instructions, the Architect/Engineer shall have the authority to make minor changes in the Work, not involving any extra cost, and not inconsistent with the overall design of the Project. If extra cost is known to be involved, these instructions will be accompanied by an RFP. These supplemental drawings and instructions shall become a part of the Contract Documents; the Contractor shall make its work conform to them.

**Section 5.07. Notification of Disagreement Regarding Scope of Work.**  
If agreement cannot be reached as to cost, and the Contractor does not agree that work due to an interpretation or supplemental drawing or instruction is within the scope of the Contract Documents, the Contractor shall, within seven (7) days after receipt of the interpretation or instruction, submit a Proposed Change Order to the District Representative specifying in detail in what particulars the contract requirements were exceeded and the change in cost resulting therefrom. The District Representative shall then determine whether a Change Order shall be issued in accordance with Article 15 of these General Conditions. The Contractor shall nevertheless perform such work without delay. The time during which the protest is pending shall not affect the Contract Time.

**Section 5.08. As-Built Drawings and Specifications.**  
The information shall be maintained as a record of the actual conditions of the Work on the Site which shall be updated weekly to reflect current as-built conditions of the Work as the Work progresses. The information to be recorded by the Contractor will be determined by the Architect/Engineer, who will be responsible for approving the final as-built drawings based upon the information submitted by the Contractor. The Contractor’s as-built information shall be clear and, at a minimum, the following information shall be inserted and dimensioned on those Drawings and Specifications, in RED, by the Contractor: the exact horizontal and vertical location of all installations in their finished condition, including all electrical, plumbing and mechanical installations; all changes in construction, materials and installed equipment; posting of all issued addenda, Request for Information (RFI) signed by the Architect/Engineer and Architect/Engineer Instruction Bulletins with back-up to the bid documents in all applicable locations along with adequate dimensional data, both horizontal and vertical, to allow location of covered installations; the identification of each change authorized by Directive, and the number of that Directive. The updated drawings and specifications shall be available for review by the District Representative and the Inspector. If as-builts are marked up in PDF format, the file shall be made available remotely in a manner acceptable to the District Representative and Inspector.

Written confirmation from the District Representative that the as-builts have been properly updated weekly shall be submitted with each pay application request, and the existence of such properly updated as-builts shall be a condition precedent to payment. Failure to comply with the preparation and submission of as-builts may result in the District withholding the current progress payment.

As a condition to certification of final completion, the Contractor shall provide signed and dated original as-built drawings and specifications in a PDF color format, with a resolution of 600 DPI and each plan sheet and specification section bookmarked by name, number or title, together with all additional information requested by the Architect/Engineer to enable the approval of the final as-built drawings and specifications. Timely submission of complete as-built documents shall be a condition precedent to certification of final completion and to final payment. Delays in the submission of complete as-built documents may subject the Contractor to liquidated damages.

![ARTICLE 7. STATE REQUIREMENTS REGARDING WAGES, HOURS, AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY](https://www.dir.ca.gov/oprl/DPreWageDetermination.htm)

**Section 7.01. Prevailing Wage Rate; Notice.**  
As provided under Labor Code Sections 1726-1861, the Director of the Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) of the State of California has determined the prevailing rate of wages in the locality in which the work on the project is to be performed for each craft, classification, or type of worker needed to execute this Contract. The prevailing rates so determined are on the internet at [https://www.dir.ca.gov/oprl/DPreWageDetermination.htm](https://www.dir.ca.gov/oprl/DPreWageDetermination.htm). Those prevailing wage rates hereby are incorporated in this agreement and made a part hereof.

The Contractor shall obtain and post copies of these prevailing wage rates in a prominent place at the job site, in accordance with the regulations of the Department of Industrial Relations. Contractor and Subcontractors shall also provide copies to the Construction Manager.

The Project is subject to compliance monitoring and enforcement by the Department of Industrial Relations.

The Contractor shall post on the jobsite a Notice containing the following language:

This public works project is subject to monitoring and investigative activities by the Department of Industrial Relations ("DIR"), State of California. This Notice is intended to provide information to all workers employed in the execution of the contract for public work and to all contractors and other persons having access to the job site to enable the DIR to ensure compliance with and enforcement of prevailing wage laws on public works projects.

The prevailing wage laws require that all workers be paid at least the minimum hourly wage as determined by the Director of Industrial Relations for the specific classification (or type of work) performed by workers on the project. These rates are listed on a separate job site posting of minimum prevailing rates required to be maintained by the public entity which awarded the public works contract. Complaints concerning nonpayment of the required minimum wage rates to workers on this project may be filed with the DIR at any office of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement ("DLSE").

Complaints should be filed in writing immediately upon discovery of any violations of the prevailing wage laws due to the short period of time following the completion of the Project that the DIR may take legal action against those responsible.

Complaints should contain details about the violations alleged (for example, wrong rate paid, not all hours paid, overtime rate not paid for hours worked in excess of 8 per day or 40 per week, etc.) as well as the name of the employer, the public entity which awarded the public works contract, and the location and name of the project.

For general information concerning the prevailing wage laws and how to file a complaint concerning any violation of these prevailing wage laws, you may contact any DLSE office. Complaint forms are also available at the DIR website found at: [www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/PublicWorks.html](http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/PublicWorks.html).

**Section 7.02. Payment of Prevailing Wage Rates.**  
Pursuant to Labor Code Section 1772, workers employed by contractors or subcontractors in the execution of any contract for public work are deemed to be employed upon public work as defined in Labor Code Sections 1720-1725. Therefore, the Contractor shall pay, and shall cause all subcontractors, whether under contract with the Contractor or under contract with any Subcontractor, to pay not less than the specified prevailing wage rates to all workers employed in the execution of this Contract.

These penalties will not progress beyond thirty days or until the records become due. The Contractor is not subject to this penalty assessment due to the failure of a subcontractor to comply with these requirements if the Contractor can demonstrate that it has fully complied with the provisions of Labor Code Section 1776.

The Contractor shall cause all payments to a subcontractor whose payroll records are delinquent or inadequate until the Labor Commissioner provides notice that the subcontractor has cured the delinquency or deficiency. When payments are withheld under 8 CCR Section 16463, the Labor Commissioner will provide the Contractor and subcontractor, if applicable, with immediate written notice that includes all of the following: (1) a statement that payments are being withheld due to delinquent or inadequate payroll records, and that identifies what records are missing or states why records that have been submitted are deemed inadequate; (2) specifies what amounts the District has been directed to withhold; and (3) informs the Contractor or subcontractor of the right to request an expedited hearing to review the withholding of payments under Labor Code Section 1742, limited to the issue of whether the records are delinquent or inadequate or the Labor Commissioner has exceeded his or her authority under 8 CCR Section 16463. Where the violation is by a subcontractor, the Contractor shall be notified of the nature of the violation and reference shall be made to Contractor’s rights to withhold or recover payments from the subcontractor under Labor Code Section 1729. The withholdings under 8 CCR Section 16463 do not preclude assessment of penalties under Labor Code Section 1776(g) for failure to timely comply with a written request for certified payroll records, as set forth below.

Where the Contract Documents, instructions by the Project Inspector, District Representative or the Architect, laws, ordinances, or any public authority having jurisdiction require work to be inspected, tested or approved before the work proceeds, such work shall not proceed, nor shall it be covered up without inspection. If any part of the Work is covered prior to inspection, the District may order the work to be uncovered so that inspection may be accomplished. The Contractor shall bear all expenses of such examination and satisfactory reconstruction.

The Contractor shall provide written notice to the Project Inspector at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the readiness for inspection.

All work shall be available for inspection and the Project Inspector shall have full access to review all work during all working times. The Contractor shall provide all necessary means of safe access (e.g., ladders) for the Project Inspector to perform his/her duties. The Contractor shall furnish the Project Inspector with any information necessary to fully inform him/her of conditions. Inspection does not relieve the Contractor from fulfilling the requirements of the Contract Documents.

Additional inspection costs incurred because of overtime or shift work shall be paid by the District. If this overtime work is necessitated by the Contractor's error or failure to perform, the cost of inspection will be borne by the Contractor.

**Section 9.08.** Materials Which May be Tested.  
The District reserves the right to require the Contractor to provide samples, and to perform tests on any materials, articles, equipment, installations, or construction performed by the Contractor in addition to those specified in the Contract Documents.

The Contractor shall bear all expenses of tests performed where the Contractor failed to provide this minimum notice.

Special Inspections and tests required by codes, ordinances, or by a plan approval authority shall be the responsibility of Contractor. The Contractor shall utilize the testing services firm retained by the District and testing shall be paid for by the District unless otherwise provided in the Contract Documents.

**Section 9.10.** Selection of Samples.  
All samples and specimens for testing shall be selected by the Project Inspector or by the testing laboratory, but not by the Contractor.

**Section 9.11.** Delivery of Samples.  
The Contractor shall, at the Contractor’s sole cost and expense, furnish, package, mark, and deliver all samples to be tested at locations other than the Site. Samples shall be delivered either to the Project Inspector or to the testing laboratory or such other address specified in the Contract Documents.

Delivery of all samples to the testing laboratory shall be made in ample time to allow the test to be made without delaying construction. No extra time will be allowed for the completion of the Work by reason of delay in testing samples required by the Contract Documents or due to the Contractor’s request for substitution.

The Contractor shall allow free access at all times to the representatives of the testing laboratory to the Work, and shall point out the sources from which samples are taken.

All test reports shall be sent to all parties specified in the Contract Documents.

**Section 9.12. Approval of Samples.**  
No materials or work of which samples and/or tests are required shall be used or covered until the District Representative or the Project Inspector informs the Contractor that such samples and/or tests have been approved. If the Contractor installs, uses, or covers any such material, article, or work prior to testing and approval, such shall be at the Contractor’s sole risk and expense, and it shall bear all costs of uncovering, repair, and replacement thereof.

The approval of any samples shall be for the characteristics thereof, or for the uses named in such approval, and no other. No approval of any samples shall be deemed a change or modification in any requirement of the Contract Documents. Upon testing of any sample of material or work, no additional sample shall be considered. All material or work installed after the sampling and testing is performed and approved shall be equal to or better than the approved sample in all respects and shall be accompanied by documentary proof that the material and work sampled is actually representative of that installed.

**Section 9.13. Damage Due to Testing.**  
The Contractor shall, at its sole cost and expense, repair all damage resulting from testing specified in the Contract Documents. The District shall issue a Change Order for repair of damage due to sampling or testing other than specified in the Contract Documents.

The Contractor shall not make any tests upon portions of the Project already completed, except with the prior written consent and under the direction and supervision of the District Representative.

**Section 9.14. Restesting.**  
If as a result of any test, whether originally specified or not, any material or work is found to be unacceptable, it shall be rejected, and all further sampling and testing required by the District or District Representative shall be at the Contractor’s expense.

**Section 9.15. Effect of Sampling and Testing.**  
The District assumes no obligation, and the Contractor shall be relieved of no obligation undertaken pursuant to the Contract Documents by virtue of sampling and testing specified in this article.

The responsibility for incorporating satisfactory materials and workmanship which meet the Contract Documents in the work rest entirely with the Contractor, notwithstanding any prior samples or tests.

# ARTICLE 11. SUBMITTALS AND SUBSTITUTIONS

## Section 11.01. Submittals.
The Contractor, at its sole cost and expense, shall furnish to the District Representative all Submittals and other descriptive material as are required by the Specifications or requested by the Architect/Engineer. See Sections 01 33 23 for specific requirements.

Shop drawings shall be done with sufficient detail to adequately describe items proposed to be furnished or methods of installation to enable the District and Architect/Engineer to determine compliance with the Specifications and with the design and arrangement shown on the working drawings.

The Contractor shall check and coordinate all Submittals with the work of all trades involved before they are submitted. The Contractor shall review each Submittal for conformance with the requirements of the Contract Documents.

All Submittals for the Project shall be made within thirty-five (35) days of the Notice of Intent to Award; however, the Contractor shall have the additional responsibility to coordinate the schedule of its Submittals with the requirements of the Contract Schedule so as not to delay the Project. No delay claims related to Submittals will be entertained on the Project for any Submittal originally received after the thirty-five (35) day submittal period. The District shall not accept limitations in materials, colors, quality, or any other aspect of products or materials due to the Contractor’s failure to provide Submittals as required. At the District’s discretion, the Contractor may be directed to furnish and install temporary materials until the District selected material is available.

Contractor shall submit a schedule of Submittals organized by Specification section required for the Project; and as coordinated with the Schedule of Submittals for Volume 2 and Volume 3. It shall delineate whether product data, shop drawings, samples and/or mock-ups are required. The schedule of Submittals shall indicate whether the Submittal will be in electronic format, as set forth below. In general, other than items requiring color selections, samples and shop drawings, Submittals will be in electronic format. This schedule of Submittals shall be submitted within ten (10) calendar days of the issuance of the Notice of Intent to Award. Any omissions or inaccuracies shall not relieve the Contractor of its obligation for conforming to the requirements in the Contract Documents. The Contractor’s Submittal schedule shall provide sufficient time for delivering the Submittal to the Architect/Engineer, the Architect/Engineer review of each Submittal, delivering the Submittal to the Contractor and re-submittal as necessary. In no case shall the Contractor allow fewer than fourteen (14) days, exclusive of delivery time, for the District Representative and the Architect/Engineer to review each Submittal.

## Section 11.02. Submission of Submittals.
Most Submittals shall be submitted electronically. Electronic Submittals which are submitted together shall be compiled into a single, bookmarked PDF file, containing links to enable navigation to each item within the Submittal package. The Contractor shall name the electronic Submittal file with a consistent project identifier, composed of the project name, bid package number, and specification section number. Electronic Submittals shall be transmitted via the District Representative’s Collaboration Site address. Submittals shall be submitted to the Construction Manager (CM) as the District’s Representative. The CM will not review the Submittals for technical compliance, but may reject any Submittal found, in the CM's judgment, to be incomplete. The CM will maintain a Submittal log, and weekly meeting minutes shall note if Submittals have been accepted. Submittals requiring color selections, samples, or shop drawings will be logged.

For shop drawings, color selections and samples, the Contractor shall submit no less than three (3) originals. All Submittals of shop drawings, color selections and samples shall be marked with the project name, the Contractor’s name, and the specification section number, and shall be accompanied by a letter of transmittal to the CM. The letter of transmittal for shop drawings shall list the identifying number of the drawings submitted and cross-reference them to the page or sheet in the specifications and/or working drawings to which they are related.

By approving and submitting shop drawings, product data, manufacturers' instructions, and samples, the Contractor represents that it has determined and verified all materials, field measurements and field construction criteria related thereto and that it has checked and coordinated the information contained within those Submittals with the requirements of the Work and to the Contract Documents. The Contractor shall adhere to any supplementary processing and scheduling instructions pertaining to Submittals as may be issued by the CM.

The CM will not accept shop drawings, product data or manufacturers' instructions which are not sufficiently dimensioned and detailed to demonstrate compliance with the Contract Documents.

The Submittals shall be submitted promptly, so as to cause no delay in the work. The Submittals shall be submitted so as to allow the CM and the Architect/Engineer a review period of no less than fourteen (14) days, and in accordance with the schedule of Submittals provided by the Contractor.

**Section 11.03. Review of Submittals.**  
Following submission, the Submittals will be reviewed and returned with one or more of five possible responses by the CM or Architect/Engineer. These possible responses are as follows:

1. **Unreviewed:** If the Submittal is not required, or if it is not complete, or if it does not meet the form, format, and number requirements specified, it may be returned unreviewed. If the Submittal is not required, work may commence; if the Submittal was returned due to form requirements, it shall be resubmitted and approval obtained prior to commencement of the work.

2. **Approved, Reviewed, or No exceptions taken:** In the event the Submittal is acceptable as submitted, it will be returned with this status. Work may proceed on receipt of the Submittal.

3. **More Corrections Needed:** If the Submittal is acceptable except for certain items which have been noted by the Architect, it will be so designated. Work may proceed with the corrections made, and no resubmittal is necessary.

4. **Revise and Resubmit:** This status indicates that revisions are noted on the Submittal, and an additional Submittal is required to reflect those revisions and/or additional information. Work may not commence until the resubmittal is approved.

5. **Rejected:** A Submittal may be rejected if it is not in compliance with the Contract Documents, or if it proposes an "or equal" or substitution which is not acceptable to the Architect/Engineer. A superseding Submittal shall be submitted and approved prior to commencement of the work.

Should the Contractor proceed with the work shown on a Submittal before approval is received, it shall remove and replace or adjust any work which is not in accordance with the Submittal as ultimately approved, and it shall be responsible for any resultant damage, defect, or added cost. The District shall be under no obligation to pay for work installed prior to approval of Submittals, until the Submittals are approved and the work in place is in compliance with the Contract Documents.

The Contractor shall resubmit Submittals in categories “D” and “E” above after making any changes required so that Submittals will comply with the Contract Documents. When resubmitting, the Contractor shall direct specific attention to deficient areas. Resubmittals shall be made within ten (10) days of return of the previous Submittal, and in any event in sufficient time so as to avoid delay to the Work. No delay claims related to resubmittals will be entertained on the Project for any resubmittal originally received after the ten (10) days.

The Architect shall determine the adequacy and completeness of all Submittals. Where the Architect deems a Submittal to be inadequate, incomplete, or otherwise unsuitable for proper review, the Contractor shall submit all additional information requested by the Architect/Engineer. There shall be no change to the Contract Time or the Contract Sum when such additional information is required.

**Section 11.04. Submittals Showing Variation from Contract.**  
It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to specifically point out any variation or discrepancy between the Submittals submitted and the Contract Documents.  

The Contractor shall make specific mention of all variations, along with an explanation of why they are requested, in its letter of transmittal.  

Failure by the contractor to identify in its letter of transmittal any variation, discrepancy, or conflict with the contract documents shall render the approval null and void, and the contractor shall bear all risk of loss and reconstruction costs or delays.  

If any architectural, plumbing, mechanical, electrical, or structural modifications are required as a result of the approval of Submittals which deviate from or do not comply with the Contract Documents, those modifications shall be made without extra cost to the District, and without extension of the Contract Time. Any other resultant costs, including but not limited to design fees, construction management fees, costs incurred by other contractors, or inspection fees, shall be at the expense of the Contractor.  

**Section 11.05. Effect of Approval of Submittals.**  
The approval of Submittals shall not relieve the Contractor of the obligation for accuracy of dimensions and details; for conforming the work to the requirements of the Contract Documents; or from responsibility to fulfill the Contract at no extra cost to the District, within the Contract Time.  

**Section 11.06. Equal Materials.**  
Unless otherwise provided in the technical specifications, whenever in the Contract Documents any systems, processes, products, or materials are indicated or specified by the name brand of the manufacturer, or by patent or proprietary names, those specifications shall be deemed to be a measure of quality and utility or a standard and shall be deemed to be followed by the words, “or equal.” It is the intent of this article to comply with Public Contract Code Section 3400.  

If the Contractor desires to use any other brand or manufacturer of equal quality and utility to that specified, it shall make application to the CM in writing, within ten (10) business days after Notice of Intent to Award and shall submit samples and all other information necessary to substantiate its claim of “or equal”. Such application constitutes a certification that the Contractor:  

1. Has investigated the proposed Equal and determined that it meets or exceeds, in all respects, the specified system, process, product, or material.  

2. Will provide the same warranty for the proposed Equal as for the specified system, process product or material.  

3. Will coordinate installation and make other changes which may be required for work to be complete in all respects and at no additional cost to the District.  

4. Waives claims for additional costs and/or Contract Time which may subsequently become apparent.  

The Architect/Engineer then will determine whether or not the proposed system, process, product or material is equal in quality and utility to that specified, and its decision shall be final. The Architect/Engineer will render its decision within twenty-one (21) business days after submission of all required information for the application. If the request is not accepted, the Contractor shall provide the specified system, process, product or material without an increase in the Contract Sum and/or Contract Time.  

Neither the submission of a request for an Equal, nor the Architect/Engineer review of the application, will extend the time for submission of any required Submittals.

**Section 11.07. Substitutions.**  
Unless otherwise provided in the technical specifications, the Contractor may make proposals for Substitutions to systems, process, products or materials shown or specified only under one or more of the following conditions:

1. **Unavailability:** If the specified system, process, product, or material, or an Equal, is no longer available in the marketplace.

2. **Delay:** If obtaining the specified system, product, process or material, or an Equal, will delay completion of the Work through no fault of the Contractor.

3. **Better system, process product or material:** If a better system, product, process or material is available at no additional cost.

4. **Savings:** If a system, process, product or material which meets all of the performance requirements of that specified is available at a savings to the District.

A proposal for Substitution shall include all information required by the Architect/Engineer to evaluate the substitute system, process, product or material. All Substitutions shall be submitted with an approved “Substitution Request Form”. Such proposal constitutes a certification that the Contractor:

A. Has investigated the proposed Substitution and determined that it meets or exceeds the performance requirements of the specified system, process product or material.

B. Will provide the same or better warranty for the proposed Substitution as for specified system, process, product or material.

C. Will coordinate installation and make other changes which may be required for the work to be complete in all respects at no additional cost to the District.

D. Waives claims for additional costs and/or Contract Time, which may subsequently become apparent.

The District Representative and the Architect/Engineer shall evaluate a timely Substitution request, and shall approve, deny, approve with conditions, or initiate the procedure for a change order in response to the Contractor’s request. This decision shall be final. This decision will be rendered within twenty one (21) business days after submission of all required information for the proposal. If the request is not accepted, the Contractor shall provide the specified system, process, product or material without an increase in the Contract Sum and/or Contract Time.

Failure by the Contractor to identify all deviations from the Contract Documents in its request for substitution shall render any District action taken thereon null and void. The Contractor shall bear all costs resulting from any error in the request for Substitution.

Only one request for Substitution will be considered for each product.

Neither the submission of a request for substituted systems, processes, products or materials, nor the District Representative’s and/or Architect’s review of the application, will extend the time for submission of any required Submittals.

Substitution proposals will not be considered prior to bidding. All requests for Substitutions shall be made within the same time requirement for initial submittals. Failure to timely submit a Substitution request shall constitute a waiver by the Contractor and an acceptance of the specified systems, processes, products and materials. Late submittals may be considered only when the District Representative consents in writing, and the District’s best interests so require.

**Section 11.09. Samples and Testing of Proposed Substitutions; Costs of Adapting to Work.**  
When the CM or Architect/Engineer determines that samples and testing are required to evaluate a request for a Substitution, the District Representative shall so advise the Contractor, and specify the systems, processes, products, materials or work to be sampled. The Contractor shall, at no cost to the District, provide samples as required by these General Conditions dealing with samples and testing, or the Technical Specifications.

The Contractor shall bear all costs of sampling and testing required to decide a request for Substitution, and if a Substitution is accepted, the Contractor shall bear all costs associated therewith, including the cost of the CM’s, Architect’s and/or Engineer’s services required to adapt the Substitution to the design to the satisfaction of the District, and all costs of mechanical, electrical, structural, or other changes needed to adapt the Substitution to the Work.

**Section 11.10. Effect of Approval of Equal Materials or Substitution Request.**

No time extensions for any increases in the Contract Sum shall be granted on account of an Equal or Substitution. In the event of a savings, the Contract Sum shall be adjusted by the price difference between the approved Equal or Substitution and the originally specified item.

**Section 11.11. Quality of Materials and Products.**  
The Contractor shall, if required by the Architect/Engineer, Project Inspector, or District Representative, furnish satisfactory evidence as to the kind and quality of materials provided.

The District Representative may require, and the Contractor shall submit if required, a list designating the source of supply of each item of materials incorporated into the Work, and in such event, those materials or products shall not be delivered to the Work nor installed therein until after the CM has approved the list.

Contractor shall certify that the materials and equipment installed comply with the Contract Documents and to the best of the Contractor’s knowledge, no installed materials or equipment contain hazardous materials.

**Section 11.12. Better Material or Process.**  
In the event that the Contractor furnishes a material, product, process, or article better than that specified in the Contract Documents, the difference in cost of that material, product, process, or article shall be borne by the Contractor.

![ARTICLE 12. PROGRESS PAYMENTS](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=ARTICLE+12.+PROGRESS+PAYMENTS)

**Section 12.01. Schedule of Values.**  
As part of required post bid submittals, and at least fourteen (14) days prior to the first payment application, the Contractor shall submit to the District Representative a schedule of values broken down by Volume, Division and Section of the Work, in sufficient detail to evaluate progress at any point in the Work. In no event shall an individual line item on a schedule of values exceed five (5) percent of the Contract Sum unless so approved in advance by the District Representative. Costs shall be segregated by Volume, Division and Section of the Work. Cost of Contract closeout shall be shown as individual line items, including, but not limited to, closeout documents, punch-list, and as-built documentation. Each of these line items shall be no less than two (2) percent of the total Contract Sum.

All other General Conditions items should be prorated among the actual construction values. The schedule of values must be prepared in sufficient detail and supported by such data to substantiate its accuracy as the District Representative and the District may require. This schedule, when approved, shall be used as a basis for the Contractor's applications for payment, and the approved schedule of values is an express condition precedent to processing the Contractor’s payment application(s).

**Section 12.02. Application for Payment.**  
Prior to the date for each progress payment review established in the Preconstruction Meeting, the Contractor shall submit to the District Representative a copy of the schedule of values, marked in pencil to show the percentage of completion proposed by the Contractor for each line item. No extension of dollar amounts is required.

At a meeting held on or before the assigned billing date each month, the CM, Architect, Project Inspector, and the Contractor will review the Contractor’s proposed percentages of completion and agree on a final percentage to be paid for that month. No progress payment will be made unless all general conditions items demonstrate satisfactory progress. Upon agreement of the amount due, the Contractor will prepare a hard copy of the Application of Payment Summary and transmit it to the District Representative for processing by the assigned day of each month.

1. **Release of Liens:** For each monthly application for payment, following agreement on percentages of completion, the Contractor shall submit a conditional lien release in the form provided in the Contract Documents warranting that title to all work, labor, materials and equipment covered by the application is free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests or encumbrances. Additionally, the Contractor shall submit unconditional lien releases for all work through the prior progress payment. For final payment, the Contractor and all of its Subcontractors and material suppliers shall submit final conditional and final unconditional lien releases.

2. Contractor shall submit a list of all Subcontractors and material suppliers including company name, address, business and emergency telephone numbers, and contact person. This Subcontractor and material supplier list shall be submitted prior to the issuance of the Notice to Proceed.

3. The signing of a certificate of payment will constitute a representation by the District Representative, Project Inspector and the Architect/Engineer to the District that, based on their observations at the Site, and the data comprising the application for payment, the Work has progressed to the point indicated and that, to the best of their knowledge, information and belief, the quality of the Work is in accordance with the Contract Documents (subject to any specific qualifications stated in the certificate for payment); and that the contractors are entitled to payment in the amount certified. However, by signing a certificate for payment, the District Representative and the Architect/Engineer shall not thereby be deemed to represent that either has made exhaustive or continuous on-site inspections to check the quality or quantity of the work, that either has reviewed the construction means, methods, techniques, sequences or procedures, or that either has made an examination to ascertain how or for what purpose the contractors have.

4. No progress payment will be released until District Representative has received all of the following items in acceptable form: as-built updates, schedule updates, certified payroll and other pay records if requested by the District, and lien releases.

**Section 12.03. Payment for Stored Materials.**  
Payments may be made by the District, at its discretion, on account of materials or equipment not incorporated in the Work but delivered to the Site and suitably stored by the Contractor. Payments for materials or equipment stored shall only be considered upon submission by the Contractor of satisfactory evidence demonstrating that it has acquired title to such material, that the material will be used in the Work, that it is satisfactorily stored, protected and insured, and that the Contractor has undertaken such other procedures satisfactory to the District Representative, Project Inspector, and Architect/Engineer, to protect the District’s interests. Materials stored off-site, to be considered for payment, shall, in addition to the above requirements, be stored in a bonded warehouse, fully insured, and available to the Architect and District Representative for inspection. The District Representative shall have complete discretion as to the amount of material and equipment that may be stored on the Site at any given time.

**Section 12.04. Payment; Retention.**  
There shall be reserved from the monies earned by the Contractor on estimates a sum equal to five percent of such estimates. It is understood that, if payment requests are made in accordance with established time schedule, payment requests received and approved by District will be processed within thirty (30) days following approval. Payment for Change Orders, under this Contract shall be made in like manner.

**Section 12.05. Posting Securities in Lieu of Withholds.**  
Pursuant to Public Contract Code Section 22300, of the Contractor, securities equivalent to the amount withheld shall be deposited in the binder, under Treasurer or with a state or federally chartered bank in California as the escrow agent, who shall then pay the retainage to the Contractor. Upon satisfactory completion of the Contract, the securities shall be returned to the Contractor.  

Alternatively, the Contractor may request, pursuant to Public Contract Code Section 22300, and the District shall make payment of retentions under Section 12.04 directly to the escrow agent. The Contractor shall receive the interest earned on the investments upon the same terms provided for in Section 22300 for securities deposited by the Contractor. Upon satisfactory completion of the Contract, the Contractor shall receive from the escrow agent all securities, interest and payments received by the escrow agent from the District.  

Either alternative under this Section may be exercised only if requested in writing by the Contractor within five (5) days after receipt of Notice of Intent to Award. The Contractor shall notify its Subcontractors in writing within fifteen (15) days of exercising this option.  

Securities eligible for investment under this Section shall include those listed in Government Code Section 16430 or bank or savings and loan certificates of deposit, interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, stand-by letters of credit, or any other security mutually agreed to by the Contractor and the District.  

The Contractor shall be the beneficial owner of any securities substituted for monies withheld and shall receive any interest thereon.

**Section 12.06. Withholding Additional Amounts; Grounds.**  
In addition to the amounts which the District may retain as provided in Section 12.04, the District may withhold a sufficient amount from any payment or payments otherwise due to the Contractor as in the District’s sole discretion may be necessary to protect the District in the event of the following:  

1. Third party claims filed or reasonable evidence indicating probable filing of such claims;  

FAIR OAKS RECREATION AND PARK DISTRICT  
January 2021
<!-- Page 279 -->
2. Defective work not remedied;

3. Failure of the Contractor to make proper payments to any of its Subcontractors for labor, materials or equipment;

4. The occurrence of reasonable doubt that the Contract can be completed for the balance of payments then unpaid to the Contractor, or in the time remaining until expiration of the Contract Time;

5. Failure of the Contractor to comply with any lawful or proper direction concerning the Work given by any District representative authorized to have given such instruction;

6. Claims and/or penalties which state law assesses against the Contractor for violation of such law;

7. Any claim or penalty asserted against the District by virtue of the Contractor's failure to comply with the provisions of all governing laws, ordinances, regulations, rules, and orders;

8. Any liquidated damages which may accrue as a result of the Contractor's progress failing to meet the schedule milestones or failing to achieve completion within the Contract Time;

9. Any reason specified elsewhere in the Contract Documents as grounds for a retention or that would legally entitle the District to a set-off.

In order to adequately protect the District, the Contractor agrees that the basic standard to determine the amount to be withheld pursuant to this Section shall be one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the amounts claimed for the value of the work done or defective delivery; provided, however, that District reserves the authority to retain greater sums should such sums be necessary in the District's discretion to adequately protect it.

**Section 12.07. Disbursement of Withheld Amounts.**  
The District, in its sole discretion, may apply any withheld amount or amounts to the payment of any claim resulting in a withhold. The Contractor agrees and hereby designates the District as its agent for such purposes, and any payment so made by the District shall be considered as a payment made under this Contract by the District to the Contractor. The District shall not be liable to the Contractor for any payments made in good faith. Such payments may be made without a prior judicial determination of the claim or claims. The District shall render to the Contractor a proper accounting of any funds disbursed on behalf of the Contractor.

Prior to disbursing any amounts, District shall afford the Contractor an opportunity to present good cause, if any it has, why the claim or claims in issue are not valid or just claims against the Contractor. The District reserves the right then to take such further steps as are appropriate, in its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, seeking a judicial resolution of the controversy.

**Section 12.08. Correction of Statement and Withholding of Payment.**  
No inaccuracy or error in any statement provided by the Contractor shall operate to release the Contractor or any surety from the error, or from damages arising from such work, or from any obligation imposed by the Contract Documents. The District shall retain the right subsequently to correct any error made in any previously issued claim for the progress or other payment, or payment of any kind issued, by adjustments to subsequent payments.

**Section 12.09. Effect of Progress Payments.**  
Neither the payment, the withholding, nor the retention of all or any portion of any progress payment claimed to be due and owing to the Contractor shall operate in any way to relieve the Contractor from its obligations under this agreement. The Contractor shall continue diligently to prosecute the Work without reference to

# ARTICLE 13. TIME OF WORK

## Section 13.01. Not applicable.

## Section 13.02. Contract Schedule Development.
Within ten (10) days after receiving the Notice to Proceed, the Contractor shall submit a detailed proposed Contract Schedule presenting an orderly and realistic plan for completion of the Work, in conformance with the requirements of this Article. The proposed Contract Schedule shall be in hard copy and in electronic format other than pdf.

The Contract Schedule shall furnish or comply with the following requirements:

1. A time scaled CPM type schedule prepared in Microsoft Project/Primavera software.

2. No activity on the schedule shall have a duration longer than fourteen (14) days, with the exception of fabrication and procurement activities, unless otherwise approved by the District Representative. Activity durations shall be the total number of actual days required to perform that activity including consideration of weather impact on completion of that activity.

3. Procurement of major equipment, through receipt and inspection at the job site, identified as a separate activity.

4. Owner furnished materials and equipment if any, identified as separate activities.

5. Dependencies (or relationships) between activities.

6. Processing/approval of submittals and shop drawings for major equipment. Activities that are dependent on submittal acceptance and/or material delivery shall not be scheduled to start earlier than the expected acceptance or delivery dates.

7. Separate buildings and other independent project elements shall be individually identified in the network.

8. Fourteen (14) days for developing punch list(s), completion of punch list items, and final clean-up for the work or any designated portion thereof. No other activities shall be scheduled during this period.

9. Interface with the work of other Contractors (or entities).

The District Representative will review the proposed Contract Schedule for conformance with the requirements of the Contract. Within ten (10) days after receipt, the District Representative will accept the proposed Contract Schedule or will return it with comments. If the proposed Contract Schedule is not accepted, the Contractor shall revise the schedule to incorporate comments and resubmit the schedule for acceptance within seven (7) days after receiving it. The accepted schedule shall become the Contract Schedule.

The Contract Schedule shall be the basis for evaluating job progress, payment requests, and time extension requests. The responsibility for developing the Contract Schedule and monitoring actual progress as compared to the schedule rests with the Contractor.

Failure of the Contract Schedule to include any element of the work or any inaccuracy in the Contract Schedule will not relieve Contractor from responsibility for accomplishing all the Work in accordance with the Contract.

![General Conditions Section 00 72 13 - Page 47](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=General+Conditions+Section+00+72+13+-+Page+47)

Acceptance of the Contract Schedule will not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for accomplishing the Work in accordance with the Contract.

Failure to obtain the accepted Contract Schedule within forty (40) calendar days of the Notice to Proceed may result in the District withholding ten percent (10%) of each progress payment, or $1000, whichever is greater, until an accepted Contract Schedule is obtained.

**Section 13.03. Monthly Updates.**  
Contractor shall submit to the District Representative each month an up-to-date status report of the Work. The status report shall be in hard copy and on a CD in electronic format other than pdf and shall include:

1. Contractor’s estimated percentage complete and remaining duration for each activity not yet complete.
2. Actual start/finish dates for activities as appropriate.
3. Identification of processing errors, if any on the previous update reports.
4. Revisions, if any, to the activity durations including revisions for weather impact to any activities due to the effect of the previous update on the schedule.
5. Identification of activities that are affected by requested or proposed changes to the Work.
6. Resolution of conflict between actual work progress and schedule logic. When out of sequence activities develop in the Contract Schedule because of actual construction progress, the Contractor shall submit revision to schedule logic to conform to current status and direction.

The District Representative will review the updated information and meet with Contractor each month at the Site to determine the status of the Work. If agreement cannot be reached on any issue, the Contractor will use the District Representative’s determination in the processing of the update.

Progress payments pursuant to the Contract will be based on the update of the Contract Schedule. No progress payments will be made without the required monthly update of the Contract Schedule.

**Section 13.04. Schedule Revisions.**  
If the sequence of construction differs significantly, as determined by the District Representative, from the Contract Schedule, Contractor shall submit within fifteen (15) days a revised schedule to the District Representative for approval.

When a requested or proposed change to the Work will have an impact on the critical path, the Contractor shall submit a schedule fragment or Network Window showing this impact. If the requested or proposed change is accepted by the District, the schedule fragment or Network Window shall be incorporated into the Contract Schedule. Time extensions will be considered only to the extent there is insufficient remaining float to accommodate these changes, and pursuant to Article 14 of these General Conditions. No additional cost beyond that provided in Article 15 will be allowed for the incorporation of approved changes into the Contract Schedule.

Should the Contractor, after acceptance of the Contract Schedule, intend to change its plan of construction, it shall submit its requested revisions to the District Representative, along with a written statement of the revision, including a description of the logic for rescheduling the work, methods of maintaining adherence to Intermediate milestones and other specific dates and the reasons for the revisions. If the requested changes are acceptable to the District Representative, they will be incorporated into the Contract Schedule in the next reporting period.

Schedule revisions shall be submitted at least seven (7) days prior to the date of submission of update information. The District will have seven (7) days to review the revisions.

**Section 13.05. Short Interval Schedules.**  
Contractor shall prepare a Short Interval Schedule (SIS) to be used throughout the duration of Work. The SIS shall include the current activities and projected activities for the succeeding two (2) weeks. The SIS shall include actual start/finish dates for the preceding one (1) week. The SIS shall be submitted in hard copy and electronic PDF format to the District Representative prior to the weekly construction meeting. The Contractor shall participate in short interval scheduling coordination during the weekly construction meetings.

**Section 13.06. Owner's Right to Revise Schedule.**  
In the event of a delay affecting the occupancy date of the Project and not the fault of the Contractor, the District Representative may elect to re-sequence work or otherwise modify the schedule in an attempt to maintain the Date of Completion. It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to cooperate in this effort. It is not the District’s responsibility to ensure the Contractor the ability to use “optimal” crew size throughout the Project and no adjustment of the Contract Sum will be made for minor variations in crew size or claimed loss of efficiency or disruption that result from schedule adjustments. However, overtime work or weekend work required by the District Representative to meet schedule objectives other than those of the individual contractor will be reimbursed per the provisions of Article 15, provided that Contractor has not contributed to the delay which the District Representative is seeking to overcome. If the Contractor contends that a schedule adjustment will cause a significant disruption of its work sequence or ability to perform work efficiently, it shall notify the District Representative within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of the adjustment. Failure to provide timely notice constitutes a waiver by Contractor of any claim for compensation arising out of the schedule adjustment.

**Section 13.08. Time of Essence.**  
Time is of the essence of this agreement. The Contractor shall, to the fullest extent possible, carry on the various classes or parts of the Work concurrently, and shall not defer construction of any portion of the Work in favor of any other portion of the Work, without the express approval of the District Representative.

**Section 13.09. Date of Completion.**  
The Contractor shall fully and satisfactorily complete the Work within the Contract Time. The Date of Completion is defined in Article I.

**Section 13.10. Responsibility for Completion.**  
The Contractor shall furnish sufficient manpower, materials, facilities and equipment and shall work sufficient hours, including night shifts, overtime operations, Sundays and holidays as may be necessary to insure the prosecution and completion of the Work in accordance with the Contract Time. If work on the critical path is seven (7) days or more behind the currently updated Contract Schedule and it becomes apparent that the Work will not be completed within the Contract Time, the Contractor will implement whatever steps it deems necessary to make up lost time. If the Contractor's solution is not successful, it will make further attempts using the following sequence of events:

1. Reschedule activities to achieve maximum practical concurrence of accomplishment of activities.

2. If the above cannot be achieved then;

   a. The Contractor shall increase manpower in such quantities and crafts as will substantially eliminate, in the judgment of the District Representative, the backlog of work; or increase the number of working hours, shifts per working day, working days per week or the amount of

**Section 00 72 13 - Page 49**

b. In addition, the District Representative may require the Contractor to submit a recovery schedule demonstrating its program and proposed plan to make up a lag in scheduled progress and to ensure completion of the Work within the Contract Time. If the District Representative finds the proposed recovery schedule unacceptable, it may require the Contractor to submit a new plan. If the actions taken by the Contractor or the second plan proposed are unsatisfactory, the District Representative may require the Contractor to take any of the actions set forth in the previous paragraph without additional cost to the District to make up the lag in scheduled progress.

Failure of the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this Section 13.09 shall be considered grounds for a determination by the District, pursuant to Article 12, Section 12.06D, that the Contractor is failing to prosecute the Work with such diligence as will ensure its completion within the time specified.

**Section 13.11. Payments Withheld.**  
Progress Payments may be withheld in whole or in part should the Contractor fail to comply with the requirements of this Article.

![ARTICLE 14. DELAYS AND EXTENSIONS OF TIME](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=ARTICLE+14.+DELAYS+AND+EXTENSIONS+OF+TIME)

**Section 14.01. Extensions of Time: Unavoidable Delays.**  
The Contractor shall not be granted an extension of time except on the issuance of a Change Order by the District, upon a finding of good cause for such extension.

1. As used herein, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

   a. **"Excusable Delay"** means any delay in completion of the Work beyond the expiration of the Contract Time caused by conditions beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. These events may include strikes, embargoes, fire, unavoidable casualties, national emergency, and stormy and inclement weather conditions in which the District Representative and Project Inspector agree that work on the critical path cannot continue. The financial incapability of the Contractor or any Subcontractor or supplier and any default of any Subcontractor, without limitation, shall not be deemed conditions beyond the Contractor’s control. An Excusable Delay may entitle the Contractor to an extension of the Contract time, in accordance with this Section of the general conditions, but shall not entitle the Contractor to any adjustment of the Contract Sum.

   b. **"Compensable Delay"** means any delay in the completion of the Work beyond the expiration date of the Contract Time caused solely by the wrongful acts of the District and which delay is unreasonable under the circumstances and not within the contemplation of the parties. A Compensable Delay may entitle the Contractor to an extension of the Contract time, in accordance with this Section of the General Conditions and/or an adjustment of the Contract Sum, in accordance with Article 15. Except as provided herein, the Contractor shall have no claim for damage or compensation for any delay, interruption, or disruption.

   c. **"Inexcusable Delay"** means any delay in completion of the Work beyond the expiration of the Contract Time resulting from causes other than those listed in Subparagraphs A1 and A2, above. An Inexcusable Delay will not entitle the Contractor to an extension of the Contract Time or an adjustment of the Contract Sum.

2. The Contractor may make a claim for an extension of the Contract time, for an Excusable Delay or a Compensable Delay, subject to the following:

   a. If an Excusable Delay and a Compensable Delay occur concurrently, the maximum extension of the Contract Time shall be the number of days from the commencement of the first delay to the cessation of the delay which ends last. Any adjustment of the Contract Sum shall be in accordance with Article 15 and shall be based only on the non-concurrent portion of any Compensable Delay.

   b. If an Inexcusable Delay occurs concurrently with either an Excusable Delay and/or a Compensable Delay, the maximum extension of the Contract Time shall be the number of days, if any, by which the duration of the Excusable Delay and/or the Compensable Delay calculated in accordance with subparagraph B1, if applicable, exceeds the Inexcusable Delay. The duration of the concurrence is non-compensable.

Delays in the prosecution of parts or classes of the Work which do not prevent or delay the completion of the whole Work within the Contract Time are not to be considered Excusable or Compensable.

**Section 14.02. Notice of Delays; Requests for Time Extensions.**  
Whenever the Contractor foresees any delay in the prosecution of the Work, and in any event immediately upon the occurrence of any delay which the Contractor regards as good cause for an extension, the Contractor shall notify the District Representative in writing of the delay. The notice shall specify with detail the cause asserted by the Contractor to constitute good cause for an extension together with a detailed

schedule analysis showing the effect of the delay on the critical path of the Contractor Schedule and a quantification of the length of the requested extension of time. Failure of the Contractor to submit such a notice within ten (10) days after the initial occurrence of the event giving rise to the delay shall constitute a waiver by the Contractor of any entitlement to a time extension, as well as to any associated additional compensation, and no extension shall be granted as a consequence of such delay.  
The District shall have no obligation to consider any time extension request unless the requirements of the Contract Documents are complied with. The District shall not be responsible or liable to the Contractor for any constructive acceleration due to failure of the District to grant time extensions under the Contract Documents, should the Contractor fail to comply with the submission and justification requirements of the Contract Documents for time extension requests. The Contractor’s failure to perform in accordance with the Contract Schedule shall not be excused because the Contractor has submitted time extension requests, unless and until such requests are approved by the District.

**Section 14.03. Investigation; Procedure.**  
Upon receipt of a request for extension, the District Representative shall conduct an investigation of the facts asserted by the Contractor to constitute good cause for an extension. The District Representative shall report the results of this investigation, as well as the propriety of the time extension requested, to the Contractor in writing within ten (10) days of receipt of the request and shall indicate whether it will recommend for or against the extension.

Upon receiving the District Representative’s recommendation, the Contractor may either concur in the recommendation, or reject the recommendation and proceed with a claim as provided for in Articles 21 and 23.

**Section 14.04. Discretionary Time Extensions for Best Efforts.**  
The District reserves the right to extend the time for completion of the Work if the extension is granted on the request of the Contractor, the District shall have the right to charge to the Contractor all or any part, as the District may deem proper, of the actual cost of construction management, engineering, inspection, supervision, incidental and other overhead expenses that accrue during the period of the extension, and to deduct all or any portion of that amount from the final payment for the Work.

In the event a discretionary time extension is ordered over the objection of the Contractor, and the decision rests solely with the District and is not legally compelled for any cause, the Contractor shall be entitled to a contract change pursuant to Article 15 adjusting the time paid to reflect the actual costs incurred by the Contractor as a direct result of the delay, upon its written application therefore, accompanied with such verification of costs as the District Representative requires. The decision of the District on any discretionary time extension and the costs thereof shall be final and binding on the District and the Contractor.

**Section 14.05. Liquidated Damages.**  
If the Work is not completed by the Contractor in the time specified in Section 00 73 00, Special Provisions, or within any period of extension authorized pursuant to this Article, the Contractor acknowledges and admits that the District will suffer damage, and that it is impracticable and infeasible to fix the amount of actual damages. Therefore, it is agreed by and between the Contractor and the District that the Contractor shall pay to the District as fixed and liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, the sum specified in the Agreement for Construction for each calendar day of delay until the Date of Completion, and that both the Contractor and the Contractor's surety shall be liable for the total amount thereof, and that District may deduct Liquidated Damages from any monies due or that may become due to the Contractor. If it appears during the course of construction that the Contractor is behind schedule and the imposition of liquidated damages is likely, or if liquidated damages begin to accrue prior to the time for final payment, the amount accrued shall be withheld from any progress payment that would otherwise be due. This right to withhold funds is intended to complement the District’s rights under Section 12.06.

This liquidated damage provision shall apply to all delays of any nature whatsoever, save and except only delays found to be excusable or compensable pursuant to Section 14.01, or time extensions granted by the District pursuant to Section 14.04.

Pursuant to Government Code Section 4215, the Contractor shall not pay fixed and liquidated damages for delay in completing the project caused by the failure of the District or the owner of utility facilities located on the Project Site to provide for removal or relocation of such facilities.

Payment by the District of any progress payments after expiration of the Contract Time shall not constitute a waiver by the District of its right to claim liquidated damages in accordance with this Section.

If the Contract is terminated before or after the Contract Time, as adjusted by any extensions of time that the District may have granted, pursuant to Section 18.07, the Contractor shall remain liable to the District for liquidated damages for all periods of time from such termination date until the Date of Completion.

**Section 14.06. Extension of Time Not a Waiver.**  
Any extension of time granted the Contractor pursuant to this Article shall not constitute a waiver by the District of, nor a release of the Contractor from the Contractor's obligation to perform this Contract in the time specified by the agreement, as modified by the particular extension in question.

The District’s decision to grant a time extension due to one circumstance set forth in one request, shall not be construed as a grant of an extension for any other circumstance or the same circumstance occurring at some other time, and shall not be viewed by the Contractor as a precedent for any other request for extension.

**Section 14.07. Suspensions Exceeding One Year.**  
Should the work be suspended for a period exceeding one calendar year due to such conditions, labor conditions, legal actions, or for other conditions constituting the legal defense of impossibility of performance, the Contractor and District agree to enter into an agreement terminating the agreement upon the following terms and conditions.

District shall be responsible only to pay the Contractor the actual value of the work performed from the Date of Commencement or from the date of the last progress payment, whichever is later, plus the five percent (5%) retention from prior progress payments, less any deductions authorized by the Contract Documents.

As between the Contractor and District, it shall be conclusively presumed that the actual value for the Contractor’s work to the date of the last progress payment is no more than the actual amount of prior progress payment plus the five percent (5%) retention from those progress payments; provided, however, that this Section shall not preclude District from deducting charges for work or materials which do not meet the requirements of the Contract Documents.

**Section 14.08. Effect of Stop Work Notice.**  
If the District orders a stop work notice pursuant to Article 9, the days on which the suspension is in effect shall be included in determining the required completion date and shall not otherwise modify or extend the time within which the Contractor is to perform. In such event, the Contractor shall not be entitled to any damages or compensation on account of such suspension or delay, unless the Contractor can establish that stop work notice was not warranted.

# ARTICLE 15. CHANGES TO THE WORK

## Section 15.01. No Changes Without Consent.
No extra work shall be performed, and no change shall be made, except pursuant to a written Change Order or Proposed Change Order signed by the District, or by a Directive signed by either the District or the District Representative, stating that the extra work or change is authorized, and no claim for any addition to the Contract Sum or Contract Time shall be valid unless so authorized; provided, however, that nothing in this Article shall excuse the Contractor from proceeding with the prosecution of the work so changed. The Contractor shall, when required by the District Representative, furnish an itemized breakdown of the quantities and prices used in computing the value of any change requested by the Contractor, or that may have been ordered by the District, including all items listed in Sections 15.07 and 15.08, below.

Change Orders shall specify the cost adjustments associated therewith, and in no case shall the District pay or become liable to pay any sums different than those specified or those established under Section 15.06 and 15.07.

## Section 15.02. Change Orders.
Subject to legal requirements relating to competitive bidding, the District may require changes in, additions to, or deductions from the work to be performed or the materials to be furnished pursuant to the Contract Documents. Changes may be made pursuant to a written Change Order signed by the District, which state the agreement of the District, the Contractor, and the Architect upon all of the following:

1. The scope of the change in the Work;
2. The amount of the adjustment in the Contract Sum, if any; and
3. The extent of the adjustment in the Contract Time, if any.

The District may also issue unilateral change orders based upon previously issued Directives. Unilateral change orders shall be approved by the District, the Architect, and the District Representative, but need not be signed by the Contractor.

If the Contractor believes that conditions have changed, or that it has been directed to do additional work requiring a change in time or cost, the Contractor may submit to the District Representative a Proposed Change Order (PCO).

Except for Minor Change Orders described below, all adjustments to the Contract Sum or the Contract Time must be approved by the District.

Signature by the Contractor on the Change Order constitutes its agreement with and acceptance of the adjustments in the Contract Sum and Contract Time, if any, set forth in the Change Order as full and complete satisfaction of any direct or indirect additional cost and/or time incurred by the Contractor in connection with performance of the change work.

## Section 15.03. Minor Change Orders by District Administration.
The Board of the District has authorized the District Administrator or his/her designated representative the ability to approve minor changes or additions in the Work. This authorization allows any change or addition in the Work to be approved in writing by the District Administrator or designated representative when the extra cost to the District for any such change or addition does not exceed the amount specifically authorized by the Board.

## Section 15.04. Change Orders Regarding Time for Completion.
Any time extension authorized by the District pursuant to Article 14 hereof shall be set forth in a Change Order signed by the District.

**Section 15.05. Construction Change Directive/Directive.**  
Changes also may be made pursuant to a Directive, which shall direct a change in the Work and state a proposed basis for adjustment, if any, in the Contract Sum or Contract Time, or both. A Directive shall be used in the absence of total agreement on the terms of a Change Order, or when time does not permit processing of a Change Order prior to implementation of the change. Directives shall be approved by the District, and the Architect, but need not be signed by the Contractor. Upon receipt of a Directive, the Contractor shall promptly proceed with the change in the work involved. It is the intent of the District that all Directives will be converted to a Change Order.

When a Directive is used because time does not permit processing of a Change Order prior to implementation of the change, signature by the Contractor on the Directive constitutes its agreement with and acceptance of the adjustments in the Contract Sum and Contract Time, if any, set forth in the Directive as full and complete satisfaction of any direct or indirect additional cost and/or time incurred by the Contractor in connection with performance of the change work.

If the Contractor disagrees with the method for adjustment in the Contract Sum, the adjustment shall be determined by the District Representative on the basis of any of the methods described in Section 15.06.

**Section 15.06. Pricing of Changes.**  
If a Change Order or Directive provides for an adjustment to the Contract Sum, the adjustment shall be based on one of the following methods:

1. Mutual acceptance of a lump sum properly itemized and supported by sufficient substantiating data to permit evaluation;

2. Unit prices established in the Contract Documents or subsequently agreed upon;

3. The District Representative’s estimate of the value of the change; or

4. Time and materials, as set forth in Section 15.07 and 15.08.

**Section 15.07. Allowable Costs.**  
Allowable costs for any Change Order shall be limited to the following:

1. Costs of labor, including social security, medical and unemployment insurance, fringe benefits required pursuant to Article 7, and workers’ compensation insurance;

2. Costs of first line supervision labor, including labor burden as described in Paragraph 1. “First Line Supervision” shall mean a working foreman or lead craft worker other than the project superintendent;

3. Actual cost of the project superintendent associated with any period of compensable delay caused by issuance of the change order. In the absence of a compensable delay, all of the project superintendent’s time is considered to have been paid for as part of the Overhead;

4. Actual costs of materials, including sales tax and delivery;

5. Rental costs of machinery and equipment, exclusive of small tools, whether rented from the Contractor or others;

**FAIR OAKS RECREATION AND PARK DISTRICT**  
January 2021
<!-- Page 290 -->
6. Overhead and Profit as specified below. “Overhead” shall include the following:

   a. Preparation of all paperwork related to changes in the Work, including field review, estimating and cost breakdown; coordination and supervision, both office and field, including the project superintendent; vehicles including gas and maintenance; small tools, incidentals and consumables; engineering, detailing, and revisions to shop drawings and as-built drawings; general office and administrative expense; extended and unabsorbed home office overhead; warranty; costs of bonds, liability insurance, and all taxes; and all other expenses not specifically included in Paragraph A above.

   b. The Contractor’s combined overhead and profit for work performed by its own forces shall be fifteen percent (15%) of the costs specified in Section 15.07, paragraphs 1-5. If the changed work is performed by a Subcontractor, the Subcontractor shall be entitled to an allowance of fifteen percent (15%) of its actual labor, material and rental costs for overhead and profit. The Contractor shall be allowed to mark-up the Subcontractor's price five percent (5%) for its overhead and profit. Cumulative total markup for all tiers of contractors and subcontractors shall not exceed twenty percent (20%).

   c. If the net value of a change results in a credit from the Contractor or Subcontractor, the credit shall be the actual net cost, plus five percent (5%) for overhead and profit. When both additions and credits covering related work or substitutions are involved in any one change, the allowance for Overhead and Profit shall be figured on the basis of the net increase or decrease, if any, with respect to the change.

**Section 15.08. Time and Materials Adjustment.**

1. **Pricing and Record Keeping.** In the event that the pricing method is the time and materials method as described in Section 15.06, paragraph 3, the pricing shall be based on the time and materials and costs set forth in Section 15.07 except that time and material (T & M) labor rates shall be pre-approved by the District Representative for T & M work. The Contractor shall keep and present daily, in such form as the District Representative may prescribe, an itemized accounting together with appropriate invoices and other supporting data of the labor, materials, and equipment used during that day. All labor shall be recorded on separate time sheets clearly identified with the Directive number and scope of extra work involved. These time sheets shall be signed daily by the Project Inspector or the District Representative. No costs will be allowed for time not recorded and signed the same day the work takes place. The Contractor and the District Representative shall discuss and attempt to resolve any disputes concerning the Contractor’s daily records at the time the report is submitted.

2. **Reconciliation.** The Contractor shall, on a monthly basis accompanying the progress payment request, submit a reconciliation for all work performed under a time and materials Directive during the period of the progress payment. A final reconciliation shall be submitted within 30 days after the work of the Directive is completed. The reconciliation shall recap all costs and appropriate markups for the period. No costs will be allowed for work not included in a reconciliation within the time periods specified.

**Section 15.09. Effect on Sureties.** All changes authorized by the Contract Documents may be made without notice to or consent of the sureties on the contract bonds, and shall not reduce the sureties’ liability on the bonds.

The District reserves the right to require additional payment or performance bonds to secure a change order.

**Section 15.10. Unforeseen Site Conditions.** If this Contract requires the digging of trenches or other excavations that extend deeper than four feet below the existing surface, the following provision shall apply to those trenches or excavations:

FAIR OAKS RECREATION AND PARK DISTRICT  
January 2021
<!-- Page 291 -->
1. In the event that any of the following described conditions is suspected to exist in the trench or excavation, the Contractor shall promptly, and before the condition is disturbed, notify the District Representative, in writing within 5 working days of discovery, of any:

   a. Material that the Contractor believes may be material that is hazardous waste, as defined in Section 25117 of the Health and Safety Code, that is required to be removed to a Class I, Class II, or Class III disposal site in accordance with provisions of existing law.

   b. Subsurface or latent physical conditions at the Site differing materially from those indicated in the Contract Documents.

   c. Unknown physical conditions at the Site of any unusual nature, differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in work of the character provided for in the Contract Documents.

2. Upon receipt of notice from the Contractor, the District Representative, the District and the Architect shall promptly investigate the conditions, and if it is determined that the conditions do materially so differ or do involve hazardous waste, and cause a decrease or increase in the Contractor’s cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work shall issue a Change Order or Directive under the procedures described in the Contract Documents.

3. In the event that a dispute arises between the District and the Contractor as to whether the conditions materially differ, or involve hazardous waste, or cause a decrease or increase in the Contractor’s cost of, or time required for, performance of any part of the work, the Contractor shall not be excused from any scheduled completion date provided for by the Contract Documents, but shall proceed with all work to be performed under the Contract Documents. The Contractor shall retain any and all rights provided either by the Contract Documents or by law which pertain to the resolution of disputes and protests between the contracting parties.

4. No contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed unless the Contractor has provided the required written notice under paragraph 1. of this Section 15.10.

5. No contract adjustment will be allowed under the provisions specified in this section for any effects caused on unchanged work.

**Section 15.11. Notice of Dispute**  
If the Contractor intends to make a claim for a change in the Contract Sum or Contract Time, the Contractor must give the District Representative written notice within ten (10) days of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim. Thereafter, the Contractor may proceed with a claim as provided for in Articles 21 and 23. Failure to provide the written notice within ten (10) days of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim shall constitute a waiver by the Contractor of any claim for a change in the Contract Sum or Contract time.

# ARTICLE 16. DISTRICT'S RIGHT TO CARRY OUT THE WORK

## Section 16.01. Notice of Default; Deduction of Cost.
If the Contractor defaults or neglects to carry out the Work in accordance with the Contract Documents and fails within three (3) days after receipt of written notice from the District to commence and continue correction of the default or neglect with diligence and promptness, the District may, without prejudice to any other remedy it may have, correct the deficiencies and may further elect to complete that portion of the Work through such means as the District may select, including the use of a new contractor. In such case, an appropriate Change Order shall be issued deducting from the payments then or thereafter due the Contractor the cost of correcting the deficiencies, and any other appropriate costs, including compensation for the Architect’s, the Project Inspector’s and the District Representative’s additional services made necessary by the default, neglect or failure. If the payments then or thereafter due the Contractor are not sufficient to cover that amount, the Contractor shall pay the difference to the District.

## Section 16.02. Disputed Work.
If a dispute arises as to who is responsible for cleaning up pursuant to Section 19 or for accomplishing coordination or doing required cutting, filling, excavating or patching, the District may carry out such work and charge the cost to the responsible contractors, as the District may determine.

## Section 16.03. Assignment of Work.
The District reserves the right to perform any portion of the Project with its own forces or with other contractors as it sees fit.

# ARTICLE 17. REJECTION AND REPLACEMENT OF WORK AND MATERIALS

## Section 17.01. Rejection of Materials and Workmanship.
The District shall have the right to reject materials and workmanship which are determined by the District Representative, the Architect/Engineer, or the Project Inspector to be defective or fail to comply with the Contract Documents. Rejected workmanship shall be corrected to the satisfaction of the District and/or Architect/Engineer and rejected materials shall be removed from the premises and replaced, all without added cost to the District and/or an increase in the Contract Time.

If the Contractor does not correct such rejected work and/or materials within a reasonable time, fixed by the District Representative or the Architect/Engineer in a written notice to the Contractor, the District may correct the same and charge the expense to the Contractor, and deduct such expense from the next progress payment otherwise payable to the Contractor.

If the District determines that it is in its best interest not to correct defective workmanship and/or materials or work not done in accordance with the Contract Documents, the Contractor agrees that an equitable deduction from the Contract Sum shall be made therefore and deducted from the next progress payment otherwise payable to the Contractor.

## Section 17.02. Correction of Work.
The Contractor shall promptly correct all work rejected by the District Representative, Project Inspector or the Architect/Engineer as defective or as failing to conform to the Contract Documents, whether observed before or after final completion and whether or not fabricated, installed or completed. The Contractor shall bear all costs of correcting such rejected work including compensation for the Architect/Engineer, Project Inspector’s and the District Representative’s additional services.

If within two (2) years after the Date of Completion and acceptance of the Work or within such longer period of time as may be prescribed by law or by the terms of any applicable special warranty required by the Contract Documents, any of the Work is found to be defective or not in accordance with the Contract Documents, the Contractor shall correct any all such work, together with any other work which may be displaced in so doing, without expense to the District, promptly after receipt of a written notice from the District unless the District has previously given the Contractor a written acceptance of such condition. The District shall issue a correction notice promptly after discovering the condition. The Contractor shall notify the District upon completion of repairs. This obligation shall survive termination of the Contract with respect to work in place prior to termination.

The Contractor shall bear the cost of making good work destroyed or damaged by such correction or removal.

Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to establish a period of limitation with respect to any other obligations which the Contractor might have under the Contract Documents or by operation of law. The establishment of the time period of two (2) years after the Date of Completion, or such longer period of time as may be prescribed by law or by the terms of any warranty required by the Contract Documents, relates only to the specific obligation of the Contractor to correct the Work and has no relationship to the time within which an action may be commenced to establish the Contractor's liability with respect to its obligations other than specifically to correct the work.

**Section 18.01. Termination by the District for Convenience.**  
The District may at any time and for any reason, terminate, in whole or in part, Contractor’s Work at the District’s convenience. Termination shall be by written notice to Contractor. Upon receipt of such notice, Contractor shall, unless the notice directs otherwise, immediately discontinue Contractor’s work and the placing of orders for materials, facilities and supplies in connection therewith, and shall, if requested, make every reasonable effort to procure cancellation of all existing orders or contracts upon terms satisfactory to the District, or at the option of the District, the District shall have the right to assume those obligations directly, including all benefits to be derived therefrom. Contractor hereby assigns to the District all of its interest in said orders and/or contracts, and the assignment of said orders and/or contracts shall be effective upon notice of acceptance by the District in writing, and only as to those orders and/or contracts which the District designates in writing. Following receipt of notice of termination, Contractor shall thereafter do only such work as may be necessary to preserve and protect portions of its work already in progress and to protect materials and equipment on or in transit to the Project.

Upon such termination, Contractor shall be entitled to payment only as follows: (1) Contractor’s direct, actual cost of the Work allocable to the portion of the Work completed in conformity with the Contract, but in no event to exceed the amount of the Contract Sum allocable to the portion of the Work completed in conformity with the Contract; plus (2) previously unpaid costs of any items delivered to the Project Site which were fabricated for subsequent incorporation in the Work, but in no event to exceed the portion of the Contract Sum allocable to said items; plus (3) an allowance of ten percent (10%) of the foregoing costs for Contractor’s overhead and profit; plus (4) any proven losses with respect to materials and equipment directly resulting from the termination; plus (5) reasonable demobilization costs.

Contractor shall not be entitled to any claim or claim of lien against the District for any additional compensation or damages in the event of such termination and payment beyond that provided for in this Section.

In connection with any termination for convenience, Contractor shall allow the District, District Representative or any authorized representative(s) to inspect, audit, or reproduce any records to the extent necessary for the District or District Representative to evaluate and verify the costs incurred by Contractor in performing the Work, including direct and indirect costs such as overhead allocations. Contractor will make this material available upon 48-hours’ written notice from the District or District Representative. The District and District Representative may inspect and copy, from time to time and at reasonable times and places, any and all information, materials and data of every kind and character (hard copy, as well as computer readable data if it exists), including without limitation, books, papers, documents, subscriptions, recordings, estimates, price quotations, agreements, purchase orders, leases, contracts, commitments, arrangements, notes, daily diaries, superintendent reports, drawings, receipts, vouchers, monthly, quarterly, yearly or other financial statements, and any and all other information or documentation that may, in the judgment of the District or District Representative, have any bearing on or pertain to any matters, rights, duties, or obligations under or covered by the Contract Documents. Such records shall include but not be limited to, the following: accounting records, payroll records, job cost reports, job cost history, margin analyses, written policies and procedures, subcontract files (contracts, correspondence, change order files, including documentation covering negotiated settlements), back charge logs and supporting documentation, general ledger entries detailing cash and trade discounts earned, insurance rebates and dividends, and any other documents customarily maintained by contractors performing work on public works projects or that the District or District Representative otherwise deem necessary to substantiate charges related to a Termination.

If this Contract is terminated for default under Section 18.02 and if it is later determined that the default was wrongful, such default termination automatically shall be converted to and treated as a termination for convenience under this Section. In such event, Contractor shall be entitled to receive only the amounts payable under this Section, and Contractor specifically waives any claim for any other amounts or damages, including any claim for consequential damages or lost profits.

**Section 18.02. Termination by the District for Cause.**  
The District may terminate the Contract, pursuant to the provisions of this Article, for the following causes:

3. The Contractor or any of its Subcontractors should fail to make prompt payment to Subcontractors or material suppliers for material or for labor as required by statute.

4. The Contractor or a Subcontractor persistently disregards laws, ordinances, or the instructions of the District Representative, Architect/Engineer or the District.

5. The Contractor fails to abide by a stop work notice issued pursuant to Article 9 or fails to correct rejected work or materials as required by the District.

6. The Contractor fails to provide insurance as required by Article 3, or fails to cause all Subcontractors to do so.

7. The Contractor fails to supply a sufficient number of properly skilled workers or proper materials.

8. The Contractor commits any substantial violation of the terms and conditions of the Contract Documents which the District, in its sole discretion, finds to be a material breach of the Contract.

**Section 18.03. Procedure for Termination for Cause.**  
The District may, without prejudice to any other right or remedy, give written notice to the Contractor and its surety or sureties of its intention to terminate the Contract.

Unless within seven (7) days of the delivery of such notice, the Contractor shall cease such violation and make satisfactory arrangements for a correction thereof, which arrangements are set forth in a written agreement signed by the Contractor and the District Representative, the Contractor’s right to complete the Work shall cease and terminate.

In the event of any such termination, the District shall immediately give written notice thereof to the surety and to the Contractor and the surety shall have the rights and obligations set forth in the performance bond. If the District is forced to take over the Work, it may prosecute the same to completion by contract or by any other method it may deem advisable, for the account and at the expense of the Contractor, and the Contractor and its sureties shall be liable to the District for any excess costs, including management, supervision, and design support, occasioned thereby. In such event, the District may, without liability, take possession of and utilize in completing the Work, the Contractor’s materials whether stored at the Site or elsewhere, that are necessary for completion. Contractor hereby assigns to the District all of its interest in orders and/or contracts existing at the time of termination. The assignment of said orders and/or contracts shall be effective upon notice of acceptance by the District in writing, and only as to those orders and/or contracts which the District designates in writing. Wherever the Contractor’s right to proceed is terminated, the Contractor shall not be entitled to receive any further payment until the Work is finished and shall be liable to the District for liquidated damages for all periods.

## Section 19.01. Periodic Cleaning of Project.
The Contractor shall properly clean its work and the Site and maintain its work area in an orderly manner. The Contractor shall remove all dirt, debris, waste, rubbish, and implements of service from the Project, the adjacent sidewalks and streets, and the working area daily or as directed by the District Representative. Debris, waste, or unused construction materials shall not be left under, in, or about the Project, nor allowed to accumulate on the Site or in the working area.

1. Weekly, and more often if necessary, inspect all arrangements of materials stored on the site. Retain all stored items in an orderly arrangement allowing maximum access, not impeding drainage or traffic, and providing the required protection of materials.

2. Provide adequate storage for all items awaiting removal from the job site, observing all requirements for fire protection and protection of the ecology.

3. Daily, and more often if necessary, inspect the site and pick up all scrap, debris, and waste material. Remove all such items to the place designated for their storage.

5. At least twice each month, and more often if necessary, completely remove all scrap, debris, and waste material from the job site.

6. Weekly, and more often if necessary, sweep all interior spaces clean. “Clean” will be interpreted as meaning free from dust and other material capable of being removed by reasonable diligence using a hand-held broom.

7. As required preparatory to installation of succeeding material, clean the structures or pertinent portions thereof to the degree of cleanliness recommended by the manufacturer of the succeeding material.

8. Following the installation of finish floor materials, clean the finish floor daily (and more often if necessary) at all times while work is being performed in the space in which finish materials have been installed. “Clean” will be interpreted as meaning free from all foreign material which may be injurious to the finish floor material.

The Contractor, at its sole cost, shall contract with a disposal company to remove all rubbish, and shall have the refuse containers emptied at frequent enough intervals so that waste does not overflow the containers.

If the Contractor fails to clean up during progress or upon completion of the Work, the District may, at the Contractor’s expense, do so as provided in Article 16.

## Section 19.02. Final Cleaning of Project.
At completion of the Work and prior to final acceptance/inspection and occupancy by the District, the Contractor shall thoroughly clean the interior and exterior of the buildings, and the Site and adjacent areas, of all material related to its performance of the Work. In the event the Contractor fails to do so, the District may cause this work to be done at the Contractor’s expense, as provided in Article 16. The following list is not inclusive but to act as a guideline:

1. Removal of all spots, stains, paint spots, rubbish, debris, tools, equipment, trade markings and labels, and accumulated dust and dirt from all areas and broom clean. Steam-clean all carpets and mop floors.

# ARTICLE 20. COMPLETION, INSPECTION, AND OCCUPANCY BY DISTRICT

## Section 20.01. Notice of Punch List Inspection.
When the Contractor believes that a phase of its Work is complete, it shall request in writing a punch list inspection in the form provided by the District. Within five (5) days of the receipt of such request, the District Representative, the Project Inspector and the Architect/Engineer shall make a punch list inspection or inform the Contractor that the work is not ready for punch list inspection; upon completion of the deficient work, the Contractor shall again request a punch list inspection. The Contractor or its representatives shall be present at the punch list inspection. The purpose of the punch list inspection is to determine whether the Work has been completed in accordance with the Contract Documents, including all Change Orders, all interpretations and instructions previously issued.

If the Contractor requests a punch list inspection when the Work is not ready for the inspection, the Contractor shall pay all costs associated with the inspection.

If Contractor fails to attend any punch list inspection, the Contractor shall be charged for the cost of the District Representative, Architect/Engineer, the Project Inspector, and other design professionals who attended the punch list inspection.

Completion of any phase of the Work does not result in final completion, or in any way alter the payment provisions after final completion.

## Section 20.02. Punch List.
The District Representative, the Project Inspector and the Architect/Engineer shall notify the Contractor in writing of any deficiencies to be remedied prior to final acceptance, by preparing a written list, known in the industry as a punch list.

The Contractor shall remedy all items shown on the punch list prior to final acceptance by the District Representative, the Project Inspector and the Architect/Engineer.

No one is authorized to amend the Contract Documents by use of the punch list; it is provided solely for the benefit of the Contractor to enable it to determine what items must be corrected before final acceptance will be recommended by the District Representative, the Project Inspector and the Architect/Engineer. The District reserves the right to require compliance with the Contract Documents, notwithstanding the issuance of a punch list or the completion by the Contractor of all items on the punch list.

In the event that the Work still does not comply with the Contract Documents, the District reserves the right to issue such further punch lists as may be required, or to deduct from the final payment the cost of correcting any work not completed in accordance with the Contract Documents, but accepted by the District, without the issuance of further punch lists.

If punch list work needs to be performed after the District has taken occupancy of a phase, the work shall be conducted at the direction of the District Representative.

## Section 20.03. Use of Work Prior to Acceptance.
Whenever, in the opinion of the District, the Work or any part thereof, is in a condition suitable for use, and the best interests of the District require such use, the District may take possession of, connect to, and open for public or District use that portion of the Work. Contractor acknowledges and agrees such occupancy and/or use does not constitute acceptance or completion as defined by California Civil Code section 9200.

## Section 20.04. Repairs or Renewal in the Work.

Prior to the Date of Completion, the Contractor shall make all repairs or renewals in the portion of the Work occupied pursuant to Section 20.03 made necessary due to defective material or workmanship, or the operations of the Contractor, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

**Section 20.05. Effect of Occupancy.**  
The District’s occupancy as contemplated in this Article shall not constitute acceptance by the District of the Work or any part thereof. Such use shall neither relieve the Contractor of any of its responsibilities under the Contract Documents, nor act as a waiver by the District of any of the terms or conditions of the Contract Documents. Any damage done by the District is the responsibility of the District. Contractor acknowledges and agrees that any occupancy and/or use of all or any portion of the work of improvement does not constitute acceptance or completion within the meaning of California Civil Code section 9200.

**Section 20.06. Coordination with Other Activities.**  
The Contractor shall conduct its operations so as not to interfere unreasonably with the District’s use of the occupied portions of the Site. The Contractor shall submit periodic schedules to the District Representative proposing the times, areas, and types of work to be done within such areas.

If the Work produces conditions rendering the occupied portions of building, the Site, or other areas uninhabitable, either because of noise, dust, vibration, smoke, fumes, or for any other cause whatsoever, the District Representative may suspend the Work or direct the Contractor to modify the Contract Schedule, and the Contractor shall comply.

Except as provided by Change Order, the Contractor shall not be entitled to a time extension or increase in the Contract Sum by virtue of conflicts between the Contractor’s work and the District’s occupancy.

**Section 21.04. Protest of the District Representative’s Estimate; Claims.**  
If the Contractor contests the estimate of sums due prepared by the District Representative, the Contractor may file a claim in writing with the District Representative pursuant to the requirements of Article 23 and setting forth in detail all grounds alleged by the Contractor to justify an adjustment to the District Representative’s estimate. The Contractor’s claim shall be certified under penalty of perjury and in compliance with the California False Claims Act. Failure to include these required certifications will constitute grounds for immediate rejection of the claim.

Failure to file a timely claim shall constitute a waiver and acceptance by the Contractor of the District Representative’s estimate, which shall then become final and be forwarded to the District for approval of payment.

**Section 21.05. Completion; Acceptance of Contract; Notice of Completion.**  
The Contractor acknowledges and agrees that completion shall mean the Contractor’s complete performance of all Work required by the Contract Documents, amendments, Change Orders, Construction Change Directives and punch lists, and the District’s formal acceptance of the Work, without regard to prior occupancy, substantial completion doctrine, beneficial occupancy or otherwise.

Acceptance of the Work shall be made only by formal acceptance by the District. Recordation of a Notice of Completion shall be in the manner prescribed by law, provided that the Work shall then be fully and satisfactorily completed and the provisions of the Contract Documents fully and satisfactorily performed in all respects.

**Section 21.06. Approval of Final Payment.**  
Following acceptance of the Work, the District shall authorize final payment to the Contractor of the undisputed sums found due, subject to retainers for stop notices as provided in Section 21.07 below.

**Section 21.07. Withholding for Stop Notices.**  
The District may, in its sole discretion, and at any time, withhold from the Contractor any unpaid claims alleged in Stop Notices filed pursuant to the California Civil Code. The District reserves all remedies it may have in the event of a stop notice dispute. The basic standard to determine a sufficient withholding in the event of a Stop Notice shall be one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the total of all stop notices filed; provided, however, the District reserves the right to withhold different or greater sums in its discretion.

**Section 21.08. Non-Waiver.**  
Neither acceptance of, nor payment for, the Work or any part thereof, nor any extension of time, nor any possession taken by District shall operate as a waiver of any of the provisions of this Contract, nor shall a waiver of any breach of this Contract be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. In addition, recordation of a Notice of Completion shall not be deemed an acceptance of latent defects, nor shall it constitute a waiver of any of the provisions of this agreement.

In addition to any guarantees required elsewhere by the Contract Documents, the Contractor shall guarantee the Work for a minimum of one (1) year from and after the recordation of the Notice of Completion and completion of all contract obligations by the Contractor, including formal acceptance of the entire Project by the District. The Contractor specifically waives any right to claim or rely on the statutory definition of completion set forth in Civil Code section 9200.

**ARTICLE 23. CLAIM REQUIREMENTS**

Claims shall be subject to the requirements of Public Contract Code sections 20104 et seq. and 9204. A summary of those provisions is set forth below. A waiver of the rights granted by the referenced statutes is void and contrary to public policy, provided, however, that (1) upon receipt of a Claim, the parties may mutually agree to waive, in writing, mediation and proceed directly to the commencement of a civil action or binding arbitration, as applicable; and (2) the District may prescribe reasonable change order, claim, and dispute resolution procedures and requirements in addition to the statutory requirements, so long as the contractual provisions do not conflict with or otherwise impair the statutory timeframes and procedures. To the extent that the summary below is inconsistent with any requirement of those statutes, the statutes shall control. The terms below are intended to be consistent with the governing statutes, and any modifications shall be understood as lawful modifications or additions to the statutory requirements if at all possible.

The written Notice of Potential Claim shall set forth the reasons for which the Contractor believes adjustment to the Contract Price or Contract Time will or may be due, the nature of the costs and/or time involved, and, insofar as possible, the amount of the potential claim. The Notice shall be submitted as soon as practical, but no more than five (5) working days after the discovery of any facts or event that does or may give rise to the claim, unless a different period for notice is specified in the Contract Documents. **Failure to timely submit the Notice of Potential Claim constitutes acknowledgement that the condition(s), fact(s), occurrence(s) or event(s) did not cause any increase in cost or time to perform and waives any Claim that the Contractor otherwise may have had the right to submit based on condition(s), fact(s), occurrence(s) or event(s).**

**Section 23.02. Definitions.**  
“Claim” means a separate demand by Contractor sent by registered mail or certified mail with return receipt requested, for one or more of the following:

23.03.05  
Any payment due on an undisputed portion of the Claim shall be processed and made within 60 days after the District issues its written statement. The District shall not fail to pay money as to any portion of a claim which is undisputed except as otherwise provided in the Contract.

23.03.06  
If the claimant disputes the District’s written response, or the District fails to respond within the time prescribed, the Contractor may notify the District, in writing, either within 15 days of receipt of the District’s response or within 15 days of the District’s failure to respond within the time prescribed, respectively, and demand an informal conference to meet and confer for settlement of the issues in dispute. Upon receipt of a demand, sent by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, the District shall schedule a meet and confer conference within 30 days for settlement of the dispute.

23.03.07  
Within 10 business days following the conclusion of the meet and confer conference, if the Claim or any portion of the Claim remains in dispute, then the District shall provide the Contractor a written statement identifying the portion of the Claim that remains in dispute and the portion that is undisputed. Failure by the District to provide the written statement within the time periods described herein shall result in the remaining Claim issues being deemed rejected in their entirety. Denial by failure of the District to respond shall not constitute an adverse finding with regard to the merits of the remaining Claim issues or the responsibility or qualifications of the claimant. Any payment due on an undisputed portion of a Claim shall be processed and made within 60 days after the District issues its written statement.

Any remaining disputed portion of the Claim following the meet and confer conference shall be submitted to nonbinding mediation, with the District and the Contractor sharing the associated costs equally. The District and Contractor shall mutually agree to a mediator within 10 business days after the disputed portion of the Claim has been identified in writing. If the parties cannot agree upon a mediator, each party shall select a mediator and those mediators shall select a qualified neutral third party to mediate with regard to the disputed portion of the Claim. Each party shall bear the fees and costs charged by its respective mediator in connection with the selection of the neutral mediator. Unless otherwise agreed to by the District and the Contractor in writing, the mediation conducted pursuant to this section shall excuse any further obligation under Public Contract Code Section 20104.4 to mediate after litigation has been commenced. This Section does not preclude arbitration if mediation under this Section does not resolve the parties’ dispute.

23.03.09  
If mediation is unsuccessful, then the Contractor may file a claim as provided in Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 900) and Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 910) of Part 3 of Division 3.6 of Title 1 of the Government Code with respect to the parts of the Claim remaining in dispute. For purposes of those provisions, the running of the period of time within which a claim must be filed shall be tolled from the time the Contractor submits his or her written Claim pursuant to Section 23.03.01 until the time that mediation of disputed portions of that Claim is completed. This Section does not apply to tort claims, and nothing in this Section is intended nor shall be construed to change the time periods for filing tort claims or actions specified by Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 900) and Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 910) of Part 3 of Division 3.6 of Title 1 of the Government Code.

(a) The case shall be submitted to judicial arbitration pursuant to Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 1141.10) of Title 3 of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, notwithstanding Section 1141.11 of that code. The Civil Discovery Act (Title 4 (commencing with Section 2016.010) of Part 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure) shall apply to any such proceeding, consistent with the rules pertaining to judicial arbitration.

The parties stipulate that the arbitrator shall be experienced in construction law and shall be paid necessary and reasonable hourly rates of pay not to exceed their customary rate, and such fees and expenses shall be paid equally by the parties, except in the case of arbitration where the arbitrator, for good cause, determines a different division. In no event shall these fees or expenses be paid by state or county funds.

In addition to Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 1141.10) of Title 3 of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, any party who, after receiving an arbitration award, requests a trial de novo but does not obtain a more favorable judgment shall, in addition to payment of costs and fees under that chapter, pay the attorneys’ fees of the other party arising out of trial de novo.

The court may, upon request by any party, order any witness to participate in arbitration process.

In any suit filed under Public Contract Code Section 20104.4, the District shall pay interest at the legal rate on any arbitration award or judgment. The interest shall begin to accrue on the date the suit is filed in a court of law.

Submission by Contractor of any claim (as the term "claim" is defined in False Claims Act) to the District in connection with the Project, whether on its behalf or on behalf of a Subcontractor or material supplier, shall constitute a representation by Contractor to the District that submission of the claim does not in any respect, violate the False Claims Act. Any party with an interest in the claim, including Contractor and any Subcontractor or material supplier, shall certify under penalty of perjury the validity and accuracy of any claim submitted to the District, as provided below. Compliance with this claim certification requirement shall be a condition precedent to any obligation District might otherwise have to review the claim, and failure to provide such certification shall constitute a waiver of the claim.

The claim certification required by this section shall provide as follows:

**CLAIM CERTIFICATION**  
Under penalty of perjury, and with specific reference to the California False Claims Act, Government Code sections 12650 et seq., I certify that submission of the attached claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data prepared by the undersigned company are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that submission of the claim to the District does not violate the False Claims Act; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the claimant.

Procore is renewed annually (on 4/6) and is based on total volume expected for the year, but is not audited for a credit if we do less than the amount estimated. The project has now entered a new billing cycle for the software since the project was to be done prior to 4/6/24 and its remaining cost had to be factored into the renewal.

**Notes:**
1. Insert Contractor's basic hourly rate, health & welfare, pension, vacation/holiday and other payments in columns "D" to "H", then add training to column "J". Subtotal straight and overtime hourly rates will be calculated at column "K" which includes "Fringes Benefits". Please note that ONLY "basic hourly rates" will change for over time and all other "Fringe Benefits" remain the same as straight hourly rates.
2. Insert Contractor's workman compensation rate at lower section of columns "N" where shows "0.00%" for each contractor/trade. Total hourly rate including "Fringes Benefits" and all "Burden" will be calculated at column "R". Since "Burden" are percentages of the "subtotal straight/NOT hourly rates" they will increase for over time rates and will be calculated automatically by the spreadsheet.

Subject: RE: VPR Calendar Overhead  

Good morning guys  

Sorry for the delayed response. The daily rate looks acceptable. We appreciate the efforts by Bobo on this rate.  

Please prep and send a revised PCO reflecting this rate ($2,257/day). **If Bobo would consider that 14 to 21 calendar days (10 to 15 work days) should have been anticipated for typical weather during the year**, which would have been non-compensable, it would go a long way towards resolving the amount(s) presented to the Board.  

Once we receive the revised PCO, I will have discussions with FORPD and push to resolve.  

Thanks,

Subject: VPR Calendar Overhead  

Hey Dave,  

Went through and fine tuned the calendar day overhead amounts and here is what I have come up with based on the records I have. I can provide backup for these numbers and will but wanted to run it by you first before I started compiling all the information.  

Thanks,

### Engineer’s Report, Fiscal Year 2024-25

## Assessment Background
Prior to fiscal year 2000-01, the Park District experienced a revenue shortfall that was primarily due to escalating costs and limited revenues from other sources. In fact, in order to provide an acceptable level of park maintenance, the Park District had funded its revenue shortfall with reserve funds. Therefore, in absence of a new local revenue source, the baseline level of park and recreation facilities in the Park District would be a deteriorating level of maintenance and upkeep of the park and recreation facilities and properties listed above.

Due to this revenue shortfall and a lack of funding for capital improvement projects, in 2000 the Park District decided to ask property owners if they would support a special assessment for park maintenance and improvement. The Assessments fund a portion of the costs of the improvements and services described below that are provided throughout the Park District, extending above and beyond the baseline level of service and the likely elimination of services that would have been projected for future years in the Park District, absent the Assessments.

## Assessment Process
In February and March of 2000, the Park District conducted an assessment ballot proceeding pursuant to the requirements of Article XIIID of the California Constitution ("The Taxpayer's Right to Vote on Taxes Act") and the Landscaping the Lighting Act of 1972. During this ballot proceeding, property owners in the Park District were provided with a notice and ballot for the proposed "Parks Maintenance and Recreation Improvement District" or the “Improvement District.” A 45-day period was provided for balloting and a public hearing was conducted on March 23, 2000. At the public hearing, all ballots returned within the 45-day balloting period were tabulated.

It was determined at the public hearing that the assessment ballots submitted in opposition to the proposed assessments did not exceed the assessment ballots submitted in favor of the assessments (with each ballot weighted by the proportional financial obligation of the property for which ballot was submitted). The final balloting result was 58.1% weighted support from ballots returned.

As a result, the Board gained the authority to approve the levy of the assessments for fiscal year 2000-01 and to continue to levy them in future years. The authority granted by the ballot proceeding was for a maximum assessment rate of $24 per single family home per year, increased each subsequent year by the Bay Area CPI (consumer price index) not to exceed 3% per annum. In the event that the annual change in the CPI exceeds 3%, any percentage change in excess of 3% can be cumulatively reserved and can be added to the annual change in the CPI for years in which the CPI change is less than 3%.

# Engineer’s Report and Continuation of Assessments

In each subsequent year for which the assessments will be continued, the Board must direct the preparation of an Engineer's Report, budgets and proposed assessments for the upcoming fiscal year. After the Engineer's Report is completed, the Board may preliminarily approve the Engineer's Report and proposed assessments and establish the date for a public hearing on the continuation of the assessments. This Report was prepared pursuant to the direction of the Board on March 20, 2024 by Resolution No. 032024-01.

This Engineer’s Report ("Report") was prepared to establish the budget for the continued improvements and services (“Improvements”) that would be funded by the proposed 2024-25 assessments and other revenue, determine the special benefits received by property from the Improvements and services within the Park District, and the method of assessment apportionment to lots and parcels within the Park District. Including the authorized annual adjustments, the maximum authorized assessment rate for fiscal year 2024-25 is $45.28 per benefit unit. This Report and the proposed assessments have been made pursuant to the Landscaping and Lighting Act of 1972, Part 2 of Division 15 of the California Streets and Highways Code (the "Act") and Article XIIID of the California Constitution (the “Article”).

If the Board approves this Report and the continuation of the assessments by resolution, a notice of public hearing must be published in a local paper at least 10 days prior to the date of the public hearing. The resolution preliminarily approving the Report and establishing the date for a public hearing is used for this notice.

Following the minimum 10-day time period after publishing the notice, a public hearing is held for the purpose of allowing public testimony about the proposed continuation of the assessments. This hearing is currently scheduled for July 17, 2024. At this hearing, the Board would consider approval of a resolution confirming the continuation of the assessments for fiscal year 2024-25. If so confirmed and approved, the assessments would be submitted to the County Auditor/Controller for inclusion on the property tax rolls for Fiscal Year 2024-25.

## Legal Analysis

### Proposition 218

This assessment is formed consistent with Proposition 218, The Right to Vote on Taxes Act, which was approved by the voters of California on November 6, 1996, and is now codified as Articles XIIIC and XIIID of the California Constitution. Proposition 218 provides for benefit assessments to be levied to fund the cost of providing services, improvements, as well as maintenance and operation expenses to a public improvement which specially benefits the assessed property.

![Page 4](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+4)

Proposition 218 describes a number of important requirements, including property-owner balloting, for the imposition, increase and extension of assessments, and these requirements are satisfied by the process used to establish this assessment.

**Silicon Valley Taxpayers Association, Inc. v Santa Clara County Open Space Authority**

In July of 2008, the California Supreme Court issued its ruling on the Silicon Valley Taxpayers Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority (“SVTA”). This ruling is the most significant legal document in further legally clarifying Proposition 218. Several of the most important elements of the ruling included further emphasis that:
- Benefit assessments are for special, not general, benefit
- The services and/or improvements funded by assessments must be clearly defined
- Special benefits are directly received by and provide a direct advantage to property in the Improvement District
- The assessment paid by property should be proportional to the special benefits it receives from the Improvements

This Report has been re-evaluated in light of the SVTA decision and updated to be consistent with the decision. There have been a number of clarifications made to the analysis, findings and supporting text to ensure that the assessment complies with Proposition 218 as construed by SVTA.

**Dahms v. Downtown Pomona Property**

On June 8, 2009, the 4th Court of Appeals approved a benefit assessment for property in the downtown area of the City of Pomona in Dahms v. Downtown Pomona Property (“Dahms”). In Dahms the Court upheld an assessment that was 100% special benefit (i.e. 0% general benefit) on the rationale that the services and improvements funded by the assessments were directly provided only to property in the assessment district. The Court also upheld discounts and exemptions from the assessment for certain properties.

**Bonander v. Town of Tiburon**

On December 31, 2009, in Bonander v. Town of Tiburon (“Bonander”), the Court of Appeal overturned a benefit assessment approved by property owners to pay for placing overhead utility lines underground in an area of the Town of Tiburon. The Court invalidated the assessments primarily on the grounds that the assessments had been apportioned to assessed property based on the costs within sub-areas of the assessment district instead of the overall cost of the improvements and the overall proportional special benefits.

**Beutz v. County of Riverside**  
On May 26, 2010 the Court of Appeals overturned an assessment for park maintenance in Wildomar, California, primarily because the general benefits associated with improvements and services were not explicitly calculated, quantified and separated from the special benefits.

**Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego**  
On September 22, 2011, the Court of Appeal issued a decision on the Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego (“Greater Golden Hill”). This decision overturned an assessment for street and landscaping maintenance in the Greater Golden Hill neighborhood of San Diego, California. The court described two primary reasons for its decision. First, like in Beutz, the court found the general benefits associated with services were not explicitly calculated, quantified and separated from the special benefits. Second, the court found that the City had failed to record the basis for the calculation of the assessment amount on city-owned parcels.

**Compliance with Current Law**  
This Report is consistent with the SVTA decision and with the requirements of Article XIIIC and XIIID of the California Constitution because the Improvements to be funded are clearly defined; the benefiting property in the Improvement District enjoys close and unique proximity, access and views to the Improvements; the Improvements serve as an extension of usable land area for benefiting properties in the Improvement District and such special benefits provide a direct advantage to property in the Improvement District that is not enjoyed by the public at large or other property.

This Report is consistent with Beutz, Dahms and Greater Golden Hill because, the improvements will directly benefit property in the Improvement District, and the general benefits have been explicitly calculated and quantified and excluded from the Assessments. The Report is consistent with Bonander because the Assessments have been apportioned based on the overall cost of the Improvements and proportional special benefit to each property.

# Estimate of Cost and Budget – Fiscal Year 2024-25

## Introduction
The Act requires the Report to estimate the costs of the Improvements for the fiscal year, including estimates for the total costs for the Improvements for the year, the amount of any surplus or deficit to be carried over from a previous fiscal year, and the amount of funding contributions made from sources other than assessment revenue. After determining these amounts, the Report then must calculate the net amount to be assessed upon assessable lands within the District.

## Estimate of Annual Cost of Improvements
The budget to be financed by the assessments is based on the original Report, which was partially based on the results of an independent survey conducted for the District, which indicated property owners’ priorities for various improvement projects and park maintenance services. The annual Park District budget sets forth the particular scope of Improvements for the fiscal year, including both operation/maintenance work and capital improvement projects. Work and projects are included throughout the Park District in order to ensure that all properties in the Park District boundaries will receive special benefit from better maintained and improved parks and facilities in their area. The budget and capital improvement plan includes projects that will improve park and open space security by enhancing lighting; replace outdated playground equipment; enhanced maintenance of all parks and recreation areas to help ensure the continued beauty, usability, and accessibility of the Park District’s parks, playfields, and recreation areas; develop playfields and youth oriented activity areas on undeveloped land owned by the Park District.

1. The item Installation, Maintenance, Servicing and Administration would provide funding for enhanced maintenance of all parks and recreation facilities on a daily basis, seven days per week. Improvements would include mowing turf, trimming and caring for landscaping, fertilization and aeration of grounds and playfields, routine maintenance and safety inspections, painting, replacing/repairing broken or damaged equipment, trash removal and cleanup, irrigation and irrigation system maintenance, and other services as needed.

2. As determined in the following section, at least 41% of the cost of Improvements must be funded from sources other than the assessments to cover any general benefits from the Improvements. Therefore, out of the total cost of Improvements of $4,303,180 the District must contribute at least 41% or $1,764,304 from sources other than the assessments. The District will actually contribute $3,675,293 which is over 85%, and more than covers any general benefits from the Improvements.

3. The Act requires that proceeds from the assessments must be deposited into a special fund that has been set up for the revenues and expenditures of the Improvement District. Moreover, funds raised by the assessment shall be used only for the purposes stated within this Report. Any balance remaining at the end of the fiscal year, July 1, must be carried over to the next fiscal year. The Park District may also establish a reserve fund for contingencies and special projects as well as a capital improvement fund for accumulating funds for larger capital improvement projects or capital renovation needs. Any remaining balance would either be placed in the reserve fund, the capital improvement fund, or would be used to reduce future years' assessments.

4. All assessment amounts are rounded to the lower even penny per the requirements of the County.

# Method of Apportionment

## Method of Apportionment

This section of the Report explains the benefits to be derived from the Improvements to park facilities and District property throughout the Park District, and the methodology used to apportion the total assessment to properties within the Improvement District.

The Improvement District consists of all Assessor Parcels within the boundaries of the Park District. The method used for apportioning the assessment is based upon the proportional special benefits conferred to the properties over and above the general benefits conferred to real property in the Improvement District or to the public at large. Special benefit is calculated for each parcel in the Improvement District using the following process:

1. Identification of all benefit factors derived from the Improvements
2. Calculation of the proportion of these benefits that are general
3. Determination of the relative special benefit within different areas within the Improvement District
4. Determination of the relative special benefit per property type
5. Calculation of the specific assessment for each individual parcel based upon special vs. general benefit; location, property type, property characteristics, improvements on property and other supporting attributes

## Discussion of Benefit

In summary, the assessments can only be levied based on the special benefit to property. Any and all general benefit, including benefit that is indirect or derivative, must be funded from another source. This special benefit is received by property over and above any general benefits from the Improvements. With reference to the requirements for assessments, Section 22573 of the Landscaping and Lighting Act of 1972 states:

"The net amount to be assessed upon lands within an assessment district may be apportioned by any formula or method which fairly distributes the net amount among all assessable lots or parcels in proportion to the estimated benefits to be received by each such lot or parcel from the improvements."

Proposition 218, as codified in Article XIIID of the California Constitution, has confirmed that assessments must be based on the special benefit to property:

"No assessment shall be imposed on any parcel which exceeds the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit conferred on that parcel."

Since assessments are levied on the basis of special benefit, they are not a tax and are not governed by Article XIII A of the California Constitution.

The SVTA decision also clarifies that a special benefit is a service or improvement that provides a direct advantage to a parcel and that indirect or derivative advantages resulting from the overall public benefits from a service or improvement are general benefits. The SVTA decision also provides specific guidance that park improvements are a direct advantage and special benefit to property that is proximate to a park that is improved by an assessment:

The characterization of a benefit may depend on whether the parcel receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g. proximity to a park) or receives an indirect, derivative advantage resulting from the overall public benefits of the improvement (e.g. general enhancement of the district’s property values).

Finally, Proposition 218 twice uses the phrase “over and above” general benefits in describing special benefit (Art. XIIID, sections 2(i) and 4(f)). The SVTA decision further clarifies that special benefits must provide a direct advantage to benefiting property and that proximity to a park is an example of a special benefit.

## Benefit Factors

The special benefits from the Improvements are listed below:

### Extension of a property’s outdoor areas and green spaces for properties within close proximity to the Improvements

In large part because it is cost prohibitive to provide large open land areas on property in the Improvement District, the residential, commercial and other benefiting properties in the Improvement District do not have large outdoor areas and green spaces. The parks in the Improvement District provide these larger outdoor areas that serve as an effective extension of the land area for proximate properties because the Improvements are uniquely proximate and accessible to property in close proximity to the Improvements. The Improvements, therefore, provide an important, valuable and desirable extension of usable land area for the direct advantage and special benefit of properties with good and close proximity to the Improvements.

According to the industry-standard guidelines established by the National Park and Recreation Association (the “NPRA”), neighborhood parks in urban areas have a service area radius of generally one-half mile and community parks have a service area radius of approximately two miles. The service radii for neighborhood parks and neighborhood green spaces were specifically established to give all properties within these service radii close proximity and easy walking access to such public land areas. Since proximate and accessible parks serve as an extension of the usable land area for property in the service radii and since the service radii was specifically designed to provide close proximity and access, the parcels within this service area clearly receive a direct advantage and special benefit from the Improvements, and this advantage is not received by other properties or the public at large.

An analysis of the service radii for the Improvements finds that all properties in the Improvement District enjoy the distinct and direct advantage of being close and proximate to one or often multiple parks within the Improvement District. The benefiting properties in the Improvement District therefore uniquely and specially benefit from the Improvements.

**Proximity to improved parks and recreational facilities**

Only the specific properties within close proximity to the Improvements are included in the Improvement District. Therefore, property in the Improvement District enjoys unique and valuable proximity and access to the Improvements that the public at large and property outside the Improvement District do not share.

In absence of the assessments, the Improvements would not be provided and the parks and recreation areas in the Improvement District would be degraded due to insufficient funding for maintenance, upkeep and repair. Therefore, the assessments provide Improvements that are over and above what otherwise would be provided. Improvements that are over and above what otherwise would be provided do not by themselves translate into special benefits but when combined with the unique proximity and access enjoyed by parcels in the Improvement District, they provide a direct advantage and special benefit to property in the Improvement District.

**Access to improved parks, open space and recreational areas**

Since the parcels in the Improvement District are nearly the only parcels that enjoy close access to the Improvements, they directly benefit from the unique close access to improved parks, open space and recreation areas that are provided by the Assessments. This is a direct advantage and special benefit to property in the Improvement District.

**Improved Views**  
The Park District, by maintaining and improving the landscaping at its park and recreation facilities provides improved views to properties within close proximity and access to the Improvements. Properties in the Improvement District receive this direct advantage because they enjoy unique proximity and access to views of the Improvements. Therefore, the improved and protected views provided by the Assessments are another direct and tangible advantage that is uniquely conferred upon property in the Improvement District.

**Benefit Finding**  
In summary, real property located within the boundaries of the Improvement District distinctly and directly benefits from closer proximity, access and views of improved parks, recreation facilities, open space, landscaped corridors, and other public resources funded by the Assessments. The Improvements are specifically designed to serve local properties in the Improvement District, not other properties or the public at large. The public at large and other properties outside the Improvement District receive only limited benefits from the Improvements because they do not have proximity, good access or views of the Improvements. These are special benefits to property in the Improvement District in much the same way that sewer and water facilities, sidewalks and paved streets enhance the utility and desirability of property and make them more functional to use, safer and easier to access.

**General versus Special Benefit**  
Article XIIIC of the California Constitution requires any local agency proposing to increase or impose a benefit assessment to “separate the general benefits from the special benefits conferred on a parcel.” The rationale for separating special and general benefits is to ensure that property owners subject to the benefit assessment are not paying for general benefits. The assessment can fund special benefits but cannot fund general benefits. Accordingly, a separate estimate of the special and general benefit is given in this section.

In other words:

Total Benefit = General Benefit + Special Benefit

There is no widely-accepted or statutory formula for determining general benefit. General benefits are benefits from improvements or services that are not special in nature, are not “particular and distinct” and are not “over and above” benefits received by other properties. SVTA provides some clarification by indicating that general benefits provide “an indirect, derivative advantage” and are not necessarily proximate to the improvements.

In light of Beutz v. County of Riverside (2010) and Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. Park District of San Diego (2011), the Park District has reevaluated the Proposition 218 requirement regarding special and general benefits. Proposition 218 requires an assessing agency to separate the general benefits from the special benefits of a public improvement or service, estimate the quantity of each in relation to the other, and limit the assessment amount to the portion of the improvement or service costs attributable to the special benefits. The courts in Golden Hill and Beutz determined that there usually will be some general benefit associated with a parks improvement project and park-related services because residents and others who don’t reside in the assessment district will use the parks at least to some degree. The separation and quantification of general and special benefits requires an apportionment of the cost of the service or improvement between the two benefit types and assessing assessment district property owners only for the portion of the cost representing special benefits to the assessment district property.

General benefits cannot be funded by assessment revenue. Rather, the funding must come from other sources. The Park District therefore has analyzed the quantity or extent to which the general public may reasonably be expected to use or benefit from the Park District parks and facilities in relation to the quantity or extent to which residents of the assessment district use and benefit from the parks and facilities.

In contrast to general benefit, special benefit is defined in the state constitution as “a particular and distinct benefit over and above general benefits conferred on real property located in the district or to the public at large.” The SVTA decision indicates that a special benefit is conferred to a property if it “receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g., proximity to a park).” In this assessment, as noted, properties in the Improvement District have close and unique proximity, views and access to the Improvements and uniquely improved desirability from the Improvements and other properties and the public at large do not receive significant benefits because they do not have proximity, access or views of the Improvements. Therefore, the majority of the benefits conferred to property is special, and a lesser benefit is received by property outside the Improvement District or the public at large.

**Calculating General Benefit**

In this section, the general benefit is conservatively estimated and described, and then budgeted so that it is funded by sources other than the assessment. In analyzing general benefit, the District has focused on the benefits from the Improvements to property outside the Improvement District and to the public at large.

**Benefit to Property Outside the Improvement District**

Properties within the Improvement District receive almost all of the special benefits from the Improvements because properties in the Improvement District enjoy unique close proximity and access to the Improvements that is not enjoyed by other properties or the public at large. However, certain properties within the proximity/access radius of the Improvements, but outside of the boundaries of the Improvement District, may receive some benefit from the Improvements. Since this benefit is conferred to properties outside the Improvement District boundaries, it contributes to the overall general benefit calculation and will not be funded by the Assessments.

The properties outside the Improvement District and within the proximity radii for neighborhood parks in the Improvement District receive benefits from the Improvements. Since these properties are not assessed for their benefits because they are outside of the area that can be assessed by the District, this is a form of general benefit to the public at large and other property. A 50% reduction factor is applied to these properties because they are all on only one side of the Improvements and properties in the Improvement District enjoy the advantage of over twice the average proximity to the Improvements. The general benefit to property outside of the Improvement District is calculated as follows with the parcel and data analysis performed by the assessment engineer.

**Assumptions:**

- 1,267 parcels outside the District but within 0.5 miles of a park within the Improvement District
- 12,500 parcels in the Improvement District
- 50% relative benefit compared to property within the Improvement District

**Calculation of General Benefit to Property Outside the Improvement District:**

1,267 / (12,500 + 1,267) * 0.5 = 4.6%

Although it can reasonably be argued that Improvements inside, but near the Park District boundaries are offset by similar park and recreational improvements provided outside, but near the Park District’s boundaries, we use the more conservative approach of finding that 4.6% of the Improvements are of general benefit to property outside the Improvement District.

## Benefit To The Public At Large

Without data concerning all users of the Park District parks, facilities and programs (which is unavailable and too difficult and costly to obtain), it is difficult to determine the general benefit to the public at large. As one measure, the general benefit to the public can be estimated by the proportionate resident versus non-resident usage of the principal Park District programs. In the re-analysis of general benefit, the Park District staff evaluated available registration data. The Park District’s parks and facilities are used regularly for recreation classes, lacrosse, Little League baseball, tennis, softball and basketball. These are some of the primary and most popular programs of the Park District and they provide a good representative sampling of parks and facilities usage. For each of these programs, the Park District maintains or has access to participant registration data, which includes each participant’s residence address. Park District staff has evaluated that data in order to determine which participants reside within the Improvement District boundaries and which reside outside the Improvement District. This evaluation results in the following proportion of recent resident and non-resident usage:

| Park Activities         | Number of Participants | Percentage of Resident Participants | Percentage of Non-Resident Participants |
|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Class Registrations     | 4,760                 | 56%                                | 44%                                    |
| Soccer                  | 1,100                 | 75%                                | 25%                                    |
| FO LaCrosse            | 75                    | 75%                                | 25%                                    |
| BV LaCrosse            | 60                    | 65%                                | 35%                                    |
| Little League          | 500                   | 70%                                | 30%                                    |
| Racquet Club           | 30                    | 80%                                | 20%                                    |
| Adult Softball         | 2,900                 | 20%                                | 80%                                    |
| Adult Basketball       | 250                   | 30%                                | 70%                                    |
| **Average Participants**|                       | **59%**                            | **41%**                                |

Based on this data, the Park District concludes that 41% of the parks and facilities users are non-resident. The 41% amount then is a fair estimate of the general benefit to the public at large.

<!-- Page 365 -->
![Page 18](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Page+18)

This data and analysis only includes park users participating in organized activities, leagues and classes, and no other “casual” park users. Previous research and field survey work indicates that casual park users are more likely to be local residents. If the parks usage by these casual participants was taken into account, the amount of general benefit would likely be significantly less than the 41% calculated above. Therefore, the 41% amount is a very conservative estimate of the general benefits.

## Total General Benefits

The registration data shows that many of the non-resident users reside close to the Improvement District, and within the properties outside the Improvement District, and within the proximity radii for neighborhood parks as analyzed above. The Park District has determined that the 4.6% general benefit to property outside the Improvement District is encompassed within the 41% general benefit to the public at large. Therefore, the Park District concludes that 41% is a conservative and fair estimate of the overall general benefit from the Improvements.

The Park District’s total assessment budget for maintenance and improvement of its parks and recreational facilities is $4,303,180. Of this total budget amount, the Park District will contribute $3,675,293 from other non-assessment revenue sources. This contribution by the Park District equates to approximately 85% of the total budget for the Improvements and constitutes more than the amount attributable to the general benefits from the improvements.

## Zones of Benefit

The boundaries of the Assessment District have been carefully drawn to include the properties in the Park District that are proximate to the proposed Improvements and that would materially benefit from the Improvements. The Assessment District is coterminous with the District boundaries. As the properties in the Park District have developed over time, regional and neighborhood parks have been strategically located throughout the community as it has been built out. Park size and location have been carefully incorporated into the design of the community, consistent with the NPRA guidelines. Now, with a mature community, all parcels in the Park District are located in close proximity to at least one park. It therefore is appropriate to provide a District-wide Assessment District because all parcels benefit similarly.

In SVTA, the court noted that a local agency-wide assessment district is appropriate under the right conditions:

“Thus, if an assessment district is narrowly drawn, the fact that a benefit is conferred throughout the district does not make it general rather than special. In that circumstance, the characterization of a benefit may depend on whether the parcel receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g., proximity to a park) or receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g., proximity to a park) or receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g., proximity to a park) or receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g., proximity to a park).”

an indirect, derivative advantage resulting from the overall public benefits of the improvement (e.g., general enhancement of the district's property values).”

The court therefore acknowledged the appropriateness of a District-wide assessment so long as each parcel receives a direct advantage from the assessment-funded improvement or service. As demonstrated in this Report, in light of the small Park District size and dispersal of parks throughout the Park District, each parcel in the Assessment District receives a direct advantage and special benefit from the Improvements.

In the Assessment District, the advantage that each parcel receives from the Improvements is direct, and the boundaries are narrowly drawn to include only parcels that benefit from the Assessment. Therefore, the even spread of assessment throughout the narrowly drawn district is indeed consistent with the OSA decision. The benefits from the Improvements within the Assessment District do not vary further based on proximity of the parcels to the Improvements because the increased benefits of greater proximity to the Improvements are generally offset by a parallel increase in negative factors such as higher levels of traffic, noise, etc. that comes with increased proximity. Consequently, since all parcels in the Assessment District have good access and proximity to the Improvements and the benefits to relatively closer proximity are offset by other factors, additional proximity is not considered to be a factor in determining benefit within the Assessment District. Therefore, zones of benefit are not justified or needed within the Improvement District.

# Method of Assessment

As previously discussed, the assessments provide specific improvements that confer direct and tangible special benefits to properties in the Improvement District. These benefits can partially be measured by the occupants on property in the Improvement District because such parcel population density is a measure of the relative benefit a parcel receives from the Improvements. Therefore, the apportionment of benefit is partially based the population density of parcels.

It should be noted that many other types of “traditional” assessments also use parcel population densities to apportion the assessments. For example, the assessments for sewer systems, roads and water systems are typically allocated based on the population density of the parcels assessed. Moreover, assessments have a long history of use in California and are in large part based on the principle that benefits from a service or improvement funded by assessments that is enjoyed by tenants and other non-property owners ultimately is conferred directly to the underlying property.¹

After separating out the general benefits, the next step in apportioning assessments is to determine the relative special benefit for each property. This process involves determining the relative benefit received by each property in relation to a single family home, or, in other words, on the basis of Single Family Equivalents (SFE). This SFE method is commonly used to distribute assessments in proportion to estimated special benefit and is generally recognized as providing the basis for a fair and appropriate distribution of assessments. For the purposes of this Report, all properties are designated a SFE value, which is each property’s relative benefit in relation to a single family home on one parcel. In this case, the “benchmark” property is the single family detached dwelling which is one Single Family Equivalent or one SFE.

In the process of determining the appropriate method of assessment, the Engineer considered various alternatives. For example, an assessment only for residential improved property was considered but was determined to be inappropriate because commercial, industrial and other property also receive direct benefits from the Improvements.

¹ For example, in Federal Construction Co. v. Ensign (1922) 59 Cal.App. 200 at 211, the appellate court determined that a sewer system specially benefited property even though the direct benefit was to the people who used the sewers: “Practically every inhabitant of a city either is the owner of the land on which he resides or on which he pursues his vocation, or he is the tenant of the owner, or is the agent or servant of such owner or of such tenant. And since it is the inhabitants who make by far the greater use of a city’s sewer system, it is to them, as lot owners or as tenants, or as the servants or agents of such lot owners or tenants, that the advantages of actual use will redound. But this advantage of use means that, in the final analysis, it is the lot owners themselves who will be especially benefited in a financial sense.”

<!-- Page 368 -->
![Page 21](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+21)

Moreover, a fixed or flat assessment for all properties of similar type was deemed to be inappropriate because larger properties receive a higher degree of benefit than other similarly used properties that are significantly smaller. (For two properties used for commercial purposes, there is clearly a higher benefit provided to the larger property in comparison to a smaller commercial property because the larger property generally supports a larger building and has higher numbers of employees, customers and guests that would benefit from proximity and improved access to well maintained and improved parks and recreational facilities. So the potential population of employees or residents is a measure of the special benefits received by the property.) Larger parcels, therefore, receive an increased benefit from the assessments.

Finally, the special benefits derived from the assessments are conferred on property and are not based on a specific property owner’s use of the improvements, or a specific property owner’s occupancy of property, or the property owner’s demographic status such as age or number of dependents. However, it is ultimately people who value the special benefits described above derived by property are related to the average number of people who could potentially live on, work at, or otherwise could use a property, not how the property is currently used by the present owner. Therefore, the number of people who could or potentially live on, work at or otherwise use a property is one indicator of the relative level of benefit received by a property.

In conclusion, the Assessment Engineer determined that the appropriate method of assessment apportionment should be based on the type and use of property, the relative size of the property, its relative population and usage potential, and its proximity to parks and recreational facilities. This method is further described below.

### Residential Properties

Certain residential properties in the Improvement District that contain a single residential dwelling unit are assigned one Single Family Equivalent or 1.0 SFE. Traditional houses, zero-lot line houses, and town homes are included in this category of single family residential property.

Properties with more than one residential unit are designated as multi-family residential properties. These properties benefit from the improvements in proportion to the number of dwelling units that occupy each property, and the average number of people who reside in multi-family residential units versus the average number of people who reside in a single family home. The population density factors for the Park District, as depicted in the next figure, provide the basis for determining the SFE factors for residential properties. Using the total population in a certain property type in the community of Fair Oaks from the 1990 Census (the most recent data available when the Improvement District was established) and dividing it by the total number of such households, finds that approximately 2.86 persons occupy each single family residence, whereas an average of 1.91 persons occupy each multi-family residence. Using the ratio of one SFE for each single-family residence, which equates to one SFE for every 2.86 persons, 0.67 SFE would equate to one multi-family unit or 0.67 SFE for every 1.91 residents. Likewise, each condominium unit receives 0.73 SFE and each mobile home receives 0.68 SFE.

| Property Type                  | Total Population | Occupied Households | Persons per Household | SFE Factor |

The single family equivalency factor of 0.67 per dwelling unit for multifamily residential properties applies to such properties with 20 or fewer units. Properties in excess of 20 units typically offer on-site recreational amenities and other facilities that tend to offset some of the benefits provided by the improvements. Therefore the benefit for properties in excess of 20 units is determined to be 0.67 SFE per unit for the first 20 units and 0.10 SFE per each additional unit in excess of 20 dwelling units.

### Commercial/Industrial Properties

SFE values for commercial and industrial land uses are based on the equivalence of special benefit on a land area basis between single family residential property and commercial property. The SFE values for other types of business and industrial land uses are established by using average employee densities, because the special benefit factors described previously can be measured by the average number of people who work at commercial/industrial properties.

In order to determine employee density factors, the findings from the San Diego Association of Governments Traffic Generators Study (the “SANDAG Study”) are used because these findings were approved by the State Legislature for use in justifying commercial and industrial school facilities fees, and are considered to be a good representation of the average number of employees per acre of land area for commercial and industrial properties. As determined by the SANDAG Study, the average number of employees per acre for commercial property is 24.

In comparison, the average number of people residing in a single family home in the area is 2.86. Since the average lot size for a single family home in Fair Oaks is approximately 0.30 acres, the average number of residents per acre of residential property is 9.53.

The employee density per acre is generally 2.50 times the population density of single-family residential property per acre (24 employees per acre / 9.53 residents per acre). Therefore, the average employee density can be used as the basis for allocating benefit to commercial or industrial property since a property with 2.50 employees receives generally similar special benefit to a residential property with 1 resident. This factor of equivalence of benefit between 1 resident to 2.50 employees is the basis for allocating commercial/industrial benefit. The following Figure shows the average employees per acre of land area or portion thereof for commercial and industrial properties, and lists the relative SFE factors per quarter acre for properties in each land use category.

Commercial and industrial properties in excess of 5 acres generally involve uses that are more land intensive relative to building areas and number of employees (lower coverage ratios). As a result, the benefit factors for commercial and industrial property land area in excess of 5 acres is determined to be the SFE rate per quarter acre for the first 5 acres and the relevant SFE rate per each additional acre over 5 acres.

Institutional properties that are used for residential, commercial or industrial purposes are also assessed at the appropriate residential, commercial, or industrial rate.

| Type of Commercial/Industrial Land Use | Average Employees Per Acre | SFE Units per 1/4 Acre * |

* The SFE factors for commercial and industrial parcels are applied by the quarter acre of land area or portion thereof. (Therefore, the minimum assessment for any assessable parcel in these categories is the SFE Units listed herein.)

## Vacant Properties

The benefit to vacant properties is determined to be proportional to the corresponding benefits for similar type developed properties; however, at a lower rate due to the lack of improvements on the property. A measure of the benefits accruing to the underlying land is the average value of land in relation to improvements for developed property. As a general average, appraisers often use a factor of 25% to 30% of developed property value as land value. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that approximately 25% of the benefits are related to the underlying land and 75% are related to the Improvements and the day-to-day use of the property. Using this ratio, the SFE factor for vacant parcels is 0.25 per parcel.

As properties are approved for development, their value also increases. Likewise, the special benefit received by vacant property increases as the property is approved for development, or becomes closer to being improved. When property is approved for development with a final map, the property has passed the final significant hurdle to development and can shortly undergo construction. Since the property is nearing the point of development, its special benefits increase. In addition, these properties are generally sold soon after completion of improvements, so the properties receive the additional benefit of desirability from prospective buyers due to the special benefits provided by proximity to improved parks and recreational facilities of the Park District. It is therefore determined that property with final map approval receives 50% of the relative benefit to improved property of similar use-type.

## Other Properties

All properties that are specially benefited are assessed. Other publicly owned property that is used for purposes similar to private residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional uses is benefited and assessed at the same rate as such privately owned property.

Miscellaneous, small and other parcels such as roads, right-of-way parcels, and common areas typically do not generate significant numbers of employees, residents, customers, or guests and have limited economic value. These miscellaneous parcels receive no benefit from the Improvements and are assessed an SFE benefit factor of 0.

# Annual Cost Indexing

It should be noted that the maximum assessment rate within the Improvement District may increase in future years based on the annual change in the Northern California (San Francisco Bay Area) Consumer Price Index (the “CPI”), with a maximum annual adjustment not to exceed 3%. In the event that the annual change in the CPI exceeds 3%, any percentage change in excess of 3% can be cumulatively reserved and can be added to the annual change in the CPI for years in which the CPI change is less than 3%.

# Duration of Assessment

It is proposed that the Assessment be levied for fiscal year 2000-01 and continued every year thereafter, so long as the parks and recreational areas need to be improved and maintained and the Park District requires funding from the Assessments for its Improvements in the Improvement District. As noted previously, the Assessment can continue to be levied annually after the Park District Board of Directors approves an annually updated Report, budget for the Assessment, Improvements to be provided, and other specifics of the Assessment. In addition, the District Board of Directors must hold an annual public hearing to continue the Assessment.

# Appeals and Interpretation

Any property owner who claims that the assessment levied on its property is in error as a result of incorrect information being used to apply the foregoing method of assessment, may file a written appeal with the District Administrator or her or his designee. Any such appeal is limited to correction of an assessment during the then current or, if before July 1, the upcoming fiscal year. Upon the filing of any such appeal, the District Administrator or his or her designee will promptly review the appeal and any information provided by the property owner. If the District Administrator or her or his designee finds that the assessment should be modified, the appropriate changes shall be made to the assessment roll. If any such changes are approved after the assessment roll has been filed with the County for collection, the District Administrator or his or her designee is authorized to refund to the property owner the amount of any approved reduction. Any dispute over the decision of the District Administrator, or her or his designee, shall be referred to the Board of Directors of the Park District and the decision of the Board of Directors shall be final.

As required by the Act, an Assessment Diagram is hereto attached and made a part hereof showing the exterior boundaries of the Improvement District. The distinctive number of each parcel or lot of land in the Improvement District is its Assessor Parcel Number appearing on the Assessment Roll.

I do hereby assess and apportion the net amount of the cost and expenses of the Improvements, including the costs and expenses incident thereto, upon the parcels and lots of land within the Improvement District, in accordance with the special benefits to be received by each parcel or lot, from the improvements, and more particularly set forth in the Cost Estimate and Method of Assessment hereto attached and by reference made a part hereof.

Property owners in the Improvement District approved in an assessment ballot proceeding in 2000 the initial fiscal year benefit assessment for special benefits to their property including the CPI adjustment schedule. As a result, the assessment may continue to be levied annually and may be adjusted by up to the maximum annual CPI adjustment without any additional assessment ballot proceeding. In the event that in future years the assessments are levied at a rate less than the maximum authorized assessment rate, the assessment rate in a subsequent year may be increased up to the maximum authorized assessment rate without any additional assessment ballot proceeding.

The assessment is subject to an annual increase tied to the Consumer Price Index-U for the San Francisco Bay Area as of December of each succeeding year (the “CPI”), with a maximum annual increase not to exceed 3%. Any change in the CPI in excess of 3% shall be cumulatively reserved as the “Unused CPI” and shall be used to increase the maximum authorized assessment rate in years in which the CPI is less than 3%. The maximum authorized assessment rate is equal to the maximum assessment rate in the first fiscal year the assessment was levied adjusted annually by the minimum of 1) 3% or 2) the change in the CPI plus any Unused CPI as described above.

The change in the CPI from December 2022 to December 2023 was 2.62% and the Unused CPI carried forward from the previous fiscal year is 3.70%. Therefore, the maximum authorized assessment rate for fiscal year 2024-25 is increased by 3.00% which equates to $45.28 per single family equivalent benefit unit. The estimate of cost and budget in this Report proposes assessments for fiscal year 2024-25 at the rate of $45.28, which is less than the maximum authorized assessment rate.

The assessment is made upon the parcels or lots of land within the Improvement District in proportion to the special benefits to be received by the parcels or lots of land, from the Improvements.

# Introduction

## Overview

The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District (the “District”) is an independent special district established in 1945. The District provides park and recreation services to an area encompassing over 12,500 parcels. The District is governed by an elected five-member Board of Directors (the “Board”).

The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District, Phoenix Field Landscape and Lighting Assessment District (the "Assessment District") provides funding for maintenance, servicing and improvements for a narrowly drawn area encompassing 373 parcels. The purpose of the Assessment District is to rehabilitate, improve, service and maintain the Little Phoenix Park, which covers 0.95 acres and is located at 9041 Phoenix Avenue, the Phoenix Enclave and Swale adjacent to former Filbert Avenue, and other perimeter landscape areas along Madison and Sunset Avenues as shown on the assessment diagram.

## Assessment Formation

On June 15, 1989, the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Board of Directors ordered by Resolution No. 61859-3, the formation of, and levied the first assessment within, the Assessment District pursuant to the provisions of the Landscaping and Lighting Act of 1972 (the "Act"), Part 2 of Division 15 of the California Streets and Highways Code (commencing with Section 22500 thereof).

## Assessment Continuation

In each subsequent year for which the assessments will be continued, the Board must direct the preparation of an Engineer's Report ("Report"), budgets and continued assessments for the upcoming fiscal year. The Report also identifies future planned projects. After the Report is completed, the Board may preliminarily approve the Report and proposed assessments and establish the date for a public hearing on the continuation of the assessments. This Report was prepared pursuant to the direction of the Board on March 20, 2024 by Resolution No. 032024-02.

This Report was prepared to establish the budget for the continued services that would be funded by the proposed 2024-25 continued assessments and to define the special benefits received from the Improvements (described below) by property within the Assessment District and the method of assessment apportionment to lots and parcels. This Report and the continued assessments have been made pursuant to the Act and Article XIIID of the California Constitution (the “Article”).

If the Board preliminarily approves this Report and the continuation of the assessments by resolution, a notice of the proposed assessment levies must be published in a local paper at least 10 days prior to the date of the public hearing. The resolution preliminarily approving the Report and establishing the date for a public hearing is typically used for this notice.

Following the minimum 10-day time period after publishing the notice, a public hearing is held for the purpose of allowing public testimony about the proposed continuation of the assessments. This hearing is currently scheduled for July 17, 2024. At this hearing, the Board will consider approval of a resolution confirming the continuation of the assessments for fiscal year 2024-25. If so confirmed and approved, the assessments will be submitted to the County Auditor/Controller for inclusion on the property tax rolls for Fiscal Year 2024-25.

## Legal Analysis

### Proposition 218

This assessment is formed consistent with Proposition 218, The Right to Vote on Taxes Act, which was approved by the voters of California on November 6, 1996, and is now codified as Articles XIIIC and XIIID of the California Constitution. Proposition 218 provides for benefit assessments to be levied to fund the cost of providing services, improvements, as well as maintenance and operation expenses to a public improvement which specially benefits the assessed property.

Proposition 218 describes a number of important requirements, including property-owner balloting, for the imposition, increase and extension of assessments, and these requirements are satisfied by the process used to establish this assessment.

### Silicon Valley Taxpayers Association, Inc. v Santa Clara County Open Space Authority

In July of 2008, the California Supreme Court issued its ruling on the Silicon Valley Taxpayers Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority (“SVTA”). This ruling is the most significant legal document in further legally clarifying Proposition 218. Several of the most important elements of the ruling included further emphasis that:

- Benefit assessments are for special, not general, benefit
- The services and/or improvements funded by assessments must be clearly defined
- Special benefits are directly received by and provide a direct advantage to property in the Assessment District
- The assessment paid by property should be proportional to the special benefits it receives from the Improvements

# Dahms v. Downtown Pomona Property
On June 8, 2009, the Court of Appeals approved a benefit assessment for property in the downtown area of the City of Pomona in Dahms v. Downtown Pomona Property (“Dahms”). In Dahms the Court upheld an assessment that was 100% special benefit (i.e. 0% general benefit) on the rationale that the services and improvements funded by the assessments were directly provided to property in the assessment district. The Court also upheld discounts and exemptions from the assessment for certain properties.

# Bonander v. Town of Tiburon
On December 31, 2009, in Bonander v. Town of Tiburon (“Bonander”), the Court of Appeal overturned a benefit assessment approved by property owners to pay for placing overhead utility lines underground in an area of the Town of Tiburon. The Court invalidated the assessments primarily on the grounds that the assessments had been apportioned to assessed property based on the costs within sub-areas of the assessment district instead of the overall proportional special benefits.

# Beutz v. County of Riverside
On May 26, 2010 the Court of Appeal overturned an assessment for park maintenance in Wildomar, California, primarily because the general benefits associated with improving services were not explicitly calculated, quantified and separated from the special benefits.

# Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego
On September 22, 2011, the Court of Appeal issued a decision on the Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego appeal (“Greater Golden Hill”). This decision overturned an assessment for street and landscaping maintenance in the Greater Golden Hill neighborhood of San Diego, California. The court described two primary reasons for its decision. First, like in Beutz, the court found the general benefits associated with services were not explicitly calculated, quantified and separated from the special benefits. Second, the court found that the City had failed to record the basis for the calculation of the assessment amount on city-owned parcels.

# Compliance with Current Law
This Report is consistent with the SVTA decision and with the requirements of Article XIIIC and XIIID of the California Constitution because the Improvements to be funded are clearly defined; the benefiting property in the Assessment District enjoys close and unique proximity, access and views to the Improvements; the Improvements serve as an extension of usable land area for benefiting properties in the Assessment District and such special benefits provide a direct advantage to property in the Assessment District that is not enjoyed by the public at large or other property.

# Estimate of Cost – Fiscal Year 2024-25

The Act requires the Report to estimate the costs of the Improvements for the fiscal year, including estimates for the total costs for the Improvements for the year, the amount of any surplus or deficit to be carried over from a previous fiscal year, and the amount of funding contributions made from sources other than assessment revenue. After determining these amounts, the Report then must calculate the net amount to be assessed upon assessable lands within the District. The table below shows the proposed estimate of cost for fiscal year 2024-25:

![Notes to Estimate of Cost](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Notes+to+Estimate+of+Cost)

**Notes to Estimate of Cost:**

1. As determined in the following section, at least 5% of the cost of Improvements must be funded from sources other than the assessments to cover any general benefits from the Improvements. Therefore, out of the total cost of Improvements of $92,000, the District must contribute at least 5% or $4,600 from sources other than the assessments. The District will contribute $35,385 which is slightly over 38%, and more than covers any general benefits from the Improvements.

2. The Act requires that proceeds from the assessments must be deposited into a special fund that has been set up for the revenues and expenditures of the Assessment District. Moreover, funds raised by the assessment shall be used only for the purposes stated within this Report. Any balance remaining at the end of the fiscal year, July 1, must be carried over to the next fiscal year. The Park District may also establish a reserve fund for contingencies and special projects as well as a capital improvement fund for accumulating funds for larger capital improvement projects or capital renovation needs. Any remaining balance would either be placed in the reserve fund, the capital improvement fund, or would be used to reduce future years' assessments.

3. All assessments are rounded to lower even penny, so the budget amount may slightly differ from the assessment rate.

![Method of Apportionment](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Method+of+Apportionment)

# Method of Apportionment

This section of the Report includes an explanation of the benefits to be derived from the installation, maintenance and servicing of the Improvements throughout the Assessment District, and the methodology used to apportion the total assessment to land uses within the Assessment District.

The Assessment District consists of all Assessor Parcels within the boundaries of the Phoenix Field Landscape and Lighting Assessment District as defined by the Assessment Diagram shown in this report and the Assessor Parcel Numbers listed within the included levy roll. The parcels include all privately or publicly owned parcels within the boundaries. The method used for apportioning the total assessment is based upon the proportional special benefits to be derived by the properties in the Assessment District over and above general benefits conferred on real property or to the public at large. The apportionment of special benefit is a two-step process: the first step is to identify the types of special benefit arising from the improvements, and the second step is to allocate the assessments to property based on the estimated relative special benefit for each type of property.

## Discussion of Benefit

In summary, the assessments can only be levied based on the special benefit to property. This benefit is received by property over and above any general benefits. Moreover, such benefit is not based on any one property owner’s use of the Improvements or a property owner’s specific demographic status. With reference to the requirements for assessments, Section 22573 of the Act states:

"The net amount to be assessed upon lands within an assessment district may be apportioned by any formula or method which fairly distributes the net amount among all assessable lots or parcels in proportion to the estimated benefits to be received by each such lot or parcel from the improvements."

Proposition 218, as codified in Article XIIID of the California Constitution, has confirmed that assessments must be based on the special benefit to property and that the value of the special benefits must reasonably exceed the cost of the assessment:

"No assessment shall be imposed on any parcel which exceeds the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit conferred on that parcel."

<!-- Page 398 -->
![Page 10](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+10)

The following benefit categories summarize the types of special benefit to residential and other lots and parcels resulting from the installation, maintenance and servicing of the Improvements to be provided with the assessment proceeds. These categories of special benefit are summarized as follows:

- Extension of a property’s outdoor areas and green spaces for properties within close proximity to the Improvements.
- Proximity and access to improved parks and recreational facilities.
- Improved views.

In this case, the recent SVTA decision provides enhanced clarity to the definitions of special benefits to properties in three distinct areas:

- Proximity
- Expanded or improved access
- Views.

The SVTA decision also clarifies that a special benefit is a service or improvement that provides a direct advantage to a parcel and that indirect or derivative advantages resulting from the overall public benefits from a service or improvement are general benefits. The SVTA decision also provides specific guidance that park improvements are a direct advantage and special benefit to property that is proximate to a park that is improved by an assessment.

The characterization of a benefit may depend on whether the parcel receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g. proximity to a park) or receives an indirect, derivative advantage resulting from the overall public benefits of the improvement (e.g. general enhancement of the district’s property values).

Proximity, improved access and views, in addition to the other special benefits listed above further strengthen the basis of these assessments.

# Benefit Factors

The special benefits from the Improvements are further detailed below:

## Extension of a property’s outdoor areas and green spaces for properties within close proximity to the Improvements

In large part because it is cost prohibitive to provide large open land areas on property in the Assessment District, the residential and other benefiting properties in the Assessment District do not have large outdoor areas and green spaces. The park in the Assessment District provides these larger outdoor areas that serve as an effective extension of the land area for proximate properties because the Improvements are uniquely proximate and accessible to property in close proximity to the Improvements. The Improvements, therefore, provide an important, valuable and desirable extension of usable land area for the direct advantage and special benefit of properties with good and close proximity to the Improvements.

According to the industry-standard guidelines established by the National Park and Recreation Association (the “NPRA”), neighborhood parks in urban areas have a service area radius of generally one-half mile and community parks have a service area radius of approximately two miles. The service radii for neighborhood parks and neighborhood green spaces were specifically established to give all properties within this service radius close proximity and easy walking access to such public land areas. Since proximate and accessible parks serve as an extension of the usable land area for property in the service radii and since the service radii was specifically designed to provide close proximity and access, the parcels within this service area clearly receive a direct advantage and special benefit from the Improvements, and this advantage is not received by other properties or the public at large.

Moreover, Little Phoenix Park does not provide a restroom or parking lot. Such public amenities were specifically excluded from neighborhood parks because neighborhood parks are designed to be an extension of usable land area specifically for properties in close proximity, and not the public at large or other non-proximate property. The occupants of proximate property do not need to drive to their local park and can use their own restroom facilities because they can easily reach their local neighborhood park and can use their own restroom facilities as needed. This is further tangible evidence of the effective extension of land area provided by the Improvements to proximate parcels in the Assessment District and the unique direct advantage the proximate parcels receive from the Improvements.

An analysis of the service radii for the Improvements finds that all properties in the Assessment District enjoy the distinct and direct advantage of being close and proximate to Little Phoenix Park. The benefiting properties in the Assessment District therefore uniquely and specially benefit from the Improvements.

<!-- Page 400 -->
![Page 12](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+12)

**Proximity and access to improved parks and recreational facilities**  
Only the specific properties within close proximity to the Improvements are included in the Assessment District. Therefore, property in the Assessment District enjoys unique and valuable proximity and access to the Improvements that the public at large and property outside the Assessment District do not share.

In absence of the assessments, the Improvements would not be provided and the Little Phoenix Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District would be degraded due to insufficient funding for maintenance, upkeep and repair. Therefore, the assessments provide Improvements that are over and above what otherwise would be provided. Improvements that are over and above what otherwise would be provided do not by themselves translate into special benefits but when combined with the unique proximity and access enjoyed by parcels in the Assessment District, they provide a direct advantage and special benefit to property in the Assessment District.

Since the parcels in the Assessment District enjoy close access to the Improvements, they directly benefit from this unique close access to improved park and recreation areas that are provided by the Assessments. This is a direct advantage and special benefit to property in the Assessment District.

**Improved Views**  
The District, by maintaining the landscaping at Little Phoenix Park and the Enclave, swale site and landscape corridors provides improved views and open space buffers to properties in the Assessment District. The properties in the Assessment District enjoy close and unique proximity, access and views of the Improvements; therefore, the improved and protected views and open space buffers provided by the Assessments are another direct and tangible advantage that is uniquely conferred upon property in the Assessment District.

# General versus Special Benefit and Quantification of General Benefit

In light of *Beutz v. County of Riverside* (2010) and *Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego* (2011), the District has reevaluated the Proposition 218 requirement regarding special and general benefits. Proposition 218 requires an assessing agency to separate the general benefits from the special benefits of a public improvement or service, estimate the quantity of each in relation to the other, and limit the assessment amount to the portion of the improvement or service costs attributable to the special benefits. The courts in *Golden Hill* and *Beutz* determined that there usually will be some general benefit associated with a parks improvement project and park-related services, because residents and others who don’t reside in the assessment district probably will use the parks at least to some degree. The separation and quantification of general and special benefits requires an apportionment of the cost of the service or improvement between the two benefit types, and assessing assessment district property owners only for the portion of the cost representing special benefits to the assessment district property. General benefits cannot be funded by assessment revenue. Rather, the funding must come from other sources. The District therefore has analyzed the quantity or extent to which the general public may reasonably be expected to use or benefit from the park and landscape areas, in relation to the quantity or extent to which residents of the assessment district use and benefit from the parks and landscape areas.

Although the park and landscape areas may be available to the general public at large, they have been specifically designed, located and created to provide additional and improved public resources for property inside the Assessment District, and not the public at large. Other properties that are outside the Assessment District do not enjoy the unique proximity, access, views, open space and other special benefit factors described previously. The Improvements are of special benefit to properties located within the Assessment District because they provide a direct advantage to properties in the Assessment District that would not be provided in absence of the assessments. The Assessment District allows the District to provide its park and recreation improvements to the Little Phoenix Park at a much higher level than what otherwise would be provided in absence of the Assessments. Moreover, in absence of the Assessments, no other agency would provide the Improvements nor would the District, because it does not have alternative available funds to provide the Improvements.

All of the Assessment proceeds derived from the Assessment District will be utilized to fund the cost of providing a level of tangible “special benefits” in the form of proximate parks, recreation facilities, landscaped corridors, project entrances, signs, walkways, parks, and other improvements and costs incidental to providing the Improvements and collecting the Assessments.

Although these Improvements may be available to the general public at large, Little Phoenix Park and the other landscape and open space in the Assessment District were specifically designed, located and created to provide additional and improved public resources for the direct advantage of property inside the Assessment District, and not the public at large. Other properties that are outside the Assessment District do not enjoy the unique proximity, access, views and other special benefit factors described previously.

These Improvements are of special benefit to properties located within the Assessment District because they provide a direct advantage to properties in the Assessment District that would not be provided in absence of the Assessments. Without the Assessments, the Little Phoenix Park and other landscape and open space areas within the Assessment District might be closed and turned into brown, unmaintained and unusable lands. If this happened, it would create a significant and material negative impact on the desirability, utility and value of property in the Assessment District. If Assessments were not collected and the Little Phoenix Park and other areas were closed and not maintained as a result, properties in the Assessment District may decline in desirability, utility and value.

**Special Note Regarding General Benefit and the SVTA Decision:**

There is no widely-accepted or statutory formula for calculating general benefit. General benefits are benefits from improvements or services that are not special in nature, are not “particular and distinct” and are not “over and above” benefits received by other properties. SVTA decision provides some clarification by indicating that general benefits provide “an indirect, derivative advantage” and are not necessarily proximate to the improvements.

In the re-analysis of general benefit, the District determined that there are several attributes and features relating to the park and landscaped areas that discourage and limit use by persons who do not reside near the parks and landscape areas: there are no bathrooms; there are no parking lots; the areas are small; the areas are designed for passive use and short duration of use (e.g. less than one hour); there are no ball fields for organized sports teams and play; the areas are not located on major streets; the park is hard to find and not a destination park; and, the Enclave, swale and corridor areas are inaccessible and unusable areas. For similar reasons, these attributes and features make the park and landscape areas much more usable by those who reside within close walking distance.

District staff persons over the years have observed the patterns of usage of Little Phoenix Parks and the persons who use that area. Based on these observations, the District has determined that the vast majority of the persons who use these areas reside in close proximity, that it is extremely rare for someone to drive to, park at and use these areas, and that it is extremely rare for someone to walk to these areas from outside the District. The vast majority of users reside in the Assessment District. However, there are some users who reside in the nearby areas to the west and east of the park, just outside the Assessment District. Based on these observations and the park/landscape area attributes and features that discourage and limit use by persons outside the Assessment District, the District has determined that approximately 5% of the persons who use Little Phoenix Park walk or drive to the area from outside the Assessment District.

Regarding the Enclave, swale and landscape areas shown on the assessment diagram, the areas are inaccessible and unusable. The areas provide open space and site view benefits for the property owner residents and property owners in the Assessment District. The areas also receive storm drainage runoff from Assessment District properties and therefore provide important storm drainage service to the Assessment District parcels. There are two small landscape corridor portions along Sunset Avenue and Madison Avenue. Driver and pedestrian passersby do enjoy some small benefit from the open space and view attributes of the adjacent landscape corridors along those streets. It is difficult to estimate and quantify this general benefit. The Sunset and Madison landscape corridors are small and thin, they are a small portion of the overall park and open space areas funded by the Assessment District and the benefits to passersby from the corridor areas are small relative to the open space, view and storm drainage benefits to Assessment District property owners and residents. In light of these factors, the District has determined that approximately 5% of the Enclave, swale and landscape areas benefit non-Assessment District passersby and constitute general benefit.

With 5% of Little Phoenix Park usage by non-Assessment District residents and 5% benefit from the Enclave, swale and landscape areas to non-Assessment District residents, the District next must determine the overall percentage of use and benefit attributable to the general benefit. It is difficult to calculate or reconcile the overall general benefit from these percentages; therefore, the District has determined that the most appropriate calculation is to average the two. In averaging the percentages, the District estimates and determines that the overall general benefit from the Improvements is 5%. The budget on page 6 shows that the amount and portion of District funding of the Improvement costs from sources other than assessment revenue exceeds 5%.

The Assessment District’s total assessment budget for maintenance and improvement of the Little Phoenix Park, the Enclave, swale and landscape areas and corridors is $92,000. Of this total budget amount, the District will utilize $35,385 from sources other than the assessments for the Improvements. This payment by the District equates to approximately 38.4% of the total budget for the Improvements, which is greater than the amount attributable to the general benefits from the Improvements.

## Method of Assessment

After separating out the general benefits, the next step in apportioning assessments is to estimate the relative special benefit for each type of property. In other words, this step determines the proportion of the special benefit conferred on the various land uses within the boundaries of the Assessment District so that each parcel of land is assessed according to its land use. Each parcel of land is therefore assessed according to its level of special benefit received. As all of the parcels of land within the boundaries are designated as single family use, except for the Park itself and the perimeter landscape properties, all parcels are determined to be benefited equally and are assigned 1 SFE or Single Family Equivalence unit.

## Duration of Assessment

It is proposed that the Assessment be levied for fiscal year 1989-90 and continued every year thereafter, so long as the Little Phoenix Park and recreational areas need to be improved and maintained, and the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District requires funding from the Assessments for its continued Improvements in the Assessment District. As noted previously, the Assessment can continue to be levied annually after the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Board of Directors approves an annually updated Report, budget for the Assessment, Improvements to be provided, and other specifics of the Assessment. In addition, the District Board of Directors must hold an annual public hearing to continue the Assessment.

Upon the filing of any such appeal, the District Administrator or his or her designee will promptly review the appeal and any information provided by the property owner. If the District Administrator or her or his designee finds that the assessment should be modified, the appropriate changes shall be made to the assessment roll. If any such changes are approved after the assessment roll has been filed with the County for collection, the District Administrator or his or her designee is authorized to refund to the property owner the amount of any approved reduction. Any dispute over the decision of the District Administrator, or her or his designee, shall be referred to the Board of Directors of the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District and the decision of the Board of Directors of the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District shall be final.

# Introduction

## Overview

The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District (the “Park District”) is an independent special district established in 1945. The District provides park and recreation services to an area encompassing over 12,500 parcels. The District is governed by an elected five-member Board of Directors (the “Board”).

The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District, Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting Assessment District (the "Assessment District") provides funding for maintenance, servicing and improvements for a narrowly drawn area known as Gum Ranch. The purpose of the Assessment District is to maintain, service and improve Madison Place Park that covers an area of approximately 0.83 acres, located at 5524 Cannes Way as shown on the assessment diagram. The Assessment District will also provide the maintenance, servicing, and improvements of the Gum Ranch Park, which will cover an area of approximately 3.92 acres, generally located west of Kenneth Avenue and just south of Arcade Creek, after the developer conveys the completed Gum Ranch Park to the Park District.

## Assessment Formation

The formation of the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting Assessment District (the "Assessment District") within the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District was completed in 2006 for the purpose of providing funding for the maintenance and improvement of the landscaping, street lighting, and neighborhood park facilities to benefit the properties in the Gum Ranch subdivision that forms the Assessment District. The Gum Ranch subdivision is the combination of two original parcels (assessor parcel numbers 249-0020-004-0000 and 249-0020-005-0000) forming an inverted “L” shape, with an approximate area of 107 acres. The Gum Ranch subdivision is located in Fair Oaks at the northwest intersection of Kenneth Avenue and Madison Avenue.

<!-- Page 420 -->
![Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+2)

At the time of the Assessment District formation in 2006, the Gum Ranch subdivision was originally planned for two developments or groups of homes. The larger area to the north (Gum Ranch North development) was planned to have 251 single family residences, and the smaller southern portion (Gum Ranch South development) would have 89 single family residences. The Assessment District formation described in this Engineer’s Report resulted from agreements or conditions of development approval between the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District and the two property owners as of year 2006, Irving & Claudia Gum (Baker-Williams Engineering Group), and City View Gum Ranch (Dunmore Communities), whereby the Park District and property owners agreed on landscape corridors and bike-pedestrian landscaping abutting the properties to reduce the visual impact of buildings on the properties and to enhance public views and resources, lighting to enhance public safety and security, and neighborhood park maintenance to improve the appeal of the Gum Ranch subdivision and recreational amenities available to the property in the Assessment District.

In 2006, per direction of the Board of Directors of the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District, SCI Consulting Group prepared an Engineer’s Report (“Report”) to establish the budget for the services that would be funded by the proposed assessments, and to determine the benefits received by property within the Assessment District from the maintenance and improvements, and the method of assessment apportionment to lots and parcels. This Report and the proposed assessments were made pursuant to the Landscaping and Lighting Act of 1972, Part 2 of Division 15 of the California Streets and Highways Code (the “Act”) and Article XIIID of the California Constitution (the “Article”).

Following submittal of the Engineer’s Report to the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Board of Directors (the “Board”), the Board adopted Resolution No. 062206-07 in June 22, 2006, preliminarily approving the Report, calling for an assessment ballot proceeding and providing notice of Public Hearing on the proposed establishment of assessments for the improvements.

# Assessment Continuation

In each subsequent year for which the assessments will be levied, the Board must direct the preparation of an Engineer's Report, budgets and proposed assessments for the upcoming fiscal year. After the Engineer's Report is completed, the Board may preliminarily approve the Engineer's Report and proposed assessments and establish the date for a public hearing on the continuation of the assessments. This Report for Fiscal Year 2024-25 was prepared pursuant to the direction of the Board adopted on March 20, 2024 (Resolution No. 032024-03). If the Board approves this Engineer's Report and the proposed assessments by resolution, a notice of assessment levies must be published in a local paper at least 10 days prior to the date of the public hearing. The resolution preliminarily approving the Engineer's Report and establishing the date for a public hearing is used for this notice.

Following the minimum 10-day time period after publishing the notice, a public hearing is held for the purpose of allowing public testimony about the proposed continuation of the assessments. This hearing is currently scheduled for July 17, 2024. At this hearing, the Board would consider approval of a resolution confirming the assessments for fiscal year 2024-25. If so confirmed and approved, the assessments would be submitted to the County Auditor/Controller for inclusion on the property tax rolls for Fiscal Year 2024-25.

# Legal Analysis

## Proposition 218

This assessment is formed consistent with Proposition 218, The Right to Vote on Taxes Act, which was approved by the voters of California on November 6, 1996, and is now codified as Articles XIIIC and XIIID of the California Constitution. Proposition 218 provides for benefit assessments to be levied to fund the cost of providing services, improvements, as well as maintenance and operation expenses to a public improvement which specially benefits the assessed property.

Proposition 218 describes a number of important requirements, including property-owner balloting, for the imposition, increase and extension of assessments, and these requirements are satisfied by the process used to establish this assessment.

# Silicon Valley Taxpayers Association, Inc. v Santa Clara County Open Space Authority

In July of 2008, the California Supreme Court issued its ruling on the Silicon Valley Taxpayers Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority (“SVTA”). This ruling is the most significant legal document in further legally clarifying Proposition 218. Several of the most important elements of the ruling included further emphasis that:

- Benefit assessments are for special, not general, benefit
- The services and/or improvements funded by assessments must be clearly defined
- Special benefits are directly received by and provide a direct advantage to property in the Assessment District
- The assessment paid by property should be proportional to the special benefits it receives from the Improvements

## Dahms v. Downtown Pomona Property

On June 8, 2009, the Court of Appeals approved a benefit assessment for property in the downtown area of the City of Pomona in Dahms v. Downtown Pomona Property (“Dahms”). In Dahms the Court upheld an assessment that was 100% special benefit (i.e. 0% general benefit) on the rationale that the services and improvements funded by the assessments were directly provided to property in the assessment district. The Court also upheld discounts and exemptions from the assessment for certain properties.

## Bonander v. Town of Tiburon

On December 31, 2009, in Bonander v. Town of Tiburon (“Bonander”), the Court of Appeal overturned a benefit assessment approved by property owners to pay for placing overhead utility lines underground in an area of the Town of Tiburon. The Court invalidated the assessments primarily on the grounds that the assessments had been apportioned to assessed property based on the costs within sub-areas of the assessment district instead of the overall proportional special benefits.

## Beutz v. County of Riverside

On May 26, 2010 the Court of Appeal overturned an assessment for park maintenance in Wildomar, California, primarily because the general benefits associated with improvements and services were not explicitly calculated, quantified and separated from the special benefits.

**Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego**

On September 22, 2011, the Court of Appeal issued a decision on the Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego appeal (“Greater Golden Hill”). This decision overturned an assessment for street and landscaping maintenance in the Greater Golden Hill neighborhood of San Diego, California. The court described two primary reasons for its decision. First, like in Beutz, the court found the general benefits associated with services were not explicitly calculated, quantified and separated from the special benefits. Second, the court found that the City had failed to record the basis for the calculation of the assessment amount on city-owned parcels.

**Compliance with Current Law**

This Report is consistent with the SVTA decision and with the requirements of Article XIIIC and XIIID of the California Constitution because the Improvements to be funded are clearly defined; the benefiting property in the Assessment District enjoys close and unique proximity, access and views to the Improvements; the Improvements serve as an extension of usable land area for benefiting properties in the Assessment District and such special benefits provide a direct advantage to property in the Assessment District that is not enjoyed by the public at large or other property.

This Report is consistent with Beutz, Dahms and Greater Golden Hill because the Improvements will directly benefit property in the Assessment District and the general benefits have been excluded from the Assessments. The Report is consistent with Bonander because the Assessments have been apportioned based on the overall proportional special benefit to each property.

1. As determined in the following section, at least 5% of the cost of Improvements must be funded from sources other than the assessments to cover any general benefits from the Improvements. Therefore, out of the total cost of Improvements for the entire Gum Ranch area of $74,651, the District must contribute at least 5% or $3,733 from sources other than the assessments. The District will actually contribute $3,805, which is over that amount, and covers any general benefits from the Improvements. The costs for the Zone of Benefit B area for the installation, maintenance, servicing and improvements of park facilities is $34,734 and the District must contribute at least $1,737. The district will contribute $1,750, which is more than the required amount of 5%

2. The Act requires that proceeds from the assessments must be deposited into a special fund that has been set up for the revenues and expenditures of the Assessment District. Moreover, funds raised by the assessment shall be used only for the purposes stated within this Report. Any balance remaining at the end of the fiscal year, July 1, must be carried over to the next fiscal year. The Park District may also establish a reserve fund for contingencies and special projects as well as a capital improvement fund for accumulating funds for larger capital improvement projects or capital renovation needs. Any remaining balance would either be placed in the reserve fund, the capital improvement fund, or would be used to reduce future years' assessments.

3. All assessments are rounded to lower even penny, so the budget amount may slightly differ from the assessment rate.

![Method of Apportionment](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Method+of+Apportionment)

# Method of Apportionment

## Method of Apportionment

This section of the Engineer's Report includes an explanation of the benefits to be derived from the installation, maintenance and servicing of the park, and the methodology used to apportion the total assessment to properties within the Assessment District.

The Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting Assessment District consists of all Assessor Parcels within the boundaries as defined by the Assessment Diagram included within this Report and the Assessor Parcel Numbers listed within the included Assessment Roll. The method used for apportioning the assessments is based upon the proportional special benefits to be derived by the properties in the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting Assessment District over and above general benefits conferred on real property or to the public at large. The apportionment of special benefit is a two-step process: the first step is to identify the types of special benefit arising from the Improvements, and the second step is to allocate the assessments to property based on the estimated relative special benefit for each type of property.

## Discussion of Benefit

In summary, the assessments can only be levied based on the special benefit to property. This benefit is received by property over and above any general benefits. Moreover, such benefit is not based on any one property owner’s use of the Improvements or a property owner’s specific demographic status. With reference to the requirements for assessments, Section 22573 of the Act states:

"The net amount to be assessed upon lands within an assessment district may be apportioned by any formula or method which fairly distributes the net amount among all assessable lots or parcels in proportion to the estimated benefits to be received by each such lot or parcel from the improvements."

Proposition 218, as codified in Article XIIID of the California Constitution, has confirmed that assessments must be based on the special benefit to property and that the value of the special benefits must reasonably exceed the cost of the assessment:

"No assessment shall be imposed on any parcel which exceeds the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit conferred on that parcel."

**SCI Consulting Group**
<!-- Page 431 -->
![Page 13](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+13)

The following benefit categories summarize the types of special benefit to residential and other lots and parcels resulting from the installation, maintenance and servicing of the Improvements to be provided with the assessment proceeds. These categories of special benefit are summarized as follows:

- Extension of a property’s outdoor areas and green spaces for properties within close proximity to the Improvements.
- Proximity and access to improved parks and recreational facilities.
- Improved views.

In this case, the recent the SVTA decision provides enhanced clarity to the definitions of special benefits to properties in three distinct areas:

- Proximity
- Expanded or improved access
- Views

The SVTA decision also clarifies that a special benefit is a service or improvement that provides a direct advantage to a parcel and that indirect or derivative advantages resulting from the overall public benefits from a service or improvement are general benefits. The SVTA decision also provides specific guidance that park improvements are a direct advantage and special benefit to property that is proximate to a park that is improved by an assessment.

The characterization of a benefit may depend on whether the parcel receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g. proximity to a park) or receives an indirect, derivative advantage resulting from the overall public benefits of the improvement (e.g. general enhancement of the district’s property values).

Proximity, improved access and views, in addition to the other special benefits listed above further strengthen the basis of these assessments.

## Benefit Factors

The special benefits from the Improvements are further detailed below:

**Extension of a property’s outdoor areas and green spaces for properties within close proximity to the Improvements**

In large part because it is cost prohibitive to provide large open land areas on property in the Assessment District, the residential and other benefiting properties in the Assessment District do not have large outdoor areas and green spaces. The park in the Assessment District provides these larger outdoor areas that serve as an effective extension of the land area for proximate properties because the Improvements are uniquely proximate and accessible to property in close proximity to the Improvements. The Improvements, therefore, provide an important, valuable and desirable extension of usable land area for the direct advantage and special benefit of properties with good and close proximity to the Improvements.

According to the industry-standard guidelines established by the National Park and Recreation Association (the “NPRA”), neighborhood parks in urban areas have a service area radius of generally one-half mile and community parks have a service area radius of approximately two miles. The service radii for neighborhood parks and neighborhood green spaces were specifically established to give all properties within this service radius close proximity and easy walking access to such public land areas. Since proximate and accessible parks serve as an extension of the usable land area for property in the service radius and since the service radii was specifically designed to provide close proximity and access, the parcels within this service area clearly receive a direct advantage and special benefit from the Improvements - and this advantage is not received by other properties or the public at large.

Moreover, the Madison Place Park site does not provide a restroom or parking lot. Such public amenities were specifically excluded from neighborhood parks because neighborhood parks are designed to be an extension of usable land area specifically for properties in close proximity, and not the public at large or other non-proximate property. The occupants of proximate property do not need to drive to their local park and do not need restroom facilities because they can easily reach their local neighborhood park and can use their own restroom facilities as needed. This is further tangible evidence of the effective extension of land area provided by the Improvements to proximate parcels in the Assessment District and the unique direct advantage the proximate parcels receive from the Improvements.

An analysis of the service radii for the Improvements finds that all properties in the Assessment District enjoy the distinct and direct advantage of being close and proximate to Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District. The benefiting properties in the Assessment District therefore uniquely and specially benefit from the Improvements.

<!-- Page 433 -->
![Page 15](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+15)

**Proximity and access to improved parks and recreational facilities**

Only the specific properties within close proximity to the Improvements are included in the Assessment District. Therefore, property in the Assessment District enjoys unique and valuable proximity and access to the Improvements that the public at large and property outside the Assessment District do not share.

In absence of the assessments, the Improvements would not be provided and the Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District would be degraded due to insufficient funding for maintenance, upkeep and repair. Therefore, the assessments provide Improvements that are over and above what otherwise would be provided. Improvements that are over and above what otherwise would be provided do not by themselves translate into special benefits but when combined with the unique proximity and access enjoyed by parcels in the Assessment District, they provide a direct advantage and special benefit to property in the Assessment District.

Since the parcels in the Assessment District enjoy close access to the Improvements, they directly benefit from this unique close access to improved park and recreation areas that are provided by the Assessments. This is a direct advantage and special benefit to property in the Assessment District.

**Improved Views**

The District, by maintaining and improving the landscaping at the Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District, provides improved views to properties in the Assessment District. The properties in the Assessment District receive this direct advantage because they enjoy close and unique proximity, access, and views of the Improvements. Therefore, the improved and protected views provided by the Assessments are another direct and tangible advantage that is uniquely conferred upon property in the Assessment District.

# General versus Special Benefit and Quantification of General Benefit

The proceeds from the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting Assessment District will be used to fund improvements and increased levels of maintenance to the park and recreation area and facilities proximate to the properties in the Assessment District. In absence of the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting Assessment District, such Improvements would not be provided and the properties would not be subdivided and improved with residential homes. Therefore, the Assessment District is specifically proposed to provide additional and improved public resources in the Assessment District. The assessments will ensure that parks and recreation areas within and adjacent to the Assessment District are well maintained, clean and safe. Moreover, in absence of the assessments, a condition of development would not be met and the subdivision likely would not be approved. The creation of residential lots and the approval for the construction of homes in Gum Ranch is the overriding clear and distinct special benefit conferred exclusively on property in the Assessment District and not enjoyed by other properties outside the Assessment District.

However, in light of **Beutz v. County of Riverside** (2010) and **Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego** (2011), the District has reevaluated the Proposition 218 requirement regarding special and general benefits. Proposition 218 requires an assessing agency to separate the general benefits from the special benefits of a public improvement or service, estimate the quantity of each in relation to the other, and limit the assessment amount to the portion of the improvement or service costs attributable to the special benefits. The courts in Golden Hill and Beutz determined that there usually will be some general benefit associated with a parks improvement project and park-related services, because residents and others who don’t reside in the assessment district probably will use the parks at least to some degree. The separation and quantification of general and special benefits requires an apportionment of the cost of the service or improvement between the two benefit types, and assessing assessment district property owners only for the portion of the cost representing special benefits to the assessment district property. General benefits cannot be funded by assessment revenue. Rather, the funding must come from other sources. The District therefore has analyzed the quantity or extent to which the general public may reasonably be expected to use or benefit from the park and recreation area, in relation to the quantity or extent to which residents of the assessment district use and benefit from the park and recreation area.

Although the park and recreation area may be available to the general public at large, they have been specifically designed, located and created to provide additional and improved public resources for property inside the Assessment District, and not the public at large. Other properties that are outside the Assessment District do not enjoy the unique proximity, access, views, open space and other special benefit factors described previously. The Improvements are of special benefit to properties located within the Assessment District because they provide a direct advantage to properties in the Assessment District that would not be provided in absence of the assessments. The Assessment District allows the District to provide its park and recreation Improvements to the Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District at a much higher level than what otherwise would be provided in absence of the Assessments. Moreover, in absence of the Assessments, no other agency would provide the Improvements nor would the District, because it does not have alternative available funds to provide the Improvements.

All of the Assessment proceeds derived from the Assessment District will be utilized to fund the cost of providing a level of tangible “special benefits” in the form of proximate parks, recreation facilities, signs, and other improvements and costs incidental to providing the Improvements and collecting the Assessments.

Although these Improvements may be available to the general public at large, the Madison Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District were specifically designed, located and created to provide additional and improved public resources for the direct advantage of property inside the Assessment District, and not the public at large. Other properties that are outside the Assessment District do not enjoy the unique proximity, access, views and other special benefit factors described previously.

These Improvements are of special benefit to properties located within the Assessment District because they provide a direct advantage to properties in the Assessment District that would not be provided in absence of the Assessments. Without the Assessments, the Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District might be closed and turn into brown, unmaintained and unusable lands. If this happened, it would create a significant and material negative impact on the desirability, utility and value of property in the Assessment District. If Assessments were not collected, and the Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District were closed and not maintained as a result, properties in the Assessment District may decline in desirability, utility and value.

Special Note Regarding General Benefit and the SVTA Decision:

There is no widely-accepted or statutory formula for calculating general benefit. General benefits are benefits from improvements or services that are not special in nature, are not “particular and distinct” and are not “over and above” benefits received by other properties. SVTA decision provides some clarification by indicating that general benefits

provide “an indirect, derivative advantage” and are not necessarily proximate to the improvements.

In the re-analysis of general benefit, the District determined that there are several attributes and features relating to the park and landscaped area that discourage and limit use by persons who do not reside near the park and landscape area: there are no bathrooms, there are no parking lots, the area is small, the area is designed for passive use and short duration of use (e.g. less than one hour), there are no ball fields for organized sports teams and play, the area is not located on major streets, and the park is hard to find and not a destination park. For similar reasons, these attributes and features make the park much more usable by those who reside within close walking distance.

District staff persons over the years have observed the patterns of usage of similar facilities within the Park District (i.e., Little Phoenix Park) and the persons who use those facilities. Based on these observations, the District has determined that the vast majority of the persons who use this area reside in close proximity, that it is extremely rare for someone to drive to, park at and use this area, and that it is extremely rare for someone to walk to this area from outside the District. The vast majority of users reside in the Assessment District. However, there might be some users who reside in the nearby areas to the south and east of the park, just outside the Assessment District. Based on these observations and the park/landscape area attributes and features that discourage and limit use by persons outside the Assessment District, the District has determined that approximately 5% of the persons who would use the Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District would walk or drive to the area from outside the Assessment District.

With 5% of the Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District usage by non-Assessment District residents, the District estimates and determines that the overall general benefit from the Improvements is 5%. The budget in this report shows that the amount and portion of District funding of the Improvement costs from sources other than assessment revenue exceeds 5%.

The Assessment District’s total assessment budget for the entire Gum Ranch area for the installation, maintenance, servicing and improvements of park facilities is $74,651. Of this total budget amount, the District will utilize $3,805 from sources other than the assessments for the Improvements. This payment by the District equates to over 5% of the total budget for the Improvements, and constitutes more than the amount attributable to the general benefits from the Improvements.

The Assessment District’s total assessment budget for the Zone of Benefit B area for the installation, maintenance, servicing and improvements of park facilities is $34,734. Of this total budget amount, the District will utilize $1750 from sources other than the assessments for the Improvements. This payment by the District equates to over 5% of the total budget for the Improvements, and constitutes more than the amount attributable to the general benefits from the Improvements.

The boundaries of the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District have been carefully drawn to only include the properties in the Park District that are proximate to the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District Improvements and that would materially benefit from the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District Improvements. Certain other properties surrounding and outside the Assessment District were excluded from the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District Improvement area because these properties are generally less proximate to the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District Improvements and/or they do not enjoy the same access, due to roads that don’t go through and/or fences, as described earlier in this Report and in prior Assessment District Engineer’s Reports. In other words, the boundaries of the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District Assessment District have been narrowly drawn to include only properties that will specially benefit from the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District Improvements, and would receive a declining level of service if the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District Assessments were not approved.

In order to add a New Service Area to the northern portion of the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District, the Park District evaluated the scope and area of special benefit from the New Service Area. Through this evaluation, the Park District determined that the northern parcels in the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District receive special benefit from the New Service Area that the parcels in the southern portion of the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District do not receive. Therefore, it was necessary to add a new Zone of Benefit to the existing Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District. This new Zone of Benefit, consisting of the northern parcels which receive additional special benefit from the New Service Area, is designated as Zone of Benefit B. The southern parcels, in order to distinguish them from the parcels in the new Zone of Benefit, are designated as Zone of Benefit A.

In Zone of Benefit B, the advantage that each parcel receives from the Improvements is direct, and the boundaries are narrowly drawn to include only parcels that benefit from the Assessment. The benefits from the Improvements within Zone of Benefit B do not vary based on proximity of the parcels to the Improvements because the increased benefits of greater proximity to the Improvements are generally offset by a parallel increase in negative factors such as higher levels of maintenance vehicles, noise, etc. that comes with increased proximity.

**Method of Assessment**

Because the special benefits from the New Service Area are uniquely enjoyed by the properties in Zone of Benefit B, the Park District has determined that those parcels should pay for the special benefits derived from the proposed increased Assessments, and the parcels in Zone of Benefit A should not. Therefore, the assessable parcels in Zone of Benefit B were mailed a ballot for the proposed increased Assessments, and the parcels in Zone of Benefit A were not.

As previously discussed, the Assessments provide comprehensive Improvements that clearly confer special benefits to properties in the Assessment District. The allocation of special benefits to property is partially based on the type of property and the size of property. These benefits can also partially be measured by the occupants on property in the Assessment District because such parcel population density is a measure of the relative benefit a parcel receives from the Improvements. It should be noted that many other types of “traditional” assessments also use parcel population densities to apportion the assessments. For example, the assessments for sewer systems, roads and water systems are typically allocated based on the population density of the parcels assessed. Therefore, the apportionment of benefit is reasonably based on the type of parcel, the size of parcels and the population density of parcels.

The next step in apportioning assessments is to determine the relative special benefit for each property. This process involves determining the relative benefit received by each property in relation to a single family home, or in other words, on the basis of Single Family Equivalents (SFE). This SFE methodology is commonly used to distribute assessments in proportion to estimated special benefit and is generally recognized as providing the basis for a fair and appropriate distribution of assessments. For the purposes of this Engineer’s Report, all properties are designated a SFE value, which is each property’s relative benefit in relation to a single family home on one parcel. In this case, the “benchmark” property is the single family detached dwelling which is one Single Family Equivalent or one SFE.

In the process of determining the appropriate method of assessment, the Engineer considered various alternatives. For example, an assessment only for all residential improved property was considered but was determined to be inappropriate because commercial, industrial and other properties also receive direct benefits from the Improvements.

Moreover, a fixed or flat assessment is proposed for all single family residential properties regardless of use or parcel size. Assessments on multifamily residential parcels vary based on the number of dwelling units. Assessments on commercial and industrial property are levied on an acreage basis because larger properties generally support larger buildings and have higher numbers of employees, customers and guests who would benefit from proximity and improved access to well-maintained and improved parks and recreational facilities.

<!-- Page 439 -->
![Page 21](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Page+21)

Finally, the special benefits to be derived from the Assessments are conferred on property and are not based on a specific property owner’s use of the improvements, or a specific property owner’s occupancy of property, or the property owner’s demographic status such as age or number of dependents. However, it is ultimately people who value the special benefits described above and use and enjoy the Assessment District’s park and recreational facilities. In other words, the benefits derived to property are related to the average number of people who could potentially live on, work at, or otherwise could use a property, not how the property is currently used by the present owner. Therefore, the number of people who could or potentially live on, work at or otherwise use a property is one indicator of the relative level of benefit received by a property.

In conclusion, the Assessment Engineer determined that the appropriate method of assessment apportionment should be based on the type and use of property, the relative size of the property, property location, its relative population and usage potential, and its proximity to parks and recreational facilities. This method is further described below.

## Residential Properties

Certain residential properties in the proposed Assessment District that contain a single residential dwelling unit are assigned one Single Family Equivalent or 1.0 SFE. Traditional houses, zero-lot line houses, and town homes are included in this category of single family residential property.

Properties with more than one residential unit are designated as multi-family residential properties. These properties benefit from the improvements in proportion to the number of dwelling units that occupy each property, and the average number of people who reside in multi-family residential units versus the average number of people who reside in a single family home. The population density factors for the Park District, as depicted below, provide the basis for determining the SFE factors for residential properties. Using the total population in a certain property type in the area of the Assessment District from the 1990 Census (the most recent data available when this Assessment was established) and dividing it by the total number of households, finds that approximately 2.86 persons occupy each single-family residence, whereas an average of 1.91 persons occupy each multi-family residence. Using the ratio of one SFE for each single-family residence, which equates to one SFE for every 2.86 persons, 0.67 SFE would equate to one multi-family unit or 0.67 SFE for every 1.91 residents. Likewise, each condominium unit receives 0.73 SFE, each duplex, triplex, fourplex receives 0.67 SFE, and each mobile home receives 0.68 SFE.

![Figure 2 – Residential Density and Assessment Factors](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768)

| Total Population | Occupied Households | Persons per Household | SFE Factor |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------|
| Single Family Residential | 20,786 | 7,280 | 2.86 | 1.00 |
| Condominium | 1,456 | 700 | 2.08 | 0.73 |
| Multi-Family Residential | 4,239 | 2,215 | 1.91 | 0.67 |
| Mobile Home on Separate Lot | 27 | 14 | 1.93 | 0.68 |

Source: 1990 Census, Community of Fair Oaks.

The single-family equivalency factor of 0.67 per dwelling unit for multifamily residential properties applies to such properties with 20 or fewer units. Properties in excess of 20 units typically offer on-site recreational amenities and other facilities that tend to offset some of the benefits provided by the improvements. Therefore, the benefit for properties in excess of 20 units is determined to be 0.67 SFE per unit for the first 20 units and 0.10 SFE per each additional unit in excess of 20 dwelling units.

**Commercial/Industrial Properties**

SFE values for commercial and industrial uses are based on the equivalence of special benefit on a land area basis between single family residential property and commercial property. The SFE values for other types of business and industrial lands are established by using average employee densities because the special benefit factors described previously can be measured by the average number of people who work at commercial/industrial properties.

In order to determine employee density factors, the findings from the San Diego Association of Governments Traffic Generators Study (the “SANDAG Study”) are used because these findings were approved by the State Legislature for use in justifying commercial and industrial school facilities fees, and are considered to be a good representation of the average number of employees per acre of land area for commercial and industrial properties. As determined by the SANDAG Study, the average number of employees per acre for commercial property is 24.

In comparison, the average number of people residing in a single-family home in the area is 2.86. Since the average lot size for a single-family home in Fair Oaks is approximately 0.30 acres, the average number of residents per acre of residential property is 9.53.

The employee density per acre is generally 2.50 times the population density of single-family residential property per acre (24 employees per acre / 9.53 residents per acre). Therefore, the average employee density can be used as the basis for allocating benefit to commercial or industrial property since a property with 2.50 employees receives generally similar special benefit to a residential property with 1 resident. This factor of equivalence of benefit between 1 resident to 2.50 employees is the basis for allocating commercial/industrial benefit. The following Figure shows the average employees per acre of land area or portion thereof for commercial and industrial properties, and lists the relative SFE factors per quarter acre for properties in each land use category.

Commercial and industrial properties in excess of 5 acres generally involve uses that are more land intensive relative to building areas and number of employees (lower coverage ratios). As a result, the benefit factors for commercial and industrial property land area in excess of 5 acres is determined to be the SFE rate per quarter acre for the first 5 acres and the relevant SFE rate per each additional acre over 5 acres.

Institutional properties that are used for residential, commercial or industrial purposes are also assessed at the appropriate residential, commercial, or industrial rate.

**Vacant Properties**

The benefit to vacant properties is determined to be proportional to the corresponding benefits for similar type developed properties; however, at a lower rate due to the lack of improvements on the property. A measure of the benefits accruing to the underlying land is the average value of land in relation to improvements for developed property. As a general average, appraisers often use a factor of 25% to 30% of developed property value as land value. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that approximately 25% of the benefits are related to the underlying land and 75% are related to the Improvements and the day-to-day use of the property. Using this ratio, the SFE factor for vacant parcels is 0.25 per parcel.

As properties are approved for development, their value also increases. Likewise, the special benefit received by vacant property increases as the property is approved for development, or becomes closer to being improved. When property is approved for development with a final map, the property has passed the final significant hurdle to development and can shortly undergo construction. Since the property is nearing the point of development, its special benefits increase. In addition, these properties are generally sold soon after completion of improvements, so the properties receive the additional benefit of desirability from prospective buyers due to the special benefits provided by proximity to improved parks and recreational facilities of the Park District. It is therefore determined that property with final map approval receives 50% of the relative benefit to improved property of similar use-type.

**Other Properties**

All properties that are specially benefited are assessed. Other publicly owned property that is used for purposes similar to private residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional uses is benefited and assessed at the same rate as such privately owned property.

Miscellaneous, small and other parcels such as roads, right-of-way parcels, and common areas typically do not generate significant numbers of employees, residents, customers, or guests and have limited economic value. These miscellaneous parcels receive no benefit from the Improvements and are assessed an SFE benefit factor of 0.

**Annual Cost Indexing**

It should be noted that the maximum assessment rate within the Assessment District may increase in future years based on the annual change in the Northern California (San Francisco Bay Area) Consumer Price Index (the “CPI”), with a maximum annual adjustment not to exceed 3%. In the event that the annual change in the CPI exceeds 3%, any percentage change in excess of 3% can be cumulatively reserved and can be added to the annual change in the CPI for years in which the CPI change is less than 3%.

<!-- Page 443 -->
![Page 25](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+25)

**Duration of Assessment**

It is proposed that the Assessment be levied for fiscal year 2006-07 and continued every year thereafter, so long as the Gum Ranch parks and recreational areas need to be improved and maintained, and the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District requires funding from the Assessments for its continued Improvements in the Assessment District. As noted previously, the Assessment can continue to be levied annually after the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Board of Directors approves an annually updated Report, budget for the Assessment, Improvements to be provided, and other specifics of the Assessment. In addition, the District Board of Directors must hold an annual public hearing to continue the Assessment. It must be noted that although the Assessment District was formed in 2006, the assessments were not levied each year as a result of the downturn of the economy, which impeded the construction of homes or recreational facilities in the Gum Ranch development.

**Appeals and Interpretation**

Any property owner who feels that the assessment levied on the subject property is in error as a result of incorrect information being used to apply the foregoing method of assessment, may file a written appeal with the Park District Administrator or his or her designee. Any such appeal is limited to correction of an assessment during the then current or, if before July 1, the upcoming fiscal year. Upon the filing of any such appeal, the Park District Administrator or his or her designee will promptly review the appeal and any information provided by the property owner. If the Park District Administrator or his or her designee finds that the assessment should be modified, the appropriate changes shall be made to the assessment roll. If any such changes are approved after the assessment roll has been filed with the County for collection, the Park District Administrator or his or her designee is authorized to refund to the property owner the amount of any approved reduction. Any property owner who disagrees with the decision of the Park District Administrator or her or his designee may refer their appeal to the Board of Directors of the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District and the decision of the Board of Directors of the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District shall be final.

The assessments are made upon the parcels or lots of land within the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting Assessment District in proportion to the special benefits to be received by the parcels or lots of land, from said Improvements.

The assessments are subject to an annual adjustment tied to the Consumer Price Index for the San Francisco Bay Area as of December of each succeeding year, with the maximum annual adjustment not to exceed 3%. In the event that the annual change in the CPI exceeds 3%, any percentage change in excess of 3% can be cumulatively reserved and can be added to the annual change in the CPI for years in which the CPI change is less than 3%.

The change in the CPI from December 2022 to December 2023 was 2.62% and the Unused CPI carried forward from the previous fiscal year is 3.70%. Therefore, the maximum authorized assessment rate for fiscal year 2024-25 is increased by 3.00% which equates to $250.12 per single family equivalent benefit unit for Zone of Benefit A and $419.92 for Zone of Benefit B. The estimate of cost and budget in this Report proposes assessments for fiscal year 2024-25 at the rate of $250.12 in Zone of Benefit A and $419.92 in Zone of Benefit B, which is equal to the maximum authorized assessment rate for each Zone of Benefit.

Each parcel or lot of land is described in the Assessment Roll by reference to its parcel number as shown on the Assessor's Maps of the County of Sacramento for the fiscal year 2024-25. For a more particular description of said property, reference is hereby made to the deeds and maps on file and of record in the office of the County Recorder of said County.
