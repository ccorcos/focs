Subject: Public Comment for August 21 FOPRD's Board of Directors' Meeting
Date: Tuesday, August 20, 2024 4:07:43 PM

Hi FOPRD:
Believe there are some items that need more community outreach, participation and communications! Attached is a letter for tomorrow nights' Board Meeting, to be read into public comments part of the agenda and hopefully discussed. It is regarding the Band Shell Area Facility.
Think it will help in clarification for all. Thank you, Joe Maloney

Will Old Town Historic Neighborhood Values,
Mesh with FOPRD’s new Band Shell Park Practices?

August 21, 2024

Dear Fair Oaks Park Board Members:

First, please accept this letter as a thank you for your improved orderliness of the Band Shell entertainment CONSTRUCTION area. The neighbors appreciate your recent attention, organization and straightening up of construction materials, sweeping of sidewalks, regular weed eating, removal of unneeded dirt piles, and in general, more attention to details. A special thank you to the Board Members who are also FO residents and would want the same type of care if this long drawn out (over four years now) project was in their front or backyard. Also, looking forward, maybe this is indication of the Projects’ timeline to come; a light(s) on the north end of the outdoor Band Shell roof!

On another related matter, Park neighbors have learned that the Board has authorized a $50,000 dollar grant application to recover costs already paid from Measure J Bond Funds! This time, it’s for reimbursing the costs for the vast number of new light pole fixtures being installed in the BAND SHELL (old Chicken Park) yard. There seems to be about 25 in number on the east side of the property and maybe the same amount on Plaza Park side.

Is the Band Shell Park being re design for individual, family or expanded group entertainment fee for service use? A lot of energy costs for a day use local F O Community park!

Of course, one of our neighborhoods’ interest is when can all expect this Park to be completed? Target date? Also, how you have, unknowingly, engaged in “urban type upgrades (street lighting it up) practices that will impact the entire “historic” area? Hopefully you and
```
<!-- Page 8 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
your staff have paid attention to some of these details and implications.

Specifically, are the many added lights needed for security, design or are they mainly intended for expansion in the number of Park user (more facility fee for increased outside event customers)? When will they be lite; on all nights, continuously? Maybe on sensors when needed or if, say, individuals walk past them? What will be this Parks’ normal use hours and at what time will this Park be closed for Event and individual use? Dusk? Will the YARD Lights (and Music) be automatically switched off to save energy during the night? Will (locked or unlocked) restrooms be a draw for homeless populations or other maintenance problems?

FURTHER MORE, will your expanded entertainment goals have limits? What’s in your Budget and Marketing Plan for numbers and dates for future, to be added, Events? How many Regional or outside of FO Group Events are you planning to rent out for our local Band Shells’ use? (At one past meeting, hopefully in jest, a Board Member stated that these rental facilities would be busy every weekend!) What is your goal for the vastly lite Band Shell area? How much more traffic, parking and neighborhood disruptions can “old town historic property owners and residents” expect?

RE: parking, traffic and crowds, will there be day or hour limits effecting venue (SPILL OVER) street parking? Will District parking slots or other District parking and other restrictions be posted? Will the Sheriffs or FOPRD paid security be added for additional large event traffic and parking controls? Will streets be closed for any non-resident and non-Community (fee for service) special event groups? AND, What’s the maximum number of people in the Band Shell entertainment “yard” at one time? Will you be selling ‘Alcohol’ outdoors at Park events?

At issue: Will the Park Board and its Members take responsibility for their unilateral decisions? Will they cover any residual costs or fall out type expenses and mitigations for new infrastructure services and improvements that they have triggered for and incurred by nearby property owners in the “old town historic neighborhoods?”

The following are some additional concerns raised by your recent and drastic Park policy and venue lighting changes as well as any future fee for facility rental decisions for the Band Shell Yard. You may also want to better inform and provide details on these matters to your neighbors. Quite frankly, old town neighbors are in the dark (excuse the pun) about many un-discussed FOPRD fee for service and Village spending decisions!

For example, are you re-paving and/or adding sidewalk or bike lanes improvements around this East End Park (Main St. Park Ave. California and Temescal)? When and how long will streets be closed? Will all Park District land be fenced; temporary or permanent? Will the existing open access and entry to Band Shell Park be changed or gated for large event controls? If so, where will the new gates be located? Is there
<!-- Page 9 -->

In the past, the neighbors wanted the County and District to fix our existing potholes and make necessary street repairs. NOT ADD NEW or hidden taxes and ASSESSMENTS! How much more might your Parks Board decisions end up costing your neighbors?

There are some that believe that the Park Board may be also instigating a conflict of values and interest between their New Village Regional Park Complex visions, ambitions and policies and the longstanding philosophy of the Old Towns’ rural/suburban neighborhoods’; their charming setting and long standing interests and agreements!

What’s next? The Board must be aware that our existing streets are supple (charming) by intent! What will this “new city look comes to old Fair Oaks” decisions trigger for the rest of us in your “sphere of influence”? Have you queried? When were these implications discussed publicly? Should they have been?

Undoubtedly, the “details” and these types of decisions are and would be of concern if this major Park transformation were happening in any ones’ neighborhood. How did the Old Town Historic Neighborhoods get so lucky?

Just tell us! What are your un-discussed plans? It may be long over due but it is time to share? Details coming soon would be extremely helpful for your neighbors’ thoughtful participation!

Please Note: FOPR Board Members can read or state their response(s) to this inquiry re: the new lighting (energy use purposes), volume of use and other expanded Band Shell Event concerns into the public record after or during the Public Comment Section of the August Board Agenda!

Thank you in advance for your attention to these details.

Jeanne and Joe Maloney on behalf of other concerned Old Town

Residents, Neighbors, Taxpayers and Property Owners

Note: Regarding Sick-Leave hours, a Regular Full-Time employee may choose the Sick Leave payout option and utilize a maximum of 320 hours (as identified within the table above) which will be compensated at 50% of the employees current hourly rate of pay. However, upon retirement from the District, a Regular Full-Time employee December choose to utilize their accrued Sick Leave toward CalPERS service credit with no maximum limit. Employees whose Sick Leave hours exceed 320 hours are noted but the hours in excess of 320 are not calculated as a liability in the table above. A Regular Part-Time employee will be compensated for a maximum of 160 hours of sick leave at 50% of the employees rate of pay upon termination.

Procore is renewed annually (on 4/6) and is based on total volume expected for the year, but is not audited for a credit if we do less than the amount estimated. The project has now entered a new billing cycle for the software since the project was to be done prior to 4/6/24 and its remaining cost had to be factored into the renewal.

Subtotal straight and overtime hour rates will be calculated at column "K" which includes "Fringes Benefits". Please note that ONLY "basic hourly rates" will change for over time and all other "Fringe Benefits" remain the same as straight hourly rates. |
| II Insert Contractor's workman compensation rate at lower section of columns "N" where shows "0.00%" for each contractor/trade. Total hourly rate including "Fringes Benefits" and all "Burden" will be calculated at column "R". Since "Burden" are percentages of the "subtotal straight/NOT hourly rates" they will increase for over time rates and will be calculated automatically by the spreadsheet. |

Good morning guys  

Sorry for the delayed response. The daily rate looks acceptable. We appreciate the efforts by Bobo on this rate.  

Please prep and send a revised PCO reflecting this rate ($2,257/day). **If Bobo would consider that 14 to 21 calendar days (10 to 15 work days) should have been anticipated for typical weather during the year**, which would have been non-compensable, it would go a long way towards resolving the amount(s) presented to the Board.  

Once we receive the revised PCO, I will have discussions with FORPD and push to resolve.  

Thanks,

Hey Dave,  

Went through and fine tuned the calendar day overhead amounts and here is what I have come up with based on the records I have. I can provide backup for these numbers and will but wanted to run it by you first before I started compiling all the information.  

Thanks,

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** August 21, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Mike Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Discussion and Possible Action Regarding the FY 24-25 Recreation Fee Schedule Proposal  
**Prepared By:** Nick Davison, Recreation Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
The Board of Directors:  
1) Open the public hearing;  
2) Receive testimony regarding the revision of the recreation fee schedule (Attachment A);  
3) Close the public hearing; and  
4) Approve Resolution No. 082124-01 (Attachment B) revising the recreation fee schedule, approving new recreation fees and giving the District Administrator & the Recreation Manager authority to waive or reduce program and facility rental fees.  

---

**II. Background**  
In 2010 voters approved Proposition 26, the Supermajority Vote to Pass New Taxes and Fees Act, as part of the November 2, 2010 ballot. Proposition 26 amends Section 3 of Article XIII A and Section 1 of Article XIII C of the California Constitution to provide that a new levy, charge, or exaction of any kind imposed, increased, or extended by a local government is a tax unless an exception applies. Exceptions to Proposition 26 include user fees; government service or product fees; regulatory fees; government property fees; government property entrance fees; fines and penalties imposed by a court or local government; property development impact fees; and assessments and property-related fees governed by Proposition 218.  

According to the requirements outlined in Proposition 26, the District must establish user fees and fees for service based on the cost of providing the service.

which will include direct, indirect, and capital costs. No fee shall exceed the costs reasonably borne by the District in providing the service (Gov. Code 61123). In order to levy a new fee or service charge, staff must follow these requirements (Gov. Code 66018):
- Must hold at least one open and public hearing;
- Any action taken to levy a new fee shall be taken only by ordinance or resolution; and
- A general explanation of the matter to be considered shall be published in accordance with section 6062a of the Government Code.

### III. Problem /Situation / Request
The District’s main goals for the Park and Recreation Fee Schedule is to; comply with the New Taxes and Fees Act (Proposition 26); simplify rate structures; update terms and conditions; and revise rates when deemed appropriate. Staff prepared the Recreation Fee Schedule that separates all District fees into three categories: fees requiring Board approval, the recommended section of fees requiring Administrator approval, and fees requiring no approval as a result of no change in the existing fee.

1. **Board Approval Required**

The current practice of the District is to raise fees for classes, programs, and rentals by no more than $10.00 - $25.00 annually (not all program areas receive an increase annually); and based on the original fee for some items a 20% increase could actually amount to between $1.00 and $3.00. However, there are some instances where a 20% increase could reflect more than a $10 increase, which staff recommends requiring Board approval. Additionally, all new and/or removed programs (fees) are important to communicate to the Board and the public. All proposed items requiring Board approval are significant enough that the Board should be made aware of these items and approve said items to create an understanding within the community that we are in fact requesting feedback and approval on any and all major changes that may affect District customers. It should be noted that after conducting research within the industry, this tends to be the practice for other parks and recreation agencies.

2. **Administrator Approval Only:**

The ability of the Administrator to approve fees modified by 19% or less allows staff the ability to modify fees throughout the fiscal year without waiting until the annual fee schedule approval by the Board. Fees within the category of 19% or less typically represent items such as a deposits, drop-in classes, etc.

3. NC is used to identify no change in fees

The Board’s adoption of Resolution 082124-01, will establish a fee schedule for the performance of various Parks and Recreation Department services and for the permitted use of District property. The approval of this resolution will allow:

- The fee schedule to be amended by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation or the experience of the District in the administration of the program.

- The Administrator and the Recreation Manager have the discretion to waive or reduce fees as deemed appropriate.

- Any new fees, fees modified by 20% or more, and fees proposed to be eliminated will be presented annually to the Board for approval prior to each fiscal year. Modifications to existing fees of less than 20% would be presented to the Administrator for approval during the same process.

**Fee Effective Dates**  
All eliminated, modified or new fees will take effect immediately following the August 2024 Board meeting.

**Public Meeting Notice**  
The Public Meeting Notice for the review of a Park and Recreation Fee Schedule was published in the Citrus Heights Messenger on July 29th to ensure a compliance with California Code Title 4 Section 6062a, which requires at least one public hearing notice be published ten days prior to the identified public hearing date, as required by law. The law allows the Board to hold a public hearing and introduce and approve the resolution by action of the Board. The fees can go into effect immediately after the adoption of the resolution.

**IV. Financial Analysis**  
Included in this report are the fee modifications to recreation programs, facilities, and events. The financial impact of the recommended fee modifications is a potential increase in the Department's revenue to offset the increased costs in.

part-time minimum wage increases, and various operational expense increases. Additionally, the recommended new fees have various start dates which will impact when new revenue is earned.

## BEFORE THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE FAIR OAKS RECREATION & PARK DISTRICT

### County of Sacramento, State of California

### A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FAIR OAKS RECREATION & PARK DISTRICT ESTABLISHING A FEE SCHEDULE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF VARIOUS PARK AND RECREATION SERVICES

WHEREAS the District intends to adopt Resolution No. 082124-01 which sets forth a fee schedule for various recreation programs and fees; and

WHEREAS budgetary considerations have required this schedule of fees to be adopted; and

WHEREAS California Government Code Sections 61123 and 66018 authorize the District to adopt a fee schedule to defray the cost of providing services to the general public; and

WHEREAS the Board of Directors desires that the District Administrator & the Recreation Manager have the authority to waive fees when it is deemed, in his or her sole discretion, to be in the best interests of the residents of the District; and

NOW, THEREFORE, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FAIR OAKS RECREATION & PARK DISTRICT DOES HEREBY RESOLVE AS FOLLOWS:

**Section 2. Establishment of a Fee Schedule:** The Board of Directors establishes the fee schedule set forth in Attachment “A” incorporated herein.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** August 21, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Sales Agreement of the Miller Park Cell Tower Leases to Towerpoint Capital and Adoption of Resolution No. 082124-02  

I. **Recommendation**  
Approve the execution of an Easement Agreement by and between Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District and TPA VII LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company and authorizing the District Administrator to sign said Easement Agreement (Attachment A) on behalf of the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District and to execute all closing documents related to such Easement Agreement, including an Assignment of Lease (Attachment B).  

II. **Background**  
The District currently holds a lease for a cell tower located at Miller Park. After thorough discussions with Towerpoint Capital, the Board approved moving forward with the sale of the lease at their June 26, 2024, meeting, recognizing it as a valuable asset of the District. Initially, the lease was set for a term of 99 years. However, due to challenges presented by Sacramento County, the term was adjusted to a perpetual agreement. It has been determined that this change is immaterial and does not affect the overall value or terms of the sale.  
The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District (FORPD) has been negotiating the sale of its Cell Tower Lease at Miller Park to TPA VII LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The Lease includes agreements with Verizon Wireless and Sprint Spectrum L.P., which have historically generated revenue for the District. After careful consideration, the Board has determined that selling this asset will benefit the District strategically and financially.
<!-- Page 128 -->
### III. Problem /Situation/ Request
The District needs to finalize the sale of the Cell Tower Lease by executing several key documents. These documents and their associated terms are as follows:

1. **Easement Agreement:**
   - **Purpose:** Establishes perpetual easements for access, utilities, and communication services, allowing the Assignee (TPA VII LLC) to maintain and operate the Cell Tower.
   - **Term:** The easement is perpetual and will run with the land.

2. **Assignment of Lease:**
   - **Transfer of Rights:** FORPD will transfer all its rights, title, and interest in the Cell Tower Lease to TPA VII LLC.
   - **Consideration:** TPA VII LLC will pay FORPD $2,001,000 for the assignment of the lease.
   - **Indemnification:** TPA VII LLC agrees to indemnify and hold FORPD harmless from any liabilities, claims, or damages arising after the effective date of the assignment.
   - **Assumption of Obligations:** TPA VII LLC will assume all responsibilities and obligations under the existing lease agreements with Verizon Wireless and Sprint Spectrum L.P., including any maintenance or operational costs.

3. **Purchase Agreement:**
   - **Purchase Price:** The total sale price for the Cell Tower Lease is $2,001,000.
   - **Closing Conditions:** The sale is contingent upon the successful execution of the Easement Agreement, Assignment of Lease, and other necessary documents.
   - **Representations and Warranties:** FORPD and TPA VII LLC make standard representations and warranties regarding their authority to enter into the agreement and the accuracy of the provided information.

4. **Corporate Resolution:**
   - **Authorization:** This resolution formally authorizes FORPD to execute and deliver the Easement Agreement, Assignment of Lease, Purchase Agreement, and any other related documents.
   - **Delegation of Authority:** The Board authorizes the District Administrator to carry out all actions necessary to complete the transaction.

### IV. Financial Analysis
The sale of the Cell Tower Lease will provide FORPD with a one-time payment of $2,001,000. Selling the cell tower lease to Towerpoint Capital will provide FORPD with a one-time payment of $2,001,000. The District will incur closing costs of $4,000 for the sale and will pay 5% of the purchase price, amounting to $102,750, to NAI for their services in brokering the sale. For an estimated financial gain to the District of $1,948,250.
<!-- Page 129 -->
FORPD’s Attorney has thoroughly reviewed and assisted in negotiating the terms of the lease sale, ensuring all documents have been properly vetted. The attorney fees associated with this legal assistance are and have been accounted for within the District’s legal budget. These fees are expected to represent a minor portion of the total sale proceeds.

A portion of the funds from the sale of the lease will be allocated to replace the seating in the Veteran's Memorial Amphitheater. The cost estimation to replace the seating is $904,935:

The remaining estimated balance of $1,043,315 will require Board approval for utilization, and potential options for these funds include investing them in an investment fund similar to the Measure J funds that were invested with the Sacramento County investment pool or another comparable investment fund.

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

6. **Right of First Refusal.** Grantor grants to Grantee the right to acquire through assignment, purchase, or other means any lease or similar conveyance for telecommunications purposes in which Grantor retains an interest outside the Easement (“Grantor’s Lease”). Grantor shall deliver to Grantee, a copy of any offer to purchase an interest in Grantor’s Lease. Grantee shall have thirty (30) business days to match the terms of any offer by delivering written notice of Grantee’s intent to match the offer.

7. **Grantor Cooperation and Non-interference.** Grantor hereby agrees at no cost to Grantor, to reasonably cooperate with Grantee and/or Telecom Tenant, Replacement Telecom Tenant and Rent Share Tenant (collectively, “Easement Tenants”) in obtaining all licenses, permits or authorizations from all applicable governmental and/or regulatory entities and in acquiring any necessary upgrades to or relocation of utility service to support the Permitted Use. In furtherance of the foregoing, Grantor hereby appoints Grantee as Grantor's attorney-in-fact to execute all land use applications, permits, licenses and other approvals on Grantor's behalf in connection with the Permitted Use. Grantor’s cooperation shall be at no cost to Grantor and without requiring payment of additional rent or fees by Grantee or Easement Tenants. Grantor shall not interfere with any construction in the Easement so long as such construction is to support the Permitted Use and does not materially and adversely interfere with Grantor’s use of the Property outside of the Easement and its proceeding pursuant to a building permit or other required municipal or governmental approvals. Grantor shall not, nor shall Grantor permit its lessees, licenses, employees, invitees or agents, to use any portion of the Parent Property or the Easement in a way which materially interferes with the operations of Grantee. Grantor shall have peaceful and quiet possession and enjoyment of the Easement. Grantor may not directly or indirectly induce, invite, or conspire to induce or invite any Easement Tenants to use or lease space in direct competition with the Easement. Subject to the rights of Grantee under this Agreement, Grantee shall not use the Easement in a manner that interferes with the use of the Parent Property by Grantor or other lessees or licensees of Grantor, with rights in the Parent Property (excluding the Easement) superior to Grantee.

8. **Assignment.** Grantee may pledge, assign, mortgage, grant a security interest, or otherwise encumber the limited interest created by this Agreement provided that any such security interest shall, subject to Section 11 herein, be subordinate to and not interfere with the right of any mortgage holder on the Parent Property, including its right to foreclose on the Parent Property subject to Section 11 herein. Grantee may freely assign this Agreement in part or in its entirety, and any or all of its rights hereunder, including the right to receive rent payments. Upon the absolute assumption of such assignee of all of the obligations of Grantee under this Agreement, then Grantee will be relieved of all obligations and liabilities hereunder.

9. **Taxes and Other Obligations.** All taxes and other obligations that are or could become liens against the Parent Property or any subdivision of the Parent Property containing the Easement, whether existing as of the Effective Date or hereafter created or imposed, shall be paid by Grantor prior to delinquency or default. Grantor shall be solely responsible for payment of all taxes and assessments now or hereafter levied, assessed or imposed upon the Parent Property, or imposed in connection with the execution, delivery, performance or recordation hereof, including without limitation any sales, income, documentary or other transfer taxes. If Grantor fails to pay when due any taxes or other obligations affecting the Parent Property, Grantee shall have the right but not the obligation to pay such and demand payment therefor from Grantor, which payment Grantor shall make within ten (10) days of such demand by Grantee.

10. Insurance. During the Term, Easement Tenants shall maintain general liability insurance as required under their respective lease. Grantor shall maintain any insurance policies in place on the Parent Property or as required under the Telecom Tenant Lease.

11. Subordination and Non-Disturbance. Grantee agrees to subordinate this Agreement to any existing or future mortgage or deed of trust on the Parent Property ("Security Instrument"), provided the beneficiary or secured party ("Secured Party") under the Security Instrument agrees for itself and its successors in interest and assigns that Grantee's rights under this Agreement and rights to the Easement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected or disturbed by the Secured Party in the exercise of Secured Party's rights under the Security Instrument during the Term, including Grantee's right to collect and retain, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, all rents, fees and other payments due from Easement Tenants. Such non-disturbance agreement must apply whether Secured Party exercises its rights under the Security Instrument, including foreclosure, sheriff's or trustee's sale under the power of sale contained in the Security Instrument, and any other transfer, sale or conveyance of Grantor's interest in the Parent Property under peril of foreclosure, including, without limitation to the generality of the foregoing, an assignment or sale in lieu of foreclosure.

12. Mutual General Indemnification. Grantor and Grantee shall each indemnify and hold harmless the other against any and all claims, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and disbursements) caused by or arising out of the indemnifying party’s breach of this Agreement or the negligent acts or omissions or willful misconduct on the Parent Property by the indemnifying party or the employees, agents, or contractors of the indemnifying party.

Grantor represents and warrants that, to the best of Grantor’s knowledge, no pollutants or other toxic or hazardous substances, as defined under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq., or any other federal or state law, including any solid, liquid, gaseous, or thermal irritant or contaminant, such as smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals or waste (including materials to be recycled, reconditioned or reclaimed) (collectively, “Hazardous Substances”) have been, or shall be discharged, disbursed, released, stored, treated, generated, disposed of, or allowed to escape or migrate (collectively referred to as the “Release”) on or from the Parent Property. Neither Grantor nor Grantee shall introduce or use any Hazardous Substances on the Parent Property or the Easement in violation of any applicable federal, state or local environmental laws.

b. Grantor and Grantee each agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the other from and against any and all administrative and judicial actions and rulings, claims, causes of action, demands and liability including, but not limited to, damages, costs, expenses, assessments, penalties, fines, cleanup, remedial, removal or restoration work required by any governmental authority, losses, judgments and reasonable attorneys’ fees that the indemnified party may suffer or incur due to the existence or discovery of any Hazardous Substances on the Parent Property caused by the other party. Grantee shall not be responsible for and shall not defend, indemnify or hold harmless Grantor for any Release of Hazardous Substances on or before the Effective Date.

14. Dispute Resolution and Notice.

under applicable law, and may seek specific performance, injunction, appointment of a receiver and any other equitable rights and remedies available under applicable law. Money damages may not be an adequate remedy for the harm caused to Grantee by a breach or default by Grantor hereunder, and Grantor waives the posting of a bond. Damages as against Grantee shall be limited to the amount of consideration received by Grantor under this Agreement, following any insurance settlement which may have effect. The prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Neither party shall be liable to the other for consequential, indirect, speculative or punitive damages.

b. The non-defaulting party shall provide written notice of a default under this Agreement or under an Easement Tenants’ lease, not more than thirty (30) days from discovery of the default. From the date of such notice, the defaulting party shall have thirty (30) days to cure the default, unless the default cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days in which case the defaulting party shall have such additional time as necessary to cure the default so long as the defaulting party has commenced to cure the default and is diligently pursuing completion of the cure.

c. All communications shall be delivered by certified mail, return receipt requested or a nationally recognized overnight courier to the address beneath each party’s signature block or such other address as advised to the other party pursuant to this Section. Notice shall be deemed given upon receipt if by certified mail, return receipt requested or one (1) business day following the date of sending, if sent by nationally recognized overnight courier service or upon attempted delivery if delivery is refused or if delivery is impossible because of failure to provide reasonable means for accomplishing delivery.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Grantor and Grantee acknowledge that this Agreement is subject and subordinate to the Telecom Tenant Lease.

b. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and the successors and assigns of the parties to this Agreement.

# STAFF REPORT

**Meeting Date:** August 21, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Request for Cost-of-Living Adjustment and Results of Salary Study  
**Prepared By:** Jennifer Larkin, Administrative Services Manager  

## I. Recommendation
1. Accept the recommendation of the Personnel and Management Committee and the Budget and Finance Committee and implement a 3.9% Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) for Fiscal Year 2024-2025 for all full-time staff.
2. Authorize staff to put out a Request for Proposal for a comprehensive compensation study.

## II. Background
Each year the Employees Association (EA) may request a COLA for the upcoming Fiscal Year. The request is typically presented to the Board during final budget for approval.

The EA also completed a salary survey in April of 2024 as directed by the MOU, and the results were discussed with the Personnel and Management Committee on August 12, 2024.

## III. Problem / Situation / Request
The Employees Association requested a COLA of 3.9%, in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, on March 15, 2024 (Attachment A). As directed in the MOU, the index used for the request is the California All-Urban Consumer Price Index (CPI), which for 2023 was 3.9%. The request was presented to the Management and Personnel Committee on August 12, 2024 and to the Finance and Budget Committee on the same date. The Committees recommended implementation provided adequate funding is available and requested information on COLA’s of other local Districts which.

| Agency                          | Percentage |
|---------------------------------|------------|
| Carmichael Rec & Park District  | 4%         |
| Cordova Rec & Park District     | 3%         |
| El Dorado Hills CSD            | 3%         |
| Fulton-El Camino Rec & Park District | N/A      |
| Mission Oaks Rec & Park District | 2%         |
| Orangevale Rec & Park District  | 4%         |
| Sunrise Rec & Park District     | 0%         |

The Salary Study (Attachment B) was prepared by the Employees’ Association as directed by the MOU using the agreed upon positions and agencies for comparison. Based on their findings, the EA requested an 8% increase to all positions that were benchmarked, which is an impact of over $100k to the budget.

However, the summary of results indicates that some positions are below average, some are right at the market average, and some are above average. This variation is significant and requires further analysis. Additionally, it has been discussed and recommended by the Personnel and Management Committee previously that the District would benefit from a comprehensive compensation study and organizational audit of positions to ensure resources are being utilized in the most efficient manner. Therefore, staff is requesting the Board authorize a request for proposal (RFP) to solicit bids and come back to the committee with costs and options for this kind of study.

IV. Financial Analysis  
The impact to the budget for the COLA is $53K. Funds have been identified and included in the final budget.

The cost to do a comprehensive study of the District’s personnel compensation and organization is unknown and has not been budgeted for FY24-25. A report back to the committee will occur once the proposals have been received and funding will be identified if the Board chooses to move forward with the study.

Respectfully Submitted,  
Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** August 21, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Approval of the Addition of Juneteenth to the District’s Official Holiday List  
**Prepared By:** Jennifer Larkin, Administrative Services Manager  

I. **Recommendation**  
The Personnel and Management Committee has made no recommendation for this request. The Board can choose one of the following options:  
- Add Juneteenth as an official District paid holiday;  
- Add a second floating holiday to be used only for a pre-approved holiday list to be compiled and approved by the District Administrator; or  
- Do not add a holiday at this time and revisit at a later date.  

II. **Background**  
During negotiations with the Employees’ Association for the Memorandum of Understanding for 2024-2027 (MOU), the District Administrator requested that Juneteenth be added to the official list of paid holidays. The Employees’ Association agreed with this request, which was discussed with the Personnel and Management Committee on June 3, 2024. The Committee did not make a recommendation, and the item went to the full Board as part of the approval of the MOU.  

While the Board did vote to adopt the MOU, this item was removed for further consideration. Director Irwin recommended replacing the Floating Holiday with Juneteenth to avoid adding another paid holiday.  

Following the June Board meeting, the Employees’ Association met and reviewed this option and rejected the loss of the Floating Holiday. They recommended as an alternative adding an additional floating holiday that could only be used for a pre-approved holiday list to be compiled and approved by the District Administrator.
<!-- Page 162 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

**approved by the District Administrator. Examples could be: Juneteenth, Cesar Chavez Day, Indigenous Peoples Day, Ramadan and Holi.**

The Employees Association presented this option to the Personnel and Management Committee on August 12, 2024, and the Committee was split and did not make a recommendation.

### III. Problem /Situation/ Request
The District currently has 12 paid holidays plus one floating holiday. The addition of Juneteenth, or a second floating holiday would bring the total to 14. The table below shows local government agencies, the number of holidays they offer their staff, whether Juneteenth is a stand-alone holiday, or whether they have an option for floating holidays in lieu of Juneteenth. A little over a third have Juneteenth as a paid holiday, while over half offer a floating holiday in lieu of Juneteenth.

**Meeting Date:** August 21st, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Mike Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Approval of Technical Supervisor Position and Job Description  
**Prepared By:** Jen Schuler, Arts & Entertainment Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
As recommended by the Management and Personnel Committee at their August 12th, 2024, committee meeting, approve staff’s proposal to implement an additional full-time Technical Supervisor position to work in the Arts & Entertainment Division.

**II. Background**  
The voters of Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District passed the General Obligation Bond Measure J in November 2018. The renovations of Village/Plaza Park, the Community Clubhouse, and Veterans Memorial Amphitheatre are part of this bond measure. As these projects near completion, the need for a dedicated Technical Supervisor has become evident. This position is essential for the efficient operation and management of the center's technical aspects, ensuring the successful execution of productions, events, and performances.

The new Technical Supervisor will bring expertise in technical theater operations, equipment management, and team leadership, significantly contributing to the overall success of the center. The role will be crucial in maximizing the benefits of the Measure J-funded renovations, ensuring that the upgraded facilities are used to their full potential and provide high-quality experiences for the community.

Given the financial constraints, securing funding for this position is vital. Sacramento County has been proactive in using the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021 to support local entities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The County’s State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund provides grants to mitigate financial hardship.
<!-- Page 164 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

including support for payroll and benefits, employee retention costs, and other operating expenses.

Recognizing the potential of these funds, our staff requested ARPA funds to support the Fair Oaks Performance Art Center. This request aligns with the County’s objective to provide relief to financially impacted organizations, ensuring they can continue to serve the community effectively.

On April 3, 2024, Sacramento County Board Supervisor Rich Desmond met with FORPD Board Chair Ralph Carhart and District Administrator Mike Aho, announcing a $130,000 award in ARPA funds to FORPD. This generous allocation will significantly aid in the operational costs and sustainability of the Fair Oaks Performance Art Center. By using $88,500 of these ARPA funds for the first year’s salary of the Technical Supervisor, we can ensure this critical position is filled, allowing us to maintain seamless operations and provide high-quality productions and events from the outset.

### III. Problem /Situation / Request
The Fair Oaks Performance Art Center, along with the facilities developed through Measure J funds, is at a pivotal stage where the appointment of a dedicated Technical Supervisor is crucial for operational success. The current absence of a Technical Supervisor introduces several operational risks:

i. **Technical Expertise Gap:** Without a Technical Supervisor, there is a lack of necessary technical knowledge and leadership for effective management.

ii. **Coordination Complications:** The absence of a centralized technical coordinator can result in logistical inefficiencies and confusion across productions and events.

iii. **Equipment Mismanagement Risk:** Proper maintenance, inventory control, and utilization of technical equipment are essential. Without dedicated oversight, there is a risk of equipment damage, loss, or inefficiency.

iv. **Compromised Production Quality:** A Technical Supervisor ensures productions meet the highest technical standards, enhancing the experience for performers and audiences.

This strategic investment will enhance the operational efficiency of our new facilities and ensure they are utilized to their full potential, providing cultural enrichment and community engagement opportunities.

This allocation provides time for staff to create and stabilize a revenue source for the ongoing funding of the position. The Technical Supervisor will ensure seamless execution of productions, events, and performances at the new performing arts.

center and other district facilities. This role is essential for the efficient operation and management of the new Arts and Entertainment program, contributing significantly to the overall future success of the Center.

The attached job description (Attachment A) was reviewed by the Management and Personnel Committee on August 12, 2024, along with the Financial Pro Forma for the new Performing Arts Center (Attachment B). The committee supports the job description draft and recommends approval from the full board this evening.

IV. Financial Analysis  
The first year's salary of $88,500 for the Technical Production Manager will be funded by the $130,000 that Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District received from Sacramento County through Supervisor Rich Desmond via the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Funds. This request includes a financial analysis (attachment B-Financial Pro Forma) for sustaining the position in the long term, in the form of revenues from ticket sales, facility fees, venue rentals, sponsorships.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** August 21st, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Mike Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Award of Bid for AV, Lighting and Draperies  
**Prepared By:** Jen Schuler, Arts & Entertainment Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Award Bid No. BP#24-101 for Production Lighting and Stage Draperies for the Village Park Community Center. The total amount is Three Hundred Twenty-Nine Thousand Nine Hundred and Thirty-Eight Dollars ($329,938.00) which includes a Thirty Thousand Dollar ($30,000) contingency for the purchase, installation, and training associated with the lighting and drapery systems for the renovated Village Park Community Center/Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center.

It should be noted that Bid No. BP#24-102 for Audio-Visual FF&E did not receive any applicants. As a result, we will proceed with acquiring quotes for the Audio-Visual Equipment, with the guidance of our theater consultant (The Shalleck Collaborative Inc.) to determine the appropriate contractor.

Authorize the District Administrator to execute all agreements and contracts associated with this award (see Attachment A) and to approve change orders up to the $30,000 allowance included in the total bid amount.

---

**II. Background**  
The Village Park Community Center Project is a significant initiative funded by the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District (FORPD) through Measure J, a $26.9 million General Obligation Bond approved by voters in November.
<!-- Page 183 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

2018. This bond is designed to enhance and expand the services offered by the FORPD, with the Village Park Community Center being one of the four key projects identified in the bond measure.  
The centerpiece of this project is the renovation of the Veterans Memorial Amphitheatre and the creation of a state-of-the-art Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center. These improvements include the installation of advanced production lighting, a comprehensive audio-visual system, and upgraded stage draperies. The technical enhancements are crucial for transforming the theatre into a modern facility capable of hosting a wide range of performances and events, thereby increasing its utility and appeal to the community.  

Bids for Production Lighting and Stage Draperies were received by the District on August 15th, 2024 with two pre-qualified and bonded contractors bidding on the project. The bids included a required $30,000 allowance for unforeseen expenditures.  
- $299,938.00 ($329,938.00)  
- $324,650.00 ($354,650.00)  

Expenditures of the $30,000 allowance must have prior approval from the District.  

III. Problem / Situation / Request  
Given the lack of applicants for the Audio-Visual FF&E bid, the District will seek quotes for this essential equipment. The District will issue a notice to proceed for the awarded Bid No. BP#24-101 for Production Lighting and Stage Draperies with construction to begin August 26th, 2024.  

IV. Financial Analysis  
The low bid of $329,938.00 was received from Musson Theatrical, Inc. Funding for this project will be paid from Measure J funding.  

Respectfully Submitted,  

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

## II. Background
Each year the Board of Directors must adopt the District’s Preliminary Budgets prior to July 1 which provides funding for District operations for the coming fiscal year (beginning July 1 and ending June 30). When the Preliminary Budgets are adopted in June, the final year-end financial data is not yet available as the current fiscal year does not end until June 30. Final Budgets are adopted in August/September which include the best available data from the prior fiscal year (final fund balance, actual revenue collections, and actual expenditures) and serves as the District’s expenditure plan for the fiscal year ahead. The Final Budget was discussed with and reviewed by the Finance and Budget Committee on Monday, August 12, and their comments are included in this report.

## III. Problem /Situation / Request
### FY 24/25 Recommended Final Budget
The FY 24/25 recommended Final budget totals $3,676,759 and contains full-year funding for authorized permanent positions, services and supplies expenditures and capital expenditures. The Final Budget was prepared with the year-end actual expenditure/revenue data. The following highlights provide information on changes from the FY 24/25 Preliminary Budget to the recommended FY 24/25 Final Budget.

### Salaries and Benefits
#### Salaries
Salaries and benefits increased from Preliminary Budget by total of $28,700. There were savings as well as increased revenue projections that offset the increase in full-time salaries stemming from the 3.9% COLA request by the Employees’ Association, detailed in the table below:

| Expenditure/Revenue       | Savings/Revenue |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| Part Time wages           | ($4,732)         |
| Workers Compensation       | ($27,976)       |
| Property Tax              | $30,838          |
| Additional Interest Income | $7,000           |

### COLA
In March 2024, the Employees' Association requested a COLA of 3.9% in line with the California All-Urban Consumer Price Index as directed by the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The budget impact of implementation is $53K.

The Management and Personnel Committee and the Budget and Finance Committee both agreed to recommend the COLA based on the understanding that through savings and additional revenues the District budget would continue to be balanced with no additional funding coming from savings for implementation.
<!-- Page 188 -->
Health Care Costs  
The Preliminary Budget contained a 5% increase for anticipated health care cost increases. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Employees association provides for no more than a 5% increase to the prior year’s maximum health rate. The Resolution establishing health care rates consistent with the methodology set forth in the MOU resulted in an increase in the limits as indicated below.  

|            | Single   | 2-Party   | Family     |
|------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| FY 24/25   | $1138.78 | $2277.56  | $2960.83   |
| FY 23/24   | $1083.98 | $2167.96  | $2818.35   |

Two additional employees have opted to receive health benefits since the preliminary budget was developed which has resulted in an increase to this expense of $12K. That is partially offset by a decrease in the stipend with a net increase of $8K.  

The Board is asked to adopt a Resolution (Attachment G) which sets the health care rates consistently with the MOU and the calculations above.  

Retirement Costs  
There was an increase of $3,997 in the retirement costs tied to an increase of salaries from the COLA.  

Workers Compensation Insurance  
There was a $27,976 decrease in Workers Compensation insurance from what was budgeted for Preliminary Budget based on the actual invoice received from CAPRI. The District’s excellent safety record, and specifically the Parks department, have continued to lower costs over the last 5 years.  

Service and Supply Cost Changes for Final Budget  
The following substantial changes were made for final budget:  
- $9,074 increase in insurance liability costs based on the actual invoice from CAPRI.  

Capital Program Expenditures  
No changes to the Capital Plan were made for final budget.  

FY 24/25 Intrafund Reimbursements Changes for Final Budget  
No changes were made for the Final Budget.  

FY 24/25 Property Tax Revenues - Property Taxes  
Property Tax Revenue increased $30,363 from Preliminary to Final Budget based on actual collections and information from the Sacramento County Tax Assessor’s office.  

FY 24/25 Cell Tower Lease Revenues  
No changes were made to the final budget. Pending the final sale of the cell tower leases, this revenue will be supplanted by revenue from the sale.

No changes were made to the final budget.

**Use of Contingency**  
The Final Budget contains contingency funding of $50,000 for FY 24/25.

The Final Budget contains full-year funding for permanent positions and provides an expenditure plan for base level operations and a variety of additions that are detailed above.

**Meeting Date:** August 21, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Adoption of Fiscal Year 2024-2025 Final Budget for the Bond Fund 341C  
**Prepared By:** Jennifer Larkin, Administrative Services Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Accept the recommendation of the Finance and Budget committee and adopt Resolution No. 082124-09: A Resolution of the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Adopting FY 2024-2025 Final Budget for the Bond Fund 341C.

**II. Background**  
In November of 2018, the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District community passed Measure J, a general obligation bond, to fund capital projects in the District. The first series of bonds was issued in April of 2019, with the Director of Finance of Sacramento County acting as the District’s paying agent. The second series was issued in April of 2020 and the third in November of 2022.

Proceeds from both bond sales are held in a County fund, the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Building Fund, Election of 2018, Series 2019, Series 2020 and Series 2022 which is an investment fund that is not co-mingled with any other County funds but upon which the District may draw against for Bond projects.

This is the final budget which follows the adoption of the preliminary budget in June. No new items or projects have been added, and no changes were made.

**III. Financial Analysis**  
This budget includes the full funding for all Board approved bond projects. It also includes fund, legal services and audit services. This budget represents amounts approved by the
<!-- Page 212 -->
Board for projects. Funding cannot exceed approved amounts without further action from the Board.

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Meeting Date:** August 21st, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** District Support for California Proposition 4, the Parks, Environment, Energy, and Water Bond Measure.  
**Prepared By:** Sean Ventura, Parks & Facilities Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Staff recommends the endorsement of Senate Bill 867, otherwise known as California Proposition 4.

**II. Background**  
Staff continually keeps apprised of legislation occurring at both the State and Federal levels which present new funding opportunities, proposed laws which may affect Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District or align with the goals of the District as stated in our mission statement. Due to this, staff has become aware of Senate Bill 867, which will be on the ballot in November of 2024.

California Proposition 4 is a proposed general obligation bond which could potentially produce funding for State and local parks, environmental protection projects (safe drinking water and clean air), water infrastructure projects, energy projects, and flood protection projects. The proposed bond issuance would be for a total sum of $10 billion.

There is a website available which allows organizations to endorse Proposition 4. This endorsement only serves to note how the Proposition may align with an organization’s mission, vision, or goals and serves to raise awareness for the Proposition to the general voting public.

**III. Problem / Situation / Request**  
Staff feels that California Proposition 4 is in the best interest of both State and local parks & recreation organizations, as well as the general.
<!-- Page 224 -->
IV. Financial Analysis  
There is no financial impact to the District due to endorsing California Proposition 4.  

Respectfully Submitted,  

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

**Meeting Date:** August 21<sup>st</sup>, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Policy Adoption – Tree Protection Policy  
**Prepared By:** Sean Ventura, Parks & Facilities Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Staff recommends that the Board of Directors approve the adoption of the attached Tree Protection Policy.  

**II. Background**  
In late 2023, staff was instructed by a member of the Board of Directors to create a tree protection policy for immediate implementation by the District. This policy was to restrict activities of District staff and contractors when those activities could prove harmful to the long-term health and safety of the trees on District managed properties.  

Staff met with the Policy Review Committee on August 12<sup>th</sup>. At that meeting, staff received feedback from the committee and has implemented that feedback into the policy now being presented before the Board of Directors.  

**III. Problem / Situation / Request**  
As requested, staff has created a Tree Protection Policy (Attachment A) which utilizes guidelines pulled from the Sacramento Tree Foundation, the International Society of Arboriculture, and generally accepted best practices for construction sites when interfacing with existing trees. This policy is intended to guide District staff in their work around trees. The policy likewise will bind contractors working on District grounds; however, guidelines for tree protection for larger construction projects will still be implemented by way of contract language for those individual projects.

# TREE PROTECTION POLICY

## PURPOSE
It is the intent of the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District to protect the urban forest within its boundaries in order to provide a long-lasting canopy which can be enjoyed by future generations. To that end, Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District is initiating the following policy in regards to tree protection throughout its properties.

This policy is intended to support rather than replace any tree protection guidelines outlined within Sacramento County Code.

This policy is intended as a guideline for District staff and independent contractors performing work on District-managed properties. This policy is not intended to supersede any tree protection guidelines outlined as part of Capital construction projects.

## DEFINITIONS

- **Compaction** – The exertion of force on soil so that it becomes more dense.
- **Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)** – A standard method of expressing the diameter of the trunk or bole of a standing tree. Tree trunks are measured at the height of an adult's breast, standardized at 4 ½ above the ground.

<!-- Page 229 -->
should provide “Good” Protection.

b. Heavy equipment should not be allowed to drive over, through, or remain at rest within the RPZ of any tree.  
   i. An exception should be made for any heavy equipment necessary for pruning or other tree-health related tasks.  
      1. When heavy equipment is present in any tree's RPZ, ¾" plywood should be placed within the equipment's path of travel in order to reduce compaction.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** August 21st, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Approval of a Chair Dedication Policy  
**Prepared By:** Jen Schuler, Arts & Entertainment Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Approve the Chair Dedication Policy as recommended by the Policy Review Committee.  

**II. Background**  
The Policy Review Committee met on August 15, 2024, to review several new policies, including a Chair Dedication Policy. The committee recommended eliminating references to "Dedications" for the Black Box Theatre to avoid confusion, suggesting that additional incentives be considered once a ticketing policy is in place. With these adjustments, the Committee recommended the policy for approval by the full Board.  

**III. Problem / Situation / Request**  
The recent approval of new seating in the Veterans Memorial Amphitheatre is expected to enhance the overall experience for attendees. Complementing this development, the Chair Dedication Policy provides an opportunity for patrons to support the arts by dedicating a chair within the venue.  

This program allows individuals, families, businesses, and organizations to give recognition through a dedication plaque affixed to the back of a seat in the Veterans Memorial Amphitheatre for a five-year term. The initiative was first introduced at the Annual Garden Gala for the Arts in Fair Oaks, where it received enthusiastic support from the community.  

The additional seating not only increases the venue’s capacity and comfort but also creates a valuable fundraising opportunity through the Chair Dedication Program. For a contribution of $500, patrons can dedicate a chair.

**IV. Financial Analysis**  
This initiative is anticipated to generate significant financial support for the Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center. Funds raised will be directed to the Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation, providing crucial support for Arts & Entertainment programming, maintenance, and future improvements to the facility. Additionally, all donations are tax-deductible, providing further incentive for community participation.  

Respectfully Submitted,  

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator
