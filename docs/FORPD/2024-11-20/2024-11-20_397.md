If you would like to make a comment on this topic please raise your hand or let me know here in the chat section. We will give you the opportunity to speak in order. We have not yet had public comment on the Disc Golf agenda item.

**18:34:24** From Paloma’s iPhone (2) to Everyone:  
There has been an incident reported in 2024. Reported by multiple parents who were present on Site.

**18:36:34** From Kristi Savio to Everyone:  
I have reported an incident of where my daughter was hit in the face by a disc. So there has been a reported incident.

**18:46:05** From Keith Walter to Everyone:  
Since it opened, players have played over 50,000 games of disc golf at Miller Park, and there have been no serious injuries in that time. We have eliminated homelessness in the park as a result of the significant increase in usage. Hundreds of residents and guests have discovered the park that otherwise never would have. Several other similar disc golf parks such as Carmichael and Folsom have similar configurations, and seem to operate without issue. Is this conversation an overreaction to a single complaint?

**18:50:01** From iPhone (116) Wendy to Everyone:  
I personally know 3 kids that have been hit and we have almost been hit 20+ times and we have only been at legette 1 year!!! The golfers tell us to watch out and give us attitude.

**18:56:54** From Kristi Savio to Everyone:  
Here is the picture of my daughter after she was hit by a disc while playing in the park. Please tell me why this is not an incident to be concerned about?

**18:57:23** From Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks to Kristi Savio (direct message):  
Have you passed this on to District Staff?

**18:58:21** From Kristi Savio to Everyone:  
Yes, this was sent to them after the incident.

**Meeting Date:** November 20th, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Approval of Public Art Policy  
**Prepared By:** Jen Schuler, Arts & Entertainment Manager  

**I. Recommendation**  
Approve Public Art Policy as recommended by the Policy Review Committee and forward it to the District’s contracted attorney for review.  

**II. Background**  
The Policy Review Committee met on October 7th, 2024, to review several new policies, including the Public Art Policy. This policy was developed in response to discussions surrounding public art projects and the need for a structured approach to how public art is commissioned, installed, and maintained within the district. The policy ensures the District has clear guidelines on community engagement, artist selection, and funding strategies for various projects, such as wrapping electrical boxes, painting benches, and memorializing murals.  

The only edits made were the removal of the appendix listing specific projects, allowing flexibility for maintenance agreements to be handled on a case-by-case basis. The Committee recommends that the full Board consider approving the Public Art Policy and submitting it for legal review by the District’s contracted attorney.  

**III. Problem /Situation / Request**  
The Public Art Policy was developed in response to the growing interest in public art projects within the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District. As the community continues to expand, there is increasing enthusiasm from residents, local businesses, and organizations to support public art initiatives that enhance the district’s cultural and aesthetic landscape. To manage this interest and ensure transparency, it became necessary to establish a formal policy guiding the selection, funding, and maintenance of public art, while encouraging community involvement.

![Public Art Policy for Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks District](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Public+Art+Policy+for+Fair+Oaks+Recreation+%26+Parks+District)

**PURPOSE:** The Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District is dedicated to enriching the community through public art that is accessible to all. This policy provides a clear framework for the selection, acquisition, installation, and maintenance of public art throughout District parks and facilities ensuring that public art is a vital part of daily community life.

**OBJECTIVES:**

- **Cultural Reflection and Identity:** Public art should reflect the diversity, history, and values of Fair Oaks while strengthening its community identity and pride.
- **Support Artists:** Provide opportunities for local and regional artists to contribute to public art projects.
- **Community Engagement:** Involve the community in the selection, creation, and maintenance of public art to ensure that it resonates with local culture and interests.
- **Artistic and Aesthetic Enrichment:** Incorporate art into public spaces to enhance their aesthetic appeal and create engaging, culturally meaningful environments.
- **Artist and District Collaboration:** Define a clear collaborative relationship between artists and the District to ensure that public art projects enhance community spaces.

**SCOPE:**

This policy applies to all public art projects commissioned, acquired, or displayed by the Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks District, including parks, public spaces, and facilities. It encompasses both permanent and temporary installations, ranging from murals and sculptures to functional art such as benches.

**FUNDING:**

- **Diverse Sources:** Public art will be funded through a variety of sources, including district capital improvement budgets, grants, private donations, business sponsorships, and a potential "percent-for-art" program where a percentage of capital improvement project budgets are allocated to public art.
- **Community Contributions:** Opportunities for direct community involvement in funding art projects, such as crowd-sourced funding, donor walls, and naming rights, will be explored to encourage community ownership and investment in the arts.

**SELECTION PROCESS:**

- **Open and Transparent:** The selection process will be inclusive and transparent, involving calls for artists, community input, and selection panels, appointed by FORPD Board that reflect the diversity of the district's population.
<!-- Page 85 -->
- **Equitable Representation:** Selection panels can be composed of FORPD Board Members, district staff, local artists, arts professionals, and community representatives to ensure diverse perspectives are considered.
- **Community Voice:** Art selection will involve community engagement, including workshops, surveys, and public forums to ensure the art reflects community interests and desires.
- **Criteria:** Artworks will be evaluated based on artistic merit, relevance to the community, inclusivity, durability, maintenance and restoration requirements, environmental impact, and public safety.

1. **Artist Calls and Community Input:**
   - Publicly announced calls for artists, ensuring wide visibility to attract diverse artistic contributions.
   - Public announcements will be made on all district owned social media platforms, as well as through electronic mail services (email blasts). If appropriate and aligned with printing the district will include the call in considered publications.
   - Facilitate community workshops or meetings where residents can provide input on the type of art they wish to see in their public spaces.

2. **Selection Committee:**
   - Form a selection committee that could include artists, community leaders, arts professionals, and members of the public. This committee reviews submissions based on set criteria such as artistic merit, relevance to the community, and sustainability.

3. **Focus on Local Artists:**
   - Prioritize local artists in the selection process to support and develop local art community.

**SITE SELECTION:**

- **Criteria:** Sites will be chosen based on visibility, accessibility, community significance, and integration with the surrounding environment. Special attention will be paid to ADA compliance and ensuring that public art is accessible to individuals with disabilities. Assessing how the placement of art might influence visitor flow and use of space, ensuring that artwork complements rather than complicates the use of the area.
  
- **Key Locations:** For both rotating and permanent art installations, the FORPD will prioritize locations that balance high visibility and community impact with practical maintenance considerations. Locations within the district, including playgrounds, picnic areas, and walking trails, will be evaluated for their suitability based on a set of criteria focused on ensuring the long-term sustainability of the art installations.

- **Durability Requirements:** Selecting materials and designs that are durable and appropriate for the specific environmental conditions of the installation site, thus reducing the frequency and complexity of maintenance tasks.

- **Integration with Nature:** Public art that interacts with the natural landscape, such as environmental or eco-friendly art, will be prioritized to promote sustainability and enhance the natural beauty of parks.
<!-- Page 86 -->
# MAINTENANCE AND CONSERVATION:

1. **Maintenance Responsibilities**
   - **Ownership and Oversight:** FORPD will provide standard park maintenance, such as cleaning and general upkeep of public space, but the artist is responsible for the specific care and preservation of the artwork itself.
   - **Artist-Provisioned Maintenance Plan:** Artists must submit a detailed maintenance plan as part of the commissioning process. This plan should include the materials used, recommended cleaning methods, potential vulnerabilities, and repair instructions, guiding FORPD’s limited involvement in maintaining the artwork.
   - **Annual Inspections:** FORPD will conduct routine visual inspections of public art as part of park oversight. Any issues related to the artwork's condition will be reported to the artist for necessary repairs.
   - **Vandalism and Repairs:** FORPD will notify artists of any vandalism or damage to their work. It is the artist's responsibility to repair the piece, either personally or through their insurer. FORPD will assist in securing the site as necessary.

2. **Artist Responsibilities for Repairs (Artist Owned)**
   - **Artist Accountability:** The artist is solely responsible for all repairs and conservation efforts necessary to maintain the artwork's condition. FORPD will coordinate access to the site but will not cover repair costs if artwork remains in artist ownership.
   - **Artist-Owned and Insured Artworks:** If the artist retains ownership and insures the artwork, any repairs or damage will be covered by the artist's insurance, with FORPD facilitating site access only.

3. **Funding for Maintenance (District Owned)**
   - **Standard Park Maintenance:** FORPD will cover routine maintenance that does not directly affect the artwork, such as graffiti removal, landscaping, or debris cleanup.
   - **Public Art Reserve Fund:** FORPD will create a dedicated fund for regular maintenance, emergency repairs, and long-term conservation, sourced from public art allocations, grants, and donations.
   - **Capital Improvement Projects (CIP):** 1% of the budget for new capital projects involving public art will go to the Public Art Reserve Fund for future maintenance.
   - **Private Contributions:** Donations for public art projects will include an additional 10% to 20% for the future maintenance of the artwork.

4. **Clarification on Funding Responsibilities:**
   - The Public Art Reserve Fund applies primarily to FORPD-owned artwork or where the artist has waived ownership.
   - For artist-owned and insured artworks, the artist remains fully responsible for repairs, even in emergencies.
<!-- Page 87 -->
# DEACCESSION AND ROTATION OF PUBLIC ART:

1. **Deaccession Criteria:**
   - **Condition:** Artworks that are no longer maintainable due to damage, deterioration, or safety concerns may be considered for removal.
   - **Relevance:** Art that no longer aligns with the community’s evolving cultural, historical, or aesthetic values may be considered for rotation or removal.
   - **Artist Request:** Artists may request removal or modification of their works due to personal, legal, or artistic reasons, as allowed by acquisition agreements.
   - **Space Requirements:** Works may be deaccessioned if space or site changes necessitate relocation or if the area is being repurposed.

2. **Process for Deaccession:**
   - **Initiation:** The deaccession process can be initiated by staff, the public, or the artist, based on one of the above criteria. A formal review will be required to assess the situation.
   - **Review Committee:** A deaccession review committee, comprising members of the public art committee, district staff, art experts, and community representatives, will be formed to evaluate the request. They will review the reasons for deaccessioning and assess alternatives, such as restoration, rotation, relocation or disposal.
   - **Artist Consultation:** Artists will be notified of any proposed deaccession. If possible, they will be consulted and given the opportunity to participate in discussions related to their work.

3. **Community Involvement:**
   - **Public Notice:** Any proposed deaccession will be announced through public channels, such as the district's website, social media, and local news outlets, to ensure transparency.
   - **Public Feedback:** Community members will be invited to provide feedback on proposed deaccession or rotation. A public comment period of 30 days will be provided before final decisions are made.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - **Approval:** The final decision on deaccession or rotation will be made by the Board of Directors, following a recommendation from the deaccession review committee.
   - **Handling Deaccessioned Art:** Deaccessioned art will not be relocated. It must either be returned to the artist or, if the artist is not interested, disposed of responsibly by District staff.

5. **Transparency and Documentation:**
   - **Documentation:** All decisions and processes regarding deaccession or rotation will be thoroughly documented. This will include reasons for removal, the artist's input, staff recommendations, public feedback, and final board actions.
   - **Legal and Moral Rights:** The guarantee of legal rights will be upheld as required by law, including adherence to the Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA).

# DOCUMENTATION AND PROMOTION:
- All public art projects will be documented including details about the artist, concept, and location.
- Promotional efforts will include public art maps, digital archives, and features in district publications to enhance public awareness and appreciation of the artworks.
<!-- Page 88 -->
# IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
- **Funding:** These projects could be funded through grants, local business sponsorships, or community fundraising initiatives.
- **Promotion:** Promote completed projects via social media, local media, and partnerships with local schools and organizations to engage the community and attract visitors.
- **Evaluation:** Regularly evaluate the impact of these projects on community engagement and satisfaction to inform future public art initiatives.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** November 20th, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Approval of Donation, Donor Recognition and Gift Policy  
**Prepared By:** Jen Schuler, Arts & Entertainment Manager  

**I. Recommendation**  
Approve the Donation, Donor Recognition and Gift Policy as recommended by the Policy Review Committee and forward it to the District’s contracted attorney for review.

**II. Background**  
The Policy Review Committee met on October 7th, 2024, to review several new policies, including the Donation, Donor Recognition, and Gift Policy. This policy originated from discussions on donor recognition, particularly the idea of a "Donor Wall." However, based on the committee's recommendations, the policy was expanded to provide an overview of how the District will recognize donors and manage donations, without focusing solely on the "Donor Wall" as the only form of recognition.

Additional revisions were made to grant the Board flexibility, allowing them to make decisions on a case-by-case basis or allocate funds according to the donor's specific wishes. The Committee recommended that the full Board discuss and possibly approve the policy and submit it for legal review by the District’s contracted attorney.

**III. Problem/Situation/Request**  
The Donation Policy was developed in response to the growing need for a structured approach to managing contributions made to the district. With increasing interest from community members, businesses, and organizations wishing to support Arts & Entertainment programming, facility improvements, recreation activities, and scholarships, it became necessary to create a formal policy to guide how donations are accepted, recognized, and utilized.
<!-- Page 90 -->
The policy establishes clear guidelines for the acceptance of monetary gifts and sponsorships while ensuring transparency and accountability in how these funds are directed. Additionally, it outlines the donor recognition process, providing a way to honor those who contribute to the district’s initiatives in a meaningful and consistent manner.

We are requesting approval of the Donation, Donor Recognition and Gift Policy be reviewed by the District’s contracted attorney to ensure legal compliance. This Policy seeks to ensure that future donations are managed effectively, with appropriate recognition for donors, and that funds are allocated in alignment with district priorities such as programming, facility maintenance, scholarships, and future improvements.

IV. Financial Analysis  
The only financial impact of approving this policy is the Attorney review fee. Donations and donor recognition are expected to provide substantial financial support for the district. Funds raised will go to the Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation, supporting Arts & Entertainment programs, recreation activities, scholarships, facility maintenance, and future improvements. All donations are tax-deductible, encouraging community involvement.

Respectfully Submitted,  
Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

---

**G. ENDOWMENT FUND**

The Endowment Fund for FORPD are held and trusted by the Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation or designated foundations and serves as a critical financial foundation to ensure the long-term sustainability and growth of the district's programs and facilities. Endowments are funds that are maintained in perpetuity, with the principal amount invested to generate earnings. These earnings are then used to fund various initiatives according to the donor's wishes and the district's strategic goals.

**Uses of Endowment Funds**
<!-- Page 95 -->
- **Program Sustainability:** Endowment earnings can provide ongoing support for key programs, such as arts education classes, public theater productions, and community sports leagues, ensuring they continue regardless of economic fluctuations.
- **Facility Upgrades and Maintenance:** Regular maintenance and upgrades of facilities, including theaters, sports fields, and community centers, can be funded to meet safety standards and enhance user experience.
- **Scholarships:** Endowment funds can be allocated to scholarship programs that make arts and recreation programs accessible to underrepresented and low-income community members.
- **New Initiatives:** As community needs evolve, endowment funds can provide seed money for innovative new programs or services that address emerging interests or challenges.
- **Emergency Reserve:** A portion of the endowment can serve as a reserve fund to protect the district against unforeseen financial challenges, ensuring the continuity of operations during economic downturns or other crises.

## Building the Endowment Fund

- **Donor Contributions:** Individuals, families, and corporations can contribute to the endowment through one-time gifts, multi-year pledges, or planned to give such as bequests and charitable trusts.
- **Matching Gifts:** FORPD may seek matching gifts from businesses or grant-making organizations to leverage donor contributions, effectively doubling the impact of the gifts.
- **Fundraising Campaigns:** Special campaigns and events can be organized to directly support the growth of the endowment fund.

## Benefits to Donors

- **Lasting Impact:** Donations to the endowment fund represent a permanent investment in the community, providing lasting benefits across generations.
- **Recognition:** Significant contributions can be recognized through naming opportunities within district facilities or programs, aligning with the donor's preferences and the district's recognition policies.
- **Tax Advantages:** Contributions to the endowment fund are tax-deductible to the fullest extent of the law, providing financial benefits to the donors.

## H. PLANNED GIVING

Planned giving offers donors the opportunity to leave a legacy at the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District, ensuring the continued vibrancy and sustainability of its arts and recreation programs for future generations. Planned Giving funds are donated to the Fair Oaks Foundation or other designated foundations on behalf of FORPD. This form of giving allows donors to integrate philanthropic plans with their overall financial, tax, and estate planning goals, often with significant benefits to both the donor and the district.

## Types of Planned Gifts

Page 5 of 10
<!-- Page 96 -->
![Page 6 of 10](attachment://image.png)

a. Bequests: One of the simplest forms of planned giving, a bequest allows donors to designate the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District as a beneficiary in their will or trust. Donors can specify a certain dollar amount, a particular asset, or a percentage of their estate to go to Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation.  
b. Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs): This type of trust allows donors to convert highly appreciated assets into lifetime income. It reduces taxes and increases income, and whatever remains in the trust at the end of the term is donated to Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation or other designated foundations.  
c. Charitable Lead Trusts (CLTs): Opposite of CRTs, CLTs allow donors to give assets to a trust that pays its income to Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation for a number of years or a lifetime. After this period, the assets are transferred back to the donor or heirs, often with significant tax savings.  
d. Gifts of Retirement Assets: Donors can designate Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation or other designated foundations as the beneficiary of their retirement accounts (IRA, 401(k), etc.), which can help heirs avoid double taxation on the inheritance of these assets.  
e. Gifts of Life Insurance: By naming Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy, donors can provide a substantial gift at a relatively low cost, subject to premium payments.  

**Benefits of Planned Giving**  
- **Tax Advantages:** Many forms of planned giving provide significant tax deductions. For example, bequests are exempt from estate tax, and CRTs can reduce income and capital gains taxes.  
- **Estate Planning:** Integrating charitable gifts into estate planning can enhance the financial plans and reduce the tax burden on the donor's estate.  
- **Sustainable Support:** Planned gifts provide a critical source of long-term funding that helps ensure the sustainability of FORPD's programs and facilities.  

**Recognizing Planned Giving Donors**  
- Donors who make planned gifts are recognized according to the levels of their contributions, similar to other forms of giving, unless anonymity is requested. Special recognition events and memorials can be arranged to honor these commitments.  
- Planned giving donors can be included in the Legacy Circle, a special category of recognition for those who have made a lasting commitment to the future of FORPD through their estate plans.  

**Commitment to Donor Intent**  
- **Respecting Donor Wishes:** FORPD is committed to honoring the specific wishes of all planned giving donors regarding how their future gifts are to be used, whether they support general operations, specific programs, or capital initiatives.  
- **Transparency and Reporting:** Planned giving donors receive regular updates on the impact of their intended contributions and are assured that their future gifts will be used according to their wishes.  

**I. CORPORATE SPONSORSHIPS AND NAMING RIGHTS**  
Page 6 of 10
<!-- Page 97 -->
![Corporate Sponsorships and Naming Rights](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Corporate+Sponsorships+and+Naming+Rights)

Corporate sponsorships and naming rights offer valuable opportunities for businesses to align with the community-centric values of the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District (FORPD), while gaining significant visibility and recognition. These partnerships are designed to foster mutual benefits, enhancing both the corporate sponsor's community presence and FORPD's ability to deliver high-quality arts and recreation programs.

## Types of Corporate Sponsorships

- **Event Sponsorships:** Corporations can sponsor specific events, performances, or series, which may include branding opportunities at the event, in promotional materials, and through social media mentions.
- **Program Sponsorships:** Support can be directed toward specific arts and recreation programs, helping to cover costs and expand offerings. Sponsors receive acknowledgment in program-related communications and materials.
- **Facility Sponsorships:** Corporations can sponsor amenities or facilities within the park district, such as playgrounds, sports fields, or community rooms. This type of sponsorship might include signage or naming within the facility.

## Naming Rights Opportunities

Naming rights present a high-profile branding opportunity, allowing a corporation’s name to be permanently associated with part of the FORPD’s facilities or programs. This is a significant form of sponsorship that reflects a deep commitment to the community and provides lasting visibility.

- **Facilities:** Opportunities might include but not limited to theaters, galleries, athletic fields, and community rooms and/or centers. Each naming agreement is crafted to respect the needs of both the sponsor and the community.
- **Programs:** Naming rights can also be extended to key programs, such as educational series, concert series, special events or sports leagues.

## Terms and Conditions

- **Duration:** Naming rights are typically granted for a predetermined period, which may range from 5 to 20 years, based on the level of contribution and the nature of the asset.
- **Renewal:** Terms for renewal or extension of naming rights are discussed prior to the expiration of the current agreement, providing an opportunity for continued partnership.
- **Approval Process:** All corporate sponsorships and naming rights are subject to approval by the FORPD board to ensure that partnerships align with the district’s mission and community standards. The district retains the authority to vet all potential sponsors to maintain the integrity of the community spaces.
- **Visibility and Acknowledgment:** Sponsor names and logos are placed in strategic, highly visible locations, ensuring maximum exposure while maintaining aesthetic and environmental standards set by FORPD.

- **Brand Visibility:** High visibility in community settings and associated media increases brand recognition and customer goodwill.
- **Community Engagement:** Direct involvement in community enhancements helps build strong community relations and can enhance corporate reputation as a committed community partner.
- **Tax Advantages:** Contributions made through corporate sponsorships and naming rights can be tax-deductible, providing financial benefits to the sponsoring entity.

**Corporate Responsibility and Alignment**

- **Sustainability Initiatives:** Corporations that emphasize sustainability and social responsibility find alignment with FORPD’s commitment to environmental stewardship and community health.
- **Diversity and Inclusion:** Sponsorships also support FORPD’s initiatives for promoting diversity and inclusivity within community programs, resonating with corporate values of equity and representation.

**J. DONOR-ADVISED FUNDS (DAFS)**

Provide an efficient and flexible way for donors to manage their philanthropy through a tax-advantaged account, where donors can contribute funds and recommend grants to charitable organizations like the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District (FORPD) over time. This method of giving allows donors to make a charitable contribution, receive an immediate tax benefit, and then recommend grants from the fund on their own timeframe.

**Benefits of Donating Through DAFs**

- **Tax Efficiency:** Contributions to DAFs are immediately tax-deductible in the year they are made, offering a flexible way to manage annual charitable deductions.
- **Simplicity:** Donors can manage all their charitable giving through one account, simplifying tracking and administration.
- **Flexibility:** Donors have the flexibility to recommend grants at their convenience and the ability to anonymously support causes they care about.
- **Strategic Philanthropic Planning:** DAFs allow donors to build a long-term strategy for major giving instead of making ad-hoc donations.

**Using DAFs to Support FORPD**

- **Unrestricted Gifts:** Donors can recommend unrestricted gifts, which give FORPD the flexibility to use funds where they are needed most.
- **Restricted Gifts:** Donors can specify that their DAF grants go toward specific programs, projects, or initiatives within FORPD.
- **Endowment Contributions:** Donors can direct DAF grants to FORPD’s endowment, providing a lasting legacy that supports the district’s future.

**Recognition for DAF Donors**
