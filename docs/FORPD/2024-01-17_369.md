**Note:** Regarding Sick-Leave hours, a Regular Full-Time employee may choose the Sick Leave payout option and utilize a maximum of 320 hours (as identified within the table above) which will be compensated at 50% of the employee's current hourly rate of pay. However, upon retirement from the District, a Regular Full-Time employee December choose to utilize their accrued Sick Leave toward CalPERS service credit with no maximum limit. Employees whose Sick Leave hours exceed 320 hours are noted but the hours in excess of 320 not calculated as a liability in the table above. A Regular Part-Time employee will be compensated for a maximum of 160 hours of sick leave at 50% of the employee's rate of pay upon termination.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** January 17, 2024  
**To:** Foundation Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Foundation By-Laws Revision  
**Prepared By:** Jen Schuler, Arts & Entertainment Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Authorize the District Administrator to submit the draft By-Laws (Attachment A) for the Fair Oaks Foundation of Leisure and the Arts to FORPD’s Attorney, facilitating the proposed transition of FORPD’s foundation to Fair Oaks Foundation for Leisure and the Arts (FOFLA).

---

**II. Background**  
The Fair Oaks Foundation of Leisure and the Arts (FOFLA) is a charitable organization that is organized and operated exclusively for charitable and educational purposes. The Foundation aims to expand and enhance the quality of life in the community through various activities. These activities include:  
1. Supporting the programs of existing community-based organizations, including the Park District, Schools, and the Chamber of Commerce.  
2. Encouraging community support and funding for capital improvements such as Community Center, Performing Arts facilities, swimming pool, etc.  
3. Sponsoring and supporting culturally diverse community-wide events such as symphony concerts, festivals, historical preservation projects, and other celebrations.  
4. Working cooperatively with and supporting other charitable, community-based organizations.  
5. Providing the avenue for the writing and receiving of grants, bequests, and gifts for charitable and educational purposes in the community.  

The Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation was founded in 2001 to promote quality and innovation for the community by empowering the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District through financial support and community involvement. A nonprofit public benefit corporation, the Foundation serves as the fundraising source for the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District. The Foundation endeavors to support high quality recreation and arts & entertainment programs, maintain parks and facilities for the benefit of the residents of Fair Oaks. The three major programs of Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District will shift over to FOFLA for the support that had in the past been provided by FORPD’s Foundation. The three programs are:  
<!-- Page 72 -->
1. The Rachael Anne Gray Scholarship which was established in honor of Rachel Anne Gray and provides four awards, in the amounts of $1,500, $1,000, $500 & $250, that are given annually to deserving high school seniors to acknowledge young people who are committed to community and school service and who seek positive solutions to community issues.  
2. Fair Oaks Youth Advisory Board (FOYAB) is a youth-driven program designed to foster leadership skills and provide the next generation a voice in the programs and services that benefit children and youth in the Fair Oaks Region.  
3. The "Don Ralls Memorial Scholarship Fund" was established in January of 1999. This scholarship is made available to underserved youth and seniors and offers up to 80% of fees covered for a select District program.  

III. Problem /Situation / Request  
Staff have been in communication with FOFLA and they have agreed in principle to have the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park Foundation merge with their Foundation. This merger will eliminate redundant missions and services and will allow for a consolidation of efforts in supporting and raising funds for art and recreation programs and services in Fair Oaks. The mission and work of FOFLA will benefit FORPD by providing an independent non-profit entity that can actively raise funds and accept donations and grants on behalf of Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District. This is a strategic and beneficial move for both groups’ needs and our community. The merger will allow the three major programs (listed above) of the FORPD Foundation to continue under FOFLA.  
During FORPD’s financial audit, the auditor recommended that the FORPD Foundation should not be controlled by the FORPD’s Board and should be a separate independent entity. This merger fulfills that recommendation.  

This request is to provide permission for staff to have the attached draft By-Laws reviewed by FORPD’s attorney. Once the By-Laws are reviewed and revised as necessary, they will be brought back to the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Foundation Board for approval and then submitted to FOFLA for approval and then submitted to the Secretary of the State for adoption. Once the By-Laws are accepted by the Secretary of the State, the FORPD Foundation Board will need to meet to formally dissolve their Foundation and transfer all assets of the Foundation to FOFLA.  

IV. Financial Analysis  
The cost for the District’s Attorney to review and revise the By-Laws will come from FORPD’s Attorney Services budgeted line item. Estimated costs are $1500-$2500.  

Respectfully Submitted,  
Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator
