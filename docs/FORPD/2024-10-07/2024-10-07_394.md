<!-- Page 5 -->
![Donor Wall Recognition Policy](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Donor+Wall+Recognition+Policy)

The donor wall is located prominently in the stone wall outside of the Veterans Memorial Amphitheatre, will serve as a lasting tribute to the individuals, businesses, and organizations that support the Arts, Recreation and the Parks in Fair Oaks. Recognition will be awarded based on the tier system outlined in this policy. Recognition terms are consistent with California's regulations governing public entities like special districts. Contributions may be cumulative over a period (e.g., five years) to meet the recognition thresholds, which are subject to approval by FORPD Board to ensure compliance with its mandate.

### Recognition Plaques:
- Will be designed uniformly, with distinctions only in size, placement, and character limits based on donation tiers.

### Approval and Customization:
- FORPD reserves the right to approve all inscriptions and donor names/logos to ensure they are consistent with the mission and values of the district.

### Anonymity Option:
- Donors may remain anonymous upon request, although recognition on the donor wall will not be possible in these cases.

### Recognition Tiers and Details:
- **Patron ($500–$999):** Name engraved on a shared plaque within the "Patron" section of the wall.
- **Benefactor ($1,000–$4,999):** Individual plaque with the donor's name and/or business logo.

### Cumulative Contributions:
- Contributions can be cumulative, allowing donors to reach higher recognition tiers over a period of five years.
- This approach enables supporters to build towards more prominent recognition as their cumulative donations increase.

### Terms of Recognition:
- Standard recognition on the donor wall is set for a period of 10 years to ensure that the wall reflects ongoing support and community engagement.
- Continued acknowledgment after this period can be secured through additional contributions, updates to the facility, or special circumstances reviewed by the Foundation.

### Ethical Standards:

**F. SCHOLARSHIPS**

The Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District (FORPD) offers scholarship programs to support individuals who may not otherwise be able to afford program fees and registration costs for various activities. These scholarships are particularly aimed at helping youth and seniors from low-income families in the Fair Oaks area participate in district programs.

**Scholarship Programs Offered by FORPD:**

1. **Don Ralls Memorial Scholarship:** This scholarship was established in memory of Don Ralls, a former District Board Member, to provide financial assistance primarily for program fees and other registration-related costs. It is open to youth and seniors, ensuring they can access recreational opportunities regardless of financial constraints.
   
2. **Rachel Anne Gray Memorial Scholarship:** Created in honor of Rachel Anne Gray, this scholarship awards financial support to high school seniors who demonstrate significant commitment to community and school service.

**How the Scholarships Work:**
<!-- Page 7 -->
![Utilization of Funds](https://example.com/image.png)

- **Utilization of Funds:** Scholarship funds can be applied toward registration fees for a variety of FORPD programs, including classes, leagues, and camps. The aim is to make recreational activities accessible to all community members, fostering inclusiveness and engagement.
- **Employer-Sponsored Matching Gift Programs:** FORPD encourages donors and participants to explore employer-sponsored matching gift programs, which can potentially double or triple the impact of their contributions. This initiative not only increases the available resources for scholarships but also enhances the overall community support for recreational programs. Participants in such programs are advised to provide necessary documentation to their employers to secure matching funds, which FORPD can assist with by providing confirmation of the donations.
- **Authorization of Scholarships:** The District Administrator is responsible for reviewing and approving all scholarship applications. This ensures that scholarship funds are allocated and fairly and equitably, prioritizing those who demonstrate the greatest financial need. The District Administrator's authorization guarantees that the scholarship process aligns with FORPD's commitment to accessibility and inclusiveness in recreational programs.

These scholarships and matching gift opportunities demonstrate FORPD's commitment to accessibility and community engagement, ensuring that financial barriers do not hinder participation in valuable recreational and cultural activities.

**G. ENDOWMENT FUND**

The Endowment Fund for FORPD are held and trusted by the Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation and serves as a critical financial foundation to ensure the long-term sustainability and growth of the district's programs and facilities. Endowments are funds that are maintained in perpetuity, with the principal amount invested to generate earnings. These earnings are then used to fund various initiatives according to the donor's wishes and the district's strategic goals.

**Uses of Endowment Funds**

- **Program Sustainability:** Endowment earnings can provide ongoing support for key programs, such as arts education classes, public theater productions, and community sports leagues, ensuring they continue regardless of economic fluctuations.
- **Facility Upgrades and Maintenance:** Regular maintenance and upgrades of facilities, including theaters, sports fields, and community centers, can be funded to meet safety standards and enhance user experience.
- **Scholarships:** Endowment funds can be allocated to scholarship programs that make arts and recreation programs accessible to underrepresented and low-income community members.
- **New Initiatives:** As community needs evolve, endowment funds can provide seed money for innovative new programs or services that address emerging interests or challenges.

<!-- Page 8 -->
- **Emergency Reserve:** A portion of the endowment can serve as a reserve fund to protect the district against unforeseen financial challenges, ensuring the continuity of operations during economic downturns or other crises.

### Building the Endowment Fund

- **Donor Contributions:** Individuals, families, and corporations can contribute to the endowment through one-time gifts, multi-year pledges, or planned to give such as bequests and charitable trusts.
- **Matching Gifts:** FORPD may seek matching gifts from businesses or grant-making organizations to leverage donor contributions, effectively doubling the impact of the gifts.
- **Fundraising Campaigns:** Special campaigns and events can be organized to directly support the growth of the endowment fund.

### Benefits to Donors

- **Lasting Impact:** Donations to the endowment fund represent a permanent investment in the community, providing lasting benefits across generations.
- **Recognition:** Significant contributions can be recognized through naming opportunities within district facilities or programs, aligning with the donor's preferences and the district's recognition policies.
- **Tax Advantages:** Contributions to the endowment fund are tax-deductible to the fullest extent of the law, providing financial benefits to the donors.

### H. PLANNED GIVING

Planned giving offers donors the opportunity to leave a legacy at the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District, ensuring the continued vibrancy and sustainability of its arts and recreation programs for future generations. Planned Giving funds are donated the Fair Oaks Foundation on behalf of FORPD. This form of giving allows donors to integrate philanthropic plans with their overall financial, tax, and estate planning goals, often with significant benefits to both the donor and the district.

### Types of Planned Gifts

a. **Bequests:** One of the simplest forms of planned giving, a bequest allows donors to designate the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District as a beneficiary in their will or trust. Donors can specify a certain dollar amount, a particular asset, or a percentage of their estate to go to Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation.

b. **Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs):** This type of trust allows donors to convert highly appreciated assets into lifetime income. It reduces taxes and increases income, and whatever remains in the trust at the end of the term is donated to Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation.

c. **Charitable Lead Trusts (CLTs):** Opposite of CRTs, CLTs allow donors to give assets to a trust that pays its income to Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation for a number of years or a lifetime. After this period, the assets are transferred back to the donor or heirs, often with significant tax savings.

Page 6 of 11
<!-- Page 9 -->
d. **Gifts of Retirement Assets:** Donors can designate Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation as the beneficiary of their retirement accounts (IRA, 401(k), etc.), which can help heirs avoid double taxation on the inheritance of these assets.  
e. **Gifts of Life Insurance:** By naming Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy, donors can provide a substantial gift at a relatively low cost, subject to premium payments.  

**Benefits of Planned Giving**  
- **Tax Advantages:** Many forms of planned giving provide significant tax deductions. For example, bequests are exempt from estate tax, and CRTs can reduce income and capital gains taxes.  
- **Estate Planning:** Integrating charitable gifts into estate planning can enhance the financial plans and reduce the tax burden on the donor's estate.  
- **Sustainable Support:** Planned gifts provide a critical source of long-term funding that helps ensure the sustainability of FORPD's programs and facilities.  

**Recognizing Planned Giving Donors**  
- Donors who make planned gifts are recognized according to the levels of their contributions, similar to other forms of giving, unless anonymity is requested. Special recognition events and memorials can be arranged to honor these commitments.  
- Planned giving donors can be included in the Legacy Circle, a special category of recognition for those who have made a lasting commitment to the future of FORPD through their estate plans.  

**Commitment to Donor Intent**  
- **Respecting Donor Wishes:** FORPD is committed to honoring the specific wishes of all planned giving donors regarding how their future gifts are to be used, whether they support general operations, specific programs, or capital initiatives.  
- **Transparency and Reporting:** Planned giving donors receive regular updates on the impact of their intended contributions and are assured that their future gifts will be used according to their wishes.  

**I. CORPORATE SPONSORSHIPS AND NAMING RIGHTS**  
Corporate sponsorships and naming rights offer valuable opportunities for businesses to align with the community-centric values of the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District (FORPD), while gaining significant visibility and recognition. These partnerships are designed to foster mutual benefits, enhancing both the corporate sponsor's community presence and FORPD’s ability to deliver high-quality arts and recreation programs.  

**Types of Corporate Sponsorships**

## J. DONOR-ADVISED FUNDS (DAFS)

Provide an efficient and flexible way for donors to manage their philanthropy through a tax-advantaged account, where donors can contribute funds and recommend grants to charitable organizations like the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District (FORPD) over time. This method of giving allows donors to make a charitable contribution, receive an immediate tax benefit, and then recommend grants from the fund on their own timeframe.

- **Tax Efficiency:** Contributions to DAFs are immediately tax-deductible in the year they are made, offering a flexible way to manage annual charitable deductions.
- **Simplicity:** Donors can manage all their charitable giving through one account, simplifying tracking and administration.
- **Flexibility:** Donors have the flexibility to recommend grants at their convenience and the ability to anonymously support causes they care about.
- **Strategic Philanthropic Planning:** DAFs allow donors to build a long-term strategy for major giving instead of making ad-hoc donations.

### Using DAFs to Support FORPD

- **Unrestricted Gifts:** Donors can recommend unrestricted gifts, which give FORPD the flexibility to use funds where they are needed most.
- **Restricted Gifts:** Donors can specify that their DAF grants go toward specific programs, projects, or initiatives within FORPD.
- **Endowment Contributions:** Donors can direct DAF grants to FORPD’s endowment, providing a lasting legacy that supports the district's future.

### Recognition for DAF Donors

- **Acknowledgment:** FORPD acknowledges all DAF contributions in accordance with donor recognition policies, unless anonymity is requested.
- **Transparency:** FORPD commits to transparency in how DAF contributions are used, providing donors with reports and updates on the impact of their support.

### Establishing a DAF

- **Setting Up:** Donors interested in establishing a DAF can do so through many financial institutions, community foundations, or other entities that offer DAF services.
- **Consultation:** FORPD encourages donors to consult with their financial advisors to understand the benefits and implications of creating and using a DAF for charitable giving.
