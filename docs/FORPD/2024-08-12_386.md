# FAIR OAKS RECREATION & PARK DISTRICT

## TREE PROTECTION POLICY

### PURPOSE
It is the intent of the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District to protect the urban forest within its boundaries in order to provide a long-lasting canopy which can be enjoyed by future generations. To that end, Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District is initiating the following policy in regards to tree protection throughout its properties.

This policy is intended to support rather than replace any tree protection guidelines outlined within Sacramento County Code.

### DEFINITIONS
- **Compaction** – The exertion of force on soil so that it becomes more dense.
- **Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)** – A standard method of expressing the diameter of the trunk or bole of a standing tree. Tree trunks are measured at the height of an adult's breast, standardized at 4 ½’ above the ground.
- **Drip Line** – The area defined by the outermost circumference of a tree canopy where water drips from and onto the ground.
- **Fertilization** – The action or process of artificially applying fertilizer to soil or land.
- **Fill** – Soil and other materials placed on top of the natural soil level.
- **Heavy Equipment** – Equipment, machinery or vehicles that exert ground pressure in excess of 8 pounds per square inch.
- **Irrigation** – The watering of land by artificial means to foster plant growth.
- **ISA** – International Society of Arboriculture.
- **Native Tree** – Trees which have developed, occurred naturally, or existed in the Sacramento region for many years. This includes, but is not limited to, the Blue Oak, Valley Oak, and Interior Live Oak. For a more comprehensive list of native trees: [https://sactree.org/resources/native-trees/](https://sactree.org/resources/native-trees/)
- **Pollarding** – To cut all the branches of a tree back to the trunk or main stem.
- **Pruning** – The act or practice of cutting or lopping off undesired twigs, branches or roots.
- **Roots** – The part of a plant which attaches it to the ground or to a support, typically underground, conveying water and nourishment to the rest of the plant via numerous branches and fibers.
- **Root Protection Zone (RPZ)** – An area surrounding a tree which is typically half again as large as the area from the trunk to the edge of the drip line. The RPZ is measured outwards from the trunk by creating a circle with a radius of 1’, 1 ½’, or 1 ½’ for each inch of DBH of the trunk.
  - **“Good” Protection** – A RPZ with a radius of 1’ per inch of DBH of the trunk.
  - **“Better” Protection** – A RPZ with a radius of 1 ¼’ per inch of DBH of the trunk.
  - **“Best” Protection** – A RPZ with a radius of 1 ½’ per inch of the DBH of the trunk.
- **Trenching** – The act of creating a long cut in the ground.
- **Trunk** – The stem and main wooden axis of a tree.

# Chair Dedication Policy

## Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center-Veterans Memorial Amphitheatre and Black Box Theatre

### PURPOSE
The Chair Dedication Program at Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center offers patrons an opportunity to support the arts while commemorating their contributions through the dedication of a chair within our venue. This policy outlines the terms and procedures for participating in the program.

### DEFINITION

### ELIGIBILITY

- Contributions must meet the minimum donation requirement set by the Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center with consideration from Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation.

### DEDICATION TERMS
- **Duration:** Chair dedications are valid for a period of five years from the date of the dedication ceremony.
- **Renewal:** Dedications may be renewed at the end of the five-year period upon additional contribution.
- **Recognition:** A plaque with the donor's name, or a name of their choosing, will be affixed to the dedicated chair.
- **Certificate:** A certificate of dedication will be available for each dedication.

- Donors will receive invitations to the ceremony and are encouraged to attend.

## SEAT RESERVATIONS, MEMBERSHIPS AND SUBSCRIPTIONS
- **Dedicated Seat Usage:** The dedication of a chair does not include any reservation rights for specific performances or events. Dedicated seats are symbolic and do not guarantee seating for any specific event.
- **Event Tickets:** Donors must purchase tickets separately for any events they wish to attend. Owning a dedicated chair does not provide any priority or reserved seating privileges.
- **Membership Privileges:** Chair dedications do not confer membership privileges or benefits. Any membership or subscription programs offered by the Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center must be purchased separately. Unless the holder is a Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center Member, which allows privileges of pre-purchasing tickets to FORPD standard performance events (i.e. Main Stage Production Series).
- **Subscription Benefits:** Subscriptions to season tickets or other benefit programs are not included with chair dedications. Subscribers and members will receive benefits according to the terms of their specific programs, which are independent of chair dedications.
