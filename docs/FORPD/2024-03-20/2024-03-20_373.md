Note: Regarding Sick-Leave hours, a Regular Full-Time employee may choose the Sick Leave payout option and utilize a maximum of 320 hours (as identified within the table above) which will be compensated at 50% of the employee's current hourly rate of pay. However, upon retirement from the District, a Regular Full-Time employee December choose to utilize their accrued Sick Leave toward CalPERS service credit with no maximum limit. Employees whose Sick Leave hours exceed 320 hours are not calculated as a liability in the table above. A Regular Part-Time employee will be compensated for a maximum of 160 hours of sick leave at 50% of the employee's rate of pay upon termination.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** March 20, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** District Response to Sacramento County’s Fair Oaks Village Parking Discussion Report of Findings  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Authorize the District Administrator to send the attached letter (Attachment A) to Sacramento County Supervisor Rich Desmond on behalf of the Board of Directors responding to the January 3, 2024 “Fair Oaks Village Parking Discussion for Owners and Tenants Report of Findings.” (Attachment B)

---

**II. Background**  
Parking availability is a current problem in Fair Oaks Village, especially on Friday and Saturday evenings from 5-9pm. The problem is likely to worsen when the new and improved facilities of Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District are in use and their events, rentals, and programs will bring about 150-200 more cars on Friday and Saturday evenings to the Village.

Sacramento County District 3 Supervisor Rich Desmond and the County of Sacramento Department of Transportation had a meeting with Village Property Owners and Tenants on September 11, 2023, to talk about the existing parking situation and possible solutions in Fair Oaks Village. A consultant hired by Sacramento County prepared a summary of this meeting called “Fair Oaks Village Parking Discussion for Owners and Tenants Report of Findings” (Attachment B).

The Board instructed staff to write a letter to Supervisor Desmond to express the District's disagreement with some of the points in the Report of Findings. The Board selected Director Irwin and Director O’Farrell to be an Ad-Hoc Committee of the Board to work with District Administrator Aho to draft a letter to Sacramento County and to guide and oversee the efforts to deal with the parking situation that is expected to happen when the facilities.

### III. Problem /Situation / Request
The draft letter expresses FORPD’s disagreement with some of the recommendations in the “Fair Oaks Village Parking Discussion for Owners and Tenants Report of Findings.” The letter states that the 86 parking spots on FORPD property, funded by Measure J, should prioritize the needs of the public park users and event attendees, rather than the local businesses and their customers. The letter also informs Sacramento County that FORPD will evaluate parking solutions proactively, before the completion of the park project, to avoid negative impacts on the community. The letter states that creating a free customer overflow and employee parking lot, along with wayfinding and lighting, falls outside the district's primary scope and mission, and suggests that other entities should lead this initiative.

### IV. Financial Analysis
There is no financial impact to the District.

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

Sacramento, CA 95814  

Dear Supervisor Desmond,

Thank you for your efforts in organizing and convening the community meeting on September 11, 2023, regarding parking in Fair Oaks village.

After reviewing the **Fair Oaks Parking Discussion Report of Findings** prepared by Drago Vantage, we find ourselves in disagreement with some of the recommendations, particularly those outlined on page 11.

- **Recommendation #3 Maintain existing parking spaces:** “With the completion of park construction, 86 parking spots for customers and employees are anticipated to become available, recommending no changes to current parking configurations at this time. suggests maintaining existing parking spaces following the completion of park construction.”

While we acknowledge the importance of supporting local businesses and their patrons, we must emphasize that these 86 parking spots are situated on Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District (FORPD) property. The creation and renovation of these spots were funded through Measure J, a General Obligation Bond Measure approved by voters in December 2018. The intent behind Measure J was to enhance public park and recreation facilities and benefit the community as a whole.

Our concern lies in the secondary use of these parking spots. While they could indeed benefit customers visiting the Village, their primary purpose should be to support FORPD’s events, activities, and park visitors. The tax-paying residents did not vote to create parking spaces exclusively for businesses and their employees. Instead, these spots should prioritize the needs of the public utilizing FORPD’s facilities and programs.

- **Recommendation #5: Evaluate Traffic and Parking Post-Park Construction:** “After park completion, a traffic and parking evaluation is recommended, exploring the implementation of metered parking. Consideration should be given to managing meters, potentially through the Park District or PBID.”

Waiting until after the park project is completed to evaluate parking challenges could have adverse effects for businesses, the public, and the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District. Businesses, their customers, and the public using our facilities will face difficulties due to limited parking availability. Over the past year and a half, with virtually no Parks and Recreation facility rentals, activities, or events, parking shortages have already been very noticeable on Friday and Saturday nights.

As we resume facility rentals, public events, programs, meetings, and performances in the Veteran’s Memorial Amphitheater, the new Black Box Theater, the Community Clubhouse, the Arts and Crafts building, and the two outside stages, the demand for parking will increase significantly. We anticipate adding between approximately 150 to 200 cars during peak evening hours on Fridays and Saturdays.

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Supervisor Rich Desmond, in collaboration with the County of Sacramento Department of Transportation (County), engaged the services of Drago Vantage, LLC (Drago Vantage) to oversee the Fair Oaks Village Parking Discussion, aimed at fostering an impartial dialogue between property owners and tenants. Site visits allowed them to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Village’s streets, the diverse range of businesses present, and the ongoing park construction – including artistic renderings. This preparatory step was instrumental in equipping the team with the insights necessary to facilitate productive conversations concerning the pressing parking concerns within the community.

On September 11, 2023, a meeting was held to discuss the current parking situation and potential solutions in the Village. The meeting was organized by Supervisor Rich Desmond and Vanessa McCarthy-Olmstead, his Chief of Staff. The meeting was facilitated by staff from Drago Vantage. Ron Vicari and Lupe Rodriguez, representing the Sacramento County Department of Transportation, actively engaged with attendees, attentively gathering feedback. A comprehensive list of meeting attendees is attached to this report, comprising property owners, tenants, and Village residents who actively participated in the discussions.

The participants were organized at five tables. Each table had a facilitator from Drago Vantage, a large pad on an easel, and a pen. There were easels with maps of the Village spaced throughout the room. The facilitators skillfully posed questions and captured responses from participants. Feedback from these facilitators indicated that the respondents were actively engaged, displaying a genuine interest in the process. Many attendees expressed optimism that their input could pave the way for progress, particularly after years of frustration experienced by some property owners and tenants. Some participants indicated that they had been through a similar type of meeting in the past that did not produce results.

The respondents were clear that they love the charm of the Village and would like to change the overall quaintness of the Village. Their feedback presented on the following pages is consistent with how the questions were asked. Some respondents provided similar comments, which have been combined for clarity and conciseness. It's important to acknowledge that the data may appear somewhat skewed due to instances where multiple individuals from the same business attended and occupied different tables. In certain cases, they may have even shared a table.

The number of respondents varied by question. Two attendees did not provide any comments (Fair Oaks Community ACTION Partnerships and Fair Oaks Village Enhancement Committee).

Following the parking-related discussions, John Lambeth, President and CEO of Civitas Advisors, presented on the benefits of developing a Citizen Planning Advisory Committee (CPAC). Supervisor Rich Desmond then inquired if anyone from the group would be willing to participate in the formation of a Steering Committee to assess the available options. The names of volunteers were subsequently submitted to Supervisor Desmond to follow-up with for the next steps.

## QUESTIONS POSED TO PARTICIPANTS

### 1. Understanding the current situation

**Where do you and your employees park?**

---

**ANALYSIS:** From the data shared by participants, most respondents feel they need more parking spaces for both employees and customers.

2. What are your current parking concerns?  
Presented below are the comments received from respondents. We asked respondents to focus on parking concerns not related to events since that situation is a different issue. However, some did provide comments about events.

**Parking Quantity**  
- Not enough parking  
- No place for employees to park so they use parking that could be used for customers  
- There is a scarcity mindset amongst businesses which makes it difficult to work together toward a solution  
- Outdoor seating at the O Café takes up spaces and they need lots of customer spaces  
- Don’t have a lack of parking just need a better agreement between businesses  
- During the car show, Fair Oaks Boulevard holds 300 cars  
- For events, should have a shuttle for parking on Sunrise  
- Would like “The Village” business complex to share parking, often empty spaces  

**Non-customer Related**  
- Construction workers working on a park are using Village parking spaces that businesses need  
- Used car lots at the north and south park cars outside of their lots  
- Need for safe parking for employees working at night  

**Enforcement**  
- No way to enforce parking  
- Bicycle riders, hikers, or park/ride use Village parking and are gone for hours  
- Parking tends to be more assigned on the north and south ends of the Village, but the middle is a “free-for-all”  
- No enforcement of 2-hour parking  
- Many respondents were confused about who owns the spots in front of their businesses. They thought that the signage they put in front of the business was enforceable. They seek clarification and a definitive answer.  
- Don’t like businesses putting restricted parking signs in front of their businesses, some sit empty while other tenant’s customers are seeking parking  
- Would like to allow open parking after businesses with “restricted” spots are closed  
- Crestline residents use street parking and leave cars for days without moving them  

**Other**  
- Not enough transit into the Village  

**ANALYSIS:** The commonality in the responses received is the need for effective solutions to address parking issues, encompassing aspects like quantity, non-customer related problems, enforcement challenges, and transit options. The comments suggest a desire for improved collaboration, enforcement mechanisms, and potential policy changes to enhance the overall parking situation in the area.

## Report of Findings

### 3. Current parking configuration

#### Parallel Versus Diagonal
**In Support**
- No respondents were in favor of changing the diagonal into parallel. Several pointed out that there are parallel spots throughout the Village.

**Non-Supportive**
- Overwhelming support for diagonal
- Want to better understand the right-of-way to better understand who owns their parking
  - Many stated requests to the County have gone unanswered

#### Metered Parking
**In Support**
- Would create more turnover of spaces
- Would be enforceable
- Would like some spots just for quick stops/pickups (e.g., bank, coffee)
- Cost should increase over time (e.g., 15 minutes is less money per minute than 2 hours, plus)
- Might discourage employees from parking in customer spots
- Would consider have stickers for employees
- Eliminates business-specific signage
- Create parking like they have in Old Sacramento

**Non-Supportive**
- Paying might discourage customers
  - Some stated this is why they don’t go to downtown Sacramento
  - Some expressed concern that customers would go to Sunrise Mall instead
- Visitors don’t know how long they will be in the Village
- May cause visitors to seek parking in residential areas

#### Discussion of AT&T Parking as Overflow
**In Support**
- County providing signage could work
- Some participants mentioned using this space for a parking garage
- Will provide additional parking

**Non-Supportive**
- Security walking to and from at night is a concern
- No lighting and dark due to shrubs/trees
- Hill leading to parking would discourage older customers and those with disabilities
- No direct walking route to Fair Oaks Boulevard
- Not ADA compliant and not consistent sidewalk
- Will travel across private property in the Village
<!-- Page 80 -->
# Fair Oaks Village Parking Discussion for Owners and Tenants
## Report of Findings

### Other
- Use Scandinavian Design as overflow parking for events

**ANALYSIS:** The commonality in the responses received is the exploration of different options of the current parking configuration, including the arrangement of parking spaces, the introduction of metered parking, and the consideration of additional parking spaces such as the current AT&T parking lot for overflow. Enhancing safety was a priority for all participants for whatever option is moved forward.

### 4. Changing how traffic flows through the village
- Temescal and Main should stay two ways, but California and Park be one way
  - Lots of support for California and Park one way
  - Could create additional diagonal parking on California
- Some liked what Folsom has done with Sutter, making some of it pedestrian only
- Specifically discussed Fair Oaks Boulevard to Winding Way
- Some individuals expressed concern that converting parts of the Village into pedestrian-only areas would increase the distance between customer parking and potentially remove existing parking spots speeding concerns in the Village
- Consider roundabout at Sunset and Fair Oaks Boulevard

**ANALYSIS:** The commonality in the responses received is the consideration of changes to the traffic flow within the Village to potentially improve parking availability and explore ways to enhance pedestrian areas. Additionally, there is a specific concern about addressing speeding issues. These responses indicate a focus on optimizing transportation infrastructure and safety in the village.

A review of California Avenue indicated that additional angled parking with a one-way configuration would not be feasible due to the limited street width and the existing/new perpendicular parking spaces recently constructed at the park.

# ACTION ITEMS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The Park District currently has a project in construction that reduces the number of parking spaces and increases the demand for the remaining spots. After construction is complete, we recommend performing a traffic and parking evaluation of the Village to best understand the normalized conditions before moving forward.

1. **Allow outside dining ordinance to expire:** Due to the lack of consensus with business owners and the expiration of the emergency ordinance, recommend not pursuing continuing this option.

2. **Encourage business owners to collaborate on parking plans:** Particularly after business hours, recommend businesses should work together to devise a plan to share parking spaces. The County will revisit this after construction is completed, as these signs are in the County’s right-of-way and on public property.

3. **Maintain existing parking spaces:** With the completion of park construction, 86 parking spots for customers and employees are anticipated to become available, recommending no changes to current parking configurations at this time.

4. **Initiate the development of a Property and Business Improvement District (PBID):** There is considerable engagement from the property and business owners. We recommend a more formal governance structure be considered and formed. Supervisor Rich Desmond's office is actively scheduling a meeting with interested parties to start the process for establishing a PBID for the Fair Oaks Village.

5. **Evaluate Traffic and Parking Post-Park Construction:** After park completion, a traffic and parking evaluation is recommended, exploring the implementation of metered parking. Consideration should be given to managing meters, potentially through the Park District or PBID.

6. **Increase Parking Options:** Work with AT&T and the Park District to explore options to create a free customer overflow and employee parking lot for the Village which could include wayfinding and lighting.

**Meeting Date:** March 20th, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Naming of Facilities in Village Park  
**Prepared By:** Jen Schuler, Arts & Entertainment Manager  

I. **Recommendation**  
The Community Resources Committee has diligently reviewed numerous potential names provided by FORPD staff and community members for the new community center. After extensive deliberation and consideration of various factors, the committee strongly recommends the adoption of the “Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center” as the official designation for the new building in Plaza Park.  

II. **Background**  
The Community Resources Committee examined suggestions by FORPD staff and community members on February 6th, 2024. During this process, FORPD Staff aimed to present a comprehensive list of prospective names to the Committee, considering factors such as local relevance, community identity, and the facility's intended purpose, thereby facilitating a well-informed decision on the most resonant name for this new facility. From this list, the Committee chose to present “Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center” as the designation of the new building. This name will be the facility's title name, which includes the Black Box Theatre, the Community Flex Rooms, and the Veterans Memorial Amphitheater. The historical name of “Veterans Memorial Amphitheater” will remain intact and labeled above the amphitheater box office. The title “Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center” will appear near the entrance to the Black Box lobby entrance.  

III. **Problem / Situation / Requests**  
The need to name the building arose due to its new construction. Failing to provide a suitable name could result in [potential consequences such as confusion among community members and greater Sacramento residents and ultimately create missed opportunities for recognition. The absence of a clear and meaningful identity for the building could also undermine its significance within our community and detract from our organizational goals and objectives.
<!-- Page 87 -->
## IV. Financial Analysis
The adoption of “Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center” incurs minimal financial implications. Costs associated with the implementation of the new name, including signage updates, design fees, and communication material expenses, have been carefully evaluated and budgeted for within existing resources. The financial investment required for this initiative is justified considering the long-term benefits of establishing a distinct and meaningful identity for the building, enhancing its visibility, and fostering a sense of belonging among the community.

# STAFF REPORT

**Meeting Date:** March 20, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Approval of Reappointments to the Bond Oversight Committee  

## I. Recommendation  
The Board of Directors hereby authorizes the one-year reappointment of Amy Larsen, Dana Woodworker-Negri, Justin Drake, Kim Sarkovich and Keith Walters as members of the Bond Oversight Committee.  

## II. Background  
The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District General Obligation Bond Measure (Measure J) was approved by voters in November 2018. Measure J authorized the issuance of $26.9 million in bonds to fund various projects related to parks, sports fields, playgrounds, and other amenities.  

One of the requirements of Measure J is the creation of an independent citizen Bond Oversight Committee (BOC) to monitor how the bond funds are used and to ensure they are spent only on the projects specified in the Bond Project List. BOC members are appointed by the FORD Board of Directors (Board) and serves as a source of public input and accountability for the bond projects. The BOC members work with the Board and the Staff to review, advise, and comment on the issues and subjects related to Measure J Projects.  

The BOC was established by Resolution 2019-01, which was approved by the Board on February 27, 2019. The resolution also adopted By-Laws for the BOC that outline the composition, duties, powers, procedures, and meetings of the BOC.  

The BOC oversees all projects funded by Measure J until they are completed or terminated. However, some projects have faced delays due to various
<!-- Page 89 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

factors beyond FORD’s control, such as COVID-19 Pandemic restrictions and environmental reviews. The original By-Laws limited the BOC members to five consecutive one-year terms, but some of the members were nearing this limit due to the delays. Therefore, in February 2023, the Board amended Term 2.3 of the By-Laws to allow the BOC members to serve as many one-year terms as the Board of Directors decides thus allowing BOC members to remain on the Committee until the projects are completed.

### III. Problem /Situation / Request
At the December 13, 2023 Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Board meeting, the Board reaffirmed their desire to continue the continuity by reappointing current Bond Oversight Members who have submit applications to continue to serve on BOC until the Bond Funds are expended. Since most funds from Measure J have been committed to approved projects maintaining the current BOC composition ensures continuity, and efficient oversight of the remaining Measure J funds.

#### Reappointment terms:

| Member                     | Original Appointment | New Term Month |
|---------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Amy Larsen                | April 2019           | April 2025      |

| Kim Sarkovich             | April 2019           | April 2025      |
| Keith Walters             | March 2020           | March 2025      |

The Bond Oversight Committee Reappointment Application for each of the members seeking reappointment is attached to this report (Attachment A).

### IV. Financial Analysis
There is no financial impact to the District.

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

# STAFF REPORT

**Meeting Date:** March 20, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Cost-Sharing Agreement for Road Work  

## I. Recommendation  
Give permission to the District Administrator to mail to Sacramento County the enclosed letter (Attachment A) that terminates the Cost Share Agreement for Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Project: Village Park Roadway Resurfacing Contract No. 81662 (Attachment B) because the scope and costs of improving the road to Sacramento County standards have increased.

## II. Background  
The roadway in this Agreement is part of the Village Park Renovation Project, which is funded by Measure J, a bond measure that the Fair Oaks voters approved in November 2018. The road around the Park is owned by the County. As part of the approved design for the Park renovation project FORPD is required to repave the road from the park to the middle of the road. During the design process for the Park, Sacramento County suggested a Cost Share Agreement that would allow the whole road surface to be done by FORPD's General Contractor instead of just the half required as part of the permitting process. Sacramento County had agreed to pay for the extra work to pave the entire road. The County and the District agreed to pave the entire road around the park, with each party paying for half of the paving costs. This would improve the road conditions for the public and save money by doing the work together. The roads included in this agreement were Fair Oaks Boulevard, Park Drive, Main Street, Temescal Street, and California Avenue.  
On May 16, 2023, the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District (FORPD) signed a Cost Share Agreement with the County of Sacramento (Attachment).
<!-- Page 97 -->
### III. Problem /Situation / Request
Some of the extra roadwork was not included in the Cost Share Agreement, which was estimated to be $300,000, based on the bid documents that FORPD's consultant prepared. This estimate did not account for the extra Traffic Control costs to pave the whole road, which were around $124,054. These required more time and resources for the following items:

- Traffic control required by Sacramento County
- Cost for Phasing 5 Sections (Street Cleaning)
- Mobilization for Traffic control, Demo, Paving & Striping
- 5 Street Traffic control plans

The staff believed that FORPD could not handle a $400,000 increase to this part of the project because of the increasing costs in almost all areas of the renovation work. On February 22, 2024, the County staff offered a way to split the roadwork into two parts during a discussion with them about the higher cost. They said that FORPD could do only one half of the road, and the County would do the other half at a later date. This way, FORPD could meet its obligation and reduce the financial impact of the cost increase. After evaluating this option, FORPD Construction Team accepted it and is proposing the split roadwork option and terminating the cost share agreement.

### IV. Financial Analysis
The main project involved grinding and overlaying half of the road around the park and Bobo's initial bid will cover most of the costs. There might be a higher cost to do the work, but the Board needs to approve any Change Order to the project over $70,000 as per their requirement.

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

Attachment B: Contract No. 81663  
<!-- Page 98 -->
![Attachment A](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Letter+to+Sacramento+County)

**Letter to Sacramento County**  
**Re: Road paving work around Village Park**  

Dear Sacramento County,

We are writing to inform you that the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District (FORPD) needs to split the road paving work around Village Park that we are doing as part of the renovation project. This is in accordance with the proposal that was made by Sacramento County staff at the meeting that was held with Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District’s Project Team and Sacramento County staff on February 22, 2024.

As you may recall, at the meeting, Sacramento County Staff suggested that we could split the road paving and have FORPD do one side of the road and Sacramento County do the other side.

We have evaluated this proposal, and we agree that it is the most feasible option for Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District. Due to the current road conditions, it is impossible financially for FORPD to do the entire road and be financially responsible to bring the entire road up to acceptable standards. Our permit for the project required us to do a grind and overlay for the roadwork up to the center line from the park, and that is what we had budgeted for. The additional work to meet the current standards for the entire road is not something we can afford and because of this we need to split the work.

Under Term 13 (A) of Cost Share Agreement for Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Project: Village Park Roadway Resurfacing County Contract No. 81662 Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District is providing notice of its intent to terminate the contract due to financial restraints.

Additionally, we would like to inform you that we have had expenditures for design, engineering, and construction management in preparation of repaving the entire road width, as per the original agreement with the County. We will be seeking reimbursement for 50% of those documented expenditures and as allowed in the Agreement according to term 13 (D) 1.

We appreciate your cooperation and understanding in this matter. We hope that this arrangement will benefit both the County and the FORPD, as well as the residents and visitors of Village Park. We look forward to working with you on this project and completing it as soon as possible.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns. You can reach us at (916) 966-1036 or maho@forpd.org.

Sincerely,

# STAFF REPORT

**Meeting Date:** March 20, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Community Clubhouse Window Replacement or Repair  

## I. Recommendation  
Provide staff directions to either replace the windows and fix the dry rot on windows E and F (Attachment A) or to fix the dry rot and put a cover on the outside and put in a fake window.

## II. Background  
As part of the Measure J work, one of the District's facilities that is undergoing renovation is the Community Clubhouse. It has eight (8) windows that need to be replaced and/or repaired: three (3) on the east side of the Clubhouse at the back, four (4) on the south side of the Clubhouse and one (1) facing west. The reason for replacing and rebuilding these windows is that the frames have a lot of dry rot. The frames and windows will have to be removed and any dry rot that is found inside the building structure will have to be fixed or replaced. The extent of the dry rot was revealed when some of the work on the outside of the Clubhouse was done.  
Four of the eight windows are hard to access from the inside of the Clubhouse because they are close to the Organ or the Organ Pipes. These are windows B, C, D and G in Attachment A. Those windows would require a lot of work to repair them properly since there is extremely limited access from the inside of the Clubhouse due to the Organ and the Organ Pipes. The four windows do not provide any natural light or air to the inside of the Clubhouse.
<!-- Page 115 -->
### III. Problem /Situation/ Request
On March 11, 2024 Director Irwin and Chairman Carhart from the Construction Ad-Hoc Committee inspected the windows and agreed to cover windows B, C, D, G and H with stucco from the outside and not replace them. They also agreed to replace or repair Window A. The two Ad-Hoc Members did not agree on windows E and F. One wanted to fix the windows and the other wanted to put a Fake window over them from the outside that looks like the current two pane style. A Fake window would preserve the historic appearance of the southside of the wall. Fixing the two windows would let natural light into the back of the stage and allow for air flow when open. Windows E and F are on the back part of the Community Clubhouse Stage and let natural light into the stage area. Since the two members did not agree they asked staff to bring this item to the full Board for a decision.

Our Construction Manager has informed staff that there are challenges with obtaining new and replacement windows, such as lack of materials, shipping setbacks and strong demand for new windows this season. This could impact the completion time of the Clubhouse, depending on the sequence of the work that is done on the exterior and interior of the Community Clubhouse. Therefore, we need to decide quickly.

### IV. Financial Analysis
When the renovation and construction of the Community Clubhouse was planned or budgeted, it did not account for window replacement or repair. The staff is working on estimating the costs for this but they did not get a quote before this Board Report was prepared. Staff hope that a cost comparison can be made for replacing vs. making a faux window. Staff advises that any work that is done for this aspect of the Construction Project be done according to time and material.

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

# SACRAMENTO COUNTY  
## Annual Investment Policy  
### of the Pooled Investment Fund  
#### CALENDAR YEAR 2024  

I. Authority  
Under the Sacramento County Charter, the Board of Supervisors established the position of Director of Finance and by ordinance will annually review and renew the Director of Finance’s authority to invest and reinvest all the funds in the County Treasury.  

II. Policy Statement  
This Investment Policy (Policy) establishes cash management and investment guidelines for the Director of Finance, who is responsible for the stewardship of the Sacramento County Pooled Investment Fund. Each transaction and the entire portfolio must comply with California Government Code and this Policy. All portfolio activities will be judged by the standards of the Policy and its investment objectives. Activities that violate its spirit and intent will be considered contrary to the Policy.  

III. Standard of Care  
The Director of Finance is the Trustee of the Pooled Investment Fund and therefore, a fiduciary subject to the prudent investor standard. The Director of Finance, employees involved in the investment process, and members of the Sacramento County Treasury Oversight Committee (Oversight Committee) shall refrain from all personal business activities that could conflict with the management of the investment program. All individuals involved will be required to report all gifts and income in accordance with California state law. When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling and managing public funds, the Director of Finance shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence to meet the aims of the investment objectives listed in Section IV, Investment Objectives.  

IV. Investment Objectives  
The Pooled Investment Fund shall be prudently invested in order to earn a reasonable return, while awaiting application for governmental purposes. The specific objectives for the Pooled Investment Fund are ranked in order of importance.  

A. Safety of Principal  
The preservation of principal is the primary objective. Each transaction shall seek to ensure that capital losses are avoided, whether they be from securities default or erosion of market value.  

Page 1  
<!-- Page 127 -->
# Annual Investment Policy of the Pooled Investment Fund  
## Calendar Year 2024  

### B. Liquidity  
As a second objective, the Pooled Investment Fund should remain sufficiently flexible to enable the Director of Finance to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated in any depositor's fund.  

### C. Public Trust  
In managing the Pooled Investment Fund, the Director of Finance and the authorized investment traders should avoid any transactions that might impair public confidence in Sacramento County and the participating local agencies. Investments should be made with precision and care, considering the probable safety of the capital as well as the probable income to be derived.  

### D. Maximum Rate of Return  
As the fourth objective, the Pooled Investment Fund should be designed to attain a market average rate of return through budgetary and economic cycles, consistent with the risk limitations, prudent investment principles and cash flow characteristics identified herein. For comparative purposes, the State of California Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) will be used as a performance benchmark. The Pooled Investment Fund quarterly performance benchmark target has been set at or above LAIF’s yield. This benchmark was chosen because LAIF’s portfolio structure is similar to the Pooled Investment Fund.  

### V. Pooled Investment Fund Investors  
The Pooled Investment Fund investors are comprised of Sacramento County, school and community college districts, districts directed by the Board of Supervisors, and independent special districts and joint powers authorities whose treasurer is the Director of Finance. Any local agencies not included in this category are subject to California Government Code section 53684 and are referred to as outside investors.  

### VI. Implementation  
In order to provide direction to those responsible for management of the Pooled Investment Fund, the Director of Finance has established this Policy and will provide it to the Oversight Committee and render it to legislative bodies of local agencies that participate in the Pooled Investment Fund. In accordance with California Government Code section 53646, et seq., the Board of Supervisors shall review and approve this Policy annually at a public meeting.  

This Policy provides a detailed description of investment parameters used to implement the investment process and includes the following: investable funds; authorized instruments; prohibited investments; credit requirements; maximum maturities and concentrations; repurchase agreements; Community Reinvestment Act Program; criteria and qualifications of broker/dealers and direct issuers; investment guidelines, management style and strategy; Approved Lists; and calculation of yield and costs.

VII. Internal Controls  
The Director of Finance shall establish internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that the investment objectives are met and to ensure that the assets are protected from loss, theft, or misuse. To assist in implementation and internal controls, the Director of Finance has established an Investment Group and a Review Group.

The Investment Group, which is comprised of the Director of Finance and his/her designees, is responsible for maintenance of the investment guidelines and Approved Lists. These guidelines and lists can be altered daily, if needed, to adjust to the ever-changing financial markets. The guidelines can be more conservative or match the policy language. In no case can the guidelines override the Policy.

The Review Group, which is comprised of the Director of Finance and his/her designees, is responsible for the monthly review and appraisal of all the investments purchased by the Director of Finance and staff. This review includes bond proceeds, which are invested separately from the Pooled Investment Fund and are not governed by this Policy.

The Director of Finance shall establish a process for daily, monthly, quarterly, and annual review and monitoring of the Pooled Investment Fund activity. The following articles, in order of supremacy, govern the Pooled Investment Fund:

1. California Government Code  
2. Annual Investment Policy  
3. Current Investment Guidelines  
4. Approved Lists (see page 9, Section IX.K)  

The Director of Finance shall review the daily investment activity and corresponding bank balances.

Monthly, the Review Group shall review all investment activity and its compliance to the corresponding governing articles and investment objectives.

All securities purchased, with the exception of bank deposits, money market mutual funds, and LAIF, shall be delivered to the independent third-party custodian selected by the Director of Finance. This includes all collateral for repurchase agreements. All trades, where applicable, will be executed by delivery versus payment by the designated third-party custodian.

VIII. Sacramento County Treasury Oversight Committee  
In accordance with California Government Code section 27130 et seq., the Board of Supervisors, in consultation with the Director of Finance, has created the Sacramento County Treasury Oversight Committee (Oversight Committee). Annually, the Oversight Committee shall cause an audit to be conducted on the Pooled Investment Fund. The meetings of the Oversight Committee shall be open to the public and subject to the Ralph M. Brown Act.

![Annual Investment Policy of the Pooled Investment Fund Calendar Year 2024](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Annual+Investment+Policy+of+the+Pooled+Investment+Fund+Calendar+Year+2024)

A member of the Oversight Committee may not be employed by an entity that has contributed to the campaign of a candidate for the office of local treasurer, or contributed to the campaign of a candidate to be a member of a legislative body of any local agency that has deposited funds in the county treasury, in the previous three years or during the period that the employee is a member of the Oversight Committee. A member may not directly or indirectly raise money for a candidate for local treasurer or a member of the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors or governing board of any local agency that has deposited funds in the county treasury while a member of the Oversight Committee. Finally, a member may not secure employment with, or be employed by bond underwriters, bond counsel, security brokerages or dealers, or financial services firms, with whom the treasurer is doing business during the period that the person is a member of the Oversight Committee or for one year after leaving the committee.

The Oversight Committee is not allowed to direct individual investment decisions, select individual investment advisors, brokers or dealers, or impinge on the day-to-day operations of the Department of Finance treasury and investment operations.

IX. Investment Parameters

A. Investable Funds  
Total Investable Funds (TIF) for purposes of this Policy are all Pooled Investment Fund moneys that are available for investment at any one time, including the estimated bank account float. Included in TIF are funds of outside investors, if applicable, for which the Director of Finance provides investment services. Excluded from TIF are all funds held in separate portfolios.

The Cash Flow Horizon is the period in which the Pooled Investment Fund cash flow can be reasonably forecasted. This Policy establishes the Cash Flow Horizon to be one (1) year.

Once the Director of Finance has deemed that the cash flow forecast can be met, the Director of Finance may invest funds in securities with maturities beyond one year. These securities will be referred to as the Core Portfolio.

B. Authorized Investments  
Authorized investments shall match the general categories established by the California Government Code sections 53601 et seq. and 53635 et seq. Authorized investments shall include, in accordance with California Government Code section 16429.1, investments into LAIF. Authorization for specific instruments within these general categories, as well as narrower portfolio concentration and maturity limits, will be established and maintained by the Investment Group as part of the Investment Guidelines. As the California Government Code is amended, this Policy shall likewise become amended.

**C. Prohibited Investments**  
No investments shall be authorized that have the possibility of returning a zero or negative yield if held to maturity except for securities issued by, or backed by, the United States government during a period of negative market interest rates. Prohibited investments shall include inverse floaters, range notes, and interest only strips derived from a pool of mortgages.

All legal investments issued by a tobacco-related company are prohibited. A tobacco-related company is defined as an entity that makes smoking products from tobacco used in cigarettes, cigars, or snuff or for smoking in pipes. The tobacco-related issuers restricted from any investment are any component companies in the Dow Jones U.S. Tobacco Index or the NYSE Arca Tobacco Index.

**D. Credit Requirements**  
Except for municipal obligations and Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) bank deposits and certificates of deposit, the issuer's short-term credit ratings shall be at or above A-1 by Standard & Poor’s, P-1 by Moody's, and, if available, F1 by Fitch, and the issuer’s long-term credit ratings shall be at or above A by Standard & Poor’s, A2 by Moody's, and, if available, A by Fitch. There are no credit requirements for Registered State Warrants. All other municipal obligations shall be at or above a short-term rating of SP-1 by Standard & Poor’s, MIG1 by Moody’s, and, if available, F1 by Fitch.

**Community Reinvestment Act Program Credit Requirements**  

| Maximum Amount                                   | Minimum Requirements                                                                                     |

| Up to the FDIC- or NCUSIF-insured limit for the term of the deposit | Banks — FDIC Insurance Coverage <br> Credit Unions — NCUSIF Insurance Coverage <br> Credit unions are limited to a maximum deposit of the NCUSIF-insured limit since they are not rated by nationally recognized rating agencies and are not required to provide collateral on public deposits. |
| Over the FDIC- or NCUSIF-insured limit          | (Any 2 of 3 ratings) <br> S&P: A-2 <br> Moody's: P-2 <br> Fitch: F-2 OR through a private sector entity that assists in the placement of deposits to achieve FDIC insurance coverage of the full deposit and accrued interest. <br> Collateral is required. |

Eligible banks must have Community Reinvestment Act performance ratings of “satisfactory” or “outstanding” from their federal regulator. In addition, deposits greater than the federally-insured amount must be collateralized. Banks must either have a letter of credit issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco or place securities worth between 110% and 150% of the value of the deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, or a trust bank.

Since credit unions do not have Community Reinvestment Act performance ratings, they must demonstrate a commitment to community reinvestment lending and charitable activities comparable to what is required of banks.

All commercial paper and medium-term note issues must be issued by corporations operating within the United States and having total assets in excess of one billion dollars ($1,000,000,000).

The Investment Group may raise these credit standards as part of the Investment Guidelines and Approved Lists. Appendix A provides a Comparison and Interpretation of Credit Ratings by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch.

E. Maximum Maturities

Due to the nature of the invested funds, no investment with limited market liquidity should be used. Appropriate amounts of highly-liquid investments, such as U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, should be maintained to accommodate unforeseen withdrawals.

The maximum maturity, determined as the term from the date of ownership to the date of maturity, for each investment shall be established as follows:

- U.S. Treasury and Agency Obligations: 5 years
- Washington Supranational Obligations: 5 years
- Municipal Notes: 5 years
- Registered State Warrants: 5 years
- Bankers Acceptances: 180 days
- Commercial Paper: 270 days
- Negotiable Certificates of Deposit: 270 days
- CRA Bank Deposit/Certificates of Deposit: 1 year
- Repurchase Agreements: 1 year
- Reverse Repurchase Agreements: 92 days
- Medium-Term Corporate Notes: 180 days
- Collateralized Mortgage Obligations: 180 days

*The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International Finance Corporation, and Inter-American Development Bank.*

<!-- Page 132 -->
# Annual Investment Policy of the Pooled Investment Fund  
## Calendar Year 2024  

The Investment Group may reduce these maturity limits to a shorter term as part of the Investment Guidelines and the Approved Lists.  

The ultimate maximum maturity of any investment shall be five (5) years. The dollar-weighted average maturity of all securities shall be equal to or less than three (3) years.  

### F. Maximum Concentrations  
No more than 80% of the portfolio may be invested in issues other than U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations. The maximum allowable percentage for each type of security is set forth as follows:  

- U.S. Treasury and Agency Obligations ......................................................... 100%  
- Municipal Notes ......................................................................................... 80%  
- Registered State Warrants ......................................................................... 80%  
- Bankers Acceptances .................................................................................. 40%  
- Commercial Paper ...................................................................................... 40%  
- Washington Supranational Obligations ..................................................... 30%  
- Negotiable Certificates of Deposit and CRA Deposit/Certificates of Deposit .30%  
- Repurchase Agreements .......................................................................... 30%  
- Reverse Repurchase Agreements .............................................................. 20%  
- Medium-Term Corporate Notes .................................................................. 30%  
- Money Market Mutual Funds ...................................................................... 20%  
- Collateralized Mortgage Obligations .......................................................... 20%  
- Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) ..................................................... (per State limit)  

The Investment Group may reduce these concentrations as part of the Investment Guidelines and the Approved Lists.  

Excluding U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, no more than 10% of the portfolio may be invested in securities of a single issuer including its related entities.  

Where a percentage limitation is established above, for the purpose of determining investment compliance, that maximum percentage will be applied on the date of purchase.  

### G. Repurchase Agreements  
Under California Government Code section 53601, paragraph (j) and section 53635, the Director of Finance may enter into Repurchase Agreements and Reverse Repurchase Agreements. The maximum maturity of a Repurchase Agreement shall be one year. The maximum maturity of a reverse repurchase agreement shall be 92 days, and the proceeds of a reverse repurchase agreement may not be invested beyond the expiration of the agreement. The reverse repurchase agreement must be "matched to maturity" and meet all other requirements in the code.

All repurchase agreements must have an executed Sacramento County Master Repurchase Agreement on file with both the Director of Finance and the Broker/Dealer. Repurchase Agreements executed with approved broker-dealers must be collateralized with either: (1) U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations with a market value of 102% for collateral marked to market daily; or (2) money market instruments on the Approved Lists of the County that meet the qualifications of the Policy, with a market value of 102%. Since the market value of the underlying securities is subject to daily market fluctuations, investments in repurchase agreements shall be in compliance if the value of the underlying securities is brought back up to 102% no later than the next business day. Use of mortgage-backed securities for collateral is not permitted. Strictly for purposes of investing the daily excess bank balance, the collateral provided by the Sacramento County's depository bank can be U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations valued at 110%, or mortgage-backed securities valued at 150%.

H. Community Reinvestment Act Program  
The Director of Finance has allocated within the Pooled Investment Fund, a maximum of $90 million for the Community Reinvestment Act Program to encourage community investment by financial institutions, which includes community banks and credit unions, and to acknowledge and reward local financial institutions that support the community's financial needs. The Director of Finance may increase this amount, as appropriate, while staying within the investment policy objectives and maximum maturity and concentration limits. The eligible banks and savings banks must have Community Reinvestment Act performance ratings of “satisfactory” or “outstanding” from each financial institution’s regulatory authority. The minimum credit requirements are located on page 5 of Section IX.D.

I. Criteria and Qualifications of Brokers/Dealers and Direct Issuers  
All transactions initiated on behalf of the Pooled Investment Fund and Sacramento County shall be executed through either government security dealers reporting as primary dealers to the Market Reports Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or direct issuers that directly issue their own securities that have been placed on the Approved List of brokers/dealers and direct issuers. Further, these firms must have an investment grade rating from at least two national rating services, if available.

Brokers/Dealers and direct issuers that have exceeded the political contribution limits, as contained in Rule G-37 of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, within the preceding four-year period to the Director of Finance, any member of the Board of Supervisors, or any candidate for the Board of Supervisors, are prohibited from the Approved List of brokers/dealers and direct issuers.

## J. Investment Guidelines, Management Style and Strategy

The costs of managing the investment portfolio, including but not limited to: investment management; accounting for the investment activity; custody of the assets; managing and accounting for the banking; receiving and remitting deposits; oversight controls; and indirect and overhead expenses are charged to the investment earnings based upon actual labor hours worked in respective areas. Costs of these respective areas are accumulated by specific cost accounting projects and charged to the Pooled Investment Fund on a quarterly basis throughout the fiscal year.

The Department of Finance will allocate the net interest earnings of the Pooled Investment Fund quarterly. The net interest earnings are allocated based upon the average daily cash balance of each Pooled Investment Fund participant.

### XI. Withdraw Requests for Pooled Fund Investors  
The Director of Finance will honor all requests to withdraw funds for normal cash flow purposes that are approved by the Director of Finance at a one dollar net asset value. Any requests to withdraw funds for purposes other than immediate cash flow needs, such as for external investing, are subject to the consent of the Director of Finance. In accordance with California Government Code Sections 27133(h) and 27136, such requests for withdrawals must first be made in writing to the Director of Finance. When evaluating a request to withdraw funds, the Director of Finance will take into account the effect of a withdrawal on the stability and predictability of the Pooled Investment Fund and the interests of other depositors. Any withdrawal for such purposes will be at the market value of the Pooled Investment Fund on the date of the withdrawal.  

### XII. Limits on Honoraria, Gifts, and Gratuities  
In accordance with California Government Code Section 27133(d), this Policy establishes limits for the Director of Finance; individuals responsible for management of the portfolios; and members of the Investment Group and Review Group who direct individual investment decisions, select individual investment advisors and broker/dealers, and conduct day-to-day investment trading activity.
