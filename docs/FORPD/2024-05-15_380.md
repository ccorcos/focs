Subject: County AHJ - Fireblocking penetrations at non-rated walls  

Hi Dave / John -  
Meeting summary notes of site visit from Sacramento County Supervising Building Inspector Paul Kukulka on November 21, 2023:  
- Purpose of meeting was to obtain clarification for remediation of building inspection correction notice for Permit No CBAC-20-00531 Community Clubhouse. Correction note #2 requires "Provide fire stopping throughout". Verbal instruction from the building inspector included firestopping of penetrations of all horizontal blocking, top and bottom plates in all Non-rated wood framed walls; these non-rated wall cavities are filled with non-faced fiberglass batt insulation.  
- Inspector Kukulka directed that the County Building Department has interpreted CBC 718.2 Fireblocking to require fire caulking of all through penetrations of fire blocking for all Non-Rated wood stud wall cavities, regardless if filled with fiberglass insulation. Specific direction included:  
  o Fire caulking that is UL rated for the application and installed with depth/thickness as determined by UL listing.  
  o Fire caulking applied to all penetrations of fireblocks within a 10’ vertical and 10’ horizontal direction. For other blocking within this area, the penetrations are not required to be fire caulked.  
  o Fire caulking of penetrations of stud wall top plates to ceiling/roof assemblies.  
  o Fire caulking of penetrations of bottom plates to floor/ceiling assemblies.

**CHANGE ORDER REQUEST**

**COR Date:** April 23, 2024  
**COR #:** 023  
**Job Name:** Village Park Renovation  
**Job Number:** 33-12191  

**Description:** Corroded Pipe under Clubhouse - V3  

We are pleased to offer the following specifications and pricing to perform the following changes:  
Per approved RFI #217, due to ~1" thick corrosion on 80' of currently installed piping, it was suggested to fully replace section with progress copper piping, hangers and fittings to avoid any damage to newly installed piping and plumbing fixtures downstream. Labor for digging up existing water main, demolition of 80' of existing piping and installation of all new material is included.  

Note: If corroded piping is not replaced, any damage caused because of corrosive sediment that warrants repair or replacement will not be covered under warranty due to existing conditions.  

Also note that there is an added $1250 for chlorination of the extra piping with a $600 alternate if we're able to perform the chlorination at the same time as the club house. We carried the $600 price in the COR under the assumption that we're able to do both at the same time. If we are not able to, we will provide a separate COR for the additional $650 at that time.  

**Specific Exclusions:**  
Standard Contract Exclusions apply  
Does not include weekend or OT hours  

**THE TOTAL AMOUNT TO PROVIDE THIS WORK IS:** $ 9,181  

All material pricing is valid for one week. If you have any questions, please contact me at (916) 381-8080.

**Question**  
From Gage Burget Bobo Construction, Inc. on Monday, Apr 3, 2023 at 11:27 AM PDT  
We have received the following from Mark III:  

During attempted install of new shut off valve feeding the Clubhouse, Mark III discovered broken and corroded pipe that looks to have had an attempted repair once before. The entire length of the existing CW pipe was found to be corroded and out of code. The thread protector use as a coupling and the absence of hangers need to be brought up to code and the existing pipe run needs to be replaced as the 2" pipe has only 1" ID. Overtime, the incoming pressure and volume of water coming off the newly installed pipe into the corroded pipe will overwhelm the system and cause backups/clogs in the future. Mark III suggests to replace all 80ft of CW pipe installed beneath the Clubhouse. Photos included for review.

**Question**  
Question from Gage Burget Bobo Construction, Inc. on Monday, Jan 29, 2024 at 01:21 PM PST  
The existing AC unit at the north clubhouse exit had to be moved in order to install the stairs as it was in conflict with the footings. The unit originally was standing on 4x4s on a concrete pad and was not anchored. We need direction as to how the unit is to be reinstalled per code, anchoring, location for the unit, and coordination between electrical and mechanical. Additionally, there is a fire sprinkler line hanging in this location that does not appear to have any purpose (see attached photos). Can this be removed? Please advise.

**Activity**  
**Question from Gage Burget Bobo Construction, Inc. on Wednesday, Feb 28, 2024 at 10:36 AM PST**  
We need details on how to structurally anchor the smoke hatches at the roof. The approved Bilco hatches are just under 2,000 pounds each. The smoke hatches are also wider than the openings for them and currently do not align with any of the structural members of the roof. If these were to be installed now as is, they would be anchored only to 1-1/2" plywood. We want to make sure these units will be structurally secure once installed and the plans do not currently show any structural details for this. Additionally, we need to know what fasteners are to be used for anchoring. The plans do not call any out and there is no manufacturer recommendation from Bilco.  

We also need clarification and direction on the finish for these smoke hatches. The specs call for a gray exterior finish. With the roof having red tile, we want to clarify if gray is the desired color finish and if so we need to know what the exact color is to be.

![INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=INSTALLATION+INSTRUCTIONS+BILCO+AUTOMATIC+FIRE+VENT)

**CAUTION**  
COVER SPRING LOADED

1. Do not remove the steel strapping until unit is to be installed and is in normal horizontal position.  
2. Place the fire vent over the roof opening with the exterior manual release cable at the desired end (if not wanted, the exterior release handle can be removed by snipping cable).  
3. Check that the frame is in the proper plane and not twisted or racked due to an uneven mounting surface. Shim under the base flange, if required, to be sure cover(s) closes properly on the frame.  
4. Secure the vent to the roof deck through holes provided in the base flange using appropriate fasteners.  
5. Complete the installation in accordance with accepted roofing industry practice. Suggested method:  
   a). For single ply roofing, apply adhesive and fold over 4" (10cm) of the top edge of the membrane skirt flashing and insert it under the cap flashing. Complete all sides. With screwdriver and hammer, bend Bil-Clip™ tabs inward to hold membrane in place (see sectional detail).  
   b). For built-up roofing, install a cant block around the curb. Run roofing plies to the top of the cant and cut off. Apply two layers of No. 15 felt on the curb under the integral cap flashing extending beyond the outside base of the cant block. Secure the felts with alternate howeled coats of finishing cement. **DO NOT BEND Bil-Clip™ TABS INWARD.**  
6. Vents with red oxide factory prime should receive a finish coat of alkyd enamel.

# STAFF REPORT

**Meeting Date:** May 15, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Approval of Amphitheater Seating Proposal  

## I. Recommendation  
Authorize the District Administrator to sign documents to start the renovation project for the seating area in the Veteran's Memorial Amphitheatre, which is part of the Village Park Renovation Project. The project is estimated to cost $904,935. Instruct staff to seek a preferred funding option and to present an official request for Board action at a future meeting.

## II. Background  
The Veteran's Memorial Amphitheatre is a historic and popular venue for outdoor events and performances in Plaza Park. As part of the Park Renovation Project, which aims to revitalize and improve the park facilities and amenities, the Amphitheatre was scheduled for a major upgrade. The original design of the renovation included new landscaping, lighting, sound system, stage, restrooms, and dressing rooms for the Amphitheatre, but did not include the replacement of the existing wooden bench seating. This was a financial decision to save some money and to revisit the seating issue at a later time.

The original design only planned to add two sections of ADA-compliant seating to meet the accessibility requirements. However, during the construction process, it became evident that the old seating would not match the new style and quality of the renovated Amphitheatre, and that replacing the seating later would be more difficult and costly, due to the expected increase in material and labor costs and the disruption to the newly finished facilities. Therefore, the Board directed staff to investigate the option of replacing the bench seating.
<!-- Page 150 -->
### III. Problem /Situation/ Request

The problem that the Board needs to address is how to fund the replacement of the bench seating at the Amphitheatre, which was not included in the original budget of the Park Renovation Project. The cost of replacing the seating is estimated at $904,935, which includes construction, demolition, regrading, paving, seating, aisle lighting, and architectural services (Attachment D).

The overall Measure J work, which covers the Park Renovation Project and other improvements in the District, has experienced a budget increase due to unforeseen site conditions, material changes, and higher construction costs. Some of the factors that contributed to the increased costs were utility work, road improvements, the Clubhouse Foundation, and site restrictions due to slope and elevation. The staff has been able to identify sources of funds to cover the increased costs, such as grants, Impact Fees, In-Lieu Fees, and others. However, the renovation of the Amphitheatre seating was not part of this budget increase, so additional sources of funds are needed for this project.

The staff has investigated different choices of financing this project and is offering a preliminary overview for this written report. Staff will give a more comprehensive overview of the financing options at your Board Meeting on May 15, 2024. The Board will need to approve any option that is chosen at a later meeting. The Board's actions at this meeting are to authorize the start of the work on the Amphitheatre seating renovation and to direct staff to pursue the preferred financing option.

The staff has asked Senator Padilla and Congressman Bera for $2.4 million from the US Senate and House Appropriations Funds for ADA upgrades in the Park and the Village. These requests could free up some of the Measure J funds for the Amphitheatre seating, but we don't know if or when the funding requests will be approved, since the funds are competitive and uncertain. So, the staff has found two more funding options that can cover this project.

The first option is a Real Property Direct Placement Lease that is secured with the District's Administration Office. This option would be a loan for $1,275,000 for 20 years at 5% interest rate, with no early payoff penalty. The second option is to sell the District's Cell Tower Lease, which has an estimated value of $1,500,000 to $2,100,000. Either option could raise the funds needed to cover the renovation costs, but they also have some disadvantages, such as giving up future income sources or requiring the District to take out a loan and repay it over 20 years at a 5% interest rate. The staff is working on a comprehensive analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of each option, which will be presented at your meeting.
