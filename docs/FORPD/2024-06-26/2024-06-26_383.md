Question from Gage Burget Bobo Construction, Inc. on Tuesday, Jun 13, 2023 at 08:54 AM PDT  

We have received the following from Marquee Fire Protection:  

Structural changes in the stage area occurred and framing no longer matches what is on the plans. The changes cause the pendent sprinkler in the stage door area to be blocked due to framing.  
Marquee is proposing to replace the pendent sprinklers in the clouded area with sidewall sprinklers to allow for installation and coverage. Plans comparing the original plan to the proposed changes will be attached at the end of this RFI.  
Are the proposed changes acceptable? If not, please provide an alternative layout.  
Also attached below are some field pictures for visualization.

Awaiting an Official Response  

**WMB Response | JR | 2023-06-14**  
EOR takes no exception to the proposed changes.  
Please note that the installation of vertical soffit framing and gyp where noted on the section, pg 9 of 9, shall be such that the pendant sprinklers at the roof provide coverage for the truss area.

**V2 - Bracing for Operable Partition Soffit**

**Activity**  

**Question**  
Question from Gage Burget Bobo Construction, Inc. on Wednesday, Nov 29, 2023 at 01:27 PM PST  
The operable partition soffit (shown on attached snapshot of drawing A5.3) is not currently shown to have any seismic bracing. It appears to just basically hang from the T-bar above. We feel that, over the span of the approximately 3 foot space, there is potential for lateral movement here, especially with the partition doors attaching to the bottom of the soffit and operating underneath. Should there be any sort of bracing added at the soffit? If so, please provide details.  

**Attachments**

**Awaiting an Official Response**  
See detail following for bracing.

Re: Fair Oaks Clubhouse  
RFI #182 : V3- Clubhouse Fire Alarm System  

Dear Tara,  

The following is our response to the questions in RFI #182 : V3- Clubhouse Fire Alarm System:  

**Subject: RFI #182 : V3- Clubhouse Fire Alarm System**  
**Question asked by Eric Larson (R&D Electric.)**  

**Question:**  
We have received the following from R&D Electric:  

The contract drawings for the Clubhouse show the existing fire alarm system to remain and new fire alarm to be installed in restrooms and drawings were submitted as such. The comments returned on the submittal are requiring an upgrade to the entire building Fire Alarm system to bring the system up to current code. Please advise how you would like us to proceed.  

**Response:** Officially, the Fire Marshal has only requested:  
1) Provide the location of all existing devices. If horn/strobe devices are not throughout the entire building, specifically the lower level community room, foyers and both kitchen, they are required to be added with the Tenant Improvement.  
2) Pull stations shall be located within 5 feet of all exit doors.  

This can be corrected by pull stations relocation, and adding a power supply and devices where requested.  

There wasn’t a written request to upgrade/replace the entire system.  

Please update the submittal to the Fire Department to meet the written request.  

Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions.  

Sincerely,  
HCS Engineering Inc.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** June 19, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Approval of Change Order for Bobo Construction in the Amount of $399,777 for the Village Park Renovation Project  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Authorize the District Administrator to sign documents to approve Change Order No. 165 for the Village Park Renovation Project. The change order is necessary to address unforeseen conditions and to extend the project timeline, resulting in an additional cost of $399,777. This change order includes 168 additional days due to weather delays.

---

**II. Background**  
Measure J, approved by voters in November 2018, provided funding for various park improvements, including the Village Park Renovation Project. This measure has been instrumental in enabling the District to undertake substantial enhancements across multiple park facilities. The Village Park Renovation Project is an ongoing effort to improve and modernize the facilities at Village Park. Bobo Construction Inc. has been contracted to carry out these renovations. During the course of the project, it was determined that additional time and resources were required due to unforeseen site conditions and weather-related delays. The Board of Directors has authorized the District Administrator to approve changes to the project up to $70,000. However, this change order exceeds that limit and requires Board approval.

---

**III. Problem / Situation / Request**  
The existing contract did not account for the extensive weather delays and site conditions encountered. To maintain the project's integrity and ensure timely completion, Change Order No. 165 has been proposed. This change...
<!-- Page 156 -->
order accounts for an additional 168 days to the project schedule and covers costs associated with the delay. Change Order No. 165 is essential to address the unforeseen conditions and ensure the completion of the Village Park Renovation Project. The additional costs are justified by the necessity to extend the project timeline and cover the associated labor and overhead. According to Section 14.01 of the contract with Bobo Construction, any additional time required due to unavoidable delays caused by conditions beyond the control of the contractor, such as weather, may entitle the contractor to an extension of the contract time. Section 14.02 states that the contractor must provide notice of delays and request time extensions, specifying the cause and providing a detailed schedule analysis. If the delays are compensable, the contractor is entitled to an adjustment of the contract sum as per Article 15. Additionally, Section 15.07 outlines allowable costs for any change order, including costs of labor, first-line supervision, actual costs of materials, and rental costs of machinery and equipment. These terms justify Bobo Construction's request for additional costs due to the allowable delay.

IV. Financial Analysis  
The total cost of the change order is $399,777. This includes labor costs, markups, and credits for weather-related non-compensable delays. The financial impact is significant but necessary to address the delays and ensure the project's completion. Measure J funds will be used to cover this increase in cost.

Respectfully Submitted,  
Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

Procore is renewed annually (on 4/6) and is based on total volume expected for the year, but is not audited for a credit if we do less than the amount estimated. The project has now entered a new billing cycle for the software since the project was to be done prior to 4/6/24 and its remaining cost had to be factored into the renewal.

| I  Insert Contractor's basic hourly rate, health & welfare, pension, vacation/holiday and other payments in columns "D" to "H", then add training to column "J". Subtotal straight and overtime hour rates will be calculated at column "K" which includes "Fringes Benefits". Please note that ONLY "basic hourly rates" will change for over time and all other "Fringe Benefits" remain the same as straight hourly rates. |
| II Insert Contractor's workman compensation rate at lower section of columns "N" where shows "0.00%" for each contractor/trade. Total hourly rate including "Fringes Benefits" and all "Burden" will be calculated at column "R". Since "Burden" are percentages of the "subtotal straight/NOT hourly rates" they will increase for over time rates and will be calculated automatically by the spreadsheet. |

Good morning guys  

Sorry for the delayed response. The daily rate looks acceptable. We appreciate the efforts by Bobo on this rate.  

Please prep and send a revised PCO reflecting this rate ($2,257/day). **If Bobo would consider that 14 to 21 calendar days (10 to 15 work days) should have been anticipated for typical weather during the year**, which would have been non-compensable, it would go a long way towards resolving the amount(s) presented to the Board.  

Once we receive the revised PCO, I will have discussions with FORPD and push to resolve.  

Thanks,

Hey Dave,  

Went through and fine tuned the calendar day overhead amounts and here is what I have come up with based on the records I have. I can provide backup for these numbers and will but wanted to run it by you first before I started compiling all the information.

![ARTICLE 14. DELAYS AND EXTENSIONS OF TIME](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=ARTICLE+14.+DELAYS+AND+EXTENSIONS+OF+TIME)

**Section 14.01. Extensions of Time; Unavoidable Delays.**  
The Contractor shall not be granted an extension of time except on the issuance of a Change Order by the District, upon a finding of good cause for such extension.

1. As used herein, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

   a. **"Excusable Delay"** means any delay in completion of the Work beyond the expiration of the Contract Time caused by conditions beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. These events may include strikes, embargoes, fire, unavoidable casualties, national emergency, and stormy and inclement weather conditions in which the District Representative and Project Inspector agree that work on the critical path cannot continue. The financial inability of the Contractor or any Subcontractor or supplier and any default of any Subcontractor, without limitation, shall not be deemed conditions beyond the Contractor’s control. An Excusable Delay may entitle the Contractor to an extension of the Contract time, in accordance with this Section of the general conditions, but shall not entitle the Contractor to any adjustment of the Contract Sum.

   b. **"Compensable Delay"** means any delay in the completion of the Work beyond the expiration date of the Contract Time caused solely by the wrongful acts of the District and which delay is unreasonable under the circumstances and not within the contemplation of the parties. A Compensable Delay may entitle the Contractor to an extension of the Contract Time, in accordance with this Section of the General Conditions and/or an adjustment of the Contract Sum, in accordance with Article 15. Except as provided herein, the Contractor shall have no claim for damage or compensation for any delay, interruption, hindrance, or disruption.

   c. **"Inexcusable Delay"** means any delay in completion of the Work beyond the expiration of the Contract Time resulting from causes other than those listed in Subparagraphs A1 and A2, above. An Inexcusable Delay will not entitle the Contractor to an extension of the Contract Time or an adjustment of the Contract Sum.

2. The Contractor may make a claim for an extension of the Contract Time, for an Excusable Delay or a Compensable Delay, subject to the following:

   a. If an Excusable Delay and a Compensable Delay occur concurrently, the maximum extension of the Contract Time shall be the number of days from the commencement of the first delay to the cessation of the delay which ends last. Any adjustment of the Contract Sum shall be in accordance with Article 15 and shall be based only on the non-concurrent portion of any Compensable Delay.

   b. If an Inexcusable Delay occurs concurrently with either an Excusable Delay and/or a Compensable Delay, the maximum extension of the Contract Time shall be the number of days, if any, by which the duration of the Excusable Delay and/or the Compensable Delay calculated in accordance with subparagraph B1, if applicable, exceeds the Inexcusable Delay. The duration of the concurrence is non-compensable.

Delays in the prosecution of parts or classes of the Work which do not prevent or delay the completion of the whole Work within the Contract Time are not to be considered Excusable or Compensable.

**Section 14.02. Notice of Delays; Requests for Time Extensions.**  
Whenever the Contractor foresees any delay in the prosecution of the Work, and in any event immediately upon the occurrence of any delay which the Contractor regards as good cause for an extension, the Contractor shall notify the District Representative in writing of the delay. The notice shall specify with detail the cause asserted by the Contractor to constitute good cause for an extension together with a detailed

**FAIR OAKS RECREATION AND PARK DISTRICT**

![General Conditions Section 00 72 13 - Page 51](https://example.com/image-url)

schedule analysis showing the effect of the delay on the critical path of the Contract Schedule and a quantification of the length of the requested extension of time. Failure of the Contractor to submit such a notice within ten (10) days after the initial occurrence of the event giving rise to the delay shall constitute a waiver by the Contractor of any entitlement to a time extension, as well as to any associated additional compensation, and no extension shall be granted as a consequence of such delay. The District shall have no obligation to consider any time extension request unless the requirements of the Contract Documents are complied with. The District shall not be responsible or liable to the Contractor for any constructive acceleration due to failure of the District to grant time extensions under the Contract Documents, should the Contractor fail to comply with the submission and justification requirements of the Contract Documents for time extension requests. The Contractor’s failure to perform in accordance with the Contract Schedule shall not be excused because the Contractor has submitted time extension requests, unless and until such requests are approved by the District.

**Section 14.03. Investigation; Procedure.**  
Upon receipt of a request for extension, the District Representative shall conduct an investigation of the facts asserted by the Contractor to constitute good cause for an extension. The District Representative shall report the results of this investigation, as well as the propriety of the time extension requested, to the Contractor in writing within ten (10) days of receipt of the request and shall indicate whether it will recommend for or against the extension.

Upon receiving the District Representative’s recommendation, the Contractor may either concur in the recommendation, or reject the recommendation and proceed with a claim as provided for in Articles 21 and 23.

**Section 14.04. Discretionary Time Extensions for Best Efforts.**  
The District reserves the right to extend the time for completion if the District determines that such an extension is in the best interest of the District. In the event a discretionary extension is granted on the request of the Contractor, the District shall have the right to charge to the Contractor all or any part, as the District may deem proper, of the actual cost of construction management, engineering, inspection, supervision, incidental and other overhead expenses that accrue during the period of the extension, and to deduct all or any portion of that amount from the final payment for the Work.

In the event a discretionary time extension is ordered over the objection of the Contractor, and the decision rests solely with the District and is not legally compelled for any cause, the Contractor shall be entitled to a contract change pursuant to Article 15 adjusting the time paid to reflect the actual costs incurred by the Contractor as a direct result of the delay, upon its written application therefore, accompanied with such verification of costs as the District Representative requires. The decision of the District on any discretionary time extension and the costs thereof shall be final and binding on the District and the Contractor.

**Section 14.05. Liquidated Damages.**  
If the Work is not completed by the Contractor in the time specified in Section 00 73 00, Special Provisions, or within any period of extension authorized pursuant to this Article, the Contractor acknowledges and admits that the District will suffer damage, and that it is impracticable and infeasible to fix the amount of actual damages. Therefore, it is agreed by and between the Contractor and the District that the Contractor shall pay to the District as fixed and liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, the sum specified in the Agreement for Construction for each calendar day of delay until the Date of Completion, and that both the Contractor and the Contractor's surety shall be liable for the total amount thereof, and that District may deduct Liquidated Damages from any monies due or that may become due to the Contractor. If it appears during the course of construction that the Contractor is behind schedule and the imposition of liquidated damages is likely, or if liquidated damages begin to accrue prior to the time for final payment, the amount accrued shall be withheld from any progress payment that would otherwise be due. This right to withhold funds is intended to complement the District’s rights under Section 12.06.

![General Conditions Section 00 72 13 - Page 52](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=General+Conditions+Section+00+72+13+-+Page+52)

This liquidated damage provision shall apply to all delays of any nature whatsoever, save and except only delays found to be excusable or compensable pursuant to Section 14.01, or time extensions granted by the District pursuant to Section 14.04.

Pursuant to Government Code Section 4215, the Contractor shall not pay fixed and liquidated damages for delay in completing the project caused by the failure of the District or the owner of utility facilities located on the Project Site to provide for removal or relocation of such facilities.

Payment by the District of any progress payments after expiration of the Contract Time shall not constitute a waiver by the District of its right to claim liquidated damages in accordance with this Section.

If the Contract is terminated before or after the Contract Time, as adjusted by any extensions of time that the District may have granted, pursuant to Section 18.07, the Contractor shall remain liable to the District for liquidated damages for all periods of time from such termination date until the Date of Completion.

**Section 14.06. Extension of Time Not a Waiver.**  
Any extension of time granted the Contractor pursuant to this Article shall not constitute a waiver by the District of, nor a release of the Contractor from the Contractor's obligation to perform this Contract in the time specified by the agreement, as modified by the particular extension in question.

The District’s decision to grant a time extension due to one circumstance set forth in one request, shall not be construed as a grant of an extension for any other circumstance or the same circumstance occurring at some other time, and shall not be viewed by the Contractor as a precedent for any other request for extension.

**Section 14.07. Suspensions Exceeding One Year.**  
Should the work be suspended for a period exceeding one calendar year due to war conditions, labor conditions, legal actions, or for other conditions constituting the legal defense of impossibility of performance, the Contractor and District agree to enter into an agreement terminating the agreement upon the following terms and conditions.

District shall be responsible only to pay the Contractor the actual value of the work performed from the Date of Commencement or from the date of the last progress payment, whichever is later, plus the five percent (5%) retention from prior progress payments, less any deductions authorized by the Contract Documents.

As between the Contractor and District, it shall be conclusively presumed that the actual value for the Contractor’s work to the date of the last progress payment is no more than the actual amount of prior progress payment plus the five percent (5%) retention from those progress payments; provided, however, that this Section shall not preclude District from deducting charges for work or materials which do not meet the requirements of the Contract Documents.

**Section 14.08. Effect of Stop Work Notice.**  
If the District orders a stop work notice pursuant to Article 9, the days on which the suspension is in effect shall be included in determining the required completion date and shall not otherwise modify or extend the time within which the Contractor is to perform. In such event, the Contractor shall not be entitled to any damages or compensation on account of such suspension or delay, unless the Contractor can establish that stop work notice was not warranted.

# ARTICLE 15. CHANGES TO THE WORK

## Section 15.01. No Changes Without Consent.
No extra work shall be performed, and no change shall be made, except pursuant to a written Change Order or Proposed Change Order signed by the District, or by a Directive signed by either the District or the District Representative, stating that the extra work or change is authorized, and no claim for any addition to the Contract Sum or Contract Time shall be valid unless so authorized; provided, however, that nothing in this Article shall excuse the Contractor from proceeding with the prosecution of the work so changed. The Contractor shall, when required by the District Representative, furnish an itemized breakdown of the quantities and prices used in computing the value of any change requested by the Contractor, or that may have been ordered by the District, including all items listed in Sections 15.07 and 15.08, below.

Change Orders shall specify the cost adjustments associated therewith, and in no case shall the District pay or become liable to pay any sums different than those specified or those established under Section 15.06 and 15.07.

## Section 15.02. Change Orders.
Subject to legal requirements relating to competitive bidding, the District may require changes in, additions to, or deductions from the work to be performed or the materials to be furnished pursuant to the Contract Documents. Changes may be made pursuant to a written Change Order signed by the District, which state the agreement of the District, the Contractor, and the Architect upon all of the following:

1. The scope of the change in the Work;
2. The amount of the adjustment in the Contract Sum, if any; and
3. The extent of the adjustment in the Contract Time, if any.

The District may also issue unilateral change orders based upon previously issued Directives. Unilateral change orders shall be approved by the District, the Architect, and the District Representative, but need not be signed by the Contractor.

If the Contractor believes that conditions have changed, or that it has been directed to do additional work requiring a change in time or cost, the Contractor may submit to the District Representative a Proposed Change Order (PCO).

Except for Minor Change Orders described below, all adjustments to the Contract Sum or the Contract Time must be approved by the District.

Signature by the Contractor on the Change Order constitutes its agreement with and acceptance of the adjustments in the Contract Sum and Contract Time, if any, set forth in the Change Order as full and complete satisfaction of any direct or indirect additional cost and/or time incurred by the Contractor in connection with performance of the change work.

## Section 15.03. Minor Change Orders by District Administration.
The Board of the District has authorized the District Administrator or his/her designated representative the ability to approve minor changes or additions in the Work. This authorization allows any change or addition in the Work to be approved in writing by the District Administrator or designated representative when the extra cost to the District for any such change or addition does not exceed the amount specifically authorized by the Board.

## Section 15.04. Change Orders Regarding Time for Completion.
Any time extension authorized by the District pursuant to Article 14 hereof shall be set forth in a Change Order signed by the District.

<!-- Page 187 -->
![Section 15.05. Construction Change Directive/Directive. Changes also may be made pursuant to a Directive, which shall direct a change in the Work and state a proposed basis for adjustment, if any, in the Contract Sum or Contract Time, or both. A Directive shall be used in the absence of total agreement on the terms of a Change Order, or when time does not permit processing of a Change Order prior to implementation of the change. Directives shall be approved by the District, and the Architect, but need not be signed by the Contractor. Upon receipt of a Directive, the Contractor shall promptly proceed with the change in the work involved. It is the intent of the District that all Directives will be converted to a Change Order. When a Directive is used because time does not permit processing of a Change Order prior to implementation of the change, signature by the Contractor on the Directive constitutes its agreement with and acceptance of the adjustments in the Contract Sum and Contract Time, if any, set forth in the Directive as full and complete satisfaction of any direct or indirect additional cost and/or time incurred by the Contractor in connection with performance of the change work. If the Contractor disagrees with the method for adjustment in the Contract Sum, the adjustment shall be determined by the District Representative on the basis of any of the methods described in Section 15.06. Section 15.06. Pricing of Changes. If a Change Order or Directive provides for an adjustment to the Contract Sum, the adjustment shall be based on one of the following methods: 1. Mutual acceptance of a lump sum properly itemized and supported by sufficient substantiating data to permit evaluation; 2. Unit prices established in the Contract Documents or subsequently agreed upon; 3. The District Representative’s estimate of the value of the change; or 4. Time and materials, as set forth in Section 15.07 and 15.08. Section 15.07. Allowable Costs. Allowable costs for any Change Order shall be limited to the following: 1. Costs of labor, including social security, medical and unemployment insurance, fringe benefits required pursuant to Article 7, and workers’ compensation insurance; 2. Costs of first line supervision labor, including labor burden as described in Paragraph 1. “First Line Supervision” shall mean a working foreman or lead craft worker other than the project superintendent; 3. Actual cost of the project superintendent associated with any period of compensable delay caused by issuance of the change order. In the absence of a compensable delay, all of the project superintendent’s time is considered to have been paid for as part of the Overhead; 4. Actual costs of materials, including sales tax and delivery; 5. Rental costs of machinery and equipment, exclusive of small tools, whether rented from the Contractor or others; FAIR OAKS RECREATION AND PARK DISTRICT January 2021](https://example.com)
<!-- Page 188 -->
6. Overhead and Profit as specified below. “Overhead” shall include the following:

   a. Preparation of all paperwork related to changes in the Work, including field review, estimating and cost breakdown; coordination and supervision, both office and field, including the project superintendent; vehicles including gas and maintenance; small tools, incidentals and consumables; engineering, detailing, and revisions to shop drawings and as-built drawings; general office and administrative expense; extended and unabsorbed home office overhead; warranty; costs of bonds, liability insurance, and all taxes; and all other expenses not specifically included in Paragraph A above.

   b. The Contractor’s combined overhead and profit for work performed by its own forces shall be fifteen percent (15%) of the costs specified in Section 15.07, paragraphs 1-5. If the changed work is performed by a Subcontractor, the Subcontractor shall be entitled to an allowance of fifteen percent (15%) of its actual labor, material and rental costs for overhead and profit. The Contractor shall be allowed to mark-up the Subcontractor's price five percent (5%) for its overhead and profit. Cumulative total markup for all tiers of contractors and subcontractors shall not exceed twenty percent (20%).

   c. If the net value of a change results in a credit from the Contractor or Subcontractor, the credit shall be the actual net cost, plus five percent (5%) for overhead and profit. When both additions and credits covering related work or substitutions are involved in any one change, the allowance for Overhead and Profit shall be figured on the basis of the net increase or decrease, if any, with respect to the change.

**Section 15.08. Time and Materials Adjustment.**

1. **Pricing and Record Keeping.** In the event that the pricing method is used, the time and materials method shall be based on Section 15.06, paragraph 3. The pricing shall be established as the time and materials costs set forth in Section 15.07 except that time and material (T & M) labor rates shall be pre-approved by the District Representative for T & M work. The Contractor shall keep and present daily, in such form as the District Representative may prescribe, an itemized accounting together with appropriate invoices and other supporting data of the labor, materials, and equipment used during that day. All labor shall be recorded on separate time sheets clearly identified with the Directive number and scope of extra work involved. These time sheets shall be signed daily by the Project Inspector or the District Representative. No costs will be allowed for time not recorded and signed the same day the work takes place. The Contractor and the District Representative shall discuss and attempt to resolve any disputes concerning the Contractor’s daily records at the time the report is submitted.

2. **Reconciliation.** The Contractor shall, on a monthly basis accompanying the progress payment request, submit a reconciliation for all work performed under a time and materials Directive during the period of the progress payment. A final reconciliation shall be submitted within 30 days after the work of the Directive is completed. The reconciliation shall recap all costs and appropriate markups for the period. No costs will be allowed for work not included in a reconciliation within the time periods specified.

**Section 15.09. Effect on Sureties.** All changes authorized by the Contract Documents may be made without notice to or consent of the sureties on the contract bonds, and shall not reduce the sureties’ liability on the bonds.

The District reserves the right to require additional payment or performance bonds to secure a change order.

**Section 15.10. Unforeseen Site Conditions.** If this Contract requires the digging of trenches or other excavations that extend deeper than four feet below the existing surface, the following provision shall apply to those trenches or excavations:

1. In the event that any of the following described conditions is suspected to exist in the trench or excavation, the Contractor shall promptly, and before the condition is disturbed, notify the District Representative, in writing within 5 working days of discovery, of any:

   a. Material that the Contractor believes may be material that is hazardous waste, as defined in Section 25117 of the Health and Safety Code, that is required to be removed to a Class I, Class II, or Class III disposal site in accordance with provisions of existing law.

   b. Subsurface or latent physical conditions at the Site differing materially from those indicated in the Contract Documents.

   c. Unknown physical conditions at the Site of any unusual nature, differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in work of the character provided for in the Contract Documents.

2. Upon receipt of notice from the Contractor, the District Representative, the District and the Architect shall promptly investigate the conditions, and if it is determined that the conditions do materially so differ or do involve hazardous waste, and cause a decrease or increase in the Contractor’s cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work shall issue a Change Order or Directive under the procedures described in the Contract Documents.

3. In the event that a dispute arises between the District and the Contractor as to whether the conditions materially differ, or involve hazardous waste, or cause a decrease or increase in the Contractor’s cost of, or time required for, performance of any part of the work, the Contractor shall not be excused from any scheduled completion date provided for by the Contract Documents, but shall proceed with all work to be performed under the Contract Documents. The Contractor shall retain any and all rights provided either by the Contract Documents or by law which pertain to the resolution of disputes and protests between the contracting parties.

4. No contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed unless the Contractor has provided the required written notice under paragraph 1. of this Section 15.10.

5. No contract adjustment will be allowed under the provisions specified in this section for any effects caused on unchanged work.

**Section 15.11. Notice of Dispute**  
If the Contractor intends to make a claim for a change in the Contract Sum or Contract Time, the Contractor must give the District Representative written notice within ten (10) days of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim. Thereafter, the Contractor may proceed with a claim as provided for in Articles 21 and 23. Failure to provide the written notice within ten (10) days of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim shall constitute a waiver by the Contractor of any claim for a change in the Contract Sum or Contract time.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** May 15, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Approval of an Amphitheatre Seating Renovation Plan  

I. **Recommendation**  
Authorize the District Administrator to sign documents to start the renovation project for the seating area in the Veteran's Memorial Amphitheatre, which is part of the Village Park Renovation Project. The project is estimated to cost $904,935. Instruct staff to seek a preferred funding option and to present an official request for Board action at a future meeting.

II. **Background**  
The Veteran's Memorial Amphitheatre is a historic and popular venue for outdoor events and performances in Plaza Park. As part of the Park Renovation Project, which aims to revitalize and improve the park facilities and amenities, the Amphitheatre was scheduled for a major upgrade. The original design of the renovation included new landscaping, lighting, sound system, stage, restrooms, and dressing rooms for the Amphitheatre, but did not include the replacement of the existing wooden bench seating. This was a financial decision to save some money and to revisit the seating issue at a later time.

The original design only planned to add two sections of ADA-compliant seating to meet the accessibility requirements. However, during the construction process, it became evident that the old seating would not match the new style and quality of the renovated Amphitheatre, and that replacing the seating later would be more difficult and costly, due to the expected increase in material and labor costs and the disruption to the
<!-- Page 191 -->
### III. Problem / Situation / Request

The problem that the Board needs to address is how to fund the replacement of the bench seating at the Amphitheatre, which was not included in the original budget of the Park Renovation Project. The cost of replacing the seating is estimated at $904,935, which includes construction, demolition, regrading, paving, seating, aisle lighting, installation, and architectural services (Attachment D).

The overall Measure J work, which covers the Park Renovation Project and other improvements in the District, has experienced a budget increase due to unforeseen site conditions, material changes, and higher construction costs. Some of the factors that contributed to the increased costs were utility work, road improvements, the Clubhouse Foundation, and site restrictions due to slope and elevation. The staff has been able to identify sources of funds to cover the increased costs, such as grants, Impact Fees, In-Lieu Fees, and others. However, the renovation of the Amphitheatre seating was not part of this budget increase, so additional sources of funds are needed for this project.

The staff has investigated different choices of financing this project and is offering a preliminary overview for this written report. Staff will give a more comprehensive overview of the financing options at your Board Meeting on May 15, 2024. The Board will need to approve any option that is chosen at a later meeting. The Board's actions at this meeting are to authorize the start of the work on the Amphitheatre seating renovation and to direct staff to pursue the preferred financing option.

The staff has asked Senator Padilla and Congressman Bera for $2.4 million from the US Senate and House Appropriations Funds for ADA upgrades in the Park and the Village. These requests could free up some of the Measure J funds for the Amphitheatre seating, but we don't know if or when the funding requests will be approved, since the funds are competitive and uncertain. So, the staff has found two more funding options that can cover this project.

The first option is a Real Property Direct Placement Lease that is secured with the District's Administration Office. This option would be a loan for $1,275,000 for 20 years at 5% interest rate, with no early payoff penalty. The second option is to sell the District's Cell Tower Lease, which has an estimated value of $1,500,000 to $2,100,000. Either option could raise the funds needed to cover the renovation costs, but they also have some disadvantages, such as giving up future income sources or requiring the District to take out a loan and repay it over 20 years at a 5% interest rate. The staff is working on a comprehensive analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of each option, which will be presented at your meeting.

We are pleased to offer the following specifications and pricing to perform the following changes:  
Per V2-ASI 23, Mark 3 is to provide a discontinuous curb at the trench drain to accommodate slopes at accessible walkways.

**THE TOTAL AMOUNT TO PROVIDE THIS WORK IS:** $ 12,011

**Notes:**
Insert Contractor's basic hourly rate, health & welfare, pension, vacation/holiday and other payments in columns "D to H", then add training to column "J". Subtotal straight and over time hourly rates will be calculated at column "K" which includes "Fringes Benefits". Please note that only "basic hourly rates" will change for over time and all other "Fringe Benefits" remain the same as straight hourly rates. 

Insert Contractor's workman compensation rate at lower section of columns "N" where shows "0.00%" for each contractor/trade. Total hourly rate including "Fringes Benefits" in all "Burden" will be calculated at column "R". Since "Burden" are percentages of the "subtotal straight/OT hourly rates" they will increase for over time rates and will be calculated automatically by the spreadsheet.

**PRODUCTION SYSTEM ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION**

A. AV Systems: Wet Location Cable  
1. Contractor must use the “wet location” cable as identified in the Production Lighting wiring key.  
2. “Wet Location” cable is larger in diameter, so the contractor must calculate the conduit sizes to maintain compliance with NEC fill ratios. Submit calculations for review.  
3. “Wet Location” cable is more expensive. The project will not accept a cost increase due to lack of communication between electrical contractor and Production Lighting contractor.  

B. AV Systems: Isolated Ground and Isolation Transformer  
1. All power to AV systems must be on a dedicated K-13 rated transformer, combined with an isolated ground system. AV power will be identified with orange outlets throughout the facility.  
2. All orange IG outlets shall be identified with a label indicating load center and circuit. “P-Touch” style labels are acceptable.  
3. The isolated ground system shall be a “star” configuration, meaning that all AV power system grounds ultimately reference the building ground at only one point, typically located in the main electrical service room. This location shall be in a separate junction box and shall be clearly labeled as to its function with a screw-on lamicoid label.  
4. The main branches for the IG system (from main electrical room to branch AV power panels) will be fed with #3/0 AWG insulated ground cable. From these main points, branch load circuits connect to an IG busbar using standard-size (12 or 14 AWG) conductors. In addition, a #3/0 AWG IG conductor must be brought to the AV equipment racks, for termination to an equipment rack busbar, provided by the AV contractor.  

C. AV Systems: Low-voltage conduit system  
1. All low-voltage AV conduit shall be as indicated in the AV drawings, using a 100% EMT conduit pathway.  
2. In-slab/on-grade and under-slab/in-grade conditions: At the contractor’s option, Non-Metallic Conduit (ENT) and/or Rigid Metal Conduit (RMC) may be used, so long as the following conditions are met:  
   a. Contractor must use the “wet location” cable as identified in the AV cable schedule.  
   b. “Wet Location” cable is larger in diameter, so the contractor must re-calculate the conduit sizes to maintain compliance with NEC fill ratios. Submit calculations for review.  
   c. “Wet Location” cable is more expensive. The project will not accept a cost increase due to lack of communication between electrical contractor and AV contractor.  
   d. Contractor must maintain stated separation and grouping requirements.  
3. In-slab/not on-grade conditions, such as metal deck or floors not on grade: Non-Metallic Conduit (ENT) and/or Rigid Metal Conduit (RMC) may be used, so long as the following conditions are met:

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** June 19, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Approval of Fiscal Year 24/25 Preliminary Budget  
**Prepared By:** Jennifer Larkin, Administrative Services Manager  

I. **Recommendation**  
- Approve the District's FY 24/25 Preliminary Budget as outlined in the Overall Budget Summary (Attachment A) and adopt Resolution No. 061924-01 Adopting the FY 2024-2025 Preliminary Budget for the General Fund (Attachment C).  
- Approve the District's FY24/25 Preliminary Budgets for the Assessment Districts as follows:  
  - Adopt Resolution No. 061924-02 Adopting 2024-2025 Preliminary Budget for the Parks Maintenance and Recreation Improvement District with expenditures and revenues totaling $753,386 (Attachment D).  
  - Adopt Resolution No. 061924-03 Adopting 2024-2025 Preliminary Budget for the Phoenix Landscape and Lighting Assessment District with expenditures and revenues totaling $56,614 (Attachment E).

- Adopt the FY 2024-2025 Salary Schedule (Attachment G).  

II. **Background**  
Each year the Board of Directors must adopt the District's Preliminary Budget prior to July 1 to provide funding for District operations for the coming fiscal year (beginning July 1 and ending June 30). When the Preliminary Budget is adopted in June, the final year-end financial data is not yet available as the current fiscal.
<!-- Page 250 -->

**year does not end until June 30. Final budgets are adopted in August which include the best available data from the prior fiscal year (final fund balance, actual revenue collections, and actual expenditures) and serve as the District's expenditure plan for the fiscal year. The Preliminary Budget was discussed and reviewed by the Finance and Budget Committee on June 4, 2024, and reflects their recommendations.**

---

**III. Problem /Situation / Request**

**FY 24/25 Recommended Preliminary Budget**

The FY 24/25 recommended Preliminary Operating Budget totals $3,638,985 and contains full-year funding for authorized permanent positions, including an additional FT Parks and Maintenance Worker to begin at mid-year and a Theater Tech position to start at mid-year. The final budget will be prepared with the year-end actual expenditure/revenue data and will contain recommendations for any operations and capital projects and additional program activities. The following highlights provide information on changes from the FY 23/24 final operating budget to the recommended FY 24/25 Preliminary Operating Budget.

**SALARIES AND BENEFITS**

The Preliminary Operating Budget contains funding for authorized permanent positions, including the additions of a FT Parks and Maintenance Worker and a Theater Tech. The Board approved the addition of the FT Park Worker last fiscal year in anticipation of the re-opening of the Village facilities which did not occur; staff is requesting to again add it into this year’s budget. The cost of this position will be about $33,175 for the period of January-June, including salary and benefits. Funding for the position will be a combination of additional tax revenues, assessment district revenues, and program/rental revenues.

The Board also approved in concept the addition of a Theater Tech position to be funded from American Rescue Plan (ARPA) funding awarded to the District in FY23-24. Full details of the position and addition to the salary schedule will happen by the August meeting for final budget, but the preliminary budget contains $44K in anticipation of that position being approved and filled at mid-year.

Staff is recommending filling the vacant Administrative Assistant I position (a Regular PT 1500-hour position) for FY 24-25 due to the increased workload in the accounting department over the last 5 years. The request includes increasing the starting hourly wage from $16 per hour to $18.02 to be commensurate with the Regular PT Senior Recreation Leader on the salary schedule. The cost for this position being added is $25K including hourly wages and associated costs. This position does not receive group insurance benefits.

Overall, salaries and benefits costs have increased from $2,273,871 last fiscal year to $2,617,978. This is a total increase of $344,107 and is based on the following:
1. Addition of 2 FT positions in Parks and Arts and Entertainment (77K).
2. Reinstatement of 1 Reg PT position in Admin (25K).
3. Increased PT staff for Recreation in anticipation of new programming (11K).
4. Increased PT hours for Parks for the re-opened facilities (8.8K).
<!-- Page 251 -->
5. Regular step and longevity increases for full-time staff who are eligible as well as an increase to the Accountant position to come into alignment with the current exempt salary requirements as was done last year for the Recreation Supervisor positions (78K).  
6. Increase of CalPERS retirement costs, including rate increases and increased unfunded liability payment (54K).  
7. Anticipated 5% increase in health insurance premiums (61K for active and $7.5K for retirees).  
8. Anticipated increase in Worker’s Compensation Insurance (17K).  
9. Increases in social security, unemployment and disability insurance associated with increases in staff and salaries (9K).  

**COLA and Salary Study**  
The Employees’ Association is requesting a COLA of 3.9% which is approximately $55K. Staff will meet again with the Personnel and Management Committee prior to the final budget in August. Additionally, there was a salary study performed by the Employees’ Association; this will have some further analysis done and will be brought back to the committee as well.  

**Employee/ Employer Retirement Contributions**  
Rates for FY 24-25 are as follows:  

Classic Employee Rate: 7% (paid by Employee)  
PEPRA Employee Rate: 7.75% (paid by Employee)  
Classic Employer Rate: 12.52% (paid by District)  
PEPRA Employer Rate: 7.87% (paid by District)  

The amount of the employer Amortization of Unfunded Accrued Liability $109,975 for Classic Employees, and $4,305 for PEPRA Employees.  

**Employee Health Care**  
The Memorandum of Understanding with the Employees Association obligates the District to pay up to 5% of any increase over the previous year; the formula used to reach the dollar amount is the average of the cost of all plans offered in the region by CalPERS minus the highest and lowest plans. That figure is compared to the previous year, and the District’s maximum amount is 5% above that figure.  

As this budget was prepared, final health care premiums for calendar year 2025 were not yet available from CalPERS but there is an assumed overall increase of 5% for the last six months of the fiscal year.  

**SERVICES AND SUPPLIES**  
The budget also contains funding for goods and services necessary for operating the District. There is an overall increase of 4.6% or $73.4K requested this year. The additional expenditures can be summarized by the following:  

1. One additional activity guide printing and mailing (10K)  
2. Re-opening of Village Park and facilities (30-35K)  
<!-- Page 252 -->
3. Potential election costs (55K)  
4. Increase to the cost incurred by the District for Sacramento County to collect tax revenues (6-8K). This is a temporary increase while the County collects additional funds from special districts and other agencies for which it performs tax collection services to offset the costs of implementing a new computer system.  

Some of the increases are offset by savings in other areas, mostly one-time expenditures from FY 23-24 that are not being re-budgeted.  

**FY 24/25 Intrafund Reimbursements**  
The Preliminary Budget reflects an assessment revenue increase of 3% in the Parks Maintenance and Improvement District (FOLL) making the reimbursement $627,886. The reimbursement from the Phoenix Field Landscape and Lighting District (PFLL) is a base budget for services provided without any escalation factor, $56,614. The reimbursement for Gum Ranch Landscape and Lighting District will be approximately $103,830.  

There is a surplus of $280K in the FOLL fund balance currently that occurred because of a clerical error in FY22-23 and funds not being moved into the general fund. Staff is recommending moving $125,500 of those funds into the FY24-25 budget to offset the increases in the Parks budget this year, bringing the total assessment district reimbursement to $913,830.  

**FY 24/25 Property Tax Revenues**  
The most recent information from the County Assessor shows the FORPD assessed valuation has increased 5% for FY 2024-25. That number is reflected in the budget and may be adjusted based on final budget information for FY 23/24 as well as more up to date information from the County Assessor’s office. The District continues to see increasing values overall, as well as the additional of new homes to the tax rolls with continuing building at Heritage Oaks at Gum Ranch as well as smaller infill projects.  

**Use of Contingency**  
The Preliminary Budget contains contingency funding of $50,000 for FY 24/25 which is anticipated to be funded from roll-over savings from the prior fiscal year as the Contingency was not spent in FY 24/25.  

**Use of Other Funds**  
Staff is recommending funding the election expenses, should they be necessary, from the District’s fund balance. This is a required expense if there is a contested election in November.  

Staff is recommending, and the Board has agreed, to fund the Theater Tech position from ARPA funds for 6 months.  

**FY 24/25 Capital Projects Funding Development Plan**  
The Board reviewed and approved the Capital Projects Plan at the regular April 4.
<!-- Page 253 -->
![Meeting Notes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Meeting+Notes)

meeting. $70,000 has been earmarked from In-Lieu fees for a new roof and some minor renovations to the Old Library so that it can be used for staff office space in addition to programming and meeting space. The Capitol Plan also contains funding for a District-wide Master Plan ($150,000) to be paid from Park Impact Fees as well as some needed equipment:
- 50K for a new parks vehicle
- 10K for replacement tables for the Village facilities
- 30K for a new barrier fencing and a trailer to contain it.

Funds for the above items has not been specified but will come from the general fund’s fund balance and/or In-Lieu fees.

**FINANCE AND BUDGET COMMITTEE**  
Staff met with the Finance and Budget Committee on June 4 to review the proposed budget. They requested some additional information on the success rates for Recreation and A&E classes which is included as Attachment H.

**IV. Financial Analysis**  
The Preliminary Budget is balanced, contains full-year funding for authorized permanent positions, and provides an expenditure plan for base level operations and approved capital projects. In the period between preliminary and final budget adoption, any unexpended funds or excess revenues will remain in the District General Fund’s Carry Forward Fund.

### Notes
- Does not include:
  - Community & Special Events
  - Rentals
  - Comedy Show
  - Concerts in the Park
  - Garden Gala
  - FOYAB
  - etc.

### Reasons that skew success rates:
1. Lack of facility space that best suits classes. McMillan & Old Library are the only 2 available facilities.
2. Fall/winter minimal indoor space for programming. Typically our slower months for recreational class offerings.
3. Some classes offered offsite with outside organizations such as Kayaking, Rollingwood YMCA, and MuVment Dance Studio have large portfolios of offerings. If these classes were removed percentages would be substantially better.
4. A&E is working on building their department and trying out different classes to see what the community takes to.
5. Recreation also tries new classes periodically and some do well and some don't. We move on from the ones that do not after 2 tries in the activity guide (seasons).

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** June 19, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Adoption of FY 2024-2025 Preliminary Budget for the Bond Fund 341C  
**Prepared By:** Jennifer Larkin, Administrative Services Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Accept the recommendation of the Finance and Budget committee and adopt Resolution No. 061924-05: A Resolution of the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Adopting FY 2024-2025 Preliminary Budget for the Bond Fund 341C.

**II. Background**  
In November of 2018, the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District community passed Measure J, a general obligation bond, to fund capital projects in the District. The first series of bonds was issued in April of 2019, with the Director of Finance of Sacramento County acting as the District’s paying agent. The second series was issued in April of 2020, and a third issuance was issued in November of 2022.

Proceeds from all bond sales are held in a County fund, the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Building Fund, Election of 2018, Series 2019, Series 2020, and Series 2022 which is an investment fund that is not co-mingled with any other County funds but upon which the District may draw against for Bond projects.

This is the preliminary budget put into place to allow the District to legally expend funds between July 1 and the final budget in late August.

**III. Financial Analysis**  
This budget includes the full funding for the remainder of Board-approved Village Renovation Project. This budget also includes funding for bond-related legal services and audit services. Funding cannot exceed approved amounts without further action from the Board.
<!-- Page 272 -->
The bond funds remaining in the County total $7,7029,229. The outstanding amount for the Village Park project is $7,404,778 million, including the change order from Bobo.

Included in the budget are anticipated reimbursements and/or grant monies for the following:

- Reimbursement from General Fund for Streng Park: $517,914
- Prop 68 Urban Per Capita Grant for Streng Park: $177,952
- Prop 68 RIRE Grant for the Village Park Playground: $250,000
- CaleVIP Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Grant: $50,000
- Ami Bera Grant: $560,929

**TOTAL: $1,556,795**

Also included in the preliminary budget is anticipated revenue to fund the Amphitheatre seating renovation should the Board approve the project. The exact expenditure amount and revenue funds will be clarified for the final budget in August.

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

**FAIR OAKS RECREATION & PARK DISTRICT**

**Meeting Date:** June 19, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Approval of Sale of Miller Park Cell Tower Leases  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Authorize the District Administrator to proceed with the sale of the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District's (FORPD) Cell Tower Lease to Towerpoint Capital for $2,055,000.00. The terms include a 99-year lease, an option to expand the lease area by up to 1000 square feet, and a 50% revenue share from additional tenants located in the expanded tower area.

**II. Background**  
The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District has been exploring options to maximize revenue from its assets. One such asset is the cell tower lease. At the Board meeting on May 15, 2024, the Board authorized the District Administrator to proceed with allowing NAI to solicit bids for the potential sale of the cell tower lease. The solicitation for bids attracted multiple offers from interested parties.

Following is a Summary of the Bids received:  
- **Towerpoint Capital:** $2,055,000.00, 99 years, 1000 SF expansion, 50% revenue share  
- **Symphony:** $2,050,000.00, perpetual, 500 SF expansion, revenue share not disclosed  
- **Everest:** $1,970,000.00, perpetual  
- **BlueSky:** $1,850,000.00, perpetual  
<!-- Page 284 -->
- **SBA:** $1,850,000.00, 50 years  
- **WRA:** $1,850,000.00, 99 years  
- **AP Wireless:** $1,820,000.00, 99 years  
- **Accelerate:** $1,737,000.00, 40 years  
- **Vertical Bridge:** $1,570,057.00, perpetual  

The bid evaluation process considered several factors, including the purchase price, lease term, expansion potential, and revenue-sharing arrangements. Towerpoint Capital's offer of $2,055,000.00 for a 99-year term with a 1000 square foot expansion and a 50% revenue share is the highest and most beneficial bid received.

### III. Problem /Situation / Request
Approving the sale of the cell tower lease to Towerpoint Capital represents a strategic decision to maximize the financial benefits for the District. The proposed terms are favorable and align with the District's long-term goals of financial stability and community service enhancement.

If Towerpoint can obtain additional customers, they would exercise their option to expand with the additional 1000 square feet. Those additional customers would then be part of the 50% revenue share, which is currently estimated to be about $1,000-$1,500 per tenant per month. The expansion details would need to be drafted by the District's Attorney to protect our park amenities and allow for District's input. Staff believe that a 1000 square foot expansion would not affect any current park amenities or use.

It is important to note that this sale is for the lease that FORPD holds for the cell towers to be located on District property. It is not a sale of the land itself. FORPD will retain ownership of the land.

The net proceeds from the sale can be allocated to various ongoing and future projects, including:  
- The seating replacement and renovation of the seating area in the Veteran's Memorial Amphitheater  
- Additional non-Bond funding expenses for Measure J funded renovations in the park and facilities  
<!-- Page 285 -->
- Investment in an interest-bearing account to ensure financial stability and growth for the District

The Board may choose to allocate the funds to a combination of these options or select other options as deemed appropriate. Any expenditure of these funds will require Board approval.

IV. Financial Analysis  
Selling the cell tower lease to Towerpoint Capital will provide FORPD with an immediate infusion of $2,055,000.00. The District will incur closing costs of $4,000 for the sale and will pay 5% of the purchase price, amounting to $102,750, to NAI for their services. For an estimated financial gain to the District of $1,948,250.

Respectfully Submitted,  

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

| Senior Rec Leader- Sports           | $18.02      | $108.12   |
| **TOTAL**                           |             | **$5468.94** |

This cost does not represent the budgetary impact, as the District would pay the cost of staff with or without the holiday.

The District would still have parks open, as it does for all holidays, and would therefore have to pay for Park Aides to open and close parks. The average cost per day for part-time park staff is $298.

| PT Park Staff | Mon | Tues | Wed | Thurs | Fri | Sat | Sun | AVERAGE |
|---------------|-----|------|-----|-------|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| Park Aide     | $88 | $88  | $88 | $88   | $88 | $64 |     |         |
| Park Aide     | $96 | $96  | $96 | $96   | $96 |     |     |         |
| Park Aide     |     |      |     |       |     | $128|     |         |
| Park Aide     |     |      |     |       |     | $96 | $96 |         |
| Park Aide     |     |      |     |       |     | $120|     |         |
| Reg PT Park Aide | $100 | $100 | $100 | $100 | $100 | $100 | $100 |         |
| **TOTAL**     | $196 | $284 | $284 | $284 | $284 | $344 | $408 | **$298** |

On holidays, the park staffing consists of three park aides to open, close and provide limited maintenance to the parks, totaling 23 hours at a rate of $16 per hour, or $316. The difference between the average daily cost and the holiday daily cost is approximately $18, so for Parks the budgetary impact is $18.
<!-- Page 290 -->
For Recreation, the District would need to have staffing at summer camp if the camp were running the full week. The regular daily staffing would be the same with a couple of exceptions: there would need to be a lead staff person on site, which would be either the Camp Director or the Preschool Assistant, both of which are represented employees who would qualify for the holiday. One of the two would either receive holiday pay at double their rate, take a different day off that week in lieu of the holiday, or bank their time at a rate of double their hours to be used later. The budget impact would depend on the option taken, but the cost of the Camp Director ($26.44) at double time for 8 hours is $423, vs. the standard cost of $211.52, a difference of $211.52.

The other option would be to close camp for the holiday as we do with July 4. The revenue cost of closing is $100 for that week per camper. If the camp is at full capacity, the loss of revenue is $6K.

**Lower the medical insurance stipend in lieu of benefits to $500 per month.**  
Under the current MOU, staff who opt out of the District’s health insurance benefit receive a stipend in lieu of benefits equal to the single-party rate of the lowest cost premium offered by CalPERS health. When this benefit was added to the MOU in 2021, that rate was $566 per month. Premiums have risen each subsequent year, and the current rate is $807 which would be rising in 2025 to $914. This growth is unsustainable for the District.

Additionally, in benchmarking 16 other nearby agencies, 12 do not offer this benefit at all; of the 4 that do offer a stipend, the rates are $75 a month for Arden Manor Rec and Park District, $300 for employees hired after 2018 and $850 for employees hired prior to 2018 for El Dorado Hills CSD, $150 a month for City of Roseville, and 50% of one of two high-deductible plans for Cordova Rec and Park District.

The District’s offer to the EA was half of the single-rate lowest-cost premium offered by CalPERS. The EA requested a flat $500 stipend and the District agreed. The Committee was also in agreement to this change.

**Cap the Maximum District Contribution to Health Benefits at 5%.**  
Under the current MOU, the District contributes a maximum amount to employee health benefits that is equal to the average of the 11 plans CalPERS offers minus the highest and lowest plans, not to exceed a 7% increase over the prior year. This year, the District recommended lower the cap to 5% due to increasing premiums and additional FT staff. The budget typically contains a 5% assumed increase to employee each year based on historical rates of increase, and that has always covered at least half of the options at 100% with no share of cost to employees.
<!-- Page 291 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

The lower cap will protect the District from incurring unsustainable increases over the next 3 years.

The Employees Association voted and agreed to the change, as did the Committee.

**Removal of Tech Stipend**  
The Employees Association recommended eliminating the Tech Stipend as there is currently a FT employee who oversees the District’s tech support. All were in agreement to remove the stipend.

**Reimbursement for Prescription Safety Glasses**  
The District brought this forward to be added as a benefit, up to $250 reimbursement for prescription safety glasses for employees who are required to wear them. As an alternative, there are safety glasses which fit over prescription glasses, but they may not be as effective as a single pair of glasses. This item was agreed upon by all.

**Purchase of Joint Use Park Passes**  
The Employees Association requested that the District purchase a Sacramento County Parking Pass and a Poppy Pass for California State Parks. The pass would be available to staff on a check-out basis for a maximum of 3 days at a time. The cost of the County pass is $70 and the Poppy Pass is $125. This item was agreed upon by all.

All other changes made were for miscellaneous formatting and language changes unrelated to negotiated items.

### III. Problem / Situation / Request  
The MOU attached was prepared in track change format for ease in reviewing the negotiated changes. The Management and Personnel Committee is recommending approval of the MOU for all items except the Juneteenth Holiday which needs a full Board discussion.

### IV. Financial Analysis  
Financial impacts of the added benefits have been included in the budget for FY 2024-2025.

Respectfully Submitted,  
Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

# ARTICLE 4. COMPENSATED LEAVES

## 4.1. VACATION
Vacation benefits shall accrue monthly for all regular employees from the date of hire as shown below:

## 4.2. FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES
Regular Full-Time Employees. Regular employees shall accrue vacation as follows:

| Employment                | Days Each Month/Year         |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Less than 3 years       | .92 per month/11 days annually |
| 3 years but less than 5 years | 1.25 per month/15 days annually |
| 5 years & over          | 1.67 per month/20 days annually |

## 4.3. REGULAR PART-TIME EMPLOYEES
Regular part-time employees accrue vacation time on a pro rata basis in the same proportions as the number of hours worked by that employee bears to the total number of hours worked on a monthly basis by regular full-time employees. A regular part-time employee is one who regularly works a minimum of 20 hours per week, but less than 38 hours per week. Seasonal and temporary employees are not eligible for vacation accrual.

## 4.4 VACATION ACCRUAL
A. Vacation is earned from the date of hire but may not be taken until the employee has completed three (3) months of continuous service (may be waived with District Administrator approval).

B. Vacation benefits shall not accrue during a leave of absence without pay, but any accrued vacation shall not be lost.

C. It is possible to take additional vacation without pay. This request must be in writing and pre-approved by the District Administrator. There are no advances.
<!-- Page 303 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  

4.5 CEILING ON VACATION BENEFITS  
Regular full-time employees may accrue up to 240 hours of vacation time. Once the 240-hour threshold is reached, no more time will accrue.  

Regular part-time employees may accrue up to 160 hours of vacation time. Once the 160-hour threshold is reached, no more time will accrue.  

4.6 SICK LEAVE  
Sick leave is an employee benefit provided by the District to be granted under the below listed circumstances and for the purpose of promoting the health and welfare of the individual employee until such time as all the accrued sick leave has been used. It is not an earned right to be used like vacation time. In addition, sick leave and vacation leave are not interchangeable, therefore the automatic use of vacation leave when sick leave has been exhausted is not allowed. An employee may request an exception for extenuating medical or health-related circumstances, such as an extended medical leave of absence. The exception may only be approved by the District Administrator. Sick leave is granted to an employee when he or she must be absent from duty because of a bona fide illness or injury. The accumulation of sick leave is unlimited.  

12
<!-- Page 304 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Displayed)

All regular full-time employees will accrue sick leave beginning on the employee’s first day of work. It will accrue at the rate of 1 day for each full month of service. All regular part-time employees will accrue sick time on a pro-rata basis.

Sick leave shall not accrue during a leave of absence, but accrued sick leave shall not be lost.

Sick Leave may be used by regular employees for the following reasons:
1. The employee’s own illness or injury;
2. Medical or dental appointments, for the employee or immediate family member;
3. Providing care for a member of the immediate family where such member is ill or injured and who requires the care of the employee.

For using sick leave, “immediate family” shall include:
- The employee’s child, which for purposes of this MOU means a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis. This definition of a child is applicable regardless of age or dependency status.
- A biological, adoptive, or foster parent, stepparent, or legal guardian of an employee or the employee’s spouse or registered domestic partner, or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a minor child.
- A spouse.
- A registered domestic partner.
- A grandparent.
- A grandchild.
- A sibling.

It shall be the responsibility of each employee absent from duty due to illness or injury to notify District at least two hours prior to the employee’s start time. Employees with sole responsibility for opening a facility or starting a scheduled District activity must notify their supervisor of their absence due to illness or injury far enough in advance to allow the supervisor to arrange for a substitute to perform these duties.

The District may require a statement from a medical doctor verifying the reason for absence due to illness or injury, or to care for an ill family member (as listed above) after two consecutive sick days. A doctor’s statement may also be required stating that the employee is capable of returning to his or her normal duties. Accrued sick leave with pay will not be authorized or granted for periods in excess of accrued sick leave. Upon retirement, unused accrued sick leave will be credited to the employee according to the provisions of the District’s contract with PERS unless the employee opts for a sick leave payout option.
<!-- Page 305 -->
4.7. SICK LEAVE PAYOUT OPTION  
The sick leave payout option encourages and compensates those employees who do not fully utilize their sick leave benefit. Regular full-time employees of the District may choose the sick leave payout option upon termination of employment with the District.  
If a full-time employee chooses the sick leave payout option upon termination, any unused sick leave up to a maximum of 320 hours will be compensated at 50% of the employee’s current hourly rate of pay at termination of employment. Should an employee choose the sick leave payout option, any accrued sick leave paid for which an employee has been paid out will not be credited to the employee upon retirement.  
If a regular part-time employee chooses the sick leave payout option upon termination, any unused sick leave up to a maximum of 160 hours will be compensated at 50% of the employee’s current hourly rate of pay at termination of employment. Should an employee choose the sick leave payout option, any accrued sick leave paid for which an employee has been paid out will not be credited to the employee upon retirement.  
Alternative to the payout options, an employee has the option of requesting all accrued but unused sick leave be credited to their PERS retirement fund upon retirement. The employee must be retiring from the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District for this to be an option; simply terminating from the District does not make an employee eligible for this option.  

4.8. CATASTROPHIC SICK LEAVE DONATIONS  
The Catastrophic Sick Leave policy allows employees who have exhausted their leave credits and must miss work due to a prolonged illness or injury (including that of an eligible family member), or due to a natural disaster, to request catastrophic leave.  
A catastrophic illness or injury is defined as an illness or injury that is serious and expected to incapacitate the employee or a member of the employee’s family or household, and which creates a financial hardship because the employee has exhausted all eligible leave credits.  
A natural disaster is defined as an act of nature, such as a flood or an earthquake, that has had an effect on the employee’s principle residence and the Governor has declared a state of emergency in the county where the employee resides.  
Employees may donate part of their accrued sick leave to any other employee of the District who exhausts their sick and vacation leave and is still incapable of the performance of their duties. Sick leave will be donated on an hour-for-
<!-- Page 306 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

4.10. WAITING PERIOD FOR WORKER’S COMPENSATION CLAIM  
The District will pay the three (3) day waiting period for those employees who are not hospitalized or removed from work for more than fourteen (14) days due to a work-related injury, before Workers' Compensation Benefits are paid.

4.11. MANAGEMENT LEAVE  
In lieu of overtime compensation or CTO, exempt employees shall be provided 60 hours of Management Leave per fiscal year to accrue at a rate of 5.34 hours per month. Management Leave requests must be approved by the District Administrator before actual usage.

4.12. LEAVES OF ABSENCE  
All Leaves of Absence are outlined in the Personnel Policy Manual and are updated annually or as legislation changes.

ARTICLE 5. HOLIDAYS

ARTICLE 6. HEALTH AND WELFARE

6.1. MEDICAL/DENTAL INSURANCE

Regular Full-Time Employees who have dual health coverage through a significant other may opt to be excluded from the District's health/dental plan. Regular Full-Time Employees employed by the District may receive monthly payments according to the following schedule:

An employee who opts out of health coverage is eligible for a stipend that is equal to $500 per month.

All regular full-time employees are eligible to participate in the District’s health and insurance plan starting on the first day of the month following 30 days of regular full-time employment. The District will pay for a portion of the premium for the employee and dependent health insurance. The District will adjust the amount annually to cover the average increase in the cost of health plans up to a maximum of the average cost of the health plans provided by CalPERS available to the District as a contracting agency, excluding the highest and lowest plans, and not to exceed 18
<!-- Page 310 -->
| **5% above the prior year’s maximum contribution rate.** Any costs not covered by the District are the responsibility of the employee and are paid through payroll deductions. The maximum amount allowed will be calculated for each of the categories of coverage (for example employee only, employee plus 1, employee plus two or more). Each year, the maximum will be recalculated using the formula above to identify the appropriate dollar amount to be used as the cap.  
In the event an employee elects a medical and/or dental plan offered by the District that has premiums in excess of the amounts set forth above, the employee will be responsible for the difference. The employee must make the necessary arrangements with the appropriate person in the Human Resources Department to have the difference in premiums deducted from his or her paycheck. A failure to make such arrangements for payment can result in termination of the employee’s health benefits.  
The District shall maintain benefits at the levels identified above during the three (3) year term of this agreement, unless negotiated otherwise in mutual agreement with the Board of Directors and the Employees' Association.  

**ARTICLE 7. MISCELLANEOUS**

**RESOLUTION NO. 061924-06**

**A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF  
THE FAIR OAKS RECREATION AND PARK DISTRICT**

**DECLARING INTENTION TO CONTINUE TO LEVY ASSESSMENTS  
FOR FISCAL YEAR 2024-25,  
PRELIMINARILY APPROVING ENGINEER'S REPORT,  
AND PROVIDING FOR NOTICE OF HEARING  
FOR THE PARKS MAINTENANCE & RECREATION IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT**

RESOLVED, by the Board of Directors of the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District (the “Board”), County of Sacramento, State of California, that:

1. On March 20, 2024, this Board adopted Resolution No. 032024-01, a Resolution Directing Preparation of an Engineer’s Report for the Parks Maintenance & Recreation Improvement District (the "District") for Fiscal Year 2024-25. Pursuant to this resolution, SCI Consulting Group, the Engineer of Work, prepared an Engineer's Report (the "Report") in accordance with Section 22565, et seq., of the Streets and Highway Code and Article XIIID of the California Constitution. The Report has been made, filed with the District Administrator and duly considered by the Board and is hereby deemed sufficient and preliminarily approved. The Report shall stand as the Engineer's Report for all subsequent proceedings under and pursuant to the foregoing resolution.

2. It is the intention of this Board to continue to levy and collect assessments within the District for fiscal year 2024-25.

3. Within the District, the existing and proposed improvements are generally described as the installation, maintenance and servicing of public facilities, including but not limited to, landscaping, sprinkler systems, park grounds, park facilities, landscape corridors, ground cover, shrubs and trees, street frontages, playground equipment and hardcourt areas, senior and community centers, drainage systems, lighting, fencing, entry monuments, basketball courts, tennis courts, running tracks, swimming pools, other recreational facilities, graffiti removal and repainting, and labor, materials, supplies, utilities and equipment, as applicable, for property owned and maintained by the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District. Installation means the construction of recreational improvements, including, but not limited to, land preparation, such as grading, leveling, cutting and filling, sod, landscaping, irrigation systems, sidewalks and drainage, lights, playground equipment, play courts, recreational facilities and public restrooms. Maintenance means the furnishing of services and materials for the ordinary and usual maintenance, operation and servicing of said improvements, including repair, removal, or replacement of all or part of any improvement; providing for the life, growth, health and beauty of landscaping; and cleaning, sandblasting and painting of walls and other.
<!-- Page 318 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+not+available)

1. Improvements to remove or cover graffiti. Servicing means the furnishing of electric current or energy for the operation or lighting of any improvements, and water for irrigation of any landscaping or the maintenance of any other improvements.

2. The District consists of the lots and parcels shown on the boundary map on the District on file with the District Administrator, and reference is hereby made to such map for further particulars.

3. Reference is hereby made to the Report for a full and detailed description of the Improvements, the boundaries of the District and the continued assessments upon assessable lots and parcels of land within the District.

4. The assessments are subject to an annual increase tied to the Consumer Price Index-U for the San Francisco Bay Area as of December of each succeeding year (the “CPI”), with a maximum annual increase not to exceed 3%. Any change in the CPI in excess of 3% shall be cumulatively reserved as the “Unused CPI” and shall be used to increase the maximum authorized assessment rate in years in which the CPI is less than 3%. The maximum authorized assessment rate is equal to the maximum assessment rate in the first fiscal year the assessment was levied adjusted annually by the minimum of 1) 3% or 2) the change in the CPI plus any Unused CPI as described above. The change in the CPI from December 2022 to December 2023 was 2.62% and the Unused CPI was 3.70%. Therefore, the maximum authorized assessment rate for fiscal year 2024-25 is increased by 3.00% which equates to $45.28 per single family equivalent benefit unit. The estimate of cost and budget in this Engineer’s Report proposes assessments for fiscal year 2024-25 at the rate of $45.28, which is less than the maximum authorized assessment rate.

5. The Public Hearing shall be held before this Board at the Fair Oaks Water District, 10326 Fair Oaks Blvd. Fair Oaks, CA 95628 on July 17, 2024 at the hour of 6:00 p.m. for the purpose of allowing public testimony regarding the proposed assessments, for this Board’s determination whether the public interest, convenience and necessity require the improvements, and for the Board’s final action upon the Engineer’s Report and the continued assessments therein. Notice of the hearing shall be published in a local newspaper at least 10 days prior to the meeting.

# Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District
## Parks Maintenance and Recreation Improvement District
### Engineer’s Report, Fiscal Year 2024-25

### Assessment Background
Prior to fiscal year 2000-01, the Park District experienced a revenue shortfall that was primarily due to escalating costs and limited revenues from other sources. In fact, in order to provide an acceptable level of park maintenance, the Park District had funded its revenue shortfall with reserve funds. Therefore, in absence of a new local revenue source, the baseline level of park and recreation facilities in the Park District would be a deteriorating level of maintenance and upkeep of the park and recreation facilities and properties listed above.

Due to this revenue shortfall and a lack of funding for capital improvement projects, in 2000 the Park District decided to ask property owners if they would support a special assessment for park maintenance and improvement. The Assessments fund a portion of the costs of the improvements and services described below that are provided throughout the Park District, extending above and beyond the baseline level of service and the likely elimination of services that would have been projected for future years in the Park District, absent the Assessments.

### Assessment Process
In February and March of 2000, the Park District conducted an assessment ballot proceeding pursuant to the requirements of Article XIIID of the California Constitution ("The Taxpayer's Right to Vote on Taxes Act") and the Landscaping the Lighting Act of 1972. During this ballot proceeding, property owners in the Park District were provided with a notice and ballot for the proposed "Parks Maintenance and Recreation Improvement District" or the “Improvement District.” A 45-day period was provided for balloting and a public hearing was conducted on March 23, 2000. At the public hearing, all ballots returned within the 45-day balloting period were tabulated.

It was determined at the public hearing that the assessment ballots submitted in opposition to the proposed assessments did not exceed the assessment ballots submitted in favor of the assessments (with each ballot weighted by the proportional financial obligation of the property for which ballot was submitted). The final balloting result was 58.1% weighted support from ballots returned.

As a result, the Board gained the authority to approve the levy of the assessments for fiscal year 2000-01 and to continue to levy them in future years. The authority granted by the ballot proceeding was for a maximum assessment rate of $24 per single family home per year, increased each subsequent year by the Bay Area CPI (consumer price index) not to exceed 3% per annum. In the event that the annual change in the CPI exceeds 3%, any percentage change in excess of 3% can be cumulatively reserved and can be added to the annual change in the CPI for years in which the CPI change is less than 3%.

# Engineer’s Report and Continuation of Assessments

In each subsequent year for which the assessments will be continued, the Board must direct the preparation of an Engineer's Report, budgets and proposed assessments for the upcoming fiscal year. After the Engineer's Report is completed, the Board may preliminarily approve the Engineer's Report and proposed assessments and establish the date for a public hearing on the continuation of the assessments. This Report was prepared pursuant to the direction of the Board on March 20, 2024 by Resolution No. 032024-01.

This Engineer’s Report ("Report") was prepared to establish the budget for the continued improvements and services (“Improvements”) that would be funded by the proposed 2024-25 assessments and other revenue, determine the special benefits received by property from the Improvements and services within the Park District, and the method of assessment apportionment to lots and parcels within the Park District. Including the authorized annual adjustments, the maximum authorized assessment rate for fiscal year 2024-25 is $45.28 per benefit unit. This Report and the proposed assessments have been made pursuant to the Landscaping and Lighting Act of 1972, Part 2 of Division 15 of the California Streets and Highways Code (the "Act") and Article XIIIID of the California Constitution (the “Article”).

If the Board approves this Report and the continuation of the assessments by resolution, a notice of public hearing must be published in a local paper at least 10 days prior to the date of the public hearing. The resolution preliminarily approving the Report and establishing the date for a public hearing is used for this notice.

Following the minimum 10-day time period after publishing the notice, a public hearing is held for the purpose of allowing public testimony about the proposed continuation of the assessments. This hearing is currently scheduled for July 17, 2024. At this hearing, the Board would consider approval of a resolution confirming the continuation of the assessments for fiscal year 2024-25. If so confirmed and approved, the assessments would be submitted to the County Auditor/Controller for inclusion on the property tax rolls for Fiscal Year 2024-25.

## Legal Analysis

### Proposition 218

This assessment is formed consistent with Proposition 218, The Right to Vote on Taxes Act, which was approved by the voters of California on November 6, 1996, and is now codified as Articles XIIIC and XIIIID of the California Constitution. Proposition 218 provides for benefit assessments to be levied to fund the cost of providing services, improvements, as well as maintenance and operation expenses to a public improvement which specially benefits the assessed property.

Proposition 218 describes a number of important requirements, including property-owner balloting, for the imposition, increase and extension of assessments, and these requirements are satisfied by the process used to establish this assessment.

**Silicon Valley Taxpayers Association, Inc. v Santa Clara County Open Space Authority**

In July of 2008, the California Supreme Court issued its ruling on the Silicon Valley Taxpayers Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority (“SVTA”). This ruling is the most significant legal document in further legally clarifying Proposition 218. Several of the most important elements of the ruling included further emphasis that:

- Benefit assessments are for special, not general, benefit
- The services and/or improvements funded by assessments must be clearly defined
- Special benefits are directly received by and provide a direct advantage to property in the Improvement District
- The assessment paid by property should be proportional to the special benefits it receives from the Improvements

This Report has been re-evaluated in light of the SVTA decision and updated to be consistent with the decision. There have been a number of clarifications made to the analysis, findings and supporting text to ensure that the assessment complies with Proposition 218 as construed by SVTA.

**Dahms v. Downtown Pomona Property**

On June 8, 2009, the 4th Court of Appeals approved a benefit assessment for property in the downtown area of the City of Pomona in Dahms v. Downtown Pomona Property (“Dahms”). In Dahms the Court upheld an assessment that was 100% special benefit (i.e. 0% general benefit) on the rationale that the services and improvements funded by the assessments were directly provided only to property in the assessment district. The Court also upheld discounts and exemptions from the assessment for certain properties.

**Bonander v. Town of Tiburon**

On December 31, 2009, in Bonander v. Town of Tiburon (“Bonander”), the Court of Appeal overturned a benefit assessment approved by property owners to pay for placing overhead utility lines underground in an area of the Town of Tiburon. The Court invalidated the assessments primarily on the grounds that the assessments had been apportioned to assessed property based on the costs within sub-areas of the assessment district instead of the overall cost of the improvements and the overall proportional special benefits.

**Beutz v. County of Riverside**  
On May 26, 2010 the Court of Appeals overturned an assessment for park maintenance in Wildomar, California, primarily because the general benefits associated with improvements and services were not explicitly calculated, quantified and separated from the special benefits.

**Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego**  
On September 22, 2011, the Court of Appeal issued a decision on the Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego (“Greater Golden Hill”). This decision overturned an assessment for street and landscaping maintenance in the Greater Golden Hill neighborhood of San Diego, California. The court described two primary reasons for its decision. First, like in Beutz, the court found the general benefits associated with services were not explicitly calculated, quantified and separated from the special benefits. Second, the court found that the City had failed to record the basis for the calculation of the assessment amount on city-owned parcels.

**Compliance with Current Law**  
This Report is consistent with the SVTA decision and with the requirements of Article XIIIC and XIIID of the California Constitution because the Improvements to be funded are clearly defined; the benefiting property in the Improvement District enjoys close and unique proximity, access and views to the Improvements; the Improvements serve as an extension of usable land area for benefiting properties in the Improvement District and such special benefits provide a direct advantage to property in the Improvement District that is not enjoyed by the public at large or other property.

This Report is consistent with Beutz, Dahms and Greater Golden Hill because, the improvements will directly benefit property in the Improvement District, and the general benefits have been explicitly calculated and quantified and excluded from the Assessments. The Report is consistent with Bonander because the Assessments have been apportioned based on the overall cost of the Improvements and proportional special benefit to each property.

![Plans & Specifications](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Plans+%26+Specifications)

The Act requires the Report to include “plans and specifications” that show and describe the existing and proposed “Improvements” (as defined at section 2525 of the Act) that will benefit the property in the Improvement District. The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District maintains park facilities in locations throughout its boundaries.

The work and improvements (the “Improvements”) proposed to be undertaken by the Improvement District, and the cost thereof paid from the levy of the annual assessment, provide special benefit to Assessor Parcels within the Improvement District as defined in the Method of Assessment herein. The Improvements are described as follows:

Installation, Maintenance and Servicing of public parks, recreational facilities and improvements, including, but not limited to, turf and play areas, landscaping, ground cover, shrubs and trees, irrigation systems, drainage systems, public lighting facilities, fencing, entry monuments, basketball courts, tennis courts, playground equipment, signage, parking lots, other recreational facilities, and labor, materials, supplies, utilities, equipment and Incidental Expenses at each of the parks and facilities owned, operated or maintained by the Park District (collectively the “Improvements.”).

As applied herein, “Installation” means the construction of recreational improvements, including, but not limited to, land preparation (such as grading, leveling, cutting and filling), sod, landscaping, irrigation systems, sidewalks and drainage, lights, playground equipment, play courts, recreational facilities and public restrooms.

“Maintenance” means the furnishing of services and materials for the ordinary and usual maintenance, operation and servicing of any improvement, including repair, removal or replacement of all or any part of any improvement; providing for the life, growth, health, and beauty of landscaping, including cultivation, irrigation, trimming, spraying, fertilizing, or treating for disease or injury; the removal of trimmings, rubbish, debris, and other solid waste, and the cleaning, sandblasting, and painting of walls and other improvements to remove or cover graffiti.

“Servicing” means the furnishing of electric current, or energy, gas or other illuminating agent for any public lighting facilities or for the lighting or operation of any other improvements; or water for the irrigation of any landscaping, the operation of any fountains, or the maintenance of any other improvements.

# Estimate of Cost and Budget – Fiscal Year 2024-25

## Introduction
The Act requires the Report to estimate the costs of the Improvements for the fiscal year, including estimates for the total costs for the Improvements for the year, the amount of any surplus or deficit to be carried over from a previous fiscal year, and the amount of funding contributions made from sources other than assessment revenue. After determining these amounts, the Report then must calculate the net amount to be assessed upon assessable lands within the District.

## Estimate of Annual Cost of Improvements
The budget to be financed by the assessments is based on the original Report, which was partially based on the results of an independent survey conducted for the District, which indicated property owners’ priorities for various improvement projects and park maintenance services. The annual Park District budget sets forth the particular scope of Improvements for the fiscal year, including both operation/maintenance work and capital improvement projects. Work and projects are included throughout the Park District in order to ensure that all properties in the Park District boundaries will receive special benefit from better maintained and improved parks and facilities in their area. The budget and capital improvement plan includes projects that will improve park and open space security by enhancing lighting; replace outdated playground equipment; enhanced maintenance of all parks and recreation areas to help ensure the continued beauty, usability, and accessibility of the Park District’s parks, playfields, and recreation areas; develop playfields and youth oriented activity areas on undeveloped land owned by the Park District.

1. The item Installation, Maintenance, Servicing and Administration would provide funding for enhanced maintenance of all parks and recreation facilities on a daily basis, seven days per week. Improvements would include mowing turf, trimming and caring for landscaping, fertilization and aeration of grounds and playfields, routine maintenance and safety inspections, painting, replacing/repairing broken or damaged equipment, trash removal and cleanup, irrigation and irrigation system maintenance, and other services as needed.

2. As determined in the following section, at least 41% of the cost of Improvements must be funded from sources other than the assessments to cover any general benefits from the Improvements. Therefore, out of the total cost of Improvements of $4,303,180 the District must contribute at least 41% or $1,764,304 from sources other than the assessments. The District will actually contribute $3,675,293 which is over 85%, and more than covers any general benefits from the Improvements.

3. The Act requires that proceeds from the assessments must be deposited into a special fund that has been set up for the revenues and expenditures of the Improvement District. Moreover, funds raised by the assessment shall be used only for the purposes stated within this Report. Any balance remaining at the end of the fiscal year, July 1, must be carried over to the next fiscal year. The Park District may also establish a reserve fund for contingencies and special projects as well as a capital improvement fund for accumulating funds for larger capital improvement projects or capital renovation needs. Any remaining balance would either be placed in the reserve fund, the capital improvement fund, or would be used to reduce future years' assessments.

4. All assessment amounts are rounded to the lower even penny per the requirements of the County.

![Method of Apportionment](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Method+of+Apportionment)

# Method of Apportionment

This section of the Report explains the benefits to be derived from the Improvements to park facilities and District property throughout the Park District, and the methodology used to apportion the total assessment to properties within the Improvement District.

The Improvement District consists of all Assessor Parcels within the boundaries of the Park District. The method used for apportioning the assessment is based upon the proportional special benefits conferred to the properties over and above the general benefits conferred to real property in the Improvement District or to the public at large. Special benefit is calculated for each parcel in the Improvement District using the following process:

1. Identification of all benefit factors derived from the Improvements
2. Calculation of the proportion of these benefits that are general
3. Determination of the relative special benefit within different areas within the Improvement District
4. Determination of the relative special benefit per property type
5. Calculation of the specific assessment for each individual parcel based upon special vs. general benefit; location, property type, property characteristics, improvements on property and other supporting attributes

## Discussion of Benefit

In summary, the assessments can only be levied based on the special benefit to property. Any and all general benefit, including benefit that is indirect or derivative, must be funded from another source. This special benefit is received by property over and above any general benefits from the Improvements. With reference to the requirements for assessments, Section 22573 of the Landscaping and Lighting Act of 1972 states:

"The net amount to be assessed upon lands within an assessment district may be apportioned by any formula or method which fairly distributes the net amount among all assessable lots or parcels in proportion to the estimated benefits to be received by each such lot or parcel from the improvements."

Proposition 218, as codified in Article XIIID of the California Constitution, has confirmed that assessments must be based on the special benefit to property:

"No assessment shall be imposed on any parcel which exceeds the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit conferred on that parcel."

<!-- Page 336 -->
![Page 12](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+12)

Since assessments are levied on the basis of special benefit, they are not a tax and are not governed by Article XIII A of the California Constitution.

The SVTA decision also clarifies that a special benefit is a service or improvement that provides a direct advantage to a parcel and that indirect or derivative advantages resulting from the overall public benefits from a service or improvement are general benefits. The SVTA decision also provides specific guidance that park improvements are a direct advantage and special benefit to property that is proximate to a park that is improved by an assessment:

The characterization of a benefit may depend on whether the parcel receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g. proximity to a park) or receives an indirect, derivative advantage resulting from the overall public benefits of the improvement (e.g. general enhancement of the district’s property values).

Finally, Proposition 218 twice uses the phrase “over and above” general benefits in describing special benefit (Art. XIII D, sections 2(i) and 4(f)). The SVTA decision further clarifies that special benefits must provide a direct advantage to benefiting property and that proximity to a park is an example of a special benefit.

## Benefit Factors

The special benefits from the Improvements are listed below:

### Extension of a property’s outdoor areas and green spaces for properties within close proximity to the Improvements

In large part because it is cost prohibitive to provide large open land areas on property in the Improvement District, the residential, commercial and other benefiting properties in the Improvement District do not have large outdoor areas and green spaces. The parks in the Improvement District provide these larger outdoor areas that serve as an effective extension of the land area for proximate properties because the Improvements are uniquely proximate and accessible to property in close proximity to the Improvements. The Improvements, therefore, provide an important, valuable and desirable extension of usable land area for the direct advantage and special benefit of properties with good and close proximity to the Improvements.

According to the industry-standard guidelines established by the National Park and Recreation Association (the “NPRA”), neighborhood parks in urban areas have a service area radius of generally one-half mile and community parks have a service area radius of approximately two miles. The service radii for neighborhood parks and neighborhood green spaces were specifically established to give all properties within these service radii close proximity and easy walking access to such public land areas. Since proximate and accessible parks serve as an extension of the usable land area for property in the service radii and since the service radii was specifically designed to provide close proximity and access, the parcels within this service area clearly receive a direct advantage and special benefit from the Improvements, and this advantage is not received by other properties or the public at large.

An analysis of the service radii for the Improvements finds that all properties in the Improvement District enjoy the distinct and direct advantage of being close and proximate to one or often multiple parks within the Improvement District. The benefiting properties in the Improvement District therefore uniquely and specially benefit from the Improvements.

**Proximity to improved parks and recreational facilities**

Only the specific properties within close proximity to the Improvements are included in the Improvement District. Therefore, property in the Improvement District enjoys unique and valuable proximity and access to the Improvements that the public at large and property outside the Improvement District do not share.

In absence of the assessments, the Improvements would not be provided and the parks and recreation areas in the Improvement District would be degraded due to insufficient funding for maintenance, upkeep and repair. Therefore, the assessments provide Improvements that are over and above what otherwise would be provided. Improvements that are over and above what otherwise would be provided do not by themselves translate into special benefits but when combined with the unique proximity and access enjoyed by parcels in the Improvement District, they provide a direct advantage and special benefit to property in the Improvement District.

**Access to improved parks, open space and recreational areas**

Since the parcels in the Improvement District are nearly the only parcels that enjoy close access to the Improvements, they directly benefit from the unique close access to improved parks, open space and recreation areas that are provided by the Assessments. This is a direct advantage and special benefit to property in the Improvement District.

![Page 14](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+14)

**Improved Views**  
The Park District, by maintaining and improving the landscaping at its park and recreation facilities provides improved views to properties within close proximity and access to the Improvements. Properties in the Improvement District receive this direct advantage because they enjoy unique proximity and access to views of the Improvements. Therefore, the improved and protected views provided by the Assessments are another direct and tangible advantage that is uniquely conferred upon property in the Improvement District.

**Benefit Finding**  
In summary, real property located within the boundaries of the Improvement District distinctly and directly benefits from closer proximity, access and views of improved parks, recreation facilities, open space, landscaped corridors, and other public resources funded by the Assessments. The Improvements are specifically designed to serve local properties in the Improvement District, not other properties or the public at large. The public at large and other properties outside the Improvement District receive only limited benefits from the Improvements because they do not have proximity, good access or views of the Improvements. These are special benefits to property in the Improvement District in much the same way that sewer and water facilities, sidewalks and paved streets enhance the utility and desirability of property and make them more functional to use, safer and easier to access.

**General versus Special Benefit**  
Article XIIIC of the California Constitution requires any local agency proposing to increase or impose a benefit assessment to “separate the general benefits from the special benefits conferred on a parcel.” The rationale for separating special and general benefits is to ensure that property owners subject to the benefit assessment are not paying for general benefits. The assessment can fund special benefits but cannot fund general benefits. Accordingly, a separate estimate of the special and general benefit is given in this section.

In other words:

**Total Benefit**  
= General Benefit + Special Benefit

There is no widely-accepted or statutory formula for determining general benefit. General benefits are benefits from improvements or services that are not special in nature, are not “particular and distinct” and are not “over and above” benefits received by other properties. SVTA provides some clarification by indicating that general benefits provide “an indirect, derivative advantage” and are not necessarily proximate to the improvements.

In light of Beutz v. County of Riverside (2010) and Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. Park District of San Diego (2011), the Park District has reevaluated the Proposition 218 requirement regarding special and general benefits. Proposition 218 requires an assessing agency to separate the general benefits from the special benefits of a public improvement or service, estimate the quantity of each in relation to the other, and limit the assessment amount to the portion of the improvement or service costs attributable to the special benefits. The courts in Golden Hill and Beutz determined that there usually will be some general benefit associated with a parks improvement project and park-related services because residents and others who don’t reside in the assessment district will use the parks at least to some degree. The separation and quantification of general and special benefits requires an apportionment of the cost of the service or improvement between the two benefit types and assessing assessment district property owners only for the portion of the cost representing special benefits to the assessment district property.

General benefits cannot be funded by assessment revenue. Rather, the funding must come from other sources. The Park District therefore has analyzed the quantity or extent to which the general public may reasonably be expected to use or benefit from the Park District parks and facilities in relation to the quantity or extent to which residents of the assessment district use and benefit from the parks and facilities.

In contrast to general benefit, special benefit is defined in the state constitution as “a particular and distinct benefit over and above general benefits conferred on real property located in the district or to the public at large.” The SVTA decision indicates that a special benefit is conferred to a property if it “receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g., proximity to a park).” In this assessment, as noted, properties in the Improvement District have close and unique proximity, views and access to the Improvements and uniquely improved desirability from the Improvements and other properties and the public at large do not receive significant benefits because they do not have proximity, access or views of the Improvements. Therefore, the majority of the benefits conferred to property is special, and a lesser benefit is received by property outside the Improvement District or the public at large.

**Calculating General Benefit**

In this section, the general benefit is conservatively estimated and described, and then budgeted so that it is funded by sources other than the assessment. In analyzing general benefit, the District has focused on the benefits from the Improvements to property outside the Improvement District and to the public at large.

**Benefit to Property Outside the Improvement District**

Properties within the Improvement District receive almost all of the special benefits from the Improvements because properties in the Improvement District enjoy unique close proximity and access to the Improvements that is not enjoyed by other properties or the public at large. However, certain properties within the proximity/access radius of the Improvements, but outside of the boundaries of the Improvement District, may receive some benefit from the Improvements. Since this benefit is conferred to properties outside the Improvement District boundaries, it contributes to the overall general benefit calculation and will not be funded by the Assessments.

The properties outside the Improvement District and within the proximity radii for neighborhood parks in the Improvement District receive benefits from the Improvements. Since these properties are not assessed for their benefits because they are outside of the area that can be assessed by the District, this is a form of general benefit to the public at large and other property. A 50% reduction factor is applied to these properties because they are all on only one side of the Improvements and properties in the Improvement District enjoy the advantage of over twice the average proximity to the Improvements. The general benefit to property outside of the Improvement District is calculated as follows with the parcel and data analysis performed by the assessment engineer.

**Assumptions:**

- 1,267 parcels outside the District but within 0.5 miles of a park within the Improvement District
- 12,500 parcels in the Improvement District
- 50% relative benefit compared to property within the Improvement District

**Calculation of General Benefit to Property Outside the Improvement District:**

1,267 / (12,500 + 1,267) * 0.5 = 4.6%

**Benefit To The Public At Large**

Although it can reasonably be argued that Improvements inside, but near the Park District boundaries are offset by similar park and recreational improvements provided outside, but near the Park District’s boundaries, we use the more conservative approach of finding that 4.6% of the Improvements are of general benefit to property outside the Improvement District.

Without data concerning all users of the Park District parks, facilities and programs (which is unavailable and too difficult and costly to obtain), it is difficult to determine the general benefit to the public at large. As one measure, the general benefit to the public can be estimated by the proportionate resident versus non-resident usage of the principal Park District programs. In the re-analysis of general benefit, the Park District staff evaluated available registration data. The Park District’s parks and facilities are used regularly for recreation classes, lacrosse, Little League baseball, tennis, softball and basketball. These are some of the primary and most popular programs of the Park District and they provide a good representative sampling of parks and facilities usage. For each of these programs, the Park District maintains or has access to participant registration data, which includes each participant’s residence address. Park District staff has evaluated that data in order to determine which participants reside within the Improvement District boundaries and which reside outside the Improvement District. This evaluation results in the following proportion of recent resident and non-resident usage:

| Park Activities         | Number of Participants | Percentage of Resident Participants | Percentage of Non-Resident Participants |

Based on this data, the Park District concludes that 41% of the parks and facilities users are non-resident. The 41% amount then is a fair estimate of the general benefit to the public at large.

This data and analysis only includes park users participating in organized activities, leagues and classes, and no other “casual” park users. Previous research and field survey work indicates that casual park users are more likely to be local residents. If the parks usage by these casual participants was taken into account, the amount of general benefit would likely be significantly less than the 41% calculated above. Therefore, the 41% amount is a very conservative estimate of the general benefits.

## Total General Benefits

The registration data shows that many of the non-resident users reside close to the Improvement District, and within the properties outside the Improvement District, and within the proximity radii for neighborhood parks as analyzed above. The Park District has determined that the 4.6% general benefit to property outside the Improvement District is encompassed within the 41% general benefit to the public at large. Therefore, the Park District concludes that 41% is a conservative and fair estimate of the overall general benefit from the Improvements.

The Park District’s total assessment budget for maintenance and improvement of its parks and recreational facilities is $4,303,180. Of this total budget amount, the Park District will contribute $3,675,293 from other non-assessment revenue sources. This contribution by the Park District equates to approximately 85% of the total budget for the Improvements and constitutes more than the amount attributable to the general benefits from the Improvements.

## Zones of Benefit

The boundaries of the Assessment District have been carefully drawn to include the properties in the Park District that are proximate to the proposed Improvements and that would materially benefit from the Improvements. The Assessment District is coterminous with the District boundaries. As the properties in the Park District have developed over time, regional and neighborhood parks have been strategically located throughout the community as it has been built out. Park size and location have been carefully incorporated into the design of the community, consistent with the NPRA guidelines. Now, with a mature community, all parcels in the Park District are located in close proximity to at least one park. It therefore is appropriate to provide a District-wide Assessment District because all parcels benefit similarly.

In SVTA, the court noted that a local agency-wide assessment district is appropriate under the right conditions:

“Thus, if an assessment district is narrowly drawn, the fact that a benefit is conferred throughout the district does not make it general rather than special. In that circumstance, the characterization of a benefit may depend on whether the parcel receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g., proximity to a park) or receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g., proximity to a park) or receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g., proximity to a park) or receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g., proximity to a park).”

an indirect, derivative advantage resulting from the overall public benefits of the improvement (e.g., general enhancement of the district's property values).”

The court therefore acknowledged the appropriateness of a District-wide assessment so long as each parcel receives a direct advantage from the assessment-funded improvement or service. As demonstrated in this Report, in light of the small Park District size and dispersal of parks throughout the Park District, each parcel in the Assessment District receives a direct advantage and special benefit from the Improvements.

In the Assessment District, the advantage that each parcel receives from the Improvements is direct, and the boundaries are narrowly drawn to include only parcels that benefit from the Assessment. Therefore, the even spread of assessment throughout the narrowly drawn district is indeed consistent with the OSA decision. The benefits from the Improvements within the Assessment District do not vary further based on proximity of the parcels to the Improvements because the increased benefits of greater proximity to the Improvements are generally offset by a parallel increase in negative factors such as higher levels of traffic, noise, etc. that comes with increased proximity. Consequently, since all parcels in the Assessment District have good access and proximity to the Improvements and the benefits to relatively closer proximity are offset by other factors, additional proximity is not considered to be a factor in determining benefit within the Assessment District. Therefore, zones of benefit are not justified or needed within the Improvement District.

# Method of Assessment

As previously discussed, the assessments provide specific improvements that confer direct and tangible special benefits to properties in the Improvement District. These benefits can partially be measured by the occupants on property in the Improvement District because such parcel population density is a measure of the relative benefit a parcel receives from the Improvements. Therefore, the apportionment of benefit is partially based the population density of parcels.

It should be noted that many other types of “traditional” assessments also use parcel population densities to apportion the assessments. For example, the assessments for sewer systems, roads and water systems are typically allocated based on the population density of the parcels assessed. Moreover, assessments have a long history of use in California and are in large part based on the principle that benefits from a service or improvement funded by assessments that is enjoyed by tenants and other non-property owners ultimately is conferred directly to the underlying property.¹

After separating out the general benefits, the next step in apportioning assessments is to determine the relative special benefit for each property. This process involves determining the relative benefit received by each property in relation to a single family home, or, in other words, on the basis of Single Family Equivalents (SFE). This SFE methodology is commonly used to distribute assessments in proportion to estimated special benefit and is generally recognized as providing the basis for a fair and appropriate distribution of assessments. For the purposes of this Report, all properties are designated a SFE value, which is each property’s relative benefit in relation to a single family home on one parcel. In this case, the "benchmark" property is the single family detached dwelling which is one Single Family Equivalent or one SFE.

In the process of determining the appropriate method of assessment, the Engineer considered various alternatives. For example, an assessment only for residential improved property was considered but was determined to be inappropriate because commercial, industrial and other property also receive direct benefits from the Improvements.

¹ For example, in Federal Construction Co. v. Ensign (1922) 59 Cal.App. 200 at 211, the appellate court determined that a sewer system specially benefited property even though the direct benefit was to the people who used the sewers: “Practically every inhabitant of a city either is the owner of the land on which he resides or on which he pursues his vocation, or he is the tenant of the owner, or is the agent or servant of such owner or of such tenant. And since it is the inhabitants who make by far the greater use of a city’s sewer system, it is to them, as lot owners or as tenants, or as the servants or agents of such lot owners or tenants, that the advantages of actual use will redound. But this advantage of use means that, in the final analysis, it is the lot owners themselves who will be especially benefited in a financial sense.”

<!-- Page 345 -->
![Page 21](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Page+21)

Moreover, a fixed or flat assessment for all properties of similar type was deemed to be inappropriate because larger properties receive a higher degree of benefit than other similarly used properties that are significantly smaller. (For two properties used for commercial purposes, there is clearly a higher benefit provided to the larger property in comparison to a smaller commercial property because the larger property generally supports a larger building and has higher numbers of employees, customers and guests that would benefit from proximity and improved access to well maintained and improved parks and recreational facilities. So the potential population of employees or residents is a measure of the special benefits received by the property.) Larger parcels, therefore, receive an increased benefit from the assessments.

Finally, the special benefits derived from the assessments are conferred on property and are not based on a specific property owner’s use of the improvements, or a specific property owner’s occupancy of property, or the property owner’s demographic status such as age or number of dependents. However, it is ultimately people who value the special benefits described above derived by property are related to the average number of people who could potentially live on, work at, or otherwise could use a property, not how the property is currently used by the present owner. Therefore, the number of people who could or potentially live on, work at or otherwise use a property is one indicator of the relative level of benefit received by a property.

In conclusion, the Assessment Engineer determined that the appropriate method of assessment apportionment should be based on the type and use of property, the relative size of the property, its relative population and usage potential, and its proximity to parks and recreational facilities. This method is further described below.

### Residential Properties

Certain residential properties in the Improvement District that contain a single residential dwelling unit are assigned one Single Family Equivalent or 1.0 SFE. Traditional houses, zero-lot line houses, and town homes are included in this category of single family residential property.

Properties with more than one residential unit are designated as multi-family residential properties. These properties benefit from the improvements in proportion to the number of dwelling units that occupy each property, and the average number of people who reside in multi-family residential units versus the average number of people who reside in a single family home. The population density factors for the Park District, as depicted in the next figure, provide the basis for determining the SFE factors for residential properties. Using the total population in a certain property type in the community of Fair Oaks from the 1990 Census (the most recent data available when the Improvement District was established) and dividing it by the total number of such households, finds that approximately 2.86 persons occupy each single family residence, whereas an average of 1.91 persons occupy each multi-family residence. Using the ratio of one SFE for each single-family residence, which equates to one SFE for every 2.86 persons, 0.67 SFE would equate to one multi-family unit or 0.67 SFE for every 1.91 residents. Likewise, each condominium unit receives 0.73 SFE and each mobile home receives 0.68 SFE.

**Figure 3 – Residential Assessment Factors**

| Property Type                  | Total Population | Occupied Households | Persons per Household | SFE Factor |
|-------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------|
| Single Family Residential      | 20,786           | 7,280               | 2.86                  | 1.00       |
| Condominium                   | 1,456            | 700                 | 2.08                  | 0.73       |
| Multi-Family Residential      | 4,239            | 2,215               | 1.91                  | 0.67       |
| Mobile Home on Separate Lot   | 27               | 14                  | 1.93                  | 0.68       |

*Source: 1990 Census, Community of Fair Oaks.*

The single family equivalency factor of 0.67 per dwelling unit for multifamily residential properties applies to such properties with 20 or fewer units. Properties in excess of 20 units typically offer on-site recreational amenities and other facilities that tend to offset some of the benefits provided by the improvements. Therefore the benefit for properties in excess of 20 units is determined to be 0.67 SFE per unit for the first 20 units and 0.10 SFE per each additional unit in excess of 20 dwelling units.

**Commercial/Industrial Properties**

SFE values for commercial and industrial land uses are based on the equivalence of special benefit on a land area basis between single family residential property and commercial property. The SFE values for other types of business and industrial land uses are established by using average employee densities, because the special benefit factors described previously can be measured by the average number of people who work at commercial/industrial properties.

In order to determine employee density factors, the findings from the San Diego Association of Governments Traffic Generators Study (the “SANDAG Study”) are used because these findings were approved by the State Legislature for use in justifying commercial and industrial school facilities fees, and are considered to be a good representation of the average number of employees per acre of land area for commercial and industrial properties. As determined by the SANDAG Study, the average number of employees per acre for commercial property is 24.

In comparison, the average number of people residing in a single family home in the area is 2.86. Since the average lot size for a single family home in Fair Oaks is approximately 0.30 acres, the average number of residents per acre of residential property is 9.53.

The employee density per acre is generally 2.50 times the population density of single-family residential property per acre (24 employees per acre / 9.53 residents per acre). Therefore, the average employee density can be used as the basis for allocating benefit to commercial or industrial property since a property with 2.50 employees receives generally similar special benefit to a residential property with 1 resident. This factor of equivalence of benefit between 1 resident to 2.50 employees is the basis for allocating commercial/industrial benefit. The following Figure shows the average employees per acre of land area or portion thereof for commercial and industrial properties, and lists the relative SFE factors per quarter acre for properties in each land use category.

Commercial and industrial properties in excess of 5 acres generally involve uses that are more land intensive relative to building areas and number of employees (lower coverage ratios). As a result, the benefit factors for commercial and industrial property land area in excess of 5 acres is determined to be the SFE rate per quarter acre for the first 5 acres and the relevant SFE rate per each additional acre over 5 acres.

Institutional properties that are used for residential, commercial or industrial purposes are also assessed at the appropriate residential, commercial, or industrial rate.

| Type of Commercial/Industrial Land Use | Average Employees Per Acre | SFE Units per 1/4 Acre * |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Commercial                              | 24                         | 0.86                      |
| Office                                  | 68                         | 2.43                      |

* The SFE factors for commercial and industrial parcels are applied by the quarter acre of land area or portion thereof. (Therefore, the minimum assessment for any assessable parcel in these categories is the SFE Units listed herein.)

## Vacant Properties

The benefit to vacant properties is determined to be proportional to the corresponding benefits for similar type developed properties; however, at a lower rate due to the lack of improvements on the property. A measure of the benefits accruing to the underlying land is the average value of land in relation to improvements for developed property. As a general average, appraisers often use a factor of 25% to 30% of developed property value as land value. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that approximately 25% of the benefits are related to the underlying land and 75% are related to the Improvements and the day-to-day use of the property. Using this ratio, the SFE factor for vacant parcels is 0.25 per parcel.

As properties are approved for development, their value also increases. Likewise, the special benefit received by vacant property increases as the property is approved for development, or becomes closer to being improved. When property is approved for development with a final map, the property has passed the final significant hurdle to development and can shortly undergo construction. Since the property is nearing the point of development, its special benefits increase. In addition, these properties are generally sold soon after completion of improvements, so the properties receive the additional benefit of desirability from prospective buyers due to the special benefits provided by proximity to improved parks and recreational facilities of the Park District. It is therefore determined that property with final map approval receives 50% of the relative benefit to improved property of similar use-type.

## Other Properties

All properties that are specially benefited are assessed. Other publicly owned property that is used for purposes similar to private residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional uses is benefited and assessed at the same rate as such privately owned property.

Miscellaneous, small and other parcels such as roads, right-of-way parcels, and common areas typically do not generate significant numbers of employees, residents, customers, or guests and have limited economic value. These miscellaneous parcels receive no benefit from the Improvements and are assessed an SFE benefit factor of 0.

# Annual Cost Indexing
It should be noted that the maximum assessment rate within the Improvement District may increase in future years based on the annual change in the Northern California (San Francisco Bay Area) Consumer Price Index (the “CPI”), with a maximum annual adjustment not to exceed 3%. %. In the event that the annual change in the CPI exceeds 3%, any percentage change in excess of 3% can be cumulatively reserved and can be added to the annual change in the CPI for years in which the CPI change is less than 3%.

# Duration of Assessment
It is proposed that the Assessment be levied for fiscal year 2000-01 and continued every year thereafter, so long as the parks and recreational areas need to be improved and maintained and the Park District requires funding from the Assessments for its Improvements in the Improvement District. As noted previously, the Assessment can continue to be levied annually after the Park District Board of Directors approves an annually updated Report, budget for the Assessment, Improvements to be provided, and other specifics of the Assessment. In addition, the District Board of Directors must hold an annual public hearing to continue the Assessment.

# Appeals and Interpretation
Any property owner who claims that the assessment levied on its property is in error as a result of incorrect information being used to apply the foregoing method of assessment, may file a written appeal with the District Administrator or her or his designee. Any such appeal is limited to correction of an assessment during the then current or, if before July 1, the upcoming fiscal year. Upon the filing of any such appeal, the District Administrator or his or her designee will promptly review the appeal and any information provided by the property owner. If the District Administrator or her or his designee finds that the assessment should be modified, the appropriate changes shall be made to the assessment roll. If any such changes are approved after the assessment roll has been filed with the County for collection, the District Administrator or his or her designee is authorized to refund to the property owner the amount of any approved reduction. Any dispute over the decision of the District Administrator, or her or his designee, shall be referred to the Board of Directors of the Park District and the decision of the Board of Directors shall be final.

As required by the Act, an Assessment Diagram is hereto attached and made a part hereof showing the exterior boundaries of the Improvement District. The distinctive number of each parcel or lot of land in the Improvement District is its Assessor Parcel Number appearing on the Assessment Roll.

I do hereby assess and apportion the net amount of the cost and expenses of the Improvements, including the costs and expenses incident thereto, upon the parcels and lots of land within the Improvement District, in accordance with the special benefits to be received by each parcel or lot, from the improvements, and more particularly set forth in the Cost Estimate and Method of Assessment hereto attached and by reference made a part hereof.

Property owners in the Improvement District approved in an assessment ballot proceeding in 2000 the initial fiscal year benefit assessment for special benefits to their property including the CPI adjustment schedule. As a result, the assessment may continue to be levied annually and may be adjusted by up to the maximum annual CPI adjustment without any additional assessment ballot proceeding. In the event that in future years the assessments are levied at a rate less than the maximum authorized assessment rate, the assessment rate in a subsequent year may be increased up to the maximum authorized assessment rate without any additional assessment ballot proceeding.

The assessment is subject to an annual increase tied to the Consumer Price Index-U for the San Francisco Bay Area as of December of each succeeding year (the “CPI”), with a maximum annual increase not to exceed 3%. Any change in the CPI in excess of 3% shall be cumulatively reserved as the “Unused CPI” and shall be used to increase the maximum authorized assessment rate in years in which the CPI is less than 3%. The maximum authorized assessment rate is equal to the maximum assessment rate in the first fiscal year the assessment was levied adjusted annually by the minimum of 1) 3% or 2) the change in the CPI plus any Unused CPI as described above.

The change in the CPI from December 2022 to December 2023 was 2.62% and the Unused CPI carried forward from the previous fiscal year is 3.70%. Therefore, the maximum authorized assessment rate for fiscal year 2024-25 is increased by 3.00% which equates to $45.28 per single family equivalent benefit unit. The estimate of cost and budget in this Report proposes assessments for fiscal year 2024-25 at the rate of $45.28, which is less than the maximum authorized assessment rate.

The assessment is made upon the parcels or lots of land within the Improvement District in proportion to the special benefits to be received by the parcels or lots of land, from the Improvements.

Engineer’s Report, Fiscal Year 2024-25

# Introduction

## Overview

The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District (the “District”) is an independent special district established in 1945. The District provides park and recreation services to an area encompassing over 12,500 parcels. The District is governed by an elected five-member Board of Directors (the “Board”).

The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District, Phoenix Field Landscape and Lighting Assessment District (the "Assessment District") provides funding for maintenance, servicing and improvements for a narrowly drawn area encompassing 373 parcels. The purpose of the Assessment District is to rehabilitate, improve, service and maintain the Little Phoenix Park, which covers 0.95 acres and is located at 9041 Phoenix Avenue, the Phoenix Enclave and Swale adjacent to former Filbert Avenue, and other perimeter landscape areas along Madison and Sunset Avenues as shown on the assessment diagram.

## Assessment Formation

On June 15, 1989, the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Board of Directors ordered by Resolution No. 61859-3, the formation of, and levied the first assessment within, the Assessment District pursuant to the provisions of the Landscaping and Lighting Act of 1972 (the "Act"), Part 2 of Division 15 of the California Streets and Highways Code (commencing with Section 22500 thereof).

## Assessment Continuation

In each subsequent year for which the assessments will be continued, the Board must direct the preparation of an Engineer's Report ("Report"), budgets and continued assessments for the upcoming fiscal year. The Report also identifies future planned projects. After the Report is completed, the Board may preliminarily approve the Report and proposed assessments and establish the date for a public hearing on the continuation of the assessments. This Report was prepared pursuant to the direction of the Board on March 20, 2024 by Resolution No. 032024-02.

This Report was prepared to establish the budget for the continued services that would be funded by the proposed 2024-25 continued assessments and to define the special benefits received from the Improvements (described below) by property within the Assessment District and the method of assessment apportionment to lots and parcels. This Report and the continued assessments have been made pursuant to the Act and Article XIIID of the California Constitution (the “Article”).

# Dahms v. Downtown Pomona Property
On June 8, 2009, the Court of Appeals approved a benefit assessment for property in the downtown area of the City of Pomona in Dahms v. Downtown Pomona Property (“Dahms”). In Dahms the Court upheld an assessment that was 100% special benefit (i.e. 0% general benefit) on the rationale that the services and improvements funded by the assessments were directly provided to property in the assessment district. The Court also upheld discounts and exemptions from the assessment for certain properties.

# Bonander v. Town of Tiburon
On December 31, 2009, in Bonander v. Town of Tiburon (“Bonander”), the Court of Appeal overturned a benefit assessment approved by property owners to pay for placing overhead utility lines underground in an area of the Town of Tiburon. The Court invalidated the assessments primarily on the grounds that the assessments had been apportioned to assessed property based on the costs within sub-areas of the assessment district instead of the overall proportional special benefits.

# Beutz v. County of Riverside
On May 26, 2010 the Court of Appeal overturned an assessment for park maintenance in Wildomar, California, primarily because the general benefits associated with improving services were not explicitly calculated, quantified and separated from the special benefits.

# Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego
On September 22, 2011, the Court of Appeal issued a decision on the Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego appeal (“Greater Golden Hill”). This decision overturned an assessment for street and landscaping maintenance in the Greater Golden Hill neighborhood of San Diego, California. The court described two primary reasons for its decision. First, like in Beutz, the court found the general benefits associated with services were not explicitly calculated, quantified and separated from the special benefits. Second, the court found that the City had failed to record the basis for the calculation of the assessment amount on city-owned parcels.

# Compliance with Current Law
This Report is consistent with the SVTA decision and with the requirements of Article XIIIC and XIIID of the California Constitution because the Improvements to be funded are clearly defined; the benefiting property in the Assessment District enjoys close and unique proximity, access and views to the Improvements; the Improvements serve as an extension of usable land area for benefiting properties in the Assessment District and such special benefits provide a direct advantage to property in the Assessment District that is not enjoyed by the public at large or other property.

# Estimate of Cost – Fiscal Year 2024-25

The Act requires the Report to estimate the costs of the Improvements for the fiscal year, including estimates for the total costs for the Improvements for the year, the amount of any surplus or deficit to be carried over from a previous fiscal year, and the amount of funding contributions made from sources other than assessment revenue. After determining these amounts, the Report then must calculate the net amount to be assessed upon assessable lands within the District. The table below shows the proposed estimate of cost for fiscal year 2024-25:

![Notes to Estimate of Cost](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Notes+to+Estimate+of+Cost)

**Notes to Estimate of Cost:**

1. As determined in the following section, at least 5% of the cost of Improvements must be funded from sources other than the assessments to cover any general benefits from the Improvements. Therefore, out of the total cost of Improvements of $92,000, the District must contribute at least 5% or $4,600 from sources other than the assessments. The District will contribute $35,385 which is slightly over 38%, and more than covers any general benefits from the Improvements.

2. The Act requires that proceeds from the assessments must be deposited into a special fund that has been set up for the revenues and expenditures of the Assessment District. Moreover, funds raised by the assessment shall be used only for the purposes stated within this Report. Any balance remaining at the end of the fiscal year, July 1, must be carried over to the next fiscal year. The Park District may also establish a reserve fund for contingencies and special projects as well as a capital improvement fund for accumulating funds for larger capital improvement projects or capital renovation needs. Any remaining balance would either be placed in the reserve fund, the capital improvement fund, or would be used to reduce future years' assessments.

3. All assessments are rounded to lower even penny, so the budget amount may slightly differ from the assessment rate.

![Method of Apportionment](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Method+of+Apportionment)

# Method of Apportionment

This section of the Report includes an explanation of the benefits to be derived from the installation, maintenance and servicing of the Improvements throughout the Assessment District, and the methodology used to apportion the total assessment to land uses within the Assessment District.

The Assessment District consists of all Assessor Parcels within the boundaries of the Phoenix Field Landscape and Lighting Assessment District as defined by the Assessment Diagram shown in this report and the Assessor Parcel Numbers listed within the included levy roll. The parcels include all privately or publicly owned parcels within the boundaries. The method used for apportioning the total assessment is based upon the proportional special benefits to be derived by the properties in the Assessment District over and above general benefits conferred on real property or to the public at large. The apportionment of special benefit is a two-step process: the first step is to identify the types of special benefit arising from the improvements, and the second step is to allocate the assessments to property based on the estimated relative special benefit for each type of property.

## Discussion of Benefit

In summary, the assessments can only be levied based on the special benefit to property. This benefit is received by property over and above any general benefits. Moreover, such benefit is not based on any one property owner’s use of the Improvements or a property owner’s specific demographic status. With reference to the requirements for assessments, Section 22573 of the Act states:

"The net amount to be assessed upon lands within an assessment district may be apportioned by any formula or method which fairly distributes the net amount among all assessable lots or parcels in proportion to the estimated benefits to be received by each such lot or parcel from the improvements."

Proposition 218, as codified in Article XIIID of the California Constitution, has confirmed that assessments must be based on the special benefit to property and that the value of the special benefits must reasonably exceed the cost of the assessment:

"No assessment shall be imposed on any parcel which exceeds the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit conferred on that parcel."

The following benefit categories summarize the types of special benefit to residential and other lots and parcels resulting from the installation, maintenance and servicing of the Improvements to be provided with the assessment proceeds. These categories of special benefit are summarized as follows:

- Extension of a property’s outdoor areas and green spaces for properties within close proximity to the Improvements.
- Proximity and access to improved parks and recreational facilities.
- Improved views.

In this case, the recent SVTA decision provides enhanced clarity to the definitions of special benefits to properties in three distinct areas:

- Proximity
- Expanded or improved access
- Views

The SVTA decision also clarifies that a special benefit is a service or improvement that provides a direct advantage to a parcel and that indirect or derivative advantages resulting from the overall public benefits from a service or improvement are general benefits. The SVTA decision also provides specific guidance that park improvements are a direct advantage and special benefit to property that is proximate to a park that is improved by an assessment.

The characterization of a benefit may depend on whether the parcel receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g. proximity to a park) or receives an indirect, derivative advantage resulting from the overall public benefits of the improvement (e.g. general enhancement of the district’s property values).

Proximity, improved access and views, in addition to the other special benefits listed above further strengthen the basis of these assessments.

# Benefit Factors

The special benefits from the Improvements are further detailed below:

## Extension of a property’s outdoor areas and green spaces for properties within close proximity to the Improvements

In large part because it is cost prohibitive to provide large open land areas on property in the Assessment District, the residential and other benefiting properties in the Assessment District do not have large outdoor areas and green spaces. The park in the Assessment District provides these larger outdoor areas that serve as an effective extension of the land area for proximate properties because the Improvements are uniquely proximate and accessible to property in close proximity to the Improvements. The Improvements, therefore, provide an important, valuable and desirable extension of usable land area for the direct advantage and special benefit of properties with good and close proximity to the Improvements.

According to the industry-standard guidelines established by the National Park and Recreation Association (the “NPRA”), neighborhood parks in urban areas have a service area radius of generally one-half mile and community parks have a service area radius of approximately two miles. The service radii for neighborhood parks and neighborhood green spaces were specifically established to give all properties within this service radius close proximity and easy walking access to such public land areas. Since proximate and accessible parks serve as an extension of the usable land area for property in the service radii and since the service radii was specifically designed to provide close proximity and access, the parcels within this service area clearly receive a direct advantage and special benefit from the Improvements, and this advantage is not received by other properties or the public at large.

Moreover, Little Phoenix Park does not provide a restroom or parking lot. Such public amenities were specifically excluded from neighborhood parks because neighborhood parks are designed to be an extension of usable land area specifically for properties in close proximity, and not the public at large or other non-proximate property. The occupants of proximate property do not need to drive to their local park and can use their own restroom facilities because they can easily reach their local neighborhood park and can use their own restroom facilities as needed. This is further tangible evidence of the effective extension of land area provided by the Improvements to proximate parcels in the Assessment District and the unique direct advantage the proximate parcels receive from the Improvements.

An analysis of the service radii for the Improvements finds that all properties in the Assessment District enjoy the distinct and direct advantage of being close and proximate to Little Phoenix Park. The benefiting properties in the Assessment District therefore uniquely and specially benefit from the Improvements.

<!-- Page 375 -->
![Page 12](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Page+12)

**Proximity and access to improved parks and recreational facilities**  
Only the specific properties within close proximity to the Improvements are included in the Assessment District. Therefore, property in the Assessment District enjoys unique and valuable proximity and access to the Improvements that the public at large and property outside the Assessment District do not share.

In absence of the assessments, the Improvements would not be provided and the Little Phoenix Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District would be degraded due to insufficient funding for maintenance, upkeep and repair. Therefore, the assessments provide Improvements that are over and above what otherwise would be provided. Improvements that are over and above what otherwise would be provided do not by themselves translate into special benefits but when combined with the unique proximity and access enjoyed by parcels in the Assessment District, they provide a direct advantage and special benefit to property in the Assessment District.

Since the parcels in the Assessment District enjoy close access to the Improvements, they directly benefit from this unique close access to improved park and recreation areas that are provided by the Assessments. This is a direct advantage and special benefit to property in the Assessment District.

**Improved Views**  
The District, by maintaining the landscaping at Little Phoenix Park and the Enclave, swale site and landscape corridors provides improved views and open space buffers to properties in the Assessment District. The properties in the Assessment District enjoy close and unique proximity, access and views of the Improvements; therefore, the improved and protected views and open space buffers provided by the Assessments are another direct and tangible advantage that is uniquely conferred upon property in the Assessment District.

**General versus Special Benefit and Quantification of General Benefit**

In light of *Beutz v. County of Riverside* (2010) and *Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego* (2011), the District has reevaluated the Proposition 218 requirement regarding special and general benefits. Proposition 218 requires an assessing agency to separate the general benefits from the special benefits of a public improvement or service, estimate the quantity of each in relation to the other, and limit the assessment amount to the portion of the improvement or service costs attributable to the special benefits. The courts in Golden Hill and Beutz determined that there usually will be some general benefit associated with a parks improvement project and park-related services, because residents and others who don’t reside in the assessment district probably will use the parks at least to some degree. The separation and quantification of general and special benefits requires an apportionment of the cost of the service or improvement between the two benefit types, and assessing assessment district property owners only for the portion of the cost representing special benefits to the assessment district property. General benefits cannot be funded by assessment revenue. Rather, the funding must come from other sources. The District therefore has analyzed the quantity or extent to which the general public may reasonably be expected to use or benefit from the park and landscape areas, in relation to the quantity or extent to which residents of the assessment district use and benefit from the parks and landscape areas.

Although the park and landscape areas may be available to the general public at large, they have been specifically designed, located and created to provide additional and improved public resources for property inside the Assessment District, and not the public at large. Other properties that are outside the Assessment District do not enjoy the unique proximity, access, views, open space and other special benefit factors described previously. The Improvements are of special benefit to properties located within the Assessment District because they provide a direct advantage to properties in the Assessment District that would not be provided in absence of the assessments. The Assessment District allows the District to provide its park and recreation improvements to the Little Phoenix Park at a much higher level than what otherwise would be provided in absence of the Assessments. Moreover, in absence of the Assessments, no other agency would provide the Improvements nor would the District, because it does not have alternative available funds to provide the Improvements.

All of the Assessment proceeds derived from the Assessment District will be utilized to fund the cost of providing a level of tangible “special benefits” in the form of proximate parks, recreation facilities, landscaped corridors, project entrances, signs, walkways, parks, and other improvements and costs incidental to providing the Improvements and collecting the Assessments.

<!-- Page 377 -->
![Page 14](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+14)

Although these Improvements may be available to the general public at large, Little Phoenix Park and the other landscape and open space in the Assessment District were specifically designed, located and created to provide additional and improved public resources for the direct advantage of property inside the Assessment District, and not the public at large. Other properties that are outside the Assessment District do not enjoy the unique proximity, access, views and other special benefit factors described previously.

These Improvements are of special benefit to properties located within the Assessment District because they provide a direct advantage to properties in the Assessment District that would not be provided in absence of the Assessments. Without the Assessments, the Little Phoenix Park and other landscape and open space areas within the Assessment District might be closed and turned into brown, unmaintained and unusable lands. If this happened, it would create a significant and material negative impact on the desirability, utility and value of property in the Assessment District. If Assessments were not collected and the Little Phoenix Park and other areas were closed and not maintained as a result, properties in the Assessment District may decline in desirability, utility and value.

**Special Note Regarding General Benefit and the SVTA Decision:**

There is no widely-accepted or statutory formula for calculating general benefit. General benefits are benefits from improvements or services that are not special in nature, are not “particular and distinct” and are not “over and above” benefits received by other properties. SVTA decision provides some clarification by indicating that general benefits provide “an indirect, derivative advantage” and are not necessarily proximate to the improvements.

In the re-analysis of general benefit, the District determined that there are several attributes and features relating to the park and landscaped areas that discourage and limit use by persons who do not reside near the parks and landscape areas: there are no bathrooms; there are no parking lots; the areas are small; the areas are designed for passive use and short duration of use (e.g. less than one hour); there are no ball fields for organized sports teams and play; the areas are not located on major streets; the park is hard to find and not a destination park; and, the Enclave, swale and corridor areas are inaccessible and unusable areas. For similar reasons, these attributes and features make the park and landscape areas much more usable by those who reside within close walking distance.

![Page 15](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Page+15)

District staff persons over the years have observed the patterns of usage of Little Phoenix Parks and the persons who use that area. Based on these observations, the District has determined that the vast majority of the persons who use these areas reside in close proximity, that it is extremely rare for someone to drive to, park at and use these areas, and that it is extremely rare for someone to walk to these areas from outside the District. The vast majority of users reside in the Assessment District. However, there are some users who reside in the nearby areas to the west and east of the park, just outside the Assessment District. Based on these observations and the park/landscape area attributes and features that discourage and limit use by persons outside the Assessment District, the District has determined that approximately 5% of the persons who use Little Phoenix Park walk or drive to the area from outside the Assessment District.

Regarding the Enclave, swale and landscape areas shown on the assessment diagram, the areas are inaccessible and unusable. The areas provide open space and site view benefits for the property owner residents and property owners in the Assessment District. The areas also receive storm drainage runoff from Assessment District properties and therefore provide important storm drainage service to the Assessment District parcels. There are two small landscape corridor portions along Sunset Avenue and Madison Avenue. Driver and pedestrian passersby do enjoy some small benefit from the open space and view attributes of the adjacent landscape corridors along those streets. It is difficult to estimate and quantify this general benefit. The Sunset and Madison landscape corridors are small and thin, they are a small portion of the overall park and open space areas funded by the Assessment District and the benefits to passersby from the corridor areas are small relative to the open space, view and storm drainage benefits to Assessment District property owners and residents. In light of these factors, the District has determined that approximately 5% of the Enclave, swale and landscape areas benefit non-Assessment District passersby and constitute general benefit.

With 5% of Little Phoenix Park usage by non-Assessment District residents and 5% benefit from the Enclave, swale and landscape areas to non-Assessment District residents, the District next must determine the overall percentage of use and benefit attributable to the general benefit. It is difficult to calculate or reconcile the overall general benefit from these percentages; therefore, the District has determined that the most appropriate calculation is to average the two. In averaging the percentages, the District estimates and determines that the overall general benefit from the Improvements is 5%. The budget on page 6 shows that the amount and portion of District funding of the Improvement costs from sources other than assessment revenue exceeds 5%.

**SCI Consulting Group**
<!-- Page 379 -->
![Page 16](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+16)

The Assessment District’s total assessment budget for maintenance and improvement of the Little Phoenix Park, the Enclave, swale and landscape areas and corridors is $92,000. Of this total budget amount, the District will utilize $35,385 from sources other than the assessments for the Improvements. This payment by the District equates to approximately 38.4% of the total budget for the Improvements, which is greater than the amount attributable to the general benefits from the Improvements.

## Method of Assessment

After separating out the general benefits, the next step in apportioning assessments is to estimate the relative special benefit for each type of property. In other words, this step determines the proportion of the special benefit conferred on the various land uses within the boundaries of the Assessment District so that each parcel of land is assessed according to its land use. Each parcel of land is therefore assessed according to its level of special benefit received. As all of the parcels of land within the boundaries are designated as single family use, except for the Park itself and the perimeter landscape properties, all parcels are determined to be benefited equally and are assigned 1 SFE or Single Family Equivalence unit.

## Duration of Assessment

It is proposed that the Assessment be levied for fiscal year 1989-90 and continued every year thereafter, so long as the Little Phoenix Park and recreational areas need to be improved and maintained, and the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District requires funding from the Assessments for its continued Improvements in the Assessment District. As noted previously, the Assessment can continue to be levied annually after the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Board of Directors approves an annually updated Report, budget for the Assessment, Improvements to be provided, and other specifics of the Assessment. In addition, the District Board of Directors must hold an annual public hearing to continue the Assessment.

# RESOLUTION NO: 061924-07

## A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE FAIR OAKS RECREATION AND PARK DISTRICT

### DECLARING INTENTION TO CONTINUE TO LEVY ASSESSMENTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2024-25, PRELIMINARILY APPROVING ENGINEER'S REPORT, AND PROVIDING FOR NOTICE OF HEARING FOR THE GUM RANCH LANDSCAPING AND LIGHTING ASSESSMENT DISTRICT

RESOLVED, by the Board of the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District, (the “Board”), State of California, that:

1. On March 20, 2024, this Board adopted Resolution No. 032024-03, A Resolution Directing Preparation of an Engineer’s Report for the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting Assessment District (the "Assessment District"). Pursuant to this resolution, SCI Consulting Group, the Engineer of Work, prepared an Engineer's Report in accordance with Section 22565, et seq., of the Streets and Highway Code (the "Report") and Article XIIID of the California Constitution. The Report has been made, filed with the Clerk of the Board and duly considered by the Board and is hereby deemed sufficient and preliminarily approved. The Report shall stand as the Engineer's Report for all subsequent proceedings under and pursuant to the foregoing resolution.

2. It is the intention of this Board to levy and collect assessments within the Assessment District for fiscal year 2024-25.

3. Within the Assessment District, the existing and proposed improvements (the “Improvements”) are generally described as: the installation, maintenance and servicing of public facilities, including but not limited to, turf, ground cover, shrubs, and trees, landscaping, irrigation systems, drainage systems, fencing, trails, recreation facilities, lighting and all necessary appurtenances, and labor, materials, supplies, utilities and equipment, and incidental costs as applicable, for property within the Assessment District that is owned or maintained by the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District. Installation means the construction of improvements, including, but not limited to, land preparation, such as grading, leveling, cutting and filling, sod, landscaping, irrigation systems, sidewalks and drainage, lights, playground equipment, play courts, recreational facilities and public restrooms. “Maintenance” means the furnishing of services and materials for the ordinary and usual maintenance, operation and servicing of said improvements, including repair, removal, or replacement of all or part of any improvement; providing for the life, growth, health and beauty of landscaping, including cultivation, irrigation, trimming, spraying, fertilizing, or treating for disease or injury; the removal of trimmings, rubbish, debris, and other solid waste and the cleaning,
<!-- Page 386 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

1. **Sandblasting and Painting**: Sandblasting, and painting of walls and other improvements to remove or cover graffiti. “Servicing” means the furnishing of electric current or energy, gas, or other illuminating agent for any public lighting facilities or for the lighting or operation of any other improvements, or water for the irrigation of any landscaping, the operation of any fountains, or the maintenance of any other improvements.

2. **Assessment District**: The Assessment District consists of the lots and parcels shown on the boundary map on the Assessment District on file with the Clerk of the Board, and reference is hereby made to such map for further particulars.

3. **Report Reference**: Reference is hereby made to the Report for a full and detailed description of the Improvements, the boundaries of the Assessment District and the proposed assessments upon assessable lots and parcels of land within the Assessment District.

4. **Annual Adjustments**: The assessments are subject to an annual adjustment tied to the Consumer Price Index-U for the San Francisco Bay Area as of December of each succeeding year (the “CPI”), with a maximum annual adjustment not to exceed 3%. Any change in the CPI in excess of 3% shall be cumulatively reserved as the “Unused CPI” and shall be used to increase the maximum authorized assessment rates in years in which the CPI is less than 3%. The maximum authorized assessment rate is equal to the maximum assessment rate in the first fiscal year the assessment was levied adjusted annually by the minimum of 1) 3% or 2) the change in the CPI plus any Unused CPI as described above. The change in the CPI from December 2022 to December 2023 was 2.62% and the Unused CPI was 3.70%. Therefore, the maximum authorized assessment rate for fiscal year 202425 is increased by 3.00% which equates to $250.12 per single family equivalent benefit unit in Zone of Benefit A and is $419.92 in Zone of Benefit B. The estimate of cost and budget in this Engineer’s Report proposes assessments for fiscal year 2024-25 at the rate of $250.12 per Single Family Equivalent (SFE) in Zone of Benefit A and $419.92 in Zone of Benefit B, which is equal to the maximum authorized assessment rate.

5. **Public Hearing**: The Public Hearing shall be held before this Board at the Fair Oaks Water District, 10326 Fair Oaks Blvd. Fair Oaks, CA 95628 on July 17, 2024 at the hour of 6:00 p.m. for the purpose of allowing public testimony regarding the proposed assessments, for this Board’s determination whether the public interest, convenience and necessity require the improvements, and for the Board’s final action upon the Engineer’s Report and the continued assessments therein. Notice of the hearing shall be published in a local newspaper at least 10 days prior to the meeting.

# Introduction

## Overview

The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District (the “Park District”) is an independent special district established in 1945. The District provides park and recreation services to an area encompassing over 12,500 parcels. The District is governed by an elected five-member Board of Directors (the “Board”).

The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District, Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting Assessment District (the "Assessment District") provides funding for maintenance, servicing and improvements for a narrowly drawn area known as Gum Ranch. The purpose of the Assessment District is to maintain, service and improve Madison Place Park that covers an area of approximately 0.83 acres, located at 5524 Cannes Way as shown on the assessment diagram. The Assessment District will also provide the maintenance, servicing, and improvements of the Gum Ranch Park, which will cover an area of approximately 3.92 acres, generally located west of Kenneth Avenue and just south of Arcade Creek, after the developer conveys the completed Gum Ranch Park to the Park District.

## Assessment Formation

The formation of the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting Assessment District (the "Assessment District") within the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District was completed in 2006 for the purpose of providing funding for the maintenance and improvement of the landscaping, street lighting, and neighborhood park facilities to benefit the properties in the Gum Ranch subdivision that forms the Assessment District. The Gum Ranch subdivision is the combination of two original parcels (assessor parcel numbers 249-0020-004-0000 and 249-0020-005-0000) forming an inverted “L” shape, with an approximate area of 107 acres. The Gum Ranch subdivision is located in Fair Oaks at the northwest intersection of Kenneth Avenue and Madison Avenue.

# Assessment Continuation

In each subsequent year for which the assessments will be levied, the Board must direct the preparation of an Engineer's Report, budgets and proposed assessments for the upcoming fiscal year. After the Engineer's Report is completed, the Board may preliminarily approve the Engineer's Report and proposed assessments and establish the date for a public hearing on the continuation of the assessments. This Report for Fiscal Year 2024-25 was prepared pursuant to the direction of the Board adopted on March 20, 2024 (Resolution No. 032024-03). If the Board approves this Engineer's Report and the proposed assessments by resolution, a notice of assessment levies must be published in a local paper at least 10 days prior to the date of the public hearing. The resolution preliminarily approving the Engineer's Report and establishing the date for a public hearing is used for this notice.

Following the minimum 10-day time period after publishing the notice, a public hearing is held for the purpose of allowing public testimony about the proposed continuation of the assessments. This hearing is currently scheduled for July 17, 2024. At this hearing, the Board would consider approval of a resolution confirming the assessments for fiscal year 2024-25. If so confirmed and approved, the assessments would be submitted to the County Auditor/Controller for inclusion on the property tax rolls for Fiscal Year 2024-25.

# Legal Analysis

## Proposition 218

This assessment is formed consistent with Proposition 218, The Right to Vote on Taxes Act, which was approved by the voters of California on November 6, 1996, and is now codified as Articles XIIIC and XIIID of the California Constitution. Proposition 218 provides for benefit assessments to be levied to fund the cost of providing services, improvements, as well as maintenance and operation expenses to a public improvement which specially benefits the assessed property.

Proposition 218 describes a number of important requirements, including property-owner balloting, for the imposition, increase and extension of assessments, and these requirements are satisfied by the process used to establish this assessment.

# Silicon Valley Taxpayers Association, Inc. v Santa Clara County Open Space Authority
In July of 2008, the California Supreme Court issued its ruling on the Silicon Valley Taxpayers Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority (“SVTA”). This ruling is the most significant legal document in further legally clarifying Proposition 218. Several of the most important elements of the ruling included further emphasis that:
- Benefit assessments are for special, not general, benefit
- The services and/or improvements funded by assessments must be clearly defined
- Special benefits are directly received by and provide a direct advantage to property in the Assessment District
- The assessment paid by property should be proportional to the special benefits it receives from the Improvements

## Dahms v. Downtown Pomona Property
On June 8, 2009, the Court of Appeals approved a benefit assessment for property in the downtown area of the City of Pomona in Dahms v. Downtown Pomona Property (“Dahms”). In Dahms the Court upheld an assessment that was 100% special benefit (i.e. 0% general benefit) because the nature of the services and improvements funded by the assessments were directly provided to property in the assessment district. The Court also upheld discounts and exemptions from the assessment for certain properties.

## Bonander v. Town of Tiburon
On December 31, 2009, in Bonander v. Town of Tiburon (“Bonander”), the Court of Appeal overturned a benefit assessment approved by property owners to pay for placing overhead utility lines underground in an area of the Town of Tiburon. The Court invalidated the assessments primarily on the grounds that the assessments had been apportioned to assessed property based on the costs within sub-areas of the assessment district instead of the overall proportional special benefits.

## Beutz v. County of Riverside
On May 26, 2010 the Court of Appeal overturned an assessment for park maintenance in Wildomar, California, primarily because the general benefits associated with improvements and services were not explicitly calculated, quantified and separated from the special benefits.

**Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego**

On September 22, 2011, the Court of Appeal issued a decision on the Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego appeal (“Greater Golden Hill”). This decision overturned an assessment for street and landscaping maintenance in the Greater Golden Hill neighborhood of San Diego, California. The court described two primary reasons for its decision. First, like in Beutz, the court found the general benefits associated with services were not explicitly calculated, quantified and separated from the special benefits. Second, the court found that the City had failed to record the basis for the calculation of the assessment amount on city-owned parcels.

**Compliance with Current Law**

This Report is consistent with the SVTA decision and with the requirements of Article XIIIC and XIIID of the California Constitution because the Improvements to be funded are clearly defined; the benefiting property in the Assessment District enjoys close and unique proximity, access and views to the Improvements; the Improvements serve as an extension of usable land area for benefiting properties in the Assessment District and such special benefits provide a direct advantage to property in the Assessment District that is not enjoyed by the public at large or other property.

This Report is consistent with Beutz, Dahms and Greater Golden Hill because the Improvements will directly benefit property in the Assessment District and the general benefits have been excluded from the Assessments. The Report is consistent with Bonander because the Assessments have been apportioned based on the overall proportional special benefit to each property.

1. As determined in the following section, at least 5% of the cost of Improvements must be funded from sources other than the assessments to cover any general benefits from the Improvements. Therefore, out of the total cost of Improvements for the entire Gum Ranch area of $74,651, the District must contribute at least 5% or $3,733 from sources other than the assessments. The District will actually contribute $3,805, which is over that amount, and covers any general benefits from the Improvements. The costs for the Zone of Benefit B area for the installation, maintenance, servicing and improvements of park facilities is $34,734 and the District must contribute at least $1,737. The district will contribute $1,750, which is more than the required amount of 5%

2. The Act requires that proceeds from the assessments must be deposited into a special fund that has been set up for the revenues and expenditures of the Assessment District. Moreover, funds raised by the assessment shall be used only for the purposes stated within this Report. Any balance remaining at the end of the fiscal year, July 1, must be carried over to the next fiscal year. The Park District may also establish a reserve fund for contingencies and special projects as well as a capital improvement fund for accumulating funds for larger capital improvement projects or capital renovation needs. Any remaining balance would either be placed in the reserve fund, the capital improvement fund, or would be used to reduce future years' assessments.

3. All assessments are rounded to lower even penny, so the budget amount may slightly differ from the assessment rate.

![Method of Apportionment](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Method+of+Apportionment)

# Method of Apportionment

## Method of Apportionment

This section of the Engineer's Report includes an explanation of the benefits to be derived from the installation, maintenance and servicing of the park, and the methodology used to apportion the total assessment to properties within the Assessment District.

The Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting Assessment District consists of all Assessor Parcels within the boundaries as defined by the Assessment Diagram included within this Report and the Assessor Parcel Numbers listed within the included Assessment Roll. The method used for apportioning the assessments is based upon the proportional special benefits to be derived by the properties in the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting Assessment District over and above general benefits conferred on real property or to the public at large. The apportionment of special benefit is a two-step process: the first step is to identify the types of special benefit arising from the Improvements, and the second step is to allocate the assessments to property based on the estimated relative special benefit for each type of property.

## Discussion of Benefit

In summary, the assessments can only be levied based on the special benefit to property. This benefit is received by property over and above any general benefits. Moreover, such benefit is not based on any one property owner’s use of the Improvements or a property owner’s specific demographic status. With reference to the requirements for assessments, Section 22573 of the Act states:

"The net amount to be assessed upon lands within an assessment district may be apportioned by any formula or method which fairly distributes the net amount among all assessable lots or parcels in proportion to the estimated benefits to be received by each such lot or parcel from the improvements."

Proposition 218, as codified in Article XIIID of the California Constitution, has confirmed that assessments must be based on the special benefit to property and that the value of the special benefits must reasonably exceed the cost of the assessment:

"No assessment shall be imposed on any parcel which exceeds the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit conferred on that parcel."

<!-- Page 405 -->
![Page 13](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+13)

The following benefit categories summarize the types of special benefit to residential and other lots and parcels resulting from the installation, maintenance and servicing of the Improvements to be provided with the assessment proceeds. These categories of special benefit are summarized as follows:

- Extension of a property’s outdoor areas and green spaces for properties within close proximity to the Improvements.
- Proximity and access to improved parks and recreational facilities.
- Improved views.

In this case, the recent SVTA decision provides enhanced clarity to the definitions of special benefits to properties in three distinct areas:

- Proximity
- Expanded or improved access
- Views

The SVTA decision also clarifies that a special benefit is a service or improvement that provides a direct advantage to a parcel and that indirect or derivative advantages resulting from the overall public benefits from a service or improvement are general benefits. The SVTA decision also provides specific guidance that park improvements are a direct advantage and special benefit to property that is proximate to a park that is improved by an assessment.

The characterization of a benefit may depend on whether the parcel receives a direct advantage from the improvement (e.g. proximity to a park) or receives an indirect, derivative advantage resulting from the overall public benefits of the improvement (e.g. general enhancement of the district’s property values).

Proximity, improved access and views, in addition to the other special benefits listed above further strengthen the basis of these assessments.

**Benefit Factors**

The special benefits from the Improvements are further detailed below:

**Extension of a property’s outdoor areas and green spaces for properties within close proximity to the Improvements**

In large part because it is cost prohibitive to provide large open land areas on property in the Assessment District, the residential and other benefiting properties in the Assessment District do not have large outdoor areas and green spaces. The park in the Assessment District provides these larger outdoor areas that serve as an effective extension of the land area for proximate properties because the Improvements are uniquely proximate and accessible to property in close proximity to the Improvements. The Improvements, therefore, provide an important, valuable and desirable extension of usable land area for the direct advantage and special benefit of properties with good and close proximity to the Improvements.

According to the industry-standard guidelines established by the National Park and Recreation Association (the “NPRA”), neighborhood parks in urban areas have a service area radius of generally one-half mile and community parks have a service area radius of approximately two miles. The service radii for neighborhood parks and neighborhood green spaces were specifically established to give all properties within this service radius close proximity and easy walking access to such public land areas. Since proximate and accessible parks serve as an extension of the usable land area for property in the service radius and since the service radii was specifically designed to provide close proximity and access, the parcels within this service area clearly receive a direct advantage and special benefit from the Improvements - and this advantage is not received by other properties or the public at large.

Moreover, the Madison Place Park site does not provide a restroom or parking lot. Such public amenities were specifically excluded from neighborhood parks because neighborhood parks are designed to be an extension of usable land area specifically for properties in close proximity, and not the public at large or other non-proximate property. The occupants of proximate property do not need to drive to their local park and do not need restroom facilities because they can easily reach their local neighborhood park and can use their own restroom facilities as needed. This is further tangible evidence of the effective extension of land area provided by the Improvements to proximate parcels in the Assessment District and the unique direct advantage the proximate parcels receive from the Improvements.

An analysis of the service radii for the Improvements finds that all properties in the Assessment District enjoy the distinct and direct advantage of being close and proximate to Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District. The benefiting properties in the Assessment District therefore uniquely and specially benefit from the Improvements.

**Proximity and access to improved parks and recreational facilities**

Only the specific properties within close proximity to the Improvements are included in the Assessment District. Therefore, property in the Assessment District enjoys unique and valuable proximity and access to the Improvements that the public at large and property outside the Assessment District do not share.

In absence of the assessments, the Improvements would not be provided and the Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District would be degraded due to insufficient funding for maintenance, upkeep and repair. Therefore, the assessments provide Improvements that are over and above what otherwise would be provided. Improvements that are over and above what otherwise would be provided do not by themselves translate into special benefits but when combined with the unique proximity and access enjoyed by parcels in the Assessment District, they provide a direct advantage and special benefit to property in the Assessment District.

Since the parcels in the Assessment District enjoy close access to the Improvements, they directly benefit from this unique close access to improved park and recreation areas that are provided by the Assessments. This is a direct advantage and special benefit to property in the Assessment District.

**Improved Views**

The District, by maintaining and improving the landscaping at the Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District, provides improved views to properties in the Assessment District. The properties in the Assessment District receive this direct advantage because they enjoy close and unique proximity, access, and views of the Improvements. Therefore, the improved and protected views provided by the Assessments are another direct and tangible advantage that is uniquely conferred upon property in the Assessment District.

**General versus Special Benefit and Quantification of General Benefit**

The proceeds from the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting Assessment District will be used to fund improvements and increased levels of maintenance to the park and recreation area and facilities proximate to the properties in the Assessment District. In absence of the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting Assessment District, such Improvements would not be provided and the properties would not be subdivided and improved with residential homes. Therefore, the Assessment District is specifically proposed to provide additional and improved public resources in the Assessment District. The assessments will ensure that parks and recreation areas within and adjacent to the Assessment District are well maintained, clean and safe. Moreover, in absence of the assessments, a condition of development would not be met and the subdivision likely would not be approved. The creation of residential lots and the approval for the construction of homes in Gum Ranch is the overriding clear and distinct special benefit conferred exclusively on property in the Assessment District and not enjoyed by other properties outside the Assessment District.

However, in light of **Beutz v. County of Riverside** (2010) and **Golden Hill Neighborhood Association v. City of San Diego** (2011), the District has reevaluated the Proposition 218 requirement regarding special and general benefits. Proposition 218 requires an assessing agency to separate the general benefits from the special benefits of a public improvement or service, estimate the quantity of each in relation to the other, and limit the assessment amount to the portion of the improvement or service costs attributable to the special benefits. The courts in Golden Hill and Beutz determined that there usually will be some general benefit associated with a parks improvement project and park-related services, because residents and others who don’t reside in the assessment district probably will use the parks at least to some degree. The separation and quantification of general and special benefits requires an apportionment of the cost of the service or improvement between the two benefit types, and assessing assessment district property owners only for the portion of the cost representing special benefits to the assessment district property. General benefits cannot be funded by assessment revenue. Rather, the funding must come from other sources. The District therefore has analyzed the quantity or extent to which the general public may reasonably be expected to use or benefit from the park and recreation area, in relation to the quantity or extent to which residents of the assessment district use and benefit from the park and recreation area.

Although the park and recreation area may be available to the general public at large, they have been specifically designed, located and created to provide additional and improved public resources for property inside the Assessment District, and not the public at large. Other properties that are outside the Assessment District do not enjoy the unique proximity, access, views, open space and other special benefit factors described previously. The Improvements are of special benefit to properties located within the Assessment District because they provide a direct advantage to properties in the Assessment District that would not be provided in absence of the assessments. The Assessment District allows the District to provide its park and recreation Improvements to the Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District at a much higher level than what otherwise would be provided in absence of the Assessments. Moreover, in absence of the Assessments, no other agency would provide the Improvements nor would the District, because it does not have alternative available funds to provide the Improvements.

All of the Assessment proceeds derived from the Assessment District will be utilized to fund the cost of providing a level of tangible “special benefits” in the form of proximate parks, recreation facilities, signs, and other improvements and costs incidental to providing the Improvements and collecting the Assessments.

Although these Improvements may be available to the general public at large, the Madison Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District were specifically designed, located and created to provide additional and improved public resources for the direct advantage of property inside the Assessment District, and not the public at large. Other properties that are outside the Assessment District do not enjoy the unique proximity, access, views and other special benefit factors described previously.

These Improvements are of special benefit to properties located within the Assessment District because they provide a direct advantage to properties in the Assessment District that would not be provided in absence of the Assessments. Without the Assessments, the Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District might be closed and turn into brown, unmaintained and unusable lands. If this happened, it would create a significant and material negative impact on the desirability, utility and value of property in the Assessment District. If Assessments were not collected, and the Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District were closed and not maintained as a result, properties in the Assessment District may decline in desirability, utility and value.

Special Note Regarding General Benefit and the SVTA Decision:

There is no widely-accepted or statutory formula for calculating general benefit. General benefits are benefits from improvements or services that are not special in nature, are not “particular and distinct” and are not “over and above” benefits received by other properties. SVTA decision provides some clarification by indicating that general benefits

provide “an indirect, derivative advantage” and are not necessarily proximate to the improvements.

In the re-analysis of general benefit, the District determined that there are several attributes and features relating to the park and landscaped area that discourage and limit use by persons who do not reside near the park and landscape area: there are no bathrooms, there are no parking lots, the area is small, the area is designed for passive use and short duration of use (e.g. less than one hour), there are no ball fields for organized sports teams and play, the area is not located on major streets, and the park is hard to find and not a destination park. For similar reasons, these attributes and features make the park much more usable by those who reside within close walking distance.

District staff persons over the years have observed the patterns of usage of similar facilities within the Park District (i.e., Little Phoenix Park) and the persons who use those facilities. Based on these observations, the District has determined that the vast majority of the persons who use this area reside in close proximity, that it is extremely rare for someone to drive to, park at and use this area, and that it is extremely rare for someone to walk to this area from outside the District. The vast majority of users reside in the Assessment District. However, there might be some users who reside in the nearby areas to the south and east of the park, just outside the Assessment District. Based on these observations and the park/landscape area attributes and features that discourage and limit use by persons outside the Assessment District, the District has determined that approximately 5% of the persons who would use the Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District would walk or drive to the area from outside the Assessment District.

With 5% of the Madison Place Park and recreation areas in the Assessment District usage by non-Assessment District residents, the District estimates and determines that the overall general benefit from the Improvements is 5%. The budget in this report shows that the amount and portion of District funding of the Improvement costs from sources other than assessment revenue exceeds 5%.

The Assessment District’s total assessment budget for the entire Gum Ranch area for the installation, maintenance, servicing and improvements of park facilities is $74,651. Of this total budget amount, the District will utilize $3,805 from sources other than the assessments for the Improvements. This payment by the District equates to over 5% of the total budget for the Improvements, and constitutes more than the amount attributable to the general benefits from the Improvements.

![Page 19](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Page+19)

The Assessment District’s total assessment budget for the Zone of Benefit B area for the installation, maintenance, servicing and improvements of park facilities is $34,734. Of this total budget amount, the District will utilize $1750 from sources other than the assessments for the Improvements. This payment by the District equates to over 5% of the total budget for the Improvements, and constitutes more than the amount attributable to the general benefits from the Improvements.

## Zones of Benefit

The boundaries of the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District have been carefully drawn to only include the properties in the Park District that are proximate to the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District Improvements and that would materially benefit from the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District Improvements. Certain other properties surrounding and outside the Assessment District were excluded from the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District Improvement area because these properties are generally less proximate to the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District Improvements and/or they do not enjoy the same access, due to roads that don’t go through and/or fences, as described earlier in this Report and in prior Assessment District Engineer’s Reports. In other words, the boundaries of the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District Assessment District have been narrowly drawn to include only properties that will specially benefit from the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District Improvements, and would receive a declining level of service if the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District Assessments were not approved.

In order to add a New Service Area to the northern portion of the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District, the Park District evaluated the scope and area of special benefit from the New Service Area. Through this evaluation, the Park District determined that the northern parcels in the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District receive special benefit from the New Service Area that the parcels in the southern portion of the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District do not receive. Therefore, it was necessary to add a new Zone of Benefit to the existing Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting District. This new Zone of Benefit, consisting of the northern parcels which receive additional special benefit from the New Service Area, is designated as Zone of Benefit B. The southern parcels, in order to distinguish them from the parcels in the new Zone of Benefit, are designated as Zone of Benefit A.

In Zone of Benefit B, the advantage that each parcel receives from the Improvements is direct, and the boundaries are narrowly drawn to include only parcels that benefit from the Assessment. The benefits from the Improvements within Zone of Benefit B do not vary based on proximity of the parcels to the Improvements because the increased benefits of greater proximity to the Improvements are generally offset by a parallel increase in negative factors such as higher levels of maintenance vehicles, noise, etc. that comes with increased proximity.

**Engineer’s Report, Fiscal Year 2024-25**
<!-- Page 412 -->
![Page 20](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Page+20)

Because the special benefits from the New Service Area are uniquely enjoyed by the properties in Zone of Benefit B, the Park District has determined that those parcels should pay for the special benefits derived from the proposed increased Assessments, and the parcels in Zone of Benefit A should not. Therefore, the assessable parcels in Zone of Benefit B were mailed a ballot for the proposed increased Assessments, and the parcels in Zone of Benefit A were not.

## Method of Assessment

As previously discussed, the Assessments provide comprehensive Improvements that clearly confer special benefits to properties in the Assessment District. The allocation of special benefits to property is partially based on the type of property and the size of property. These benefits can also partially be measured by the occupants on property in the Assessment District because such parcel population density is a measure of the relative benefit a parcel receives from the Improvements. It should be noted that many other types of “traditional” assessments also use parcel population densities to apportion the assessments. For example, the assessments for sewer systems, roads and water systems are typically allocated based on the population density of the parcels assessed. Therefore, the apportionment of benefit is reasonably based on the type of parcel, the size of parcels and the population density of parcels.

The next step in apportioning assessments is to determine the relative special benefit for each property. This process involves determining the relative benefit received by each property in relation to a single family home, or in other words, on the basis of Single Family Equivalents (SFE). This SFE methodology is commonly used to distribute assessments in proportion to estimated special benefit and is generally recognized as providing the basis for a fair and appropriate distribution of assessments. For the purposes of this Engineer’s Report, all properties are designated a SFE value, which is each property’s relative benefit in relation to a single family home on one parcel. In this case, the “benchmark” property is the single family detached dwelling which is one Single Family Equivalent or one SFE.

In the process of determining the appropriate method of assessment, the Engineer considered various alternatives. For example, an assessment only for all residential improved property was considered but was determined to be inappropriate because commercial, industrial and other properties also receive direct benefits from the Improvements.

Moreover, a fixed or flat assessment is proposed for all single family residential properties regardless of use or parcel size. Assessments on multifamily residential parcels vary based on the number of dwelling units. Assessments on commercial and industrial property are levied on an acreage basis because larger properties generally support larger buildings and have higher numbers of employees, customers and guests who would benefit from proximity and improved access to well-maintained and improved parks and recreational facilities.

<!-- Page 413 -->
![Page 21](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Page+21)

Finally, the special benefits to be derived from the Assessments are conferred on property and are not based on a specific property owner’s use of the improvements, or a specific property owner’s occupancy of property, or the property owner’s demographic status such as age or number of dependents. However, it is ultimately people who value the special benefits described above and use and enjoy the Assessment District’s park and recreational facilities. In other words, the benefits derived to property are related to the average number of people who could potentially live on, work at, or otherwise could use a property, not how the property is currently used by the present owner. Therefore, the number of people who could or potentially live on, work at or otherwise use a property is one indicator of the relative level of benefit received by a property.

In conclusion, the Assessment Engineer determined that the appropriate method of assessment apportionment should be based on the type and use of property, the relative size of the property, property location, its relative population and usage potential, and its proximity to parks and recreational facilities. This method is further described below.

## Residential Properties

Certain residential properties in the proposed Assessment District that contain a single residential dwelling unit are assigned one Single Family Equivalent or 1.0 SFE. Traditional houses, zero-lot line houses, and town homes are included in this category of single family residential property.

Properties with more than one residential unit are designated as multi-family residential properties. These properties benefit from the improvements in proportion to the number of dwelling units that occupy each property, and the average number of people who reside in multi-family residential units versus the average number of people who reside in a single family home. The population density factors for the Park District, as depicted below, provide the basis for determining the SFE factors for residential properties. Using the total population in a certain property type in the area of the Assessment District from the 1990 Census (the most recent data available when this Assessment was established) and dividing it by the total number of households, finds that approximately 2.86 persons occupy each single-family residence, whereas an average of 1.91 persons occupy each multi-family residence. Using the ratio of one SFE for each single-family residence, which equates to one SFE for every 2.86 persons, 0.67 SFE would equate to one multi-family unit or 0.67 SFE for every 1.91 residents. Likewise, each condominium unit receives 0.73 SFE, each duplex, triplex, fourplex receives 0.67 SFE, and each mobile home receives 0.68 SFE.

![Figure 2 – Residential Density and Assessment Factors](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768)

| Total Population | Occupied Households | Persons per Household | SFE Factor |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------|
| Single Family Residential | 20,786 | 7,280 | 2.86 | 1.00 |
| Condominium | 1,456 | 700 | 2.08 | 0.73 |
| Multi-Family Residential | 4,239 | 2,215 | 1.91 | 0.67 |
| Mobile Home on Separate Lot | 27 | 14 | 1.93 | 0.68 |

Source: 1990 Census, Community of Fair Oaks.

The single-family equivalency factor of 0.67 per dwelling unit for multifamily residential properties applies to such properties with 20 or fewer units. Properties in excess of 20 units typically offer on-site recreational amenities and other facilities that tend to offset some of the benefits provided by the improvements. Therefore, the benefit for properties in excess of 20 units is determined to be 0.67 SFE per unit for the first 20 units and 0.10 SFE per each additional unit in excess of 20 dwelling units.

**Commercial/Industrial Properties**

SFE values for commercial and industrial land uses are based on the equivalence of special benefit on a land area basis between single family residential property and commercial property. The SFE values for other types of business and industrial lands are established by using average employee densities because the special benefit factors described previously can be measured by the average number of people who work at commercial/industrial properties.

In order to determine employee density factors, the findings from the San Diego Association of Governments Traffic Generators Study (the “SANDAG Study”) are used because these findings were approved by the State Legislature for use in justifying commercial and industrial school facilities fees, and are considered to be a good representation of the average number of employees per acre of land area for commercial and industrial properties. As determined by the SANDAG Study, the average number of employees per acre for commercial property is 24.

In comparison, the average number of people residing in a single-family home in the area is 2.86. Since the average lot size for a single-family home in Fair Oaks is approximately 0.30 acres, the average number of residents per acre of residential property is 9.53.

<!-- Page 415 -->
![Page 23](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+23)

The employee density per acre is generally 2.50 times the population density of single-family residential property per acre (24 employees per acre / 9.53 residents per acre). Therefore, the average employee density can be used as the basis for allocating benefit to commercial or industrial property since a property with 2.50 employees receives generally similar special benefit to a residential property with 1 resident. This factor of equivalence of benefit between 1 resident to 2.50 employees is the basis for allocating commercial/industrial benefit. The following Figure shows the average employees per acre of land area or portion thereof for commercial and industrial properties, and lists the relative SFE factors per quarter acre for properties in each land use category.

Commercial and industrial properties in excess of 5 acres generally involve uses that are more land intensive relative to building areas and number of employees (lower coverage ratios). As a result, the benefit factors for commercial and industrial property land area in excess of 5 acres is determined to be the SFE rate per quarter acre for the first 5 acres and the relevant SFE rate per each additional acre over 5 acres.

Institutional properties that are used for residential, commercial or industrial purposes are also assessed at the appropriate residential, commercial, or industrial rate.

## Vacant Properties

The benefit to vacant properties is determined to be proportional to the corresponding benefits for similar type developed properties; however, at a lower rate due to the lack of improvements on the property. A measure of the benefits accruing to the underlying land is the average value of land in relation to improvements for developed property. As a general average, appraisers often use a factor of 25% to 30% of developed property value as land value. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that approximately 25% of the benefits are related to the underlying land and 75% are related to the Improvements and the day-to-day use of the property. Using this ratio, the SFE factor for vacant parcels is 0.25 per parcel.

As properties are approved for development, their value also increases. Likewise, the special benefit received by vacant property increases as the property is approved for development, or becomes closer to being improved. When property is approved for development with a final map, the property has passed the final significant hurdle to development and can shortly undergo construction. Since the property is nearing the point of development, its special benefits increase. In addition, these properties are generally sold soon after completion of improvements, so the properties receive the additional benefit of desirability from prospective buyers due to the special benefits provided by proximity to improved parks and recreational facilities of the Park District. It is therefore determined that property with final map approval receives 50% of the relative benefit to improved property of similar use-type.

## Other Properties

All properties that are specially benefited are assessed. Other publicly owned property that is used for purposes similar to private residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional uses is benefited and assessed at the same rate as such privately owned property.

Miscellaneous, small and other parcels such as roads, right-of-way parcels, and common areas typically do not generate significant numbers of employees, residents, customers, or guests and have limited economic value. These miscellaneous parcels receive no benefit from the Improvements and are assessed an SFE benefit factor of 0.

## Annual Cost Indexing

It should be noted that the maximum assessment rate within the Assessment District may increase in future years based on the annual change in the Northern California (San Francisco Bay Area) Consumer Price Index (the “CPI”), with a maximum annual adjustment not to exceed 3%. In the event that the annual change in the CPI exceeds 3%, any percentage change in excess of 3% can be cumulatively reserved and can be added to the annual change in the CPI for years in which the CPI change is less than 3%.

![Page 25](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+25)

**Duration of Assessment**

It is proposed that the Assessment be levied for fiscal year 2006-07 and continued every year thereafter, so long as the Gum Ranch parks and recreational areas need to be improved and maintained, and the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District requires funding from the Assessments for its continued Improvements in the Assessment District. As noted previously, the Assessment can continue to be levied annually after the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Board of Directors approves an annually updated Report, budget for the Assessment, Improvements to be provided, and other specifics of the Assessment. In addition, the District Board of Directors must hold an annual public hearing to continue the Assessment. It must be noted that although the Assessment District was formed in 2006, the assessments were not levied each year as a result of the downturn of the economy, which impeded the construction of homes or recreational facilities in the Gum Ranch development.

**Appeals and Interpretation**

Any property owner who feels that the assessment levied on the subject property is in error as a result of incorrect information being used to apply the foregoing method of assessment, may file a written appeal with the Park District Administrator or his or her designee. Any such appeal is limited to correction of an assessment during the then current or, if before July 1, the upcoming fiscal year. Upon the filing of any such appeal, the Park District Administrator or his or her designee will promptly review the appeal and any information provided by the property owner. If the Park District Administrator or his or her designee finds that the assessment should be modified, the appropriate changes shall be made to the assessment roll. If any such changes are approved after the assessment roll has been filed with the County for collection, the Park District Administrator or his or her designee is authorized to refund to the property owner the amount of any approved reduction. Any property owner who disagrees with the decision of the Park District Administrator or her or his designee may refer their appeal to the Board of Directors of the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District and the decision of the Board of Directors of the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District shall be final.

**Assessment**

The assessments are made upon the parcels or lots of land within the Gum Ranch Landscaping and Lighting Assessment District in proportion to the special benefits to be received by the parcels or lots of land, from said Improvements.

The assessments are subject to an annual adjustment tied to the Consumer Price Index for the San Francisco Bay Area as of December of each succeeding year, with the maximum annual adjustment not to exceed 3%. In the event that the annual change in the CPI exceeds 3%, any percentage change in excess of 3% can be cumulatively reserved and can be added to the annual change in the CPI for years in which the CPI change is less than 3%.

The change in the CPI from December 2022 to December 2023 was 2.62% and the Unused CPI carried forward from the previous fiscal year is 3.70%. Therefore, the maximum authorized assessment rate for fiscal year 2024-25 is increased by 3.00% which equates to $250.12 per single family equivalent benefit unit for Zone of Benefit A and $419.92 for Zone of Benefit B. The estimate of cost and budget in this Report proposes assessments for fiscal year 2024-25 at the rate of $250.12 in Zone of Benefit A and $419.92 in Zone of Benefit B, which is equal to the maximum authorized assessment rate for each Zone of Benefit.

Each parcel or lot of land is described in the Assessment Roll by reference to its parcel number as shown on the Assessor's Maps of the County of Sacramento for the fiscal year 2024-25. For a more particular description of said property, reference is hereby made to the deeds and maps on file and of record in the office of the County Recorder of said County.

**Meeting Date:** June 26, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Cost Share Agreement with Fair Oaks Water District for California Avenue Work  

I. **Recommendation**  
Approve Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District’s cost share amount of $53,353 with the Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) for the waterline work completed on California Avenue, ensuring equitable distribution of expenses incurred during the project.  

II. **Background**  
In July of 2021, the FORPD Board of Directors and the FOWD Board of Directors reached an agreement (Attachment A) to relocate public water facilities impacted by planned improvements to the Village/Plaza Park area. In accordance with direction from the two Boards, FORPD staff collaborated with FOWD staff to develop a formal agreement for the required public water improvements.  

The agreement for the work had a not to exceed amount of $260,000 which was the responsibility of FOWD. In exchange for this cost, the FOWD was to receive from FORPD a future water well site in a yet to be determined site in the Phoenix Park area as detailed in the agreement.  

This project involved significant work, including the installation of new water lines, road resurfacing, and related enhancements, which benefit both the community and FORPD’s facilities. The collaboration aimed to optimize resource use, minimize disruption, and ensure a high standard of completion.
<!-- Page 428 -->
### III. Problem /Situation / Request
The completion of the California Avenue waterline project has resulted in substantial additional costs beyond the $260,000 cost that need to be distributed between FORPD and FOWD. The project’s additional cost, including labor, materials, and ancillary expenses, amounts to $106,706 (Attachment B).

It was apparent that the scope needed to expand to benefit both FORPD and FOWD. This expansion resulted in the additional cost of $106,706 for the completion of the public water infrastructure installed alongside the FORPD project. FOWD had invoiced FORPD for the additional work. FORPD staff rejected FOWD’s request for the final payment of $106,706 due to the work occurring outside of the scope of the original agreement.

On June 6, 2024, District Administrator Mike Aho, FORPD Board President Ralph Carhart, and Dave Fuki of ICS met with FOWD staff to discuss the options for the additional $106,706. During this meeting, it was suggested that the additional cost be shared 50-50 between both agencies. FORPD's portion of the cost if approved is $53,353, while FOWD will cover the remaining $53,353. This equitable distribution ensures both entities pay a fair share relative to their use and benefit from the improvements.

To maintain successful collaboration for the community of Fair Oaks, FORPD staff is recommending that the FORPD Board approve splitting the outstanding $106,706 equally between FOWD and FORPD. This cost share will also help maintain positive inter-district relationships and foster future collaborations.

### IV. Financial Analysis
The proposed cost sharing formula results in FORPD covering $53,353 of the expenses. This allocation is based on the direct benefits received by the park district facilities and the community at large from the improved infrastructure. The financial impact on FORPD will be covered by Measure J Funds.

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

THIS AGREEMENT is entered into between Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District, a local government agency (“Park District”), and Fair Oaks Water District, a local government agency (“Water District”). This Agreement will become effective on the date that it is signed by the last party to sign as indicated by the date associated with that party’s signature below. The parties agree as follows:

1. Recitals. The parties enter into this Agreement with reference to the following background recitals:

1.1. Park District owns the Village Park and Plaza Park in the Fair Oaks Village, located in Sacramento County, CA - including the Community Clubhouse located north of the intersection of California Avenue and Temescal Street. Park District plans to redevelop and improve the parks and rehabilitate the clubhouse. The work will include parking, walkway, and landscaping improvements (the “Improvements”) in the area between the clubhouse, California Avenue, and Temescal Street.

(A) Village Park and Plaza Park are both located in the Fair Oaks Water District service area.

1.2. Park District owns Phoenix Park at 9050 Sunset Avenue in Sacramento County.

(A) Phoenix Park is located in the Fair Oaks Water District service area.

1.3. County of Sacramento (“County”) owns a county road right-of-way, including an associated public utility easement (“PUE”), located in front of the south side of the Village Park Clubhouse as shown on the attached Exhibit A. The existing right-of-way and PUE interfere with Park District’s planned Improvements. The Park District is therefore working with the County to abandon and vacate the road right-of-way and PUE in order to accommodate the installation of their proposed improvements.

1.4. Water District owns and operates a water infrastructure within the existing PUE as shown on Exhibit A. As a condition of the County abandoning and vacating the right-of-way, the Water District will need to relocate its existing public water infrastructure out of the PUE and into the County road right-of-way for California Avenue and Temescal Street.

1.5. Water District is willing to relocate its existing public water facilities in accordance with Exhibit B (at its cost) and abandon its interests in the PUE in exchange for Park District granting to the Water District (without cost) a water well site easement subject to the terms of this Agreement.

2. Water District Pipeline Relocation and PUE Abandonment

2.1. Water District, at its sole cost and expense, shall abandon in place, in accordance with current County of Sacramento Standards, all existing public water infrastructure
<!-- Page 430 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
located within the PUE as shown on Exhibit B. Water District shall make every reasonable effort to complete this work by April 30, 2022.

2.2. Water District, at its sole cost and expense, will install new water infrastructure in accordance with the Water Improvements Plans as shown on Exhibit B and limited to the cost included in the Engineers Estimate as shown on Exhibit C plus a twenty-five percent contingency. Any cost for this work in excess of this cap will be paid by the Park District.  
(A) Water District shall backfill and compact all areas of Water District work in accordance with County of Sacramento standards – but will not be responsible for any paving, flatwork, or restoration of such.

2.3. Upon completion of the water pipeline relocation work, the Water District shall be deemed to have abandoned and vacated all of its rights and interests in the PUE. The Water District shall promptly inform County in writing that it has abandoned its rights and interests in the PUE. Water District shall cooperate with County and Park District as appropriate to facilitate the right-of-way and PUE vacation.

3. Water Well Easement

3.1. Park District shall grant and convey an easement in Phoenix Park to Water District for the installation, operation, and maintenance of a water well (including pump and wellhead treatment equipment) and associated underground pipeline to connect the well to the existing Water District water distribution system. The well site shall not exceed 175 feet by 175 feet (or equivalent square footage if not square). The exact easement location within the park shall be determined later in coordination between the parties and it shall be subject to the approval of the governing boards of both Water District and Park District. Park District shall not unreasonably refuse to approve the easement location.  
(A) Prior to accepting a proposed well site, the Water District shall drill a test hole to determine the estimated water quality and quantity that the proposed site may yield. If a proposed site is determined by the Water District unacceptable for further investment, the Water District shall return the site to its existing condition prior to the drilling.  
(B) Test hole drilling shall be limited to two locations at Phoenix Park. If both proposed locations at Phoenix Park are determined to be unacceptable for further investment by the Water District, the Park District shall convey the following to the Water District:  
(1) An approximate 150 Ft x 150 Ft property located immediately adjacent to the Water District's existing well site located in Fair Oaks Park for the purpose of drilling a replacement groundwater well.

3.2. The easement shall be in substantially the form as set forth in the attached Exhibit D (the "Easement Agreement"). Upon the parties' approval of the exact easement location within the park, Water District shall retain a qualified engineering or surveying firm to prepare an easement plat and description to be incorporated into the Easement Agreement. The final plat and description as prepared by Water District's engineer or surveyor shall be  
{00247691.1}  
-2-  
FINAL 03-03-2022
<!-- Page 431 -->
subject to Park District's written approval, which approval will not be withheld unreasonably.

3.3. Upon Park District approval of the plat and description, Park District will finalize and prepare a signature-ready Easement Agreement with all exhibits. The final Easement Agreement shall be subject to Water District's written approval, which approval will not be withheld unreasonably. Upon approval by Water District, Park District shall approve and sign (including notary acknowledgment) the Easement Agreement and deliver it to Water District. Water District then shall approve and sign the Easement Agreement and arrange for the recording of the document. Water District shall provide a copy of the fully executed and recorded Easement Agreement to Park District.

3.4. Water District shall pay the fees and costs to prepare the easement plat and description and the County recording fees. Water District, at its sole cost and expense, may obtain from a title company a preliminary title report and title insurance policy for its acquired easement interest.

3.5. Water District has been advised to investigate the condition and suitability of Phoenix Park for its intended use and all matters affecting the usability of the property. Park District makes no representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied, as to the physical condition of its property; condition of the soil or presence of groundwater; permissible uses of the property or limitations on use (including matters pertaining to zoning, environmental, or other laws, regulations, or governmental requirements); utilities on or near the property; presence or absence of toxic materials or hazardous substances in, on, under, or around the property; or any other matter bearing on the use or condition of the property.

3.6. Water District's pipeline relocation and PUE abandonment pursuant to section 2 is the consideration that supports Park District's conveyance of the easement to Water District.

4. General Provisions

4.1. Entire Agreement.

4.2. Construction and Interpretation. The parties agree and acknowledge that this Contact has been arrived at through negotiation, and that each party has had a full and fair opportunity to revise the terms of this Agreement.

EASEMENT AGREEMENT  

THIS AGREEMENT, dated as of __________, 20__, is entered into by and between Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District, a local government agency (“Park District”), and Fair Oaks Water District, a local government agency (“Water District”), who agree as follows:  

1. Recitals. This Agreement is made with reference to the following background recitals:  

1.1. Park District is the fee owner of that certain parcel of land comprised of approximately _____ acres (known as Phoenix Park) located in the County of Sacramento, State of California, which is more particularly shown on the attached Exhibit A (“Phoenix Park”).  

1.2. Park District and Water District have entered into the Water Pipeline Relocation and Well Site Conveyance Agreement dated ______, 2021 (the “Agreement”). The Agreement provides for Park District to convey a certain easement in Phoenix Park to Water District in exchange for Water District’s agreement to relocate a certain water pipeline and abandon its interests in a public utility easement.  

1.3. Water District desires to acquire an easement in Phoenix Park for the future installation and operation of a water well (including pump and wellhead treatment equipment) and an associated pipeline to connect the well to the existing water distribution system.  

1.4. Water District has relocated the water pipeline and abandoned its interests in the public utility easement in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Park District and Water District have agreed upon the location of the easement and they have cooperated on the preparation of an easement plat and description (which are incorporated as Exhibits B and C). Park District therefore is ready to convey an easement to Water District (as contemplated by the Agreement) for the installation and operation of a water well, underground water pipeline, and related facilities, together with access to and from the facilities, on and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

# MEMORANDUM

To: Tom R. Gray, General Manager  
From: Blake Chetcuti, Engineer  
Date: 3/20/24  
Subject: Response to FORPD – California Avenue Main Replacement  

Hi Tom,

This memo contains a response to the request for documentation sent by Mike Aho on March 14th, 2024. Mike had several inquiries regarding the construction contract with C.E. Cox as it relates to the water main relocation at California Avenue and Temescal Street. These are outlined as items 1 – 5 below. Per Mike, the information that is presented herein will be shared with the FORPD Board.

1. **Provide C.E. Cox’s contract and scope.**  
C.E. Cox prepared a bid in the amount of $233,250 that was accepted and bonded by FOWD on May 16th, 2022. The scope of work was to replace 350 linear feet of water main on California Avenue adjacent to the Fair Oaks Village Park. Included with this memo is the Request for Bid, Bid Bond, and Bid Set Plans as attachments A, B, and C, respectively.

2. **Provide any and all change orders issued to C.E. Cox’s contract.**  
Two change orders were issued by C.E. Cox during the project. Change order #1 was to extend the water main relocation by an additional 240 feet to Fair Oaks Boulevard. As part of this work, a hydrant was relocated to avoid conflict with the proposed Village Park site improvements and a 2-inch irrigation service was abandoned at the FORPD’s direction. The total cost of improvements for change order #1 was $110,000. Change order #2 was to upgrade the service line for the Fair Oaks Brew Pub (7988 California Avenue) and to install backflow devices for the Brew Pub and Slocum House (7992 California Avenue). These changes were requested and paid for by the owner, Gary Juels, at a total cost of $6,000. Included with this memo is Change Order #1, Change Order #2, and the Revised Construction Plan Set as attachments D, E, and F, respectively.

3. **Provide all billings (including schedule of values) which document the amounts paid to C.E. Cox.**  
A total of $343,321.67 was paid to C.E. Cox for the project. This amount was charged over three separate invoices and includes change orders #1 and #2. The $6,000 charge for
<!-- Page 452 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

change order #2 was removed from the initial total, bringing the final construction cost of the project to $337,321.67. It should be noted that each invoice reflects a 10% retention charge that is accounted for in the subtotal and was ultimately paid for once the project was completed. An excel spreadsheet showing the summary of all charges has also been submitted for clarity.

Included with this memo is Invoice #1, Invoice #2, Invoice #3, and the Payment Summary as attachments G, H, I, and J, respectively.

4. Provide a breakdown/detail of FOWD labor ($26,274) and parts ($2,956).

The total labor charges for the project are $26,274.54. This accounts for FOWD staff time to draft the improvement plans, hold design review meetings, process bid documents, review and approve submittals, and perform other administrative duties. A portion of staff labor is also dedicated to making field visits and preparing inspection reports in addition to final as-built drawings.

The total parts charges for the project are $2,956.04. This includes the purchase of two 1.5-inch backflow devices that were supplied to the contractor at a cost of $1,903.12. Upon further review, it was discovered that the backflow purchases were associated with change order #2 and therefore should not be paid for by the FORPD. This is stated in further detail in the Summary of Recommendations at the end of this report. The remaining charges of $1,052.92 are a result of miscellaneous FOWD inventory items supplied to the contractor. Included with this memo is a Project Charges Summary and Material Charges Summary as attachments K and L, respectively.

5. Provide a narrative which explains why the project costs ($367,787) exceed the Engineer’s Estimate ($207,342).

During the course of construction, two change orders were carried out that modified the original scope of work. Change order #1 extended the main relocation by 240 ft to Fair Oaks Boulevard at a cost of $110,000. As part of this extension, a hydrant was relocated and a 2-inch service was abandoned at the west end of Village Park to the benefit of the FORPD. Change order #2 called for two service upgrades at a cost of $6,000 and was requested and paid for by Gary Juels, a neighboring business owner, and not included in the costs for FORPD.

Fair Oaks Water District made the decision to proceed with the main extension as it presented a unique opportunity to accommodate requests from both the FORPD and a neighboring customer, while offering significant savings on mobilization, paving, and design costs by completing the work in conjunction with the existing main relocation project that was already being required for FORPD.
