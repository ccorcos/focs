**18:37:34 From iPhone (116)Wendy to Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks (direct message):**  
I think it should be a priority to keep our kids safe at Miller park. At this time they are in constant worry of being hit by disk golf's. I feel like it keeps being out in the back burner and kids are being hurt.

**18:39:28 From Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks to iPhone (116)Wendy (direct message):**  
Hi Wendy. Would you like this to be added as a comment? I can read this out loud for the board.

**18:39:51 From iPhone (116)Wendy to Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks (direct message):**  
Yes please

**18:41:07 From Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks to iPhone (116)Wendy (direct message):**  
I will make sure this gets added

**18:41:43 From Jenna Gonzalez to Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks (direct message):**  
I am here I support of making the park safer

**18:42:13 From Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks to Jenna Gonzalez (direct message):**  
Thank you Jenna.

**18:46:06 From elizabeth to Everyone:**  
Why does there have to be so many conversation to remove the disc golf when there was no conversation when it was installed? It was done during covid when the schools where out of session and no one got to fight against it. Seems more difficult than necessary.

**18:47:58 From elizabeth to Everyone:**  
Kids safety is priority.

**18:48:10 From MC to Everyone:**  
Agreed!

**18:48:11 From Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks to elizabeth (direct message):**  
Thank you Elizabeth we will add this to the record.

**18:48:21 From Kylie Thrall to Everyone:**  
The golfers are not following the rules. Today at 3:25pm golfers were out there playing during the “no fly” time scolding 9 year olds to move.

# Appendix A: Public Comments received on Zoom

**18:48:41 From Kristi Savio to Everyone:**
Hello, I am here in support of Lyndsey. My daughter was hit by a disc while playing at Miller Park after school, and instead of the disc golfer being sympathetic to my hurt daughter, he was rude to her and the other mother's. A disc golf course at Miller Park does not make sense being next to a school where kids are clearly going to play. Please look into relocating this disc golf course to a more suitable park. How many more kids have to be hurt before something takes place?

**18:49:01 From Erica C. to Everyone:**
October 3 is Boo Bash Trunk or Treat - I suggest a different date so parents don’t have to choose between that event and the outreach.

**18:50:39 From iPhone (116) Wendy to Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks (direct message):**
That is not a solution.

**18:50:43 From Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks to Everyone:**
Thank you, we will pass this on for consideration.

**18:52:11 From Jon R to Everyone:**
More signage is not going to solve this problem, especially if there is no enforcement. The root of the issue is that this park is too small for it to be a golf course and a public park.

**18:53:06 From Kylie Thrall to Everyone:**
I know we live in California, but another reason this course should not be near a school is a lot of the golfers are smoking weed while playing and our children are walking through it. As a mom I’m being asked by my 5 year old if there was a “skunk” near by.

**18:54:49 From iPhone (116) Wendy to Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks (direct message):**
I never received a response when I emailed.

**18:55:03 From Jon R to Everyone:**
My email regarding my complaint about the disc golf that I sent right after the child was hit in the face. I never received any response.

**18:55:45 From elizabeth to Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks (direct message):**  
I had a disc golf thrown at me while walking on the path.

**19:02:46 From Erica C. to Everyone:**  
My daughter was also hit in the face with a disc and the golfers laughed at it.

**19:03:30 From elizabeth to Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks (direct message):**  
There are a lot more kids that have been hit. Everyone I talk to has had an incident at the park. My family alone has been yelled at twice and two discs thrown at us.

**19:04:21 From MC to Everyone:**  
I was with EC when her daughter was hit and the golfers were incredibly rude. They had just hit a 4 year old in the face and could not even apologize.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Meeting Date:** October 16, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Discussion and Possible Action on Miller Park Disc Golf Course Safety Assessment  
**Prepared By:** Sean Ventura, Parks & Facilities Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  

It is recommended that the Board review and discuss the presented mitigation options for addressing safety concerns at the Miller Park Disc Golf Course. A decision should be made regarding which safety mitigation package or actions the Board would like to pursue, taking into consideration the safety of park users, availability of similar amenities, the cost, and the timeline for implementation.

---

**II. Background**  

Miller Park Disc Golf Course was installed in late 2019 with a grand opening in March of 2020. Since that time, the course has grown in popularity; however, concerns have emerged regarding safety, especially towards the potential for errant throws to impact non-golfers in the park. In response to complaints from some park users, the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District (FORPD) contracted Whirlwind Disc Golf to conduct a thorough safety assessment of the course with the intention to create a guiding document with which the District might make an informed decision regarding potential safety improvements.

Whirlwind Disc Golf, led by Leonard Muise, an accomplished professional designer with extensive experience in disc golf course design, carried out the assessment in September 2024. Leonard has designed numerous successful courses ranging from small, neighborhood courses to professional, tour-level courses. Leonard has been recognized for his
<!-- Page 106 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

**contributions to the sport, including his election to the World Disc Golf Hall of Fame in 2024.**

The primary goal of the assessment was to thoroughly evaluate the current layout of the disc golf course from a safety perspective, considering all other park uses, and to recommend adjustments that would ensure a safer, more enjoyable experience for all park users. The report identified that many holes are not as safe as they should be, with some areas presenting significant concerns. The report also identified areas of low relative concern and noted that the course at Miller Park was roughly equivalent in safety ratings to many other courses throughout the Sacramento area, though that equivalence was below what Whirlwind Disc Golf would qualify as sufficient.

In terms of recommendations, the report offered a variety of potential mitigations, including relocating tee and basket positions, adding natural buffers such as trees and hedges, installing netting and fencing, redirecting pathways, improving signage, and enforcing course closures more strictly. These recommendations reflect the thoroughness of the evaluation and the high safety standards upheld by Leonard Muise as a professional course designer.

Additionally, the FORPD Board of Directors directed staff to hold a public outreach meeting, which took place at Miller Park on October 3rd, 2024. Feedback gathered from the residents and park users during this meeting was utilized to finalize the report from Whirlwind Disc Golf and will help guide the Board in making decisions as to how to address these safety concerns. The summary of comments from this public outreach meeting are attached to this report as Attachment C.

### III. Problem /Situation/ Request

The safety assessment outlined several key safety challenges:

1. **Risk of Injury from Errant Discs:** Several areas of the course, particularly near the playground, pedestrian pathways, and picnic areas have a potential for non-golfers to be struck by errant disc throws.
2. **Blind Spots:** Several holes have limited visibility from the tee, which creates the potential for non-golfers to be hit while walking through the course.
3. **Overlap of Holes:** Some fairways overlap with each other, increasing the likelihood of players unintentionally throwing into adjacent holes. This elevates the potential for injury, though primarily to disc golfers rather than those not participating in the activity.

In addition to the mitigation measures provided, the Board has the option to consider removing the course or moving the disc golf course from Miller.
<!-- Page 107 -->
![Financial Analysis](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Financial+Analysis)

**IV. Financial Analysis**

Three general mitigation packages have been proposed in the safety assessment alongside several mitigation measures which can be performed on a hole-by-hole basis. Each has varying costs and degrees of effectiveness. It is important to note that all cost estimations provided are rough, and actual costs will likely vary once work begins.

1. **Mitigation Package 1:**
   - **Cost:** Estimated at $15,000 - $20,000
   - **Scope:** Addition of approximately 15 trees to create fairway corridors, relocation of several baskets, and installation of a small number of fences and signs.
   - **Pros:** High impact on safety with moderate cost.
   - **Cons:** Trees will take 5-10 years to mature, dependent on species selected. Only mitigates front three holes of course.

2. **Mitigation Package 2:**
   - **Cost:** Estimated at $10,000 - $15,000
   - **Scope:** Removal of hole #3/12, adding one hole in the wooded area at the south end of the park.
   - **Pros:** Reduces the risk of disc flights crossing pedestrian paths.
   - **Cons:** Requires re-design of multiple holes. If trees are added to this mitigation package the cost rises by approximately another $4,500, and those trees will take 5-10 years to mature. Does not mitigate creek or playground concerns. May require renovation of rear parking lot which would add an exorbitant amount to costs (not included in above cost section).

3. **Mitigation Package 3:**
   - **Cost:** Estimated at $25,000 - $60,000
<!-- Page 108 -->
b. Scope: Installation of approximately 700 linear feet of fencing to enclose the wooded area of the disc golf course and restrict access to non-golfers.  
c. Pros: Highest reduction in safety risks among packages  
d. Cons: High cost and potential visual impact. Does not mitigate first three holes of course. May require renovation of rear parking lot which would add an exorbitant amount to costs (not included in above cost section).  

Please note that the three presented mitigation packages can be taken separately, completed together, or each pulled from to create a combined approach. The safety assessment includes highlighted sections within the mitigation measures that Whirlwind Disc Golf recommends above other measures. The report also notes that, “The mitigation of Major concerns should be considered non-negotiable – i.e., it’s a question of when, not if.”  

Hole-by-hole mitigation measures are likewise proposed beginning on page forty-two of the safety assessment. Many of the larger measures proposed by the general mitigation packages are contained in these recommendations as well, but the hole-by-hole analysis holds additional details and recommendations that can help the District to achieve a higher level of safety at the park.  

Costs associated with these more specific recommendations should be assumed to include the costs and scope referenced above for the mitigation packages, but each individual hole’s recommendations will include a higher cost and a longer timeframe to achieve all of those recommendations.  

In addition to these mitigation packages, the Board has the option to relocate the course to another site within the District or to simply remove it completely. The costs associated with this option are roughly estimated as follows:  

1. Course Removal:  
   a. Cost: Estimated at $8,000 - $10,000  
   b. Scope: Removal of baskets, signage, and tee pads, dump fees for heavy inert materials, and restoration of Miller Park to pre-course state.  

2. Course Relocation:  
   a. Cost: Estimated at $20,000 - $40,000  
   b. Scope: Design consultation for safety of new location, course design and signage design, installation of new tees, baskets (but not the cost of the baskets themselves), land preparation and labor. Additional costs may arise depending on the location and infrastructure requirements, such as parking, additional landscaping, and the presence or lack of restrooms.
<!-- Page 109 -->
In total, the removal and relocation of the course could cost between $28,000 and $50,000, though these costs may increase or decrease based on unforeseen factors during the project. Should the Board recommend this option, staff will continue working with disc golfers and other stakeholders to identify a viable new location for the course, though with the previously expressed difficulties regarding other sites within the District, this option may simply lead to course removal without relocation.

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

# (Final) Safety Assessment and Recommendations: Miller Park, Fair Oaks, CA

## REPORT GOALS AND SCOPE

This report seeks to identify all significant safety issues – in particular, potential injury to people being hit by a disc – associated with how the course is routed and installed, and how disc golfers play the course. The report also recommends a variety of effective mitigations to make the course much safer for everyone, far surpassing the safety norms of other disc golf courses in the region.

This report has four sections and an appendix:

- **SITE OVERVIEW** – High-level description of the course and the park
- **ABOUT DISC GOLF SAFETY** – Context, process, and terminology for this report
- **SITE ASSESSMENT** – Safety summary; detailed hole-by-hole identification of potential risk
- **MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS** – Mitigation summary; detailed solutions to eliminate major risks and increase overall safety
- **Appendix** – Design principles and experience of the professional designer responsible for this report

# SITE OVERVIEW

## Disc Golf Course

The disc golf course at Miller Park is an 18-hole layout consisting of 8 tee boxes playing through 9 fairways. Each fairway culminates with two baskets, one green basket for each for the front nine (holes 1-9) and one orange basket for each of the back nine (holes 10-18).

The course area is roughly 5.5 acres, with a variety of terrain. Roughly half the course is located in improved grassy areas with relatively gentle slopes and moderately dense groups of trees, ranging from smallish olive trees to a handful of large Chinese tallow. The other half is unimproved, mostly dirt with steeper slopes and denser vegetation, including many live oaks and shrubs such as privet. A tiny creek with year-round moisture separates the two areas to some extent.

The southwest quadrant of the park, where the more wooded and sloped disc golf holes are located, has two service utility enclosures at/near its highest point.

Players at this course have a wide variety of skill levels and experience, ranging from first-timers to highly advanced. Based on the number of rounds played, the median player would have recreational to lower-intermediate skills, playing 5-10 rounds a month (primarily here or at ‘Shady Oaks’ in Orangevale), with 1-4 years’ experience. The median skill level can throw 200-250 feet with modest control and consistency. They have a decent grasp of normal disc golf etiquette, including the awareness and courtesy to let non-golfers clear a potential flight area before throwing.

Best guess is that this course averages about 50 rounds a day, based on 3X rounds that were recorded on UDisc.

## Multi-Use Park

In addition to disc golf, the park offers many other activities to its community, including tennis, basketball, and a playground. Amenities include two reservable areas with grills and power, picnic tables, and bathrooms. The park also has some community-organized activities such as exercise groups and educational programs for kids.

The park has one paved path which mainly routes people to-and-from the parking lot to the bathrooms, tennis courts, and Earl Le Gette Elementary School. The paved path also has a spur which wraps around most of the tennis courts. There are also social trails in the wooded area on the southwest quadrant of the park, primarily established by disc golf foot traffic.

My sense is that each of the park activities and amenities enjoy a moderate amount of use. Disc golf may be the most popular use, or at least the most consistent use, during off-peak periods. ("Peak" being right after school and weekends with mild weather.) The highest level of routine park usage occurs for about 30 minutes on weekday mornings, noon-ish, and afternoons during the school year, when roughly 50-100 elementary school kids walk between the school and the park’s parking lot, with greater dispersion and more lingering in the afternoons.

# ABOUT DISC GOLF SAFETY

## A Legitimate Concern

Safety on disc golf courses is a legitimate concern, especially at multi-use sites like Miller Park.

The essence of the game is trying to throw the disc around obstacles to the basket. If it was easy to make the disc go exactly where intended every time, the game would be boring. Errant throws happen. Golf discs can cause injury.

At the same time, historically, the odds of someone being injured by a golf disc are incredibly small, even at multi-use sites. The majority of the world’s 15,000+ disc golf courses is located in multi-use parks, including the majority of courses in the Sacramento region. A typical course, assuming 25 rounds per day and 50 throws per round, has over half a million throws per year. World-wide, that’s over 4 billion throws per year.

In all recreational activities, some degree of risk is inherent, and often difficult to quantify. Disc golf is no different. Anecdotally – based on social media, local journalism, conferences, etc – disc golf leaders like myself might be aware of maybe 1 extremely serious injury every 5-10 years, less than 100 bad injuries each year (e.g., concussion, laceration requiring urgent care), and less than 10,000 minor injuries (e.g., bruise) each year. Accordingly, a typical course may average 1 minor injury per year (roughly one out of every 400,000 throws), 1 bad injury every 100 years (~40 million throws), and 1 extremely serious injury every 10,000 years (~4 billion throws). These figures compare favorably to a long list of well-established recreational activities.

## Professional Course Design

Even though the odds of being injured by a disc are low, courses can and should be designed to greatly minimize safety risk while maximizing the enjoyment of the game. Fundamentally, designing a safe course involves understanding a simple dynamic, informed by years of experience and careful consideration of the site: Evaluating where the discs are likely to fly, given the skills of the players and the conditions in which they play, and the chances that someone might be present where the discs flies.

To determine where the discs might fly, many things are taken into account, including: intended flight paths, unintended flight paths, fairway obstacles, off-fairway buffers, terrain, footing, weather, wind, types of discs, velocity of discs, number of rounds, layout variations, and skill levels of participants.

---

Whirlwind Disc Golf – Miller Park Disc Golf Course – Sept 16, 2024
<!-- Page 114 -->
To determine the chance that someone might be present where the disc flies, many more things are taken into account: existing uses of the site (programmed and informal), a player’s ability to see people in their potential flight areas, the speed at which people may go from unseen to at-risk (e.g., walking vs biking), whether the people are in a fixed location (e.g., picnic bench) or passing through (e.g., dog walking), probability that people are aware of their proximity to discs in flight, etc.

Taking all those things into account is a lot. But even then, the preceding lists are not comprehensive. Other considerations may include: level of cultural etiquette (e.g., newbies vs experienced players), the local norm for what’s considered a safe-to-play fairway (e.g., if high-risk courses are the regional norm, players tend to get comfortable taking lots of risk), whether players have alternative courses nearby if their preferred course is crowded with non-golfers, the presence of effective signage communicating safety and etiquette, etc.

**Safety Ratings**

In any industry, a proper risk assessment involves a simple calculation: Probability X Severity. (see generic risk matrix below.) Best case: The probability of a risk being realized is low and, if it did happen, the harm would likely be minimal. These risks are negligible. Worst case: The probability of a risk being realized is high, and, if it does happen, the harm would likely be substantial. Always, these risks must be reduced or eliminated.

In my experience, stakeholders tend to overweigh the highest probability / lowest impact risks (Risk score: 5) and underweigh the 2nd lowest probability / highest impact risks (Risk score: 10). (Preview: I’m highlighting this underweigh tendency because there are a couple such scenarios on the course, as detailed later.)

**Generic risk matrix. To determine level of risk, multiply probability by severity.**

| Probability / Risk | Insignificant (1) | Significant (2) | Major (3) | Extreme (4) |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| 5 Almost Certain     | Medium 5         | High 10         | Very high 15 | Extreme 20  |
| 4 Likely            | Medium 4         | Medium 8        | Very high 12 | Extreme 16  |
| 3 Moderate          | Medium 3         | Medium 6        | Medium 9   | High 12     |
| 2 Unlikely          | Very low 2       | Low 4           | Medium 6   | Medium 8    |
| 1 Rare              | Very low 1       | Low 2           | Low 3      | Medium 4    |

Risk calculations are not familiar to many folks, probably a bit too academic. Therefore, although I use the matrix above for my analysis as a professional designer (and as a PMP-certified professional project manager), my course assessments use letter grades – something we all know well – as a substitute.

**More about Grades**

Please keep in mind that, as a diligent, experienced professional, I have unusually high standards when it comes to course safety. I’ve analyzed many courses. I’ve seen lots of errant throws. As a leader in the sport, I’m more concerned about the long-term health of the sport than any risk-driven adjustments to an individual course. Accordingly, my “D” grade (“resolve as soon as possible”) might be someone else’s “B” grade (“acceptable”).

When I give a hole a low grade, it doesn’t mean that the risk is any worse than other courses. It just means that I know we should do better. In my experience, most courses have many C’s and a few D’s as well. And roughly 5% of courses at least one F. Such is the nature of a fast-growing sport which hasn’t yet established consistent, mature design practices and standards.

To get an “A” grade, a hole must have excellent separation from other activities and other holes (i.e., extremely unlikely anybody’s in the flight path), with excellent visibility for the thrower to see wherever their disc might fly. Such optimum holes are uncommon in regions where open space is at a premium – including most parks in metropolitan areas, and including some of my own designs.

In the real world, where communities strive to provide healthy recreation to as many community members as possible, a course with mostly B’s and a few C’s is reasonably solid from a safety perspective – and much safer than an average course where, despite their weaknesses, serious injuries are very rare.

---

### Grade Definitions

- **“A” - No significant risk**
  
- **“B” - Low risk**
  - Much better than average.

- **“C” - Medium risk**
  - Acceptable, but not great. Should mitigate as many C’s as time and budget allow.
  - Multiple minor mitigations are likely available; may be able to make a significant improvement with some combination of options.
  - Reminder: If all the holes on a course are C or better, the course is safer than the typical course in this region. Reminder: Even on a typical course with lower grades, being injured by a disc is very rare.

- **“D” - High risk**
  - Must be resolved as soon as possible – within months, not years.

- **“F” - Extreme risk**
  - 100% unacceptable for any period of time.
  - Hole should not be played until the risk is resolved.

# SAFETY ASSESSMENT

## Summary: Safety Assessment

Overall, the course about average from a safety perspective. Which means two things that may seem contradictory:

1. The course has multiple safety risks that should be resolved as soon as possible. And several more, though less critical, that should also be mitigated as time and budget permit. (Again, Miller Park is not unusual in this assessment. Most courses have significant safety issues.)

2. The probability of a serious injury caused by a thrown disc is extremely low. (As noted above, serious injuries are very rare, despite the general lack of maturity in course design practices and standards.)

## The main factors impacting safety
- The course is cramped. The area in play is small for the number of holes and the length of the holes.
  - The tees and especially baskets are located close to areas where other park users routinely walk, play, or congregate. The main pathways and picnic areas are overexposed to potential errant disc flights.
  - Holes overlap each other, resulting in discs frequently flying into adjacent fairways.

- At times, the course area is crowded with non-golfers, especially the grassy meadow on school days (holes 1-3, 10-12). (This is a Major concern.)
  - On weekday mornings, noon-ish, and afternoons during the school year, roughly 50-100 kids may pass through the park during a short period of time. In the afternoon, most stay on the path as they head to the parking lot or playground, but many don’t. (Even if they do stay on the main path, it’s less than ideal from a safety perspective.)
  - The main grassy area may also be crowded with non-golfers on some mild weather weekends.

- Several fairways are “blind” from the tee – i.e., players cannot see where they’re intending to throw.
  - Most of these blind spots are within the course itself, where the person at risk is more likely to be another golfer than a non-golfing visitor.

- Multiple mandatories have limited effectiveness keeping discs out of risky areas because there’s not enough natural buffer to block errant flights. (Definition: A “mando” is an arrow attached to an obstacle, typically a tree, which indicates the correct side that the disc must pass the obstacle.)
  - Some players won’t notice or understand the mando’s guidance.
  - Some players will recognize the mando, but choose to ignore it.
  - Most players will recognize the mando and attempt to abide by it, but that doesn’t guarantee their disc will fly where intended.

More Context about Grades

For the following grades and observations, I’m pairing the front nine and back nine holes. Because they share fairways, they will usually receive similar assessments and recommendations.

On most disc golf holes, the potential harm near the tee is “high” at a minimum, because that’s where the disc is flying fastest and other people have the least time to react. But that’s not a problem where there’s extremely low probability of a problem occurring in the first place – which is usually the case.

# HOLE-BY-HOLE GRADES

## Hole #1: C-
## Hole #10: C-

### Risk Summary
- **Near the tee (first 50 feet)**: Extremely low probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, high potential harm. Primary risk is to disc golfers.
- **Fairway**: Moderate-to-high probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, low-to-moderate potential harm. Primary risk is to disc golfers, some to non-golfers.
- **Near the baskets (final 50 feet)**: Moderate-to-high probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, low potential harm. Primary risk is to non-golfers.
- **Major concerns**: Pulled flights from the tee that miss the mando; overthrows and pulled shots (both from the tee and fairway) that cross the pedestrian path.

### Observations
- The mando helps protect the main path to the right of the fairway, but it’s not insufficient.
  - **(good)** Most players successfully flip their disc to the left of the mando arrow.
  - Errant flights, pulled right of the mando, have little natural buffer to stop them from reaching the main path or basketball courts.
  - Re-teeing after missing the mando gives someone who has already demonstrated inaccuracy another opportunity to make a high-risk error.
  
- Errant flights often go into #3/#12 fairway and sometimes #2/#11 fairway.
  - **(good)** Visibility is wide open between this hole and the adjacent holes. Players can see discs in flight and call out when necessary.
  - Kids enjoy this space with lush grass and big shady trees. The lack of disc golf equipment mid-fairway may reinforce a false sense of safety when passing through this area.

- Both baskets are very close to the main path. Roughly 10% of flights land on or across the path.
  - **(good)** Most players are not good enough to throw a disc from the tee, around the mando, and all the way to the basket. Most flights which fly on or across the path are from short distance, flying slowly.
  - **(good)** Up close, players make better judgments about when non-players are within range. From close distance, most errors in judgment or execution are very unlikely to cause a significant injury.
  - For the 5-10% of players who can reach the baskets from the tee, flying to or across the main path is only maybe 5 degrees offline from almost 300 feet -- not a terribly inaccurate flight. The main path is very much at risk for these players.

### Insight
Higher skilled players, who throw farther than others, also tend to have better awareness and etiquette – i.e., they’re more cautious when non-players are within range. Nonetheless, it’s common for players of all skill levels to underestimate their potential inaccuracy when the risk is far away.

**Risk Summary**  
- Near the tee (first 50 feet): Very low probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, extremely high potential harm. Primary risk is to non-golfers.  
- Fairway: Low-to-moderate probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, low-to-moderate potential harm. Primary risk is to non-golfers.  
- Near the baskets (final 50 feet): Very high probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, very low potential harm. Primary risk is to non-golfers.  

**Major concerns**: Pulled flights from the tee toward BBQ/picnic people who are very close to the tee; several minor concerns.  

**Observations**  
- The sheltered, reservable picnic area is close to the tee and not very far offline from a good shot.  
  - (good) The BBQ grills are only 15 feet to the right of an ideal flight, and less than 30 feet from the tee.  
  - (good) The proximity of the picnic area makes it easy for golfers to see if anyone might be within their range – and wait or communicate to throw when safe.  
  - Players may hesitate to ask someone to temporarily relocate if they are in the middle of cooking.  
  - Although the probability is very low, this is the most likely location for a very serious injury.  

- (good) The series of mandos do help keep flights within the trees and away from risky areas.  
  - The presence of mandos does not guarantee compliance or accuracy.  
  - (good) After missing any of the mandos, players use a drop zone in the fairway rather than re-teeing.  

- The path along the tennis courts and the bench near the walkway junction are somewhat exposed to slightly pulled, mid-velocity flights that slip under the canopy of the large trees.  
  - The bench and mid-fairway paths get some use, but not much.  

- Errant flights often go onto #3/#12 fairway and sometimes #1/#10.  
  - (good) Visibility is wide open between this hole and the adjacent holes. Players can see discs in flight and call out when necessary.  

- The baskets are located very close to paved paths. The deeper positions result in discs flying across paths ~70% (B) to ~100% (C) of the time.  
  - (good) The paths near the baskets get very little use.  
  - Flights to and across those paths may be frequent, but the vast majority are low velocity. Rare for a higher-speed throw to reach these paths.  
  - The C position, near the corner of the fence, is exposed to people walking on the grass past the fence.  
  - But visibility through the fence is good; players won’t throw blindly.  
  - (good) Flights over the tennis courts are extremely rare.

![Insights](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
Insights  
Risks near the tee are most concerning because that’s when the disc is flying its fastest of all throws on the course. And there’s little opportunity for anyone to see and avoid an errant throw.  

As a percentage, the majority of errant flights fly relatively slowly by lower-skilled players, usually landing short and left of the ideal result. However, from a risk perspective, the most common scenario for a severe injury is a higher speed flight pulled to the right by a strong player.  

As a general rule, designers should account for the potential presence of people some distance away from “fixed location” activities like picnic benches and playgrounds. People tend to be active around those areas, not completely stationary within the areas.  

#2#11 tee. The BBQ grills are only 15 feet to the right of an ideal flight, and less than 30 feet from the tee. Although the probability is very low, this is the most likely location for a very serious injury.

A bench faces the tennis courts along right side of #2/#11 fairway. Mandos encourage flights parallel to the path, but low, pulled shots can easily reach this seldom-used path and bench.

**Risk Summary**
- Near the tee (first 50 feet): very low probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, very high potential harm. Primary risk is to disc golfers.
- Fairway: moderate-to-high probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, low-to-moderate potential harm. Primary risk is to disc golfers, some to non-golfers.
- Near the baskets (final 50 feet): very high probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, very low potential harm. Primary risk is to non-golfers.
- Major concern: Overthrows and pulled shots that cross the pedestrian paths (both from the tee and from the fairway); some minor concerns.

**Observations**
- On the tee, the fenced enclosure to the right slightly reduces visibility.
  - Low risk that people will be walking past the front of the tee from the practice basket area.
  - Only weak/bad throws go into the early trees on the left, given all the open fairway straight ahead and to the right.
  - Flights over 275 feet may curve around the first trees on the left, landing in the #2/#11 fairway.
  - On this hole, re-teeing after missing a mando is a reasonable option for safety.
  
- Most flights go into #1/#10 fairway, as there’s no natural separation between these two parallel fairways.
  - (good) Visibility is wide open between this hole and the adjacent holes. Players can see discs in flight and call out when necessary.
  - Kids enjoy this space with lush grass and big shady trees. The lack of disc golf equipment mid-fairway may reinforce a false sense of safety when passing through this area.

- If a tee shot is pulled right, the disc can fly across the path at various points, depending on player’s power.
  - More players can reach the path 250 feet away with a hard pull to the right, but pulling that far right is a fairly unusual mistake.
  - Fewer players, perhaps 10%, have the power to reach the path 300 feet away, but doing so only is slightly offline. Throwing over 300 feet in distance and ~30 feet offline -- a good shot for most players.

- Both baskets are very close to the bathroom sidewalk and main path. Roughly 20% of players throw a disc onto or across the sidewalk or path.
  - From mid-fairway – 200 feet from the green, give or take – slightly pulled flights can easily fly to or across the path to the short-right of the green.
  - (good) Most players throw their shots to the green from within 100 feet, which means relatively slow flights. Thus, errors in judgment or execution are very unlikely to cause a significant injury.

- Bathroom users are not visible to golfers and may suddenly appear where even a slight overthrow would reach them. Visibility is equally lacking if people are walking down the sloped path beyond the bathrooms.
  - (good) The tree canopy near the baskets forces most flights low. The vast majority of flights reaching or crossing the path are likely to be skipping or sliding across, with low velocity.

**Risks Summary**  
- Near the tee (first 50 feet): Extremely low probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, high potential harm. Primary risk is to disc golfers.  
- Fairway: Moderate-to-high probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, moderate potential harm. Primary risk is to disc golfers.  
- Near the baskets (final 50 feet): Low-to-moderate chance of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, very low potential harm. Primary risk is to disc golfers.  
- Major concerns: No major concerns; several minor concerns.  

**Observations**  
- The tee pad ends inches short of a small retaining wall. Players may injure themselves during follow-through, or when attempting to avoid a normal follow-through.  
- The fairway shares lots of space with the fairway for #9/#18, and also #6/#13 fairway, to a lesser extent.  
- The first mando, directing players to the left of the first tree on the right, helps protect the greens on holes #9/#18, but it’s not sufficient.  
  - (good) Most players successfully execute the mando by flying their disc to the left of the mando arrow.  
  - There’s nothing to block pulled drives to the right toward the B and C greens on #9/#18, except bushes a few feet away from those baskets.  
- (good) The mandos on the left do encourage players to fly their discs to the safe right side of #12 tee box. The trees on the left also provide a buffer/disincentive for flights going too far left from the tee.  
- (good) The screen protecting #5 tee is well-placed.  
- The struggling tree near #5/#14 tee is propped up. In coming years, it will probably be cut or removed, losing some of the buffer protecting those players.  
- Re-teeing after missing any of the mandos gives someone who has already demonstrated inaccuracy another opportunity to make a high-risk error – particularly if they missed the mando on the right.  
  - A forward drop zone would also increase visibility to the targets, thus reducing or eliminating the risk of throwing blindly into other people.  
- Well-thrown flights crest the hill and fly blindly toward several potential areas of risk, mandos notwithstanding: #9/#18 fairway, behind #5/#14 tee, and the hidden greens on this hole itself.  
- All three basket locations and greens are exposed to flights from other holes.  
  - When the basket is in A, discs landing within 30-40 feet are exposed to blind flights on hole #6/#15.  
  - When the basket is in B, it’s in the main fairway for holes #9/#18. None of the basket positions on #9/#18 appear to avoid this conflict.  
  - When the basket is in C, lies within 30-40 feet on either side of the baskets are also exposed to blind or obstructed-view flights from holes #6/#15 and #9/#18, respectively.  
- Once players are close enough to see the basket, there are no significant risk scenarios for disc flights.

- **Near the baskets (final 50 feet)**: Moderate-to-high probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, low-to-moderate potential harm. Primary risk is to non-golfers.
- **Major concern**: Overthrows from the tee and fairway can easily cross the gravel path; some minor concerns.

## Observations
- As noted above, the tree left of the tee is being propped up. In coming years, it will probably be cut or removed, losing some of the protection for the players.
- The two utility enclosures come into play, especially the second (easterly) one.
  - Retrieving discs from the enclosures presents a different potential risk – a player potentially injuring themselves. (I don’t know how prevalent this is.)
  - Rarely, a player or other person may appear suddenly from behind the second enclosure, at risk of a mid-fairway flight.
- The two mandos help keep flights within the trees and away from risky areas, but not especially well.
  - The presence of mandos does not guarantee compliance or accuracy.
  - On this hole, re-teeing after missing a mando is a reasonable option for safety. A forward drop-zone would improve visibility to/beyond the baskets; but it would also encourage overthrows.
  - The mando on the left is key. If a flight goes left, either accidentally (missing left is the most common error by lower-level players) or intentionally (the A position is easily accessible around the left), this is the shortest distance to the gravel path close behind the baskets.
- Though the holes are very short, visibility to the greens at the bottom of the hill is somewhat limited.
  - It’s hard to see someone walking behind the baskets – especially near the B position to the right.
  - Players on the #6/#13 tee are very slightly vulnerable to relatively good flights to the B position -- flights that get through all the trees, but drift too far right, running out of gas as they reach the tee.
- **(good)** The wood posts between the baskets and the path encourage non-golfers to continue down the path rather than wandering near or in front of the baskets.
- The B position is elevated several feet, which motivates many players to throw the disc higher and farther than if the basket was standard height.
  - From within 50 feet, about 25% of short throws/long putts will fly past the elevated baskets and onto or beyond the gravel path.
  - The area beyond the posts is out-of-bounds, intended to discourage overthrows. Similar to the limited effectiveness of mandos, many players may not be aware of this rule or may choose to disregard it.

**Hole #6: D**  
**Hole #15: D**  

**Risk Summary**  
- Near the tee (first 50 feet): Very low probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, very high potential harm. Primary risk is to disc golfers.  
- Fairway: moderate-to-high probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, very high potential harm. Significant risk to disc golfers and non-golfers.  
- Near the baskets (final 50 feet): Very low probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, very low potential harm. Primary risk is to disc golfers.  
- **Major concern:** Blind flights from the tee which are intended to fly directly down a well-worn social trail; some minor concerns.  

**Observations**  
- **(good)** The tee backs up to the edge of the parking lot and throws directly away from it.  
- **(good)** The school fence along the left ensures the vast majority of flights stay within the park; probably extremely rare for a flight to go over the fence on the drive or other throw.  
- **(good)** The two utility enclosures help separate this fairway from #5/#14.  
  - The first enclosure to the right, as noted above, presents a different kind of safety issue – a player potentially injuring themselves trying to retrieve their disc. *(I don’t know how prevalent this is.)*  
- The hole encourages a hard straight flight, staying low as it crests the hill mid-fairway, continuing fast toward the greens. The 2nd half of the fairway is blind from the tee.  
  - Beyond the crest of the hill, a well-worn social trail goes down the middle of the fairway. Even though the wooded area doesn’t have nearly as much non-golfer foot traffic as the grassy area, this social trail is the most likely place for a non-golfer to be walking in the wooded area. If they’re walking from west-to-east, they will not be visible from the tee, may not have been seen on the course at all, and may be walking directly into the ideal flight.  
  - Disc golfers on #6/#15 fairway may also be out of sight to players on the tee. But it’s likely those players would have been noticed by the group as they played hole #5/#14, which normally leads to players actively confirming that the fairway has cleared.  
  - **This is the most likely location on the course for a serious injury. An accident here is more likely than #2/#11, but the potential harm is greater there.**  
- From mid-fairway to the greens, there is minor chance of flying into the same area as overthrown #4/#13, or going right into #9/#18 fairway. Visibility is good, velocities are low; not a significant concern.  
- The hillside below the B position has been reinforced with decent makeshift retaining. It probably improves footing and reduces erosion a little, but the hill is probably slippery during wet weather.

**Insight**  
As a general principle, the best way to avoid a high-risk area is to throw directly away from it. Most tees on this course reflect that idea, throwing away from the street, primary paths, or, in this case, the back parking lot.

**The tee for #6/#15 is just beyond the dirt parking area. It's a popular entry point for walkers.**

**Golfers on #6/#15 throw long, blind shots over a hill.**  
**Utility area often comes into play on right side of #6/#15.**

![Hole #16: C-](https://example.com/hole16_image)  

**Risk Summary**  
- **Near the tee (first 50 feet)**: Extremely low probability of a disc flying into risky space; if it occurs, high potential harm. Primary risk is to disc golfers.  
- **Fairway**: Moderate probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, moderate potential harm. Primary risk is to non-golfers.  
- **Near the baskets (final 50 feet)**: Moderate-to-high probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, moderate potential harm. Primary risk is to non-golfers.  
- **Major concern**: Flights from tee landing near creek or long right where non-golfers, kids in particular, may not be visible when throwing; also some minor concerns.  

**Observations**  
- The large, wide, elevated tee serves 4 holes on 2 fairways – #7/#16 and #9/#18.  
  - The tee itself presents an extremely minor potential impact on safety, as people on the course may not pay attention to which the players are throwing to the other hole.  
- Unseen people, especially non-golfers, may be present in common landing areas from mid-fairway to and beyond the greens. These people are likely moving around, making awareness and judgment more difficult for disc golfers.  
  - Right side of mid-fairway: Branches overhang the grass and creek area. Roughly 25% of drives (of players who can throw hard enough) deflect off the branches and drop below. Some of these blocked flights may have continued farther down the right side of the fairway, where the chance of somebody being in the landing area gets higher as it goes.  
  - Long-right in/near the creek: About 10% of the longer flights fly cleanly long and to the right, landing in or near the creek, roughly at or beyond “pin high” with the B position. Kids in particular like to play in/along the creek, located about 90 feet downhill from the playground.  
- The green for the B position on #8/#17 is highly exposed to flights from the tee on this hole. Errant shots falling short and to the left – the most common miss – may land near B position for #8/17.  
- The green areas are also vulnerable to people entering the space unexpectedly, coming from the nearby playground or large reservable picnic area. B position is a slightly higher risk, given its relative proximity to the playground and creek.  
  - Visibility is better toward the baskets than along the creek itself – i.e., disc golfers are more likely to be aware of people near the baskets, and wait for the area to clear.  
- For most players, it’s challenging to reach either of these baskets from the tee. Most shots into the greens are from much shorter distance, with ample opportunity for the disc golfer to be aware of someone already within or possibly entering the range of their flight.  
- **(good)** The drop zone for the missed mando is near the overhanging branches mid-fairway right, resulting in approach shots with excellent visibility to the greens and anybody who might enter the space.  
- **(good)** The simple bridge crossing the creek – an element which may draw unexpected people – is clearly visible from the tee.

![Hole #8: B- Hole #17: B-](https://example.com/image.png)

**Risk Summary**
- Near the tee (first 50 feet): Extremely low probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, very high potential harm. Primary risk is to non-golfers.
- Fairway: very low probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, low potential harm. Primary risk is to disc golfers.
- Near the baskets (final 50 feet): very low probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, very low potential harm. Primary risk is to disc golfers.
- Major concern: No major concerns; some minor concerns.

**Observations**
- The tee is very close to a large, reservable picnic area that probably gets limited use due to lack of shade.
  - The tee is forward and apart from the picnic area just enough that flights into stationary picnickers is extremely unlikely.
  - However, picnickers should not be assumed to be stationary. The layout of the picnic area and the position of the tee would rarely result in someone unknowingly wandering in front of the tee as someone throws. And players would easily see this happening before they throw.
  - Having the tee so close to the picnic area is not ideal, but the risk is very low.
- To prevent flights from going into neighbors’ yards, a shelter was constructed to the right and slightly forward of the tee, and mesh screens were installed above the conventional fence along the property line.
  - These barriers block 70-80% of the shots that would have gone into the yards otherwise.
- Several mandos are also intended to minimize flights into neighbors’ yards.
  - There’s plenty of room between the shelter and the first mando for discs to fly to or over the fence.
  - Re-teeing after missing the mando gives someone who has already demonstrated inaccuracy another opportunity to make a problematic error.
- As noted above, the green for the B position is located in the fairway for hole #7/#16.
  - The A and C positions on this hole are more enjoyable, so B is rarely played.
- Retrieving discs from problematic areas presents a different kind of potential risk – a player potentially injuring themselves.
  - Players may climb over or cut through the fence to retrieve discs that fly into private property.
  - The brush behind the C position, “inside circle one” (10 meters), includes some blackberries.

**Risk Summary**
- Near the tee (first 50 feet): extremely low probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, very high potential harm. Primary risk is to disc golfers.
- Fairway: moderate probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, moderate potential harm. Primary risk is to disc golfers.
- Near the baskets (final 50 feet): very low probability of a disc flying into a risky space; if it happens, very low potential harm. Primary risk is to disc golfers.
- Major concern: No major concerns; several minor concerns.

**Observations**
- The large, wide, elevated tee serves 4 holes on 2 fairways – #7/#16 and #9/#18.
  - The tee itself presents an extremely minor potential impact on safety, as people on the course may not pay attention if they think the players are throwing to the other hole.
- The fairway is narrow with many small trees to navigate.
  - Deflections can fly sideways, at reduced velocity, into the adjoining fairways.
  - (good) The dense privet downslope of the main fairway provides an effective buffer separating the hole from the grassy area and creek.
- As detailed above, the baskets positions and greens on #4/#13 can easily come into play on this hole.
  - The B position on #4/#13 is located in the main fairway for this hole. There does not appear to be any basket position(s) on this hole that, if paired with 4B, would significantly reduce the potential conflict.
  - From the tee or early fairway, players on this hole have a clear or partially obstructed view of people on the second half of #4/#13. A good shot on this hole, however, will fly into areas where players on #4/#13 may be hidden.
- The greens are compact, with vegetation close to the basket, especially in the C position. This provides a bit of additional buffer from errant flights on #4/#13.
- The eroded right-to-left downslope, all along the second half of the hole, may be slippery during wet weather – including the rough-cut steps going down toward the creek from near the A position.

# MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS

## Summary: Mitigation Recommendations

### Primary mitigation techniques
- Install barriers to block risky flights – trees, hedges, fences
- Move baskets away from pedestrian paths
- Redirect non-golfer foot traffic; modify paths
- Close course when lots of school kids are moving through the park
- Add caution signage

### Recommended mitigations: Estimated quantities
- Plant ~20 new trees
- Install ~150 feet of 6-foot fence; add ~200 feet of 4-foot extension atop existing fence
- Plant 100 linear feet of hedges
- Relocate 4 basket sleeves
- Add flags to 6 baskets
- Remove parking spaces and path near tennis practice area
- Relocate 2 BBQ grills

### Optional mitigations: Estimated quantities (partial list):
- Build several new tees
- Install many new sleeves
- Redo nearly all tee signs
- Add hundreds of feet of additional fencing
- Add another ~200 feet of natural screens / hedges
- Add another 5-10 new trees
- Rebuild makeshift terraces and steps

---

All of Whirlwind's recommended mitigation options are highlighted yellow below, based on information and ideas generated thus far. These options are the most impactful and cost-effective.

The highlighted set of recommendations is subject to change, after receiving feedback and suggestions from various stakeholders.

The adjusted Hole-by-Hole grades reflect the application of all recommended mitigations, as highlighted. If any optional mitigation options are applied, the mitigated grade would likely improve.

# MITIGATION OPTIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS: PACKAGES

This report presents three “Mitigation Packages”, where a given solution would impact multiple holes. These packages are intended to simplify the recommendations and reduce the redundancy.

Note: The Google map for this report includes a layer for all recommendations, and separate layers for Packages #2 and #3, which are not officially recommended.

## Mitigation Package #1 (Recommended)

Add ~15 trees to create three separate corridor fairways in the main meadow, impacting current holes #1/#10, #2/#11, and #3/#12.

![Map](image_url)

*Changes in yellow. New trees will separate fairways and protect paths from errant flights. With trees, holes don’t have to be shortened as much. (Some other recommendations appear in this clip, unrelated to this package.)*

### Expected results (in priority order)
- Greatly reduce discs flying across pedestrian paths
- Greatly reduce discs flying into other fairways

Whirlwind Disc Golf – Miller Park Disc Golf Course – Sept 16, 2024
<!-- Page 147 -->
![Whirlwind Disc Golf – Miller Park Disc Golf Course – Sept 16, 2024](attachment://image.png)

**Considerations**
- Tall, relatively skinny trees would be best in the middle (e.g., incense cedar, redwood), with broader trees closest to the paths (e.g., liquid amber)
  - It could take 5-10 years for the trees to reach their full mitigation potential. Given abundant moisture in the meadow, perhaps they would grow quickly. On the other hand, maybe the variable moisture will stress some species.
- Baskets on #1/#10 and #3/#12 would still need to be moved away from the paths, but not as far as recommended without these trees to block most inaccurate or overthrown flights.
- Corridors would make these holes more “technical” (technical: requiring narrow, controlled flights) vs the “open” space for the current holes. Most players enjoy “technical” more than “open”, offsetting the disappointment of advanced throwers who may miss having long holes in this small space.
- More trees in the meadow will make it a little harder to see non-golfers passing through the area.
- More trees in the meadow might make it more appealing for picnickers to set up in a fairway.
  - This can be offset to some extent by increasing the number of shaded picnic benches available elsewhere in the park.
<!-- Page 148 -->
![Mitigation Package #2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Mitigation+Package+%232)

**Mitigation Package #2**

In the main meadow, remove hole #3/#12 so that the baskets for #1/#10 can move away from the main pedestrian path toward the middle of the meadow.

Consequently, add one hole between in the wooded southwest quadrant – between current #6/#15 and #7/#16. Redesign the adjacent holes to enable/exploit the position of the new hole.

**Expected results (in priority order)**
- Moderately reduce discs flying across pedestrian paths
- Greatly reduce discs flying into other fairways

**Considerations**
- Fairly effective mitigation if planting many large trees in the meadow is not desirable.
- If combined with Package #1, potential for flights across pedestrian paths would be even lower.
  - With Package #2, it’s possible to achieve comparable mitigation as Package #1, but use only 5-10 trees instead of 10-15.
- Baskets on hole #1/#10 would still need to be moved away from the paths, but not as far as recommended without this mitigation.
- The course would be re-numbered: After #1/#10, start into wooded area at current #4/#13, then walk from current #9/#18 to current #3/#12 to finish. Other words, current #3/#12 becomes #9/#18.
  - This creates a more efficient loop, returning players closer to where they started the round.
- Space in the wooded area is already compressed, with tightly grouped fairways and significant risk of unexpected flights into adjoining fairways. The preliminary new layout does not worsen this risk.

**Whirlwind Disc Golf – Miller Park Disc Golf Course – Sept 16, 2024**
<!-- Page 149 -->
- The new tee on #3/#12, pulled back about 30 feet vs existing tee on #4/#13, would work much better if the current path in front of the tee is removed. (see recommendations for hole #5/#14 below)  
  - The new tee is workable even without the path removal. But if the path remains, it would preclude the possibility of playing the wooded area during school rush.

- Several side-benefits occur from making the new hole fit into this space.  
  - Blind shots are minimized on new holes #3/#12 and #5/#14 compared to the same fairways used by existing holes #4/#13 and #6/#15.  
  - The forward position of new tee #4/#13 (current #5/#14) enables better downhill visibility. The relocation of #6/#15 tee makes room for a longer basket position on #5/#14 – or to preserve the current distance on #5/#14 when it becomes #4/#13 with a shorter tee. And if there’s a new position long right, maybe the old B position short left can be removed, as it was the mostly likely to result in discs across the path.  
  - The new longer tee on #3/#12 vs existing #4/#13 allows comparable distance while reducing extent that the greens on the hole come into play on the adjoining holes (especially #9/#18 fairway).

<!-- Page 150 -->
# Mitigation Package #3
Enclose most of the wooded southwest quadrant with a fence.

![Map](https://example.com/map)  
*Approx 500 feet of 4-foot or 6-foot fence (gray line) restricts entry to the wooded section of the course to only 3 gateways.*

## Expected results (in priority order)
- Greatly reduce pedestrians walking unseen toward flights on #6/#15.
- Greatly reduce unexpected non-golfer foot traffic; make non-golfer location much easier to predict.
- Create an area that may remain playable when lots of school kids are passing through the park.

## Considerations
- Roughly 500 feet of fencing with 3 openings:
  - Middle of course near #4/#13 tee and #9/#18 baskets
  - Southeast corner of course near #6/#15 tee
  - West side of course near #8/#17 tee
- If new tee is installed on #6/#15 (see Hole-by-Hole below), the visibility of incoming non-golfers would be greatly improved. This mitigation would still be useful to address that concern, but not as essential.
- Could be expensive. And might look ugly.
- Might be perceived that disc golfers have their own dedicated space within a multi-use park.
  - Not that it’s a bad thing, safety-wise. Or even an unusual thing for recreational facilities – e.g., tennis.
- This would amend fencing already recommended for targeted mitigations on #5/#14, #6/#15, and #7/#16 (see Hole-by-Hole recommendations below).
- For the best possible safety grades – no hole worse than B- – make this area exclusive use (disc golf only).

# MITIGATION OPTIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS: HOLE-BY-HOLE

Mitigations listed below each hole are grouped by Major and Minor.

- The Major concern(s) below, if any, are copy-pasted from the Site Assessment above.
- The mitigation of Major concerns should be considered non-negotiable – i.e., it’s a question of when, not if.
- The mitigation of Minor concerns is valuable, but not essential. A cost-effective approach is recommended.

**Hole #1:** C- becomes B- if highlighted mitigations are applied  
**Hole #10:** C- becomes B- if highlighted mitigations are applied  

**Major concerns:** Pulled flights from the tee that miss the mando; overthrows and pulled shots (both from the tee and fairway) that cross the pedestrian path.

**Major Mitigations:**

- **Recommended: Mitigation Package #1.** (details above)  
  - Package #1 adds many trees to the fairway to block errant shots from reaching paths. It also separates the fairways well – a lower priority here.  
  - Package #2 would also work. (Details above.)

- **(applicable whether or not either Package is used)** Prevent errant shots from flying across the early right path toward basketball court. **Recommended:** Choose one of these two.  
  - Move the tee to the left of the information kiosk, so that two existing olive trees block most pulled flights.  
    - This also eliminates the need for the mandatory.  
    - It also adds a few feet to the hole, given that other mitigations shorten the hole.  
    - It will necessitate relocation of the practice basket.  
  - Plant two trees with low canopies (e.g., olive trees) to the forward right of the tee, creating a barrier to block most pulled flights.  
    - Keep the mandatory.  
    - **Note:** This mitigation would be slightly less impactful in conjunction with Package 2, as the new hole would be shifted away from the path.

- **Recommended:** Move the baskets away from the path  
  - **(applicable if using Package #1)** Move the baskets 45 feet from nearest path  
    - Move the long/left (A) position 20 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  
    - Move the short/right (B) position 35 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  
  - **(applicable if not using either Package #1 or #2)** Move the baskets 60 feet from nearest path  
    - Move the long/left (A) position 35 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  
    - Move the short/right (B) position 55 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  

**Minor Mitigations:**

- **(if tee is not relocated)** Create a drop zone for the mandatory near the mandatory itself, positioned so that the mando tree helps block another pulled shot.

**Insight**

Overthrows tend to be proportionate to the distance of the throw. The farther the flight to the basket, the more space should be provided between the basket and any risky areas behind it. My rule of thumb -- for unobstructed flights over level ground with negligible wind – is 20 feet + 15% of the farthest common distance that reaches the basket. On a 300-foot hole where a significant number of players can reach the basket from the tee, the recommended buffer would be 65 feet behind the basket (20 + (3*15)).

**Possible relocation of tee on #1/#10.** Info kiosk and trees prevent pulled shots from crossing the path near the basketball court.

**Grassy meadow where 10-20 new trees could separate fairways for the first 3 holes and create barriers to discs flying across the path.**

![Hole 2 & 11 Sign](https://example.com/hole_sign_image)

**Hole #2:** D becomes C+ if highlighted mitigations are applied  
**Hole #11:** D becomes C+ if highlighted mitigations are applied  

**Major concerns:** Pulled flights from the tee toward BBQ/picnic people who are very close to the tee; several minor concerns.  

Although the probability is very low, this is the most likely location for a very serious injury.  

**Major Mitigations:**  
- **Recommended:** Relocate or remove both BBQ grills so that people are less likely to stand within 15 feet of the flight path of an ideal throw.  
  - (and/or) Add an 8-foot-tall, 40-foot-long fence or mesh barrier between the tee and the picnic shelter, parallel to the fairway. It would be ugly, but a natural hedge wouldn’t work because it would conceal people who might walk around it.  
  - (or) Move the tee up 40 feet. If grills are re-located, moving up 30 feet would be sufficient.  

**Minor Mitigations:**  
- **Recommended:** Remove the bench near the walkway junction at the middle of the tennis courts. It gets little use.  
  - (and/or) Plant roughly 80 feet of 6-foot edge along the path parallel to the middle set of tennis courts, ending slightly beyond the bench’s current location.  
- Remove the seldom-used paved path near the B and C basket positions.  
  - The last 100 feet from the Y side B position is particularly suitable for this mitigation, as path use is very low and risk is highest near the baskets.  
  - The previous 100 feet would also make sense, resulting in a clean line where the path makes a 90-degree turn at the east-west junction of the path.  
  - Putting grass here would greatly improve the aesthetic and playability of the hole. No more rough skips on the paths. No more fairly random OB penalties.  
  - **Note:** Removing the full ~200 feet would be fantastic, but it’s not sufficiently high-risk to make the official recommendation list.  

- Put a 4-foot-high fence, running north-south from the tennis courts to the edge of the grass at the road, starting about 20 feet from the corner of the courts.  
  - If the optional mitigation to move #1/#10 tee is implemented, the practice basket should probably move. This area would be one of the two obvious places to relocate it – so the fence wouldn’t work in that scenario.  
  - Again, there’s very little play around the corner of the courts and visibility through the courts’ fence is good – but if players are inclined to play the current C position or temporary positions further around the corner, then the fence becomes somewhat more useful.  

**Mitigation Packages** (details in Mitigation Packages section above)  
- As described above, **Package #1 (recommended)** greatly impacts this hole.  
- **Package #2** (optional) would impact this hole. It would be renumbered as #9/#18.  
- **Package #3** (optional) would not impact this hole.

**Strongly recommended:** Both BBQ grills should be relocated, ideally south of the shelter. People standing at the grills are only 15 feet from where ideal shots are intended to fly – very much exposed to errant shots pulled hard to the right from the tee.

**Recommended:** The bench on the right side of the fairway should be relocated. Pulled shots don't fly to beyond this bench often, but it's not rare enough to accept the risk.

**Optional mitigation:** Replacing seldom-used path with grass. Would reduce pedestrian traffic, and increase golf fun. Priority would be the last ~100 feet from the flat Y, down to the street. All ~200 feet, from the corner of the tennis court, would be ideal.

![Hole 3 and Hole 12 Disc Golf Course](https://example.com/image.png)

Hole #3: C- becomes B- if highlighted mitigations are applied  
Hole #12: C- becomes B- if highlighted mitigations are applied  

**Major Concerns:** Overthrows and pulled shots that cross the pedestrian paths (both from the tee and from the fairway); some minor concerns.

**Major Mitigations**  
- **Recommended: Mitigation Package #1.** (details above)  
  - Package #1 adds many trees to fairway to block long throws from reaching paths. It also separates the fairways well – a lower priority here.  
  - Package #2 would also work. (Details above.)  

- **Recommended: Move the baskets away from the paths.**  
  - The new distance would be much shorter, as the baskets reside in/near peninsula with paths on 3 sides.  
  - It’s very risky to have busy and/or blind paths in play with regularity, even if the disc is usually flying slowly.  
  - (applicable if using Package #1) Move the baskets 45 feet from nearest path.  
    - Move the long/left (A) position 55 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  
    - Move the short/right (B) position 60 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  
    - Move the long/left (A) position 65 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  
    - Move the short/right (B) position 75 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  

**Minor Mitigations**  
- No other observed issues necessitate any actions.  

**Recommended:** Mitigation Package #1 adds many trees to this open space, separating fairways and, more importantly, blocking most flights from reaching any paths.

![Hole 4 & 13](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**Hole #4:** C remains C as no major mitigations are identified  
**Hole #13:** C remains C as no major mitigations are identified  

**Major concerns:** No major concerns; many minor concerns.  

**Major Mitigations**  
- No major concerns identified; no major mitigations needed.  

**Minor Mitigations**  
- **Recommended:** Pull the tee pad back at least 24” to enable a reasonable follow-through without bumping into the retaining at the front of the tee.  
- Add a tree on the right side of the fairway, fairly close to the tee, which blocks pulled drives from flying into the greens for #9/#18 B and C positions.  
- Create a drop zone for the mandatory near the mandatory itself, positioned so that the mando tree helps block another pulled shot. This will also enable visibility to basket positions that are blind from the tee.  
- Don’t play B position often, as it’s very close to the ideal drive on the adjacent fairway for #9/#18. Probably best to remove it.  
- **Recommended:** Add basket flags to both baskets to help players on the tee know where they’re throwing, to help them stay out of adjacent fairways. (Note: This report’s Google map shows a flag for each position, but a flag is only needed for each baskets – i.e., 2 flags, not 4.)  

Many minor mitigations could be helpful on #4/#13. For example, re-setting the tee pad so players have more room to follow-through before bumping into the retaining wall.

![Mitigation Packages](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+of+Miller+Park+Disc+Golf+Course)

Mitigation Packages (details in Mitigation Packages section above)
- Package #1 (recommended) would not impact this hole.
- Package #2 (optional) would impact this hole, somewhat indirectly.
  - To make room for a new hole between current #6/#15 and #7/#16, both the tee and the basket positions would be pulled back roughly 30 feet.
- Package #3 (optional) would impact this hole slightly. The tee area would be one of the 3 entry points into the wooded southwest quadrant of the course, which will otherwise be fenced off.

Looking back over the crown toward a tee area which is largely blind from deeper in the fairway.  
Recommended: Basket flags would help players know where the intended targets are located.

# Hole #5: C- becomes B- if highlighted mitigations are applied
# Hole #14: C- becomes B- if highlighted mitigations are applied

## Major concern: 
Overthrows from the tee and fairway can easily cross the gravel path; some minor concerns.

## Major Mitigations
- **Recommended:** Eliminate the path/parking access and parking spots behind the baskets. This yields roughly 15 more feet playable space behind the baskets.
  - Recommend keeping the posts as the OB line behind the baskets, to discourage players from being aggressive running the baskets given the extra room.
  
- **Recommended:** Install ~50 feet of 5- or 6-foot fence from near #6/#15 tee, tying into the court fence of same height. Will prevent most people from walking behind the baskets.

## Minor Mitigations
- Add netting to the fence of the utility enclosure, extending the height another 4 feet. This should reduce the number of players who try to retrieve discs inside the enclosure.
  
- Plant two trees on the left side to block flights that go around the left mando.
  
- Restore the B (short left) post to standard height, so that aggressive shots fly lower past the baskets – reducing the height of the disc across the path or even into the practice area.
  - In which case, a basket flag might help players see the basket.
  
- If the major mitigations above are not applied, install an 8-foot fence just inside the wood posts, starting near #6/#15 tee and ending where the parking wall squares up – roughly 115 feet.

**Recommended:** Remove parking area and add a fence to largely eliminate the risk of people walking behind the baskets.
<!-- Page 161 -->
![Mitigation Packages](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Mitigation+Packages)

- **Mitigation Packages** (details in Mitigation Packages section above)
  - Package #1 (recommended) would not impact this hole.
  - Package #2 (optional) would impact this hole, somewhat indirectly.
    - To make room for a new hole between current #6/#15 and #7/#16, this tee might be moved ~25 feet downhill. Then, to recover the lost distance and end up with two holes of the same distance as before, the B position (currently short, left) would be moved to near the current #6/#15 tee. This assumes, as shown in the preliminary design for Package #2, that a fence has been installed as a backstop.
  - Package #3 (optional) would potentially impact this hole, but essentially redundant to the individual recommended changes above: removing the parking area and fencing off the path.

![Extending the fence on the utility enclosures would reduce attempts to retrieve discs.](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Extending+the+fence+on+the+utility+enclosures+would+reduce+attempts+to+retrieve+discs.)

Lowering the B basket would reduce high flights over path and toward the practice courts.

**Recommended**: Remove parking access and parking spots, install fence to greatly reduce foot traffic behind baskets.

# Hole #6: D becomes C if highlighted mitigations are applied
# Hole #15: D becomes C if highlighted mitigations are applied

**Major concern:** Blind flights from the tee which are intended to fly directly down a well-worn social trail; some minor concerns.

## Major Mitigations

- **Recommended:** Move the tee to an elevated position near the school fence.
  - Path visibility will be greatly improved. Much less likely to throw when someone is on the path.
  - Pulling the hole back – both tee and baskets ~65 feet back – means flights over the crest of the hill will be traveling more slowly vs current situation where well-thrown flights are just past their mid-point.
  - **Installation notes:**
    - The flat spot aside the school fence may need to be widened and reinforced.
    - The path to/from the tee will need durable natural steps (e.g., railroad ties w/ gravel) to ensure easy ingress and egress in all weather conditions.
    - **Recommended:** The school fence should be extended to 10-feet-high if possible, for roughly 100 feet in length. Deflections over the fence will not be common even without the extension; nonetheless, worthwhile to reduce the minor safety concern and potential nuisance.
    - Some minor tree trimming would be needed to open up the intended flight path.
    - If Package 2 is applied, the new hole would be as challenging as the existing hole, perhaps more. The extra ~65 feet of distance at the tee nearly offsets pulling the baskets ~70 feet forward. If Package 2 is not applied, the longest position on this hole might be considered a par 4.
  - **Incidental:** This makes room for a new basket position on the preceding hole – especially useful if Package 2 is applied. (see details in #5/#14 info above)

- **Recommended:** Route non-golfers clockwise through the wooded course area, starting near tee #6/#15, exiting along the fence near tee #8/#17.
  - This helps avoid the worst-case scenario where a walker is coming over the hill toward the throwers and they can’t see each other to avoid the risk. If the walker is heading the same direction as the players, the players will wait and walkers will normally keep moving after they disappear over the hill.
  - After the walkers clear the fairway for #6/#15, they will remain highly visible to players on #7/#16, #8/#17, and #9/#18 – very little risk compared to walking into flights on #6/#15.
  - **Recommended:** Signs should be installed at each end to encourage clockwise direction, and perhaps mid-trail as well.
  - Natural materials should be used to define the trail so that people consistently pass through on the safest route, with a consideration of efficiency, slope, and erosion – e.g., peeler core or rocks or something which periodically defines the location of the trail.

- **Recommended:** As detailed on hole #5/#14 mitigation notes, a fence will be installed starting near the current #6/#15 tee – where the swinging gate is located – and connecting to the practice court.
<!-- Page 164 -->
![Whirlwind Disc Golf – Miller Park Disc Golf Course – Sept 16, 2024](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768)

**Minor Mitigations**
- Add netting to the fence of the utility enclosure, extending the height another 4 feet. This should reduce the number of players who try to retrieve discs inside the enclosure.
- Rebuild the terracing up to the B position to ensure safe footing in all weather conditions.

**Mitigation Packages (details in Mitigation Packages section above)**
- **Package #1 (recommended)** would not impact this hole.
- **Package #2 (optional)** would impact this hole, somewhat indirectly. The relocation of this tee box is recommended here, whether or not Package #2, which includes the same relocation, is applied. The main impact of Package #2 would be shortening this hole -- not much, given the new tee -- so that there’s room for another hole down the same fairway as the existing #6/#15.
- **Package #3 (optional)** would impact this hole slightly. The tee area would be one of the 3 entry points into the wooded southwest quadrant of the course, which will otherwise be fenced off.

**Current tee on #6/#15 is blind over the crest of the hill. Good shots fly right through the space where most walkers go.**

**Recommended: New tee on #6/#15 is elevated and pulled back ~65 feet. Increases path visibility, reduces speed of discs which crest of the hill. New tree and fence extension help keep discs out of the school yard.**

![Hole 7 & 16](https://example.com/hole7_16_image)

# Hole #7: C becomes B- if highlighted mitigations are applied
# Hole #16: C- becomes C+ if highlighted mitigations are applied

## Major concern:
Flights from tee landing near creek or long right where non-golfers, including kids, may not be visible when throwing; some minor concerns.

## Major Mitigations:
- **Recommended:** Install a 4-foot or 6-foot fence about 45 feet beyond the B position, roughly 90 feet long, running from playground down near the creek.
  - **Recommended:** Put standard disc golf caution signs at both ends of the fence.
  - Angle the fence so that people sitting on the bench at the west side of the playground have clear line of sight down to the creek.

## Minor Mitigations:
- Plant roughly 70 feet of hedge or some sort of natural screen on the playground side of the fence that runs from playground down to the creek.
  - If lacking a natural screen, a taller fence is preferable, as kids may climb over the 4-foot fence more often than a 6-foot fence.
  - Without a natural screen, the fence will look ugly.
- **Recommended:** Extend the fence suggested above all the way across the creek to the base of the hill, below fairway for #9/#18. This would be more effective keeping kids away from disc flights.
  - Concern that having a fence across the creek could be a maintenance or safety issue itself.
- Move the wood bridge roughly 30 feet downstream of current location. This would be more visible to players on the tee, and less useful for non-golfers crossing to get to/from playground and picnic areas.
- Preserve the overhanging branches above the drop zone; restore if lost. The branches block many flights that would otherwise fly around the corner, possibly where kids are unseen along the creek.
- Don’t play (or remove) the B position on subsequent hole #8/#17, as it’s very much in play on this hole, especially when playing to the A position. (more detail in #8/#17 recommendations below)
- Install two more caution signs, roughly 30 feet on either side of existing caution sign near the picnic area.
- If no fence, then move B position ~30 feet shorter and add more caution signs.

## Mitigation Packages (details in Mitigation Packages section above)
- Package #1 (recommended) would not impact this hole.
- Package #2 (optional) would not impact this hole.
- Package #3 (optional) would impact this hole slightly. The clockwise-trail would run close to the tee area, but visibility would be excellent with extremely low risk of someone getting hit near the tee.

**Recommended:** 4-foot fence running from the playground across the creek, along the camera location toward the bench at the west side of the playground. Placed to the shady side of the tree at each end.  

![Image 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+2)  
Looking east, this section of creek is ~120 feet from the recommended fence to the path/bridge.

**Hole #8: B- remains B- as no major mitigations are identified**  
**Hole #17: B- remains B- as no major mitigations are identified**

**Major concern:** No major concerns; some minor concerns.

**Minor Mitigations**
- No major concerns identified; no major mitigations needed.
- Though not a major concern from a safety perspective, the shelter and mandos are insufficient to stop pulled drives from going at/over the fence along the property line.  
  - **Recommended:** Plant two trees roughly 20 & 30 feet from tee, between the shelter and first mando on right.  
  - (if blocking trees are not planted) Create a drop zone at the mandatory itself, rather than giving the inaccurate player a chance to make the same mistake from the tee.
- B position is in the fairway for the preceding hole #7/#16 – located short, left where many drives that hole might land.  
  - Remove B position completely as it’s less safe and less fun than the other positions.
- I decided later to add another position to this hole – possibly for repair of the A or C positions – find a new place within this fairway.
- Remove the blackberry bushes “inside circle one” (within 10 meters) behind the C position.

*The tee on #8/#17 is very close to a reservable picnic area, but there’s just enough room.*

**Recommended:** New trees on #17 will block most shots flying between the shelter and mando, toward the property line fence. This should reduce the need for net maintenance and also reduce trespassing.

Hole #9: B- remains B- as no major mitigations are identified  
Hole #18: B- remains B- as no major mitigations are identified  

**Major concern:** No major concerns; several minor concerns.  

**Major Mitigations**  
- No major concerns identified; no major mitigations needed.  

**Minor Mitigations**  
- Recommended: Add basket flags to both baskets to help players on the tee know where they’re throwing, to help them stay out of adjacent fairways. (Note: This report’s Google map shows a flag for each position, but a flag is only needed for each baskets – i.e., 2 flags, not 3.)  
- Planting a new tree on the right edge of the fairway, about 80 feet off the tee, would help keep drive out of the greens on #4/#13 and even landing areas for #6/#15.  
- As noted above, the B position on #4/#13 is at the edge of this fairway, very much in play for accurate drives. It shouldn’t be played often, if at all.  
- The makeshift dirt steps down from A position toward the creek could be improved for year-round safe footing.  

*Erosion and maintenance are factors in the sloped areas near greens on #9/#18.*

# MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS: ENTIRE COURSE

Mitigations listed below each hole are grouped by Major and Minor.

- The Major concern(s) below, if any, are copy-pasted from the Site Assessment above.
- The mitigation of Major concerns should be considered non-negotiable – i.e., it’s a question of when, not if.
- The mitigation of Minor concerns is valuable, but not essential. A cost-effective approach is recommended.

## Major concern: At times, the course area is crowded with non-golfers, especially the grassy meadow on school days (holes 1-3, 10-12). Mitigations:

- **Recommended mitigation: Closing the course when it’s crowded with school kids.**
  - **Setting a time for course closure.**
    - Ideally, a simple closure framework would be established so that frequent players could remember easily. However, the school has different times for the end of the school day, depending on grade (kindergarten vs K-6), and day of week (Thursdays are earlier).
    - Ideally, given that the kids usually flow through the park and course areas for no more than 30 minutes, a one-hour closure should be sufficient.
    - **Recommended:** Update the course signage and UDisc info with precise times for the regular bell schedule – including different grades and different days.
    - **Recommended closure times:**
      - Observed: High number of non-golfers on the course was typically ~30 minutes before school, 45-60 minutes after school.
      - Morning and lunch: Every day 8:00-9:00 am & 12:00-1:30 pm
      - Afternoon: Thursdays: 2:00-3:30 pm. All other days 3:00-4:30 pm.
      - Special schedules: An hour before school starts and 90 minutes after school ends.

[School Schedule](https://leqette.sanjuan.edu/our-school/bell-schedule)

- **Closing the whole course vs closing certain holes.**
  - Various mitigations above, including official recommendations, should reduce the number of kids in high-risk areas of the course. Those mitigations would be most effective in the wooded area (holes #4/#13 to #9/#18) where kids are less of a concern, compared to the holes in the grassy meadow.
  - **Recommendation:** For simplicity, close the entire course, not just some holes.
    - **Also recommended:** This decision should be revisited within 2-3 months of re-setting the hours and implementing the specified mitigations. If foot traffic through the wooded area has been reduced and/or directed clockwise through fairway #6/#15—and if compliance with the course closure has been excellent—then the wooded area could remain open, on a trial basis. Hopefully, this opportunity would motivate for compliance. (see more re compliance below.)

- Communicating the park closure time.
  - Currently, there are two sets of signs at the park and/or online communicating different time periods for closure. (see below)
  - Recommended: Place a barricade on the first tee when the course is closed.
    - Who can do this? Perhaps a school safety officer. If they do so before and after the rush of kids, perhaps this won’t be too much of a hassle. Or maybe parents, who ideally wouldn’t be asked, would nonetheless be the best candidates for this task.
    - Where is the barricade stored when not on the first tee? If somebody official is responsible, it could be chained to the information board near the first tee – where it will be visible when not in effect.
    - Additional mitigation, but not as essential: Put identical barricades on holes 4, 6, and 8.
  - Recommended: Ensure the information board emphasizes the closure times – as it currently does, but perhaps even more prominently. This is a mutual responsibility of the park dept and the club.
  - Recommended: Ensure UDisc emphasizes the closure times. It’s good that the information board includes a QR code for the course information. Keeping UDisc updated is a club responsibility.

- Enforcing the park closure time.
  - Carrot: Per above, if compliance is very good – let’s say no more than 20 players violate the closure in a given month (that’s about 1-2% of all the rounds played) – then the back 6 wooded holes could remain open on a trial basis of no specific duration. (As above, this assumes the aforementioned mitigations have also been effective in reducing/controlling foot traffic in that area.)
    - Acknowledged: Getting an accurate count of non-compliance will be difficult. The obvious scorekeeper would be park staff. Moreover, it’s likely to be undercounted, as nobody’s going to be counting every closure period. Might be worthwhile for park staff to drop by during these times, especially after the new standards and communications have been established.

- Stick: If compliance is poor – let’s say more than 20 players violate the closure in any week of a given month – then:
  - The clock to qualify for the carrot (above) starts over in the following month.
  - If compliance is poor more than 2 months in a row, the morning and afternoon closure periods will be changed from one hour to two hours for at least two months for the rest of the current month and all of the following month.
  
- If non-compliance persists, further restriction of access may be necessary – although, as above re barricades on tees, it may be unclear or difficult who would perform these tasks:
  - Put covers on baskets during course closures. Covers could be anything from plastic trash bags to custom lockage canvas covers.
  - Periodically issue citations to violators, with potential financial penalties. And publicize any such enforcement to deter others.

- Guiding the kids to areas that are less likely to impact safety on the course.
  - To repeat some of the recommended mitigations that have been referenced above:
    - Closing the path behind the baskets on #5/#14 so that school kids use the paved path near the tennis courts.
    - In the same area behind #5/#14, put a fence which funnels foot traffic past the tee on #6/#15 – to some extent impeding the number of kids, not just making their location more predictable.
    - Installing a fence and natural barrier from the playground down to the creek, greatly reducing foot traffic near the baskets on #7/#16.
    - Additional mitigations are included in this report which could further reduce high-risk foot traffic – e.g., fencing the entire wooded area, leaving only 3 entry points. Those mitigations are not officially recommended as they don’t appear to have enough positive impact to offset the cost, complexity, or potential detriment to the character of the park.
    - Increasing kids’ awareness of disc golf so that they enter a fairway or green, they know how to look for golfers and discs in flight.
      - It will be difficult to ‘move the needle’ on this. The kids are young and it’s great for them to be able to run around the park without worrying about things like golf discs. Nonetheless, there’s no harm in encouraging this awareness.
      - Perhaps add a barricade sign near the top of the ramp above the bathroom, where most of the kids will flow into the park after school, which says something like “Disc Golf Course Ahead” with a big, fun, colorful graphic.
      - Further invest in school programs for kids to learn to play, either on campus or at the course.
      - Maybe the course is open *only* to school kids and their families during the “closure” hours.

Major concern: Non-golfers in fairways are at risk because players can’t see them from the tee.
- Recommended mitigation: Routing non-golfers clockwise through the wooded course area, starting near tee #6/#15, exiting along the fence near tee #8/#17. (See more details in the Hole-by-Hole mitigation notes above for hole #6/#15.)

Minor concern: Signage around the course is much better than typical courses, in terms of quality of message, frequency, and locations.
- A few additional caution signs may be worthwhile. (additional are mentioned in Hole-by-Hole report)
  - At the intersection of the main path and the offshoot path to the playground. Positioned to be visible to people heading from the playground onto the main path.
  - Near the fence to the right of the shelter next to #8/#17 tee. (This is already part of the recommended mitigation to encourage a one-way clockwise trail along the edge of the course, starting at the #6/#15 tee and exiting here. For more details, see Hole-by-Hole mitigation notes for #6/#15 below.)
  - At the base of the natural steps on the left side of #9/#18 fairway.
<!-- Page 177 -->
- At the edge of the reservable picnic area where it meets the grass, near #2/#11 tee. Positioned to be visible from the picnic area. (Mitigation of risk associated with this picnic area is detailed above.)
- In the grass north of the tennis courts, facing people as they are about to enter the greens for the long positions on hole #2/#11.

- Mandatory signs could be larger and brighter. Good that “mandatory” was recently printed on them.

# Guiding Principles of Disc Golf Course Design

## PREPARATION (5 PRINCIPLES)
* **Know the Land** -- the terrain, the flora, the fauna, the shapes, the colors, the wind, the water, and the seasons; *highlight the strengths, protect the vulnerabilities*.
* **Know the Equipment** -- the discs, the tees, the baskets, and the signs; *make it tangible*.
* **Know the Players** -- the skills, the tendencies, the values, the events, the demographics, and the local courses; *identify the target player(s)*.
* **Know the Community** -- the activities, the values, the demographics, and the local sites; *win their support*.
* **Know the Decision Makers** -- the motivation, the decision process, and the budget; *commit to their success*.

## DESIGN (10 PRINCIPLES)
* **(Safety) Consider Chaos** -- wayward shots, oblivious users, big crowds, and rough weather; *account for outliers*.
* **(Variety) Use Every Disc** -- left/right, high/low, up/down, tight/open, upwind/crosswind/downwind, long/short, multiple tees, and multiple baskets; *mix it up*!
* **(Scoring distribution) Penalize Failure & Reward Excellence** -- distance, accuracy, versatility, creativity, excellence; *make it count*!
* **(Strategy) Make Players Think About Shots** -- risk/reward, flight paths, wind angles, slope, landing areas, variety of greens; *provide interesting choices*.
* **(Flow) Don't Make Players Think About the Course** -- navigation, lost discs, tough footing, natural hazards, wayward shots; *keep their heads in the game*.
* **(Wind & Elevation) Amplify Nature** -- wind angles, elevation changes, ground covers, sun angles, and seasonal foliage; *harness the elements*.
* **(Signature Hole) Highlight the Wow** -- unique terrain, aesthetic beauty, extreme risk/reward, dramatic alleys, and unusual flight shapes; *give them something to remember*.
* **(Flight) Maximize Air Time** -- gliding, curving, and even rolling and skipping; *let it fly*!
* **(Holistic) Reflect the Big Picture** -- take everything into account, including site limitations, site logistics, organizations/people/politics, club support, events, etc; *the whole truth, nothing but the truth*.
* **(Sustainability) Design and Install for 10 Years From Now** -- usage rates, skill levels, tree changes, terrain changes, maintenance, stewardship, and future land plans; *sustain the success*.

# Summary of Comments Received by Attendees at Miller Park Disc Golf Public Outreach Meeting

**Attendees**

**Meeting Date:** October 3rd, 2024  
**Meeting Time:** 6 pm  
**Meeting Place:** Miller Park  

- One attendee asked if the Whirlwind Disc Golf (Safety Survey contractor) ever came out to Miller Park during the hours when school is getting out of session.  
  - The contractor confirmed that they were present during those times.  
- Next door neighbor asked if trees planted near their fence were intended to aid with keeping disc golf separate.  
  - Staff responded in the affirmative  
    - Neighbor demanded they be removed due to not wanting trees to touch their fence or the possibility of shade on their vegetable garden.  
- Next door neighbor stated that over 300 discs flew over their fence and the disc golf players were bothersome in attempting to get the discs back.  
- Next door neighbor stated that the disc golf course was enabling more marijuana use within the park.  
- Next door neighbor stated that people were engaging in intercourse too close to her fence due to the sound barrier designed to reduce noise levels from disc golfers near property line being loud.  
- Next door neighbor stated that the course was an irritant and should be removed.  
- An attendee requested documentation from Whirlwind Disc Golf regarding their knowledge of injury rates occurring on disc golf courses.  
  - Whirlwind Disc Golf contractor admitted that much of that knowledge was anecdotal, as comprehensive studies as to injury rates aren’t available.  
- An attendee asked whether the close proximity to Earl Legette Elementary School got taken into consideration prior to the installation of the disc golf course.  
- An attendee stated that Earl Legette Elementary School no longer allows children close to the school’s northern fence line due to disc golfers.  
- Several attendees stated that disc golfers were regularly shouting at children.  
- Several attendees expressed their desire to remove the disc golf course.  
- Several attendees expressed their desire for the course to be moved to a different park.  
- An attendee expressed their desire for the District to find a solution for homeless encampments within the park that was something other than a disc golf course.  
- An attendee stated that families are no longer going to Miller Park because of the presence of the disc golf course.  
- Attendees expressed that the additional signage was appreciated but ineffective.  
- Several attendees stated that the park was too small for a disc golf course.  
- Several attendees questioned what the next steps they can take might be, whether the disc golf safety survey would be appearing on the October Board Agenda, and what the timeline for change might be.  
<!-- Page 201 -->
- An attendee who requested to speak in private stated that the District needed to make a task force to make decisions about the course by utilizing staff from the Fire Department, the Sheriff’s office, the local school Board, and County supervisors. The attendee then offered their services in organizing this task force for the District.

# MITIGATION OPTIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS: HOLE-BY-HOLE

Mitigations listed below each hole are grouped by Major and Minor.

- The Major concern(s) below, if any, are copy-pasted from the Site Assessment above.
- The mitigation of Major concerns should be considered non-negotiable – i.e., it’s a question of when, not if.
- The mitigation of Minor concerns is valuable, but not essential. A cost-effective approach is recommended.

**Hole #1:** C- becomes B- if highlighted mitigations are applied  
**Hole #10:** C- becomes B- if highlighted mitigations are applied  

**Major concerns:** Pulled flights from the tee that miss the mando; overthrows and pulled shots (both from the tee and fairway) that cross the pedestrian path.

**Major Mitigations:**

- **Recommended: Mitigation Package #1.** (details above)  
  - Package #1 adds many trees to the fairway to block errant shots from reaching paths. It also separates the fairways well – a lower priority here.  
  - Package #2 would also work. (Details above.)

- **(applicable whether or not either Package is used)** Prevent errant shots from flying across the early right path toward basketball court. **Recommended:** Choose one of these two.  
  - Move the tee to the left of the information kiosk, so that two existing olive trees block most pulled flights.  
    - This also eliminates the need for the mandatory.  
    - It also adds a few feet to the hole, given that other mitigations shorten the hole.  
    - It will necessitate relocation of the practice basket.  
  - Plant two trees with low canopies (e.g., olive trees) to the forward right of the tee, creating a barrier to block most pulled flights.  
    - Keep the mandatory.  
    - **Note:** This mitigation would be slightly less impactful in conjunction with Package 2, as the new hole would be shifted away from the path.

- **Recommended:** Move the baskets away from the path  
  - **(applicable if using Package #1)** Move the baskets 45 feet from nearest path  
    - Move the long/left (A) position 20 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  
    - Move the short/right (B) position 35 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  
  - **(applicable if not using either Package #1 or #2)** Move the baskets 60 feet from nearest path  
    - Move the long/left (A) position 35 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  
    - Move the short/right (B) position 55 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  

**Minor Mitigations:**

- **(if tee is not relocated)** Create a drop zone for the mandatory near the mandatory itself, positioned so that the mando tree helps block another pulled shot.

**Insight**

Overthrows tend to be proportionate to the distance of the throw. The farther the flight to the basket, the more space should be provided between the basket and any risky areas behind it. My rule of thumb -- for unobstructed flights over level ground with negligible wind – is 20 feet + 15% of the farthest common distance that reaches the basket. On a 300-foot hole where a significant number of players can reach the basket from the tee, the recommended buffer would be 65 feet behind the basket (20 + (3*15)).

**Possible relocation of tee on #1/#10.** Info kiosk and trees prevent pulled shots from crossing the path near the basketball court.

**Grassy meadow where 10-20 new trees could separate fairways for the first 3 holes and create barriers to discs flying across the path.**

![Hole 2 & 11 Sign](https://example.com/hole_sign_image)

**Hole #2:** D becomes C+ if highlighted mitigations are applied  
**Hole #11:** D becomes C+ if highlighted mitigations are applied  

**Major concerns:** Pulled flights from the tee toward BBQ/picnic people who are very close to the tee; several minor concerns.  

Although the probability is very low, this is the most likely location for a very serious injury.  

**Major Mitigations:**  
- **Recommended:** Relocate or remove both BBQ grills so that people are less likely to stand within 15 feet of the flight path of an ideal throw.  
  - (and/or) Add an 8-foot-tall, 40-foot-long fence or mesh barrier between the tee and the picnic shelter, parallel to the fairway. It would be ugly, but a natural hedge wouldn’t work because it would conceal people who might walk around it.  
  - (or) Move the tee up 40 feet. If grills are re-located, moving up 30 feet would be sufficient.  

**Minor Mitigations:**  
- **Recommended:** Remove the bench near the walkway junction at the middle of the tennis courts. It gets little use.  
  - (and/or) Plant roughly 80 feet of 6-foot edge along the path parallel to the middle set of tennis courts, ending slightly beyond the bench’s current location.  
- Remove the seldom-used paved path near the B and C basket positions.  
  - The last 100 feet from the Y side B position is particularly suitable for this mitigation, as path use is very low and risk is highest near the baskets.  
  - The previous 100 feet would also make sense, resulting in a clean line where the path makes a 90-degree turn at the east-west junction of the path.  
  - Putting grass here would greatly improve the aesthetic and playability of the hole. No more rough skips on the paths. No more fairly random OB penalties.  
  - **Note:** Removing the full ~200 feet would be fantastic, but it’s not sufficiently high-risk to make the official recommendation list.  

- Put a 4-foot-high fence, running north-south from the tennis courts to the edge of the grass at the road, starting about 20 feet from the corner of the courts.  
  - If the optional mitigation to move #1/#10 tee is implemented, the practice basket should probably move. This area would be one of the two obvious places to relocate it – so the fence wouldn’t work in that scenario.  
  - Again, there’s very little play around the corner of the courts and visibility through the courts’ fence is good – but if players are inclined to play the current C position or temporary positions further around the corner, then the fence becomes somewhat more useful.  

**Mitigation Packages** (details in Mitigation Packages section above)  
- As described above, **Package #1 (recommended)** greatly impacts this hole.  
- Package #2 (optional) would impact this hole. It would be renumbered as #9/#18.  
- Package #3 (optional) would not impact this hole.

**Strongly recommended:** Both BBQ grills should be relocated, ideally south of the shelter. People standing at the grills are only 15 feet from where ideal shots are intended to fly – very much exposed to errant shots pulled hard to the right from the tee.

**Recommended:** The bench on the right side of the fairway should be relocated. Pulled shots don't fly to beyond this bench often, but it's not rare enough to accept the risk.

**Optional mitigation:** Replacing seldom-used path with grass. Would reduce pedestrian traffic, and increase golf fun. Priority would be the last ~100 feet from the flat Y, down to the street. All ~200 feet, from the corner of the tennis court, would be ideal.

![Hole 3 and Hole 12 Disc Golf Course Sign](https://example.com/image.png)

**Hole #3:** C- becomes B- if highlighted mitigations are applied  
**Hole #12:** C- becomes B- if highlighted mitigations are applied  

**Major Concerns:** Overthrows and pulled shots that cross the pedestrian paths (both from the tee and from the fairway); some minor concerns.

**Major Mitigations**  
- **Recommended: Mitigation Package #1.** (details above)  
  - Package #1 adds many trees to fairway to block long throws from reaching paths. It also separates the fairways well – a lower priority here.  
  - Package #2 would also work. (Details above.)  

- **Recommended: Move the baskets away from the paths.**  
  - The new distance would be much shorter, as the baskets reside in/near peninsula with paths on 3 sides.  
  - It’s very risky to have busy and/or blind paths in play with regularity, even if the disc is usually flying slowly.  
  - (applicable if using Package #1) Move the baskets 45 feet from nearest path.  
    - Move the long/left (A) position 55 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  
    - Move the short/right (B) position 60 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  
    - Move the long/left (A) position 65 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  
    - Move the short/right (B) position 75 feet shorter and slightly left (from tee perspective)  

**Minor Mitigations**  
- No other observed issues necessitate any actions.  

**Recommended:** Mitigation Package #1 adds many trees to this open space, separating fairways and, more importantly, blocking most flights from reaching any paths.

![Hole 4 & 13](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**Hole #4:** C remains C as no major mitigations are identified  
**Hole #13:** C remains C as no major mitigations are identified  

**Major concerns:** No major concerns; many minor concerns.  

**Major Mitigations**  
- No major concerns identified; no major mitigations needed.  

**Minor Mitigations**  
- **Recommended:** Pull the tee pad back at least 24” to enable a reasonable follow-through without bumping into the retaining at the front of the tee.  
- Add a tree on the right side of the fairway, fairly close to the tee, which blocks pulled drives from flying into the greens for #9/#18 B and C positions.  
- Create a drop zone for the mandatory near the mandatory itself, positioned so that the mando tree helps block another pulled shot. This will also enable visibility to basket positions that are blind from the tee.  
- Don’t play B position often, as it’s very close to the ideal drive on the adjacent fairway for #9/#18. Probably best to remove it.  
- **Recommended:** Add basket flags to both baskets to help players on the tee know where they’re throwing, to help them stay out of adjacent fairways. (Note: This report’s Google map shows a flag for each position, but a flag is only needed for each baskets – i.e., 2 flags, not 4.)  

Many minor mitigations could be helpful on #4/#13. For example, re-setting the tee pad so players have more room to follow-through before bumping into the retaining wall.

![Mitigation Packages](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+of+Miller+Park+Disc+Golf+Course)

Mitigation Packages (details in Mitigation Packages section above)
- Package #1 (recommended) would not impact this hole.
- Package #2 (optional) would impact this hole, somewhat indirectly.
  - To make room for a new hole between current #6/#15 and #7/#16, both the tee and the basket positions would be pulled back roughly 30 feet.
- Package #3 (optional) would impact this hole slightly. The tee area would be one of the 3 entry points into the wooded southwest quadrant of the course, which will otherwise be fenced off.

Looking back over the crown toward a tee area which is largely blind from deeper in the fairway.  
Recommended: Basket flags would help players know where the intended targets are located.

# Hole #5: C- becomes B- if highlighted mitigations are applied
# Hole #14: C- becomes B- if highlighted mitigations are applied

## Major concern: 
Overthrows from the tee and fairway can easily cross the gravel path; some minor concerns.

## Major Mitigations
- **Recommended:** Eliminate the path/parking access and parking spots behind the baskets. This yields roughly 15 more feet playable space behind the baskets.
  - Recommend keeping the posts as the OB line behind the baskets, to discourage players from being aggressive running the baskets given the extra room.
  
- **Recommended:** Install ~50 feet of 5- or 6-foot fence from near #6/#15 tee, tying into the court fence of same height. Will prevent most people from walking behind the baskets.

## Minor Mitigations
- Add netting to the fence of the utility enclosure, extending the height another 4 feet. This should reduce the number of players who try to retrieve discs inside the enclosure.
  
- Plant two trees on the left side to block flights that go around the left mando.
  
- Restore the B (short left) post to standard height, so that aggressive shots fly lower past the baskets – reducing the height of the disc across the path or even into the practice area.
  - In which case, a basket flag might help players see the basket.
  
- If the major mitigations above are not applied, install an 8-foot fence just inside the wood posts, starting near #6/#15 tee and ending where the parking wall squares up – roughly 115 feet.

**Recommended:** Remove parking area and add a fence to largely eliminate the risk of people walking behind the baskets.

![Mitigation Packages](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Mitigation+Packages+details+in+Mitigation+Packages+section+above)

- Package #1 (recommended) would not impact this hole.
  
- Package #2 (optional) would impact this hole, somewhat indirectly.
  - To make room for a new hole between current #6/#15 and #7/#16, this tee might be moved ~25 feet downhill. Then, to recover the lost distance and end up with two holes of the same distance as before, the B position (currently short, left) would be moved to near the current #6/#15 tee. This assumes, as shown in the preliminary design for Package #2, that a fence has been installed as a backstop.

- Package #3 (optional) would potentially impact this hole, but essentially redundant to the individual recommended changes above: removing the parking area and fencing off the path.

![Extending the fence on the utility enclosures would reduce attempts to retrieve discs.](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Extending+the+fence+on+the+utility+enclosures+would+reduce+attempts+to+retrieve+discs.)

![View from a proposed basket position near current #6/#15 tee. This position assumes the tee has been relocated and the gravel path has been blocked.](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=View+from+a+proposed+basket+position+near+current+#6/#15+tee.)

Lowering the B basket would reduce high flights over path and toward the practice courts.

**Recommended**: Remove parking access and parking spots, install fence to greatly reduce foot traffic behind baskets.

# Hole #6: D becomes C if highlighted mitigations are applied
# Hole #15: D becomes C if highlighted mitigations are applied

**Major concern:** Blind flights from the tee which are intended to fly directly down a well-worn social trail; some minor concerns.

## Major Mitigations

- **Recommended:** Move the tee to an elevated position near the school fence.
  - Path visibility will be greatly improved. Much less likely to throw when someone is on the path.
  - Pulling the hole back – both tee and baskets ~65 feet back – means flights over the crest of the hill will be traveling more slowly vs current situation where well-thrown flights are just past their mid-point.
  - **Installation notes:**
    - The flat spot aside the school fence may need to be widened and reinforced.
    - The path to/from the tee will need durable natural steps (e.g., railroad ties w/ gravel) to ensure easy ingress and egress in all weather conditions.
    - **Recommended:** The school fence should be extended to 10-feet-high if possible, for roughly 100 feet in length. Deflections over the fence will not be common even without the extension; nonetheless, worthwhile to reduce the minor safety concern and potential nuisance.
    - Some minor tree trimming would be needed to open up the intended flight path.
    - If Package 2 is applied, the new hole would be as challenging as the existing hole, perhaps more. The extra ~65 feet of distance at the tee nearly offsets pulling the baskets ~70 feet forward. If Package 2 is not applied, the longest position on this hole might be considered a par 4.
  - Incidental: This makes room for a new basket position on the preceding hole – especially useful if Package 2 is applied. (see details in #5/#14 info above)

- **Recommended:** Route non-golfers clockwise through the wooded course area, starting near tee #6/#15, exiting along the fence near tee #8/#17.
  - This helps avoid the worst-case scenario where a walker is coming over the hill toward the throwers and they can’t see each other to avoid the risk. If the walker is heading the same direction as the players, the players will wait and walkers will normally keep moving after they disappear over the hill.
  - After the walkers clear the fairway for #6/#15, they will remain highly visible to players on #7/#16, #8/#17, and #9/#18 – very little risk compared to walking into flights on #6/#15.
  - **Recommended:** Signs should be installed at each end to encourage clockwise direction, and perhaps mid-trail as well.
  - Natural materials should be used to define the trail so that people consistently pass through on the safest route, with a consideration of efficiency, slope, and erosion – e.g., peeler core or rocks or something which periodically defines the location of the trail.

- **Recommended:** As detailed on hole #5/#14 mitigation notes, a fence will be installed starting near the current #6/#15 tee – where the swinging gate is located – and connecting to the practice court.

![Current tee on #6/#15 is blind over the crest of the hill. Good shots fly right through the space where most walkers go.](https://via.placeholder.com/300x200) ![Recommended: New tee on #6/#15 is elevated and pulled back ~65 feet. Increases path visibility, reduces speed of discs which crest of the hill. New tree and fence extension help keep discs out of the school yard.](https://via.placeholder.com/300x200)

## Minor Mitigations
- Add netting to the fence of the utility enclosure, extending the height another 4 feet. This should reduce the number of players who try to retrieve discs inside the enclosure.
- Rebuild the terracing up to the B position to ensure safe footing in all weather conditions.

## Mitigation Packages (details in Mitigation Packages section above)
- **Package #1 (recommended)** would not impact this hole.
- **Package #2 (optional)** would impact this hole, somewhat indirectly. The relocation of this tee box is recommended here, whether or not Package #2, which includes the same relocation, is applied. The main impact of Package #2 would be shortening this hole -- not much, given the new tee -- so that there’s room for another hole down the same fairway as the existing #6/#15.
- **Package #3 (optional)** would impact this hole slightly. The tee area would be one of the 3 entry points into the wooded southwest quadrant of the course, which will otherwise be fenced off.

# Hole #7: C becomes B- if highlighted mitigations are applied
# Hole #16: C- becomes C+ if highlighted mitigations are applied

## Major concern:
Flights from tee landing near creek or long right where non-golfers, including kids, may not be visible when throwing; some minor concerns.

## Major Mitigations:
- **Recommended:** Install a 4-foot or 6-foot fence about 45 feet beyond the B position, roughly 90 feet long, running from playground down near the creek.
  - **Recommended:** Put standard disc golf caution signs at both ends of the fence.
  - Angle the fence so that people sitting on the bench at the west side of the playground have clear line of sight down to the creek.

## Minor Mitigations:
- Plant roughly 70 feet of hedge or some sort of natural screen on the playground side of the fence that runs from playground down to the creek.
  - If lacking a natural screen, a taller fence is preferable, as kids may climb over the 4-foot fence more often than a 6-foot fence.
  - Without a natural screen, the fence will look ugly.
- **Recommended:** Extend the fence suggested above all the way across the creek to the base of the hill, below fairway for #9/#18. This would be more effective keeping kids away from disc flights.
  - Concern that having a fence across the creek could be a maintenance or safety issue itself.
- Move the wood bridge roughly 30 feet downstream of current location. This would be more visible to players on the tee, and less useful for non-golfers crossing to get to/from playground and picnic areas.
- Preserve the overhanging branches above the drop zone; restore if lost. The branches block many flights that would otherwise fly around the corner, possibly where kids are unseen along the creek.
- Don’t play (or remove) the B position on subsequent hole #8/#17, as it’s very much in play on this hole, especially when playing to the A position. (more detail in #8/#17 recommendations below)
- Install two more caution signs, roughly 30 feet on either side of existing caution sign near the picnic area.
- If no fence, then move B position ~30 feet shorter and add more caution signs.

## Mitigation Packages (details in Mitigation Packages section above)
- Package #1 (recommended) would not impact this hole.
- Package #2 (optional) would not impact this hole.
- Package #3 (optional) would impact this hole slightly. The clockwise-trail would run close to the tee area, but visibility would be excellent with extremely low risk of someone getting hit near the tee.

**Recommended:** 4-foot fence running from the playground across the creek, along the camera location toward the bench at the west side of the playground. Placed to the shady side of the tree at each end.  

![Image 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+2)  
**Looking east, this section of creek is ~120 feet from the recommended fence to the path/bridge.**

**Hole #8: B- remains B- as no major mitigations are identified**  
**Hole #17: B- remains B- as no major mitigations are identified**

**Major concern:** No major concerns; some minor concerns.

**Minor Mitigations**
- No major concerns identified; no major mitigations needed.
- Though not a major concern from a safety perspective, the shelter and mandos are insufficient to stop pulled drives from going at/over the fence along the property line.  
  - **Recommended:** Plant two trees roughly 20 & 30 feet from tee, between the shelter and first mando on right.
  - (if blocking trees are not planted) Create a drop zone at the mandatory itself, rather than giving the inaccurate player a chance to make the same mistake from the tee.
- B position is in the fairway for the preceding hole #7/#16 – located short, left where many drives that hole might land.  
  - Remove B position completely as it’s less safe and less fun than the other positions.
- I decided later to add another position to this hole – possibly for repair of the A or C positions – find a new place within this fairway.
- Remove the blackberry bushes “inside circle one” (within 10 meters) behind the C position.

*The tee on #8/#17 is very close to a reservable picnic area, but there’s just enough room.*

**Recommended:** New trees on #17 will block most shots flying between the shelter and mando, toward the property line fence. This should reduce the need for net maintenance and also reduce trespassing.

![Hole 9 & 18](https://example.com/image.jpg)

Hole #9: B- remains B- as no major mitigations are identified  
Hole #18: B- remains B- as no major mitigations are identified  

**Major concern:** No major concerns; several minor concerns.  

**Major Mitigations**  
- No major concerns identified; no major mitigations needed.  

**Minor Mitigations**  
- Recommended: Add basket flags to both baskets to help players on the tee know where they’re throwing, to help them stay out of adjacent fairways. (Note: This report’s Google map shows a flag for each position, but a flag is only needed for each baskets – i.e., 2 flags, not 3.)  
- Planting a new tree on the right edge of the fairway, about 80 feet off the tee, would help keep drive out of the greens on #4/#13 and even landing areas for #6/#15.  
- As noted above, the B position on #4/#13 is at the edge of this fairway, very much in play for accurate drives. It shouldn’t be played often, if at all.  
- The makeshift dirt steps down from A position toward the creek could be improved for year-round safe footing.  

*Erosion and maintenance are factors in the sloped areas near greens on #9/#18.*

# MITIGATION RECOMMENDATIONS: ENTIRE COURSE

Mitigations listed below each hole are grouped by Major and Minor.

- The Major concern(s) below, if any, are copy-pasted from the Site Assessment above.
- The mitigation of Major concerns should be considered non-negotiable – i.e., it’s a question of when, not if.
- The mitigation of Minor concerns is valuable, but not essential. A cost-effective approach is recommended.

## Major concern: At times, the course area is crowded with non-golfers, especially the grassy meadow on school days (holes 1-3, 10-12). Mitigations:

- **Recommended mitigation: Closing the course when it’s crowded with school kids.**
  - **Setting a time for course closure.**
    - Ideally, a simple closure framework would be established so that frequent players could remember easily. However, the school has different times for the end of the school day, depending on grade (kindergarten vs K-6), and day of week (Thursdays are earlier).
    - Ideally, given that the kids usually flow through the park and course areas for no more than 30 minutes, a one-hour closure should be sufficient.
    - **Recommended:** Update the course signage and UDisc info with precise times for the regular bell schedule – including different grades and different days.
    - **Recommended closure times:**
      - Observed: High number of non-golfers on the course was typically ~30 minutes before school, 45-60 minutes after school.
      - Morning and lunch: Every day 8:00-9:00 am & 12:00-1:30 pm
      - Afternoon: Thursdays: 2:00-3:30 pm. All other days 3:00-4:30 pm.
      - Special schedules: An hour before school starts and 90 minutes after school ends.

[School Schedule](https://leqette.sanjuan.edu/our-school/bell-schedule)

- **Closing the whole course vs closing certain holes.**
  - Various mitigations above, including official recommendations, should reduce the number of kids in high-risk areas of the course. Those mitigations would be most effective in the wooded area (holes #4/#13 to #9/#18) where kids are less of a concern, compared to the holes in the grassy meadow.
  - **Recommendation:** For simplicity, close the entire course, not just some holes.
    - **Also recommended:** This decision should be revisited within 2-3 months of re-setting the hours and implementing the specified mitigations. If foot traffic through the wooded area has been reduced and/or directed clockwise through fairway #6/#15—and if compliance with the course closure has been excellent—then the wooded area could remain open, on a trial basis. Hopefully, this opportunity would motivate for compliance. (see more re compliance below.)

<!-- Page 226 -->
- Communicating the park closure time.
  - Currently, there are two sets of signs at the park and/or online communicating different time periods for closure. (see below)
  - Recommended: Place a barricade on the first tee when the course is closed.
    - Who can do this? Perhaps a school safety officer. If they do so before and after the rush of kids, perhaps this won’t be too much of a hassle. Or maybe parents, who ideally wouldn’t be asked, would nonetheless be the best candidates for this task.
    - Where is the barricade stored when not on the first tee? If somebody official is responsible, it could be chained to the information board near the first tee – where it will be visible when not in effect.
    - Additional mitigation, but not as essential: Put identical barricades on holes 4, 6, and 8.
  - Recommended: Ensure the information board emphasizes the closure times – as it currently does, but perhaps even more prominently. This is a mutual responsibility of the park dept and the club.
  - Recommended: Ensure UDisc emphasizes the closure times. It’s good that the information board includes a QR code for the course information. Keeping UDisc updated is a club responsibility.

- Enforcing the park closure time.
  - Carrot: Per above, if compliance is very good – let’s say no more than 20 players violate the closure in a given month (that’s about 1-2% of all the rounds played) – then the back 6 wooded holes could remain open on a trial basis of no specific duration. (As above, this assumes the aforementioned mitigations have also been effective in reducing/controlling foot traffic in that area.)
    - Acknowledged: Getting an accurate count of non-compliance will be difficult. The obvious scorekeeper would be park staff. Moreover, it’s likely to be undercounted, as nobody’s going to be counting every closure period. Might be worthwhile for park staff to drop by during these times, especially after the new standards and communications have been established.

- Stick: If compliance is poor – let’s say more than 20 players violate the closure in any week of a given month – then:
  - The clock to qualify for the carrot (above) starts over in the following month.
  - If compliance is poor more than 2 months in a row, the morning and afternoon closure periods will be changed from one hour to two hours for at least two months for the rest of the current month and all of the following month.
  - If non-compliance persists, further restriction of access may be necessary – although, as above re barricades on tees, it may be unclear or difficult who would perform these tasks:
    - Put covers on baskets during course closures. Covers could be anything from plastic trash bags to custom lockage canvas covers.
    - Periodically issue citations to violators, with potential financial penalties. And publicize any such enforcement to deter others.

- Guiding the kids to areas that are less likely to impact safety on the course.
  - To repeat some of the recommended mitigations that have been referenced above:
    - Closing the path behind the baskets on #5/#14 so that school kids use the paved path near the tennis courts.
    - In the same area behind #5/#14, put a fence which funnels foot traffic past the tee on #6/#15 – to some extent impeding the number of kids, not just making their location more predictable.
    - Installing a fence and natural barrier from the playground down to the creek, greatly reducing foot traffic near the baskets on #7/#16.
    - Additional mitigations are included in this report which could further reduce high-risk foot traffic – e.g., fencing the entire wooded area, leaving only 3 entry points. Those mitigations are not officially recommended as they don’t appear to have enough positive impact to offset the cost, complexity, or potential detriment to the character of the park.
    - Increasing kids’ awareness of disc golf so that they enter a fairway or green, they know how to look for golfers and discs in flight.
      - It will be difficult to ‘move the needle’ on this. The kids are young and it’s great for them to be able to run around the park without worrying about things like golf discs. Nonetheless, there’s no harm in encouraging this awareness.
      - Perhaps add a barricade sign near the top of the ramp above the bathroom, where most of the kids will flow into the park after school, which says something like “Disc Golf Course Ahead” with a big, fun, colorful graphic.
      - Further invest in school programs for kids to learn to play, either on campus or at the course.
      - Maybe the course is open *only* to school kids and their families during the “closure” hours.

Major concern: Non-golfers in fairways are at risk because players can’t see them from the tee.
- Recommended mitigation: Routing non-golfers clockwise through the wooded course area, starting near tee #6/#15, exiting along the fence near tee #8/#17. (See more details in the Hole-by-Hole mitigation notes above for hole #6/#15.)

Minor concern: Signage around the course is much better than typical courses, in terms of quality of message, frequency, and locations.
- A few additional caution signs may be worthwhile. (additional are mentioned in Hole-by-Hole report)
  - At the intersection of the main path and the offshoot path to the playground. Positioned to be visible to people heading from the playground onto the main path.
  - Near the fence to the right of the shelter next to #8/#17 tee. (This is already part of the recommended mitigation to encourage a one-way clockwise trail along the edge of the course, starting at the #6/#15 tee and exiting here. For more details, see Hole-by-Hole mitigation notes for #6/#15 below.)
  - At the base of the natural steps on the left side of #9/#18 fairway.
<!-- Page 228 -->
- At the edge of the reservable picnic area where it meets the grass, near #2/#11 tee. Positioned to be visible from the picnic area. (Mitigation of risk associated with this picnic area is detailed above.)
- In the grass north of the tennis courts, facing people as they are about to enter the greens for the long positions on hole #2/#11.

- Mandatory signs could be larger and brighter. Good that “mandatory” was recently printed on them.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** October 16th, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Approval of Public Art Policy  
**Prepared By:** Jen Schuler, Arts & Entertainment Manager  

I. **Recommendation**  
Approve Public Art Policy as recommended by the Policy Review Committee and forward it to the District’s contracted attorney for review.  

II. **Background**  
The Policy Review Committee met on October 7th, 2024, to review several new policies, including the Public Art Policy. This policy was developed in response to discussions surrounding public art projects and the need for a structured approach to how public art is commissioned, installed, and maintained within the district. The policy ensures the District has clear guidelines on community engagement, artist selection, and funding strategies for various projects, such as wrapping electrical boxes, painting benches, and memorializing murals.  

The only edits made were the removal of the appendix listing specific projects, allowing flexibility for maintenance agreements to be handled on a case-by-case basis. The Committee recommends that the full Board consider approving the Public Art Policy and submitting it for legal review by the District’s contracted attorney.  

III. **Problem /Situation / Request**  
The Public Art Policy was developed in response to the growing interest in public art projects within the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District. As the community continues to expand, there is increasing enthusiasm from residents, local businesses, and organizations to support public art initiatives that enhance the district’s cultural and aesthetic landscape. To manage this interest and ensure transparency, it became necessary to establish a formal policy guiding the selection, funding, and maintenance of public art, while encouraging community involvement.

![Public Art Policy for Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks District](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Public+Art+Policy+for+Fair+Oaks+Recreation+%26+Parks+District)

**PURPOSE:** The Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District is dedicated to enriching the community through public art that is accessible to all. This policy provides a clear framework for the selection, acquisition, installation, and maintenance of public art throughout District parks and facilities ensuring that public art is a vital part of daily community life.

**OBJECTIVES:**

- **Cultural Reflection and Identity:** Public art should reflect the diversity, history, and values of Fair Oaks while strengthening its community identity and pride.
- **Support Artists:** Provide opportunities for local and regional artists to contribute to public art projects.
- **Community Engagement:** Involve the community in the selection, creation, and maintenance of public art to ensure that it resonates with local culture and interests.
- **Artistic and Aesthetic Enrichment:** Incorporate art into public spaces to enhance their aesthetic appeal and create engaging, culturally meaningful environments.
- **Artist and District Collaboration:** Define a clear collaborative relationship between artists and the District to ensure that public art projects enhance community spaces.

**SCOPE:**

This policy applies to all public art projects commissioned, acquired, or displayed by the Fair Oaks Recreation & Parks District, including parks, public spaces, and facilities. It encompasses both permanent and temporary installations, ranging from murals and sculptures to functional art such as benches.

**FUNDING:**

- **Diverse Sources:** Public art will be funded through a variety of sources, including district capital improvement budgets, grants, private donations, business sponsorships, and a potential "percent-for-art" program where a percentage of capital improvement project budgets are allocated to public art.
- **Community Contributions:** Opportunities for direct community involvement in funding art projects, such as crowd-sourced funding, donor walls, and naming rights, will be explored to encourage community ownership and investment in the arts.

**SELECTION PROCESS:**

- **Open and Transparent:** The selection process will be inclusive and transparent, involving calls for artists, community input, and selection panels, appointed by FORPD Board that reflect the diversity of the district's population.
<!-- Page 232 -->
- **Equitable Representation:** Selection panels can be composed of FORPD Board Members, district staff, local artists, arts professionals, and community representatives to ensure diverse perspectives are considered.
- **Community Voice:** Art selection will involve community engagement, including workshops, surveys, and public forums to ensure the art reflects community interests and desires.
- **Criteria:** Artworks will be evaluated based on artistic merit, relevance to the community, inclusivity, durability, maintenance and restoration requirements, environmental impact, and public safety.

1. **Artist Calls and Community Input:**
   - Publicly announced calls for artists, ensuring wide visibility to attract diverse artistic contributions.
   - Public announcements will be made on all district owned social media platforms, as well as through electronic mail services (email blasts). If appropriate and aligned with printing the district will include the call in considered publications.
   - Facilitate community workshops or meetings where residents can provide input on the type of art they wish to see in their public spaces.

2. **Selection Committee:**
   - Form a selection committee that could include artists, community leaders, arts professionals, and members of the public. This committee reviews submissions based on set criteria such as artistic merit, relevance to the community, and sustainability.

3. **Focus on Local Artists:**
   - Prioritize local artists in the selection process to support and develop local art community.

**SITE SELECTION:**

- **Criteria:** Sites will be chosen based on visibility, accessibility, community significance, and integration with the surrounding environment. Special attention will be paid to ADA compliance and ensuring that public art is accessible to individuals with disabilities. Assessing how the placement of art might influence visitor flow and use of space, ensuring that artwork complements rather than complicates the use of the area.
  
- **Key Locations:** For both rotating and permanent art installations, the FORPD will prioritize locations that balance high visibility and community impact with practical maintenance considerations. Locations within the district, including playgrounds, picnic areas, and walking trails, will be evaluated for their suitability based on a set of criteria focused on ensuring the long-term sustainability of the art installations.

- **Durability Requirements:** Selecting materials and designs that are durable and appropriate for the specific environmental conditions of the installation site, thus reducing the frequency and complexity of maintenance tasks.

- **Integration with Nature:** Public art that interacts with the natural landscape, such as environmental or eco-friendly art, will be prioritized to promote sustainability and enhance the natural beauty of parks.
<!-- Page 233 -->
# MAINTENANCE AND CONSERVATION:

1. **Maintenance Responsibilities**
   - **Ownership and Oversight:** FORPD will provide standard park maintenance, such as cleaning and general upkeep of public space, but the artist is responsible for the specific care and preservation of the artwork itself.
   - **Artist-Proposed Maintenance Plan:** Artists must submit a detailed maintenance plan as part of the commissioning process. This plan should include the materials used, recommended cleaning methods, potential vulnerabilities, and repair instructions, guiding FORPD’s limited involvement in maintaining the artwork.
   - **Annual Inspections:** FORPD will conduct routine visual inspections of public art as part of park oversight. Any issues related to the artwork's condition will be reported to the artist for necessary repairs.
   - **Vandalism and Repairs:** FORPD will notify artists of any vandalism or damage to their work. It is the artist's responsibility to repair the piece, either personally or through their insurer. FORPD will assist in securing the site as necessary.

2. **Artist Responsibilities for Repairs (Artist Owned)**
   - **Artist Accountability:** The artist is solely responsible for all repairs and conservation efforts necessary to maintain the artwork's condition. FORPD will coordinate access to the site but will not cover repair costs if artwork remains in artist ownership.
   - **Artist-Owned and Insured Artworks:** If the artist retains ownership and insures the artwork, any repairs or damage will be covered by the artist's insurance, with FORPD facilitating site access only.

3. **Funding for Maintenance (District Owned)**
   - **Standard Park Maintenance:** FORPD will cover routine maintenance that does not directly affect the artwork, such as graffiti removal, landscaping, or debris cleanup.
   - **Public Art Reserve Fund:** FORPD will create a dedicated fund for regular maintenance, emergency repairs, and long-term conservation, sourced from public art allocations, grants, and donations.
   - **Capital Improvement Projects (CIP):** 1% of the budget for new capital projects involving public art will go to the Public Art Reserve Fund for future maintenance.
   - **Private Contributions:** Donations for public art projects will include an additional 10% to 20% for the future maintenance of the artwork.

4. **Clarification on Funding Responsibilities:**
   - The Public Art Reserve Fund applies primarily to FORPD-owned artwork or where the artist has waived ownership.
   - For artist-owned and insured artworks, the artist remains fully responsible for repairs, even in emergencies.
<!-- Page 234 -->
# DEACCESSION AND ROTATION OF PUBLIC ART:

1. **Deaccession Criteria:**
   - **Condition:** Artworks that are no longer maintainable due to damage, deterioration, or safety concerns may be considered for removal.
   - **Relevance:** Art that no longer aligns with the community’s evolving cultural, historical, or aesthetic values may be considered for rotation or removal.
   - **Artist Request:** Artists may request removal or modification of their works due to personal, legal, or artistic reasons, as allowed by acquisition agreements.
   - **Space Requirements:** Works may be deaccessioned if space or site changes necessitate relocation or if the area is being repurposed.

2. **Process for Deaccession:**
   - **Initiation:** The deaccession process can be initiated by staff, the public, or the artist, based on one of the above criteria. A formal review will be required to assess the situation.
   - **Review Committee:** A deaccession review committee, comprising members of the public art committee, district staff, art experts, and community representatives, will be formed to evaluate the request. They will review the reasons for deaccessioning and assess alternatives, such as restoration, rotation, relocation or disposal.
   - **Artist Consultation:** Artists will be notified of any proposed deaccession. If possible, they will be consulted and given the opportunity to participate in discussions related to their work.

3. **Community Involvement:**
   - **Public Notice:** Any proposed deaccession will be announced through public channels, such as the district's website, social media, and local news outlets, to ensure transparency.
   - **Public Feedback:** Community members will be invited to provide feedback on proposed deaccession or rotation. A public comment period of 30 days will be provided before final decisions are made.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - **Approval:** The final decision on deaccession or rotation will be made by the Board of Directors, following a recommendation from the deaccession review committee.
   - **Handling Deaccessioned Art:** Deaccessioned art will not be relocated. It must either be returned to the artist or, if the artist is not interested, disposed of responsibly by District staff.

5. **Transparency and Documentation:**
   - **Documentation:** All decisions and processes regarding deaccession or rotation will be thoroughly documented. This will include reasons for removal, the artist's input, staff recommendations, public feedback, and final board actions.
   - **Legal and Moral Rights:** The guarantee of legal rights will be upheld as required by law, including adherence to the Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA).

# DOCUMENTATION AND PROMOTION:
- All public art projects will be documented including details about the artist, concept, and location.
- Promotional efforts will include public art maps, digital archives, and features in district publications to enhance public awareness and appreciation of the artworks.
<!-- Page 235 -->
# IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
- **Funding:** These projects could be funded through grants, local business sponsorships, or community fundraising initiatives.
- **Promotion:** Promote completed projects via social media, local media, and partnerships with local schools and organizations to engage the community and attract visitors.
- **Evaluation:** Regularly evaluate the impact of these projects on community engagement and satisfaction to inform future public art initiatives.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Meeting Date:** October 16th, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Approval of Donation, Donor Recognition and Gift Policy  
**Prepared By:** Jen Schuler, Arts & Entertainment Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Approve the Donation, Donor Recognition and Gift Policy as recommended by the Policy Review Committee and forward it to the District’s contracted attorney for review.

**II. Background**  
The Policy Review Committee met on October 7th, 2024, to review several new policies, including the Donation, Donor Recognition, and Gift Policy. This policy originated from discussions on donor recognition, particularly the idea of a "Donor Wall." However, based on the committee's recommendations, the policy was expanded to provide an overview of how the District will recognize donors and manage donations, without focusing solely on the "Donor Wall" as the only form of recognition.

Additional revisions were made to grant the Board flexibility, allowing them to make decisions on a case-by-case basis or allocate funds according to the donor's specific wishes. The Committee recommended that the full Board discuss and possibly approve the policy and submit it for legal review by the District’s contracted attorney.

**III. Problem/Situation/Request**  
The Donation Policy was developed in response to the growing need for a structured approach to managing contributions made to the district. With increasing interest from community members, businesses, and organizations wishing to support Arts & Entertainment programming, facility improvements, recreation activities, and scholarships, it became necessary to create a formal policy to guide how donations are accepted, recognized, and utilized.
<!-- Page 237 -->
The policy establishes clear guidelines for the acceptance of monetary gifts and sponsorships while ensuring transparency and accountability in how these funds are directed. Additionally, it outlines the donor recognition process, providing a way to honor those who contribute to the district’s initiatives in a meaningful and consistent manner.

We are requesting approval of the Donation, Donor Recognition and Gift Policy be reviewed by the District’s contracted attorney to ensure legal compliance. This Policy seeks to ensure that future donations are managed effectively, with appropriate recognition for donors, and that funds are allocated in alignment with district priorities such as programming, facility maintenance, scholarships, and future improvements.

IV. Financial Analysis  
The only financial impact of approving this policy is the Attorney review fee. Donations and donor recognition are expected to provide substantial financial support for the district. Funds raised will go to the Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation, supporting Arts & Entertainment programs, recreation activities, scholarships, facility maintenance, and future improvements. All donations are tax-deductible, encouraging community involvement.

Respectfully Submitted,  
Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

- Come with conditions that may impose an undue burden or obligation on Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District.
- Conflict with existing sponsorships or partnerships.

**F. SCHOLARSHIPS**

The Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District (FORPD) offers scholarship programs to support individuals who may not otherwise be able to afford program fees and registration costs for various activities. These scholarships are particularly aimed at helping youth and seniors from low-income families in the Fair Oaks area participate in district programs.

**Scholarship Programs Offered by FORPD:**

1. **Don Ralls Memorial Scholarship:** This scholarship was established in memory of Don Ralls, a former District Board Member, to provide financial assistance primarily for program fees and other.
<!-- Page 241 -->
![Page 4 of 10](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+4+of+10)

1. **Scholarship Programs:**
   - **Utilization of Funds:** Scholarship funds can be applied toward registration fees for various FORPD programs, including classes, leagues, and camps. The aim is to make recreational activities accessible to all community members, fostering inclusiveness and engagement.
   - **Employer-Sponsored Matching Gift Programs:** FORPD encourages donors and participants to explore employer-sponsored matching gift programs, which can potentially double or triple the impact of their contributions. This initiative not only increases the available resources for scholarships but also enhances overall community support for recreational programs. Participants in such programs are advised to provide necessary documentation to their employers to secure matching funds, with assistance from FORPD.
   - **Authorization of Scholarships:** The District Administrator is responsible for reviewing and approving scholarship applications.

**G. ENDOWMENT FUND**

The Endowment Fund for FORPD is held and trusted by the Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation or designated foundations and serves as a critical financial foundation to ensure the long-term sustainability and growth of the district's programs and facilities. Endowments are funds that are maintained in perpetuity, with the principal amount invested to generate earnings. These earnings are then used to fund various initiatives according to the donor's wishes and the district's strategic goals.

**Uses of Endowment Funds**
<!-- Page 242 -->
- **Program Sustainability:** Endowment earnings can provide ongoing support for key programs, such as arts education classes, public theater productions, and community sports leagues, ensuring they continue regardless of economic fluctuations.
- **Facility Upgrades and Maintenance:** Regular maintenance and upgrades of facilities, including theaters, sports fields, and community centers, can be funded to meet safety standards and enhance user experience.
- **Scholarships:** Endowment funds can be allocated to scholarship programs that make arts and recreation programs accessible to underrepresented and low-income community members.
- **New Initiatives:** As community needs evolve, endowment funds can provide seed money for innovative new programs or services that address emerging interests or challenges.
- **Emergency Reserve:** A portion of the endowment can serve as a reserve fund to protect the district against unforeseen financial challenges, ensuring the continuity of operations during economic downturns or other crises.

### Building the Endowment Fund

- **Donor Contributions:** Individuals, families, and corporations can contribute to the endowment through one-time gifts, multi-year pledges, or planned gifts such as bequests and charitable trusts.
- **Matching Gifts:** FORPD may seek matching gifts from businesses or grant-making organizations to leverage donor contributions, effectively doubling the impact of the gifts.
- **Fundraising Campaigns:** Special campaigns and events can be organized to directly support the growth of the endowment fund.

### Benefits to Donors

- **Lasting Impact:** Donations to the endowment fund represent a permanent investment in the community, providing lasting benefits across generations.
- **Recognition:** Significant contributions can be recognized through naming opportunities within district facilities or programs, aligning with the donor's preferences and the district's recognition policies.
- **Tax Advantages:** Contributions to the endowment fund are tax-deductible to the fullest extent of the law, providing financial benefits to the donors.

### H. PLANNED GIVING

Planned giving offers donors the opportunity to leave a legacy at the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District, ensuring the continued vibrancy and sustainability of its arts and recreation programs for future generations. Planned Giving funds are donated to the Fair Oaks Foundation or other designated foundations on behalf of FORPD. This form of giving allows donors to integrate philanthropic plans with their overall financial, tax, and estate planning goals, often with significant benefits to both the donor and the district.

### Types of Planned Gifts

Page 5 of 10
<!-- Page 243 -->
![Page 6 of 10](attachment://image.png)

a. Bequests: One of the simplest forms of planned giving, a bequest allows donors to designate the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District as a beneficiary in their will or trust. Donors can specify a certain dollar amount, a particular asset, or a percentage of their estate to go to Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation.  
b. Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs): This type of trust allows donors to convert highly appreciated assets into lifetime income. It reduces taxes and increases income, and whatever remains in the trust at the end of the term is donated to Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation or other designated foundations.  
c. Charitable Lead Trusts (CLTs): Opposite of CRTs, CLTs allow donors to give assets to a trust that pays its income to Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation for a number of years or a lifetime. After this period, the assets are transferred back to the donor or heirs, often with significant tax savings.  
d. Gifts of Retirement Assets: Donors can designate Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation or other designated foundations as the beneficiary of their retirement accounts (IRA, 401(k), etc.), which can help heirs avoid double taxation on the inheritance of these assets.  
e. Gifts of Life Insurance: By naming Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy, donors can provide a substantial gift at a relatively low cost, subject to premium payments.  

**Benefits of Planned Giving**  
- **Tax Advantages:** Many forms of planned giving provide significant tax deductions. For example, bequests are exempt from estate tax, and CRTs can reduce income and capital gains taxes.  
- **Estate Planning:** Integrating charitable gifts into estate planning can enhance the financial plans and reduce the tax burden on the donor's estate.  
- **Sustainable Support:** Planned gifts provide a critical source of long-term funding that helps ensure the sustainability of FORPD's programs and facilities.  

**Recognizing Planned Giving Donors**  
- Donors who make planned gifts are recognized according to the levels of their contributions, similar to other forms of giving, unless anonymity is requested. Special recognition events and memorials can be arranged to honor these commitments.  
- Planned giving donors can be included in the Legacy Circle, a special category of recognition for those who have made a lasting commitment to the future of FORPD through their estate plans.  

**Commitment to Donor Intent**  
- **Respecting Donor Wishes:** FORPD is committed to honoring the specific wishes of all planned giving donors regarding how their future gifts are to be used, whether they support general operations, specific programs, or capital initiatives.  
- **Transparency and Reporting:** Planned giving donors receive regular updates on the impact of their intended contributions and are assured that their future gifts will be used according to their wishes.  

**I. CORPORATE SPONSORSHIPS AND NAMING RIGHTS**  
Page 6 of 10
<!-- Page 244 -->
![Corporate Sponsorships and Naming Rights](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Corporate+Sponsorships+and+Naming+Rights)

Corporate sponsorships and naming rights offer valuable opportunities for businesses to align with the community-centric values of the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District (FORPD), while gaining significant visibility and recognition. These partnerships are designed to foster mutual benefits, enhancing both the corporate sponsor's community presence and FORPD's ability to deliver high-quality arts and recreation programs.

## Types of Corporate Sponsorships

- **Event Sponsorships:** Corporations can sponsor specific events, performances, or series, which may include branding opportunities at the event, in promotional materials, and through social media mentions.
- **Program Sponsorships:** Support can be directed toward specific arts and recreation programs, helping to cover costs and expand offerings. Sponsors receive acknowledgment in program-related communications and materials.
- **Facility Sponsorships:** Corporations can sponsor amenities or facilities within the park district, such as playgrounds, sports fields, or community rooms. This type of sponsorship might include signage or naming within the facility.

## Naming Rights Opportunities

Naming rights present a high-profile branding opportunity, allowing a corporation’s name to be permanently associated with part of the FORPD’s facilities or programs. This is a significant form of sponsorship that reflects a deep commitment to the community and provides lasting visibility.

- **Facilities:** Opportunities might include but are not limited to theaters, galleries, athletic fields, and community rooms and/or centers. Each naming agreement is crafted to respect the needs of both the sponsor and the community.
- **Programs:** Naming rights can also be extended to key programs, such as educational series, concert series, special events, or sports leagues.

## Terms and Conditions

- **Duration:** Naming rights are typically granted for a predetermined period, which may range from 5 to 20 years, based on the level of contribution and the nature of the asset.
- **Renewal:** Terms for renewal or extension of naming rights are discussed prior to the expiration of the current agreement, providing an opportunity for continued partnership.
- **Approval Process:** All corporate sponsorships and naming rights are subject to approval by the FORPD board to ensure that partnerships align with the district’s mission and community standards. The district retains the authority to vet all potential sponsors to maintain the integrity of the community spaces.
- **Visibility and Acknowledgment:** Sponsor names and logos are placed in strategic, highly visible locations, ensuring maximum exposure while maintaining aesthetic and environmental standards set by FORPD.

## Benefits to Sponsors

Page 7 of 10
<!-- Page 245 -->
- **Brand Visibility:** High visibility in community settings and associated media increases brand recognition and customer goodwill.
- **Community Engagement:** Direct involvement in community enhancements helps build strong community relations and can enhance corporate reputation as a committed community partner.
- **Tax Advantages:** Contributions made through corporate sponsorships and naming rights can be tax-deductible, providing financial benefits to the sponsoring entity.

**Corporate Responsibility and Alignment**

- **Sustainability Initiatives:** Corporations that emphasize sustainability and social responsibility find alignment with FORPD’s commitment to environmental stewardship and community health.
- **Diversity and Inclusion:** Sponsorships also support FORPD’s initiatives for promoting diversity and inclusivity within community programs, resonating with corporate values of equity and representation.

**J. DONOR-ADVISED FUNDS (DAFS)**

Provide an efficient and flexible way for donors to manage their philanthropy through a tax-advantaged account, where donors can contribute funds and recommend grants to charitable organizations like the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District (FORPD) over time. This method of giving allows donors to make a charitable contribution, receive an immediate tax benefit, and then recommend grants from the fund on their own timeframe.

**Benefits of Donating Through DAFs**

- **Tax Efficiency:** Contributions to DAFs are immediately tax-deductible in the year they are made, offering a flexible way to manage annual charitable deductions.
- **Simplicity:** Donors can manage all their charitable giving through one account, simplifying tracking and administration.
- **Flexibility:** Donors have the flexibility to recommend grants at their convenience and the ability to anonymously support causes they care about.
- **Strategic Philanthropic Planning:** DAFs allow donors to build a long-term strategy for major giving instead of making ad-hoc donations.

**Using DAFs to Support FORPD**

- **Unrestricted Gifts:** Donors can recommend unrestricted gifts, which give FORPD the flexibility to use funds where they are needed most.
- **Restricted Gifts:** Donors can specify that their DAF grants go toward specific programs, projects, or initiatives within FORPD.
- **Endowment Contributions:** Donors can direct DAF grants to FORPD’s endowment, providing a lasting legacy that supports the district’s future.

**Recognition for DAF Donors**

Page 8 of 10
<!-- Page 246 -->
- Acknowledgment: FORPD acknowledges all DAF contributions in accordance with donor recognition policies, unless anonymity is requested.
- Transparency: FORPD commits to transparency in how DAF contributions are used, providing donors with reports and updates on the impact of their support.

## Establishing a DAF

- **Setting Up:** Donors interested in establishing a DAF can do so through many financial institutions, community foundations, or other entities that offer DAF services.

**Meeting Date:** October 16, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Annual Report and Five-Year Findings Report for the Park Impact Fee Program  
**Prepared By:** Jennifer Larkin, Administrative Services Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Staff recommends that the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District (“District”) Board of Directors (“Board”) adopt the attached resolution approving the District’s Annual Report and Five-Year Findings Report for the Park Impact Fee Program in compliance with Government Code Sections 66006 and 66001.

**II. Background**  
Pursuant to the Mitigation Fee Act (AB 1600), codified in Government Code Section 66000 et seq., public agencies may establish development impact fees when there is a demonstrated reasonable relationship between the development project and the public services being funded. The County of Sacramento (“County”), on behalf of the District, has established park impact fee program to fund necessary park improvements resulting from new development within the District's boundaries.

Government Code Sections 66001(d) and 66006(b) require the District to make an annual accounting of fees collected and expended and conduct a Five-Year Findings Report for any remaining funds in the impact fee fund.

**III. Problem/Situation/Request**  
The attached resolution acknowledges the receipt and review of the District’s Annual and Five-Year Findings Reports for Fiscal Year 2023-24. These reports provide an overview of the Park Impact Fee Program, including an accounting of collected fees, expenditures, and any future improvements or projects to be funded by the fees. No refunds or
<!-- Page 249 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

reallocations of fees are required at this time, and the District is in full compliance with the applicable sections of the Government Code.

Approval of the resolution and subsequent adoption by the County Board of Supervisors later this year will ensure the District remains compliant with Government Code Sections 66006 and 66001 regarding the Park Impact Fee Program.

IV. Financial Analysis  
There is no fiscal impact associated with the adoption of this resolution.

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael J. Aho

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## INTRODUCTION
The Mitigation Fee Act (Government Code Section 66000 et. seq., hereafter the “Act”) requires local agencies to report, every year and every fifth year, certain financial information regarding their development impact fee programs. These reporting requirements are applicable to the park impact fee (“Reportable Fee”) program of the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District (“District”) that became effective on October 24, 2022, upon adoption by the County of Sacramento (“County”) Board of Supervisors on behalf of the District.

This **Five-Year Findings Report** provides the findings required by Section 66001(d)(1) of the Act for the District's Park Impact Fee Fund for fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. The District's last Five-Year Findings Report for their Park Impact Fee Funds was provided for fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.

## BACKGROUND
Section 66006(b) the Act requires that the following information, entitled “Annual Report,” be made available to the public within 180 days after the last day of each fiscal year:

- a brief description of the type of fee in the account;
- the amount of the fee;
- the beginning and ending balance of the account;
- the fees collected that year and the interest earned;
- an identification of each public improvement for which the fees were expended and the amount of the expenditures for each improvement;
- an identification of an approximate date by which development of the improvement will commence if the local agency determines that sufficient funds have been collected to complete financing of an incomplete public improvement;
- a description of each inter-fund transfer or loan made from the account or fund, including the public improvement on which the transferred or loaned fees will be expended, the date on which any loan will be repaid, and the rate of interest to be returned to the account; and
- the amount of money refunded under section Govt. Code § 66001.

The District has prepared a timely Annual Report every fiscal year since fiscal year 2010-11.

<!-- Page 256 -->
# FIVE-YEAR FINDINGS REPORT (FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 2024)

In accordance with Government Code Section 66001(d)(1), the District affirmatively demonstrates that the District still needs the unexpended park impact fee revenue to achieve the purpose for which it was originally imposed and that the District has a plan on how to use the unexpended balance to achieve that purpose.

## UNEXPENDED REPORTABLE FEE FUND BALANCE
The District's Park Impact Fee ("Reportable Fee") fund balance, as of June 30, 2024, was $1,676,695.

## PURPOSE OF THE REPORTABLE FEE FUND BALANCE
The purpose of the Reportable Fee imposed and collected on new development within the District is to fund the construction of new park and recreational facilities, including community use facilities, to serve the new service population created by new development within the District. Specifically, the District's unexpended Reportable Fee fund balance will partially fund the construction of three new (added) softball fields at La Vista ($2,243,000).

## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UNEXPENDED REPORTABLE FEE BALANCE AND THE PURPOSE OF THE FEE
There is a reasonable relationship between the unexpended Reportable Fee balance and the purpose of the Reportable Fee by reason of the fact that the additional service population generated by the development projects that paid the Reportable Fee created the need for new park and recreational facilities, including community use facilities, to maintain the District's level of service. The District intends to use the unexpended Reportable Fee fund balance to partially fund the construction of three new (added) softball fields at La Vista to serve the District's growing service population.

## SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR INCOMPLETE IMPROVEMENTS FUNDED BY UNEXPENDED REPORTABLE FEE
The estimated cost of the District's incomplete improvements funded by the unexpended Reportable Fee and the sources and amounts of funding anticipated to complete the financing of the incomplete improvements are shown in Figure 1 on Page 5.
