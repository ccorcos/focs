**FAIR OAKS**  
**RECREATION & PARK DISTRICT**

**Meeting Date:** December 18th, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Disc Golf Update – Moving the Course  
**Prepared By:** Sean Ventura, Parks & Facilities Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
No recommendation is needed for this report. This item is intended to provide information to the Board based on the prior directive to continue implementing enhancements to the Miller Park Disc Golf Course as recommended by Whirlwind Disc Golf, while retaining the existing 18-hole course configuration. This update is to ensure the Board is informed of the ongoing efforts and progress in accordance with the established directive.

**II. Background**  
Staff began receiving reports from concerned members of the community in May of 2024 regarding safety in locations where disc golf users and non-disc golfers interfaced within Miller Park.

Staff retained the services of Whirlwind Disc Golf, a professional disc golf course safety analyst, in July of 2024 with the intention of seeking a professional, critical eye in advising the District towards modifications to the course to improve the safety of all visitors to Miller Park, no matter their chosen activity.

In October of 2024, staff received the final report from Whirlwind Disc Golf and brought that report before the Board of Directors. After review of this report, the Board directed staff to enact several of the major mitigation measures proposed by the safety survey. The Board also directed staff to explore options for other park sites to host the District’s disc golf course.

Staff immediately began enacting mitigation measures recommended by the safety survey, utilizing the Parks Department’s operational budget. Staff simultaneously began investigating other park sites within the District for suitability for a disc golf course.
<!-- Page 6 -->
### III. Problem /Situation/ Request
Staff’s findings are as follows. These findings are organized by park site and will note both positives and negatives of each park site.

#### Fair Oaks Park
This park site is one of the larger sites available as an option at 6.7 acres. Fair Oaks Park only affords that much acreage if all areas not currently being utilized for other park uses are made into a disc golf course. This would present issues with the immediate adjacency of several other key features of the park: walking trails, seating areas, a rentable BBQ area, a playground, parking lots, and sports fields. The location would also require several portions of the course to play immediately alongside Madison Avenue which is a hazard both for discs flying out into traffic and also for liability by placing activities within feet of a major roadway.

If all non-utilized spaces are changed into a disc golf course, several sections would need to abut several neighbor’s property lines.

The park is also one of the most frequently used parks for special events. Often, this means that the park will be shut down for an entire day or longer. This limits the amount of days and times during which the course could be used. Though this is not high on the list of factors which would lead to a negative recommendation for this site, staff thought it should be a consideration nonetheless.

The spaces which are currently unused, therefore available for a course, are discontinuous, which would lead to confusion by players and a reduction in use of the course overall. Staff also believes that creating several, disconnected sections of a disc golf course could potentially lead to confusion by non-disc golfers as to whether they were in areas with a higher likelihood of flying discs and hazards to the unaware.

Two positive elements of Fair Oaks Park are the availability of parking and the varied terrain/foliage. Staff feels that an interesting course could be created in this park, though it would likely not allow a full course with nine or eighteen holes in one area.

Fair Oaks Park is also one of the most-used parks within the District on a daily average. If the District is looking to place a disc golf course away from non-disc golfers, it is inadvisable to utilize Fair Oaks Park for this purpose.

#### Phoenix Park
<!-- Page 7 -->
![Phoenix Park Disc Golf Course Consideration](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**Phoenix Park** is the largest possible site for a disc golf course in the District at a potential 11 acres; however, this park suffers from many of the same issues as Fair Oaks Park and a few unique issues of its own.

Though the park is fairly under-utilized during the winter months, Phoenix Park is legitimately the District’s busiest park during spring, summer, and fall when sports activities are in-season. During these times, the already limited parking is completely overloaded to meet the needs of the activities therein. Staff feels that adding additional activities to a park which already struggles under the weight of its current activities would be a decision resulting in further problems and complaints from visitors to the park.

Similar to Fair Oaks Park, Phoenix Park suffers from a lack of contiguous usable land. The areas not already reserved for dog park use, soccer, lacrosse, or little league use are small and separated by several long distances between them. The noted 11 acres includes an area within the center of the park which is currently undeveloped. This area is called out in the recently developed Phoenix Park Master plan for other uses once funding is secured to accomplish the related capital improvement projects. Without the use of this space for a potential disc golf course, the usable space drops to approximately 7.5 acres.

If a course were implemented at Phoenix Park utilizing the space outlined in the attached presentation, the course would be either immediately adjacent to or completely overlapping several walking paths, sports fields, playgrounds, major roadways (Sunset Avenue), interior roadways and parking lots. Many sections of the course would need to be placed directly adjacent to the property lines of many neighbors to the park.

From a course design perspective, Phoenix Park is possibly one of the least interesting sites due to its lack of foliage and flat terrain.

Staff strongly recommends against consideration of any of the vernal pool areas for inclusion in acreage calculations for any potential disc golf course at this location.

It is the opinion of staff that there are no major positive items to include in a discussion regarding Phoenix Park as a disc golf site. Two minor positives include the low utilization rates during winter months and that the site hypothetically has a large area which might be developed for a course.

Once more, if the District’s intent is to place a disc golf course away from the usage of non-disc golfers, then it is inadvisable to consider Phoenix Park as a realistic location.

**Gum Ranch Park**
<!-- Page 8 -->
Gum Ranch Park has the second smallest possible acreage of all park sites under consideration at 3.5 acres of usable space, only beating out Montview Park by 0.2 acres of usable space.

As with the two previously reviewed parks, Gum Ranch Park suffers from adjacency and overlap issues with existing walking paths and nearby playgrounds. Staff believes that the overlap between walking paths and travel patterns within this park is one of the most severe cases out of all parks being presented for consideration as this site is heavily utilized by pedestrians. At the north end of the property, a disc golf course would be butted up against neighbor’s property lines as well. The park is also a safe-walking corridor for children heading to the nearby school; Gum Ranch Park helps create a pathway by which those children are able to walk either on a sidewalk or within a park from their homes in the surrounding neighborhoods to their place of learning without crossing any major roadways.

Parking at the site is non-existent within the boundaries of the park. Visitors must park by way of parallel street parking which, even without disc golf usage at the park, has incurred complaints from neighbors within the area due to park visitors taking up space in front of or nearby their homes.

The area north of Arcade Creek within the park is inaccessible at this time, and the District would need to perform costly capital improvement projects in order to construct bridges in at least two locations to allow use of the entire undeveloped section of the park. Without bridges over Arcade Creek, the available space within the park for a disc golf course would be reduced to approximately 1.8 acres. Though staff are in consideration of proposing bridges such as these in the future, staff does not feel that funding is available at this time for a project of this scope.

One major positive to Gum Ranch Park as a potential site is that the terrain is varied and the foliage is plentiful. In addition, Arcade Creek as a water hazard is highly beneficial to play. If none of the above considerations were present, then staff feels that this location would be an interesting location in terms of course design and play.

Though the area shows promise due to its natural resources, the combined size and parking restrictions, and the immediately adjacent existing features create too many safety concerns for staff to recommend moving a disc golf course to this location.

Bannister Park is listed as having varying available acreage for a potential disc golf course at 4-8.5 acres. This variance is due to several factors: how much of the existing multipurpose fields can be utilized, how far east
<!-- Page 9 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

the District's property extends, and how much of the park has been encroached upon by neighbors to the east. Staff admits that the exact eastern edge of the property has not been surveyed during the period of time in which they have been serving the District. Personal investigations into the property boundaries lead staff to believe that our property likely extends to much more usable space near Minnesota Creek (near the eastern edge of the property) than is currently utilized by the District. An official survey of the property to establish boundaries would be required to say for sure. At this time, staff believes that many of the currently installed “No Trespassing” signs (east of the multipurpose fields) are on District property and are placed illegally.

Parking at Bannister Park is minimal and often utilized by people walking along the bike trail into property managed by Sacramento Regional Parks along the American River. Only about 40 spaces are available and, as such, parking is often full while the park remains completely empty. Due to the popularity of this parking lot as one of the only unpaid parking areas connecting to the American River, staff does not feel that the presence of a disc golf course would greatly increase traffic along Bannister Road in a noticeable way to the neighbors along the roadway.

Depending on course design, there are potential adjacency concerns with the bike trail, exercise area, and parking lot. Staff believes that design could very likely be created which alleviates these adjacency concerns. To the north of the park are several neighbors which could potentially be impacted by the proximity to one or more holes of a new disc golf course, and the neighbors to the east would likely be frustrated by use of a section of the park which has been historically ignored by the District and which allows a degree of privacy from the general public. Relations would likely be strained if the District were to formally establish its boundaries in this area, especially if there has been development on the land by those neighbors. The positive side of this is that there are no playgrounds or walking paths through the majority of the park, and the park itself is one of the most severely under-utilized by the general public on a regular basis. The issues seen in many other parks would not be as problematic at this location. At the southern end of the property lies Sacramento Waldorf School; staff understands that the disc golf course being adjacent to a school is currently a concern of the public but feels that the issue is less extreme in this location due to the topography of the site and the layout of the school to the south.

Acreage at this site is contiguous and could potentially allow for a circular pattern to enable play to both begin and end at the parking area, depending on how much of the multipurpose field is overtaken by a new disc golf course.

The terrain is incredibly varied on the eastern end of the park, elevation changes are extensive, and the foliage is plentiful. As far as natural
<!-- Page 10 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

resources are concerned, staff believes this might be the most promising site from amongst those presented in this report. That being said, the site would require a great deal of labor to clear away enough dead wood to make the area safe and usable. There are also concerns with construction so close to a steep hillside leading down to a natural creek, and any potential development of the eastern edge of this site would need to be very carefully managed in conjunction with the Department of Water Resources (among other agencies as yet identified by staff).

There is also the opportunity to shift the preferred use of Bannister Park if a disc golf course is installed in this location. If the multipurpose fields were eliminated and plantings occurred throughout that area, the whole park could be utilized for development and the use of the park would see an increase rather than being a parking lot from which visitors head to other recreation opportunities outside of the District. Rentals on the multipurpose fields here provide approximately $5000 per year which would then be lost, though creative ways to recover the loss of that revenue could then be explored on site including a pro shop for disc golf related sales, a disc golf rental kiosk, permitting charges, or possibly ticket sales to utilize the course.

Though staff currently recommends not moving Miller Disc Golf Course and continuing with Whirlwind Disc Golf’s safety mitigation recommendations, if staff were required to choose a location to move the course to, Bannister Park would be the site they would recommend. Due to survey and construction requirements at the site, this would likely be the most expensive option out of the lot.

Montview Park

Montview Park was not included in the direction received by staff when tasked with exploring other park options for a disc golf course; however, in the interest of being fairly exhaustive, it is included here for informational purposes. Montview Park is the smallest potential site for consideration when moving Miller Park Disc Golf Course at 3.3 acres.

The site benefits by having a road’s separation between neighboring houses and being relatively under-utilized, but it suffers from two of the same concerns as our other park sites: walking paths and a playground. Due to the small area available in the park, holes would need to be near both of these features. Also due to the small area available, the course would be short and compact which could potentially create safety issues between disc golfers playing in different areas of the course.

The parking at Montview Park is limited as well, which would force many visitors to utilize parallel parking on neighborhood streets, potentially causing conflict with residents in the area.
<!-- Page 11 -->
From a course design standpoint, the elevation changes in the park are enticing, but any excitement is tempered by a lack of vegetation and the restrictions on hole length the smaller area requires.

Primarily due to the limited space available at this site, staff believes it is inadvisable to move the District’s disc golf course to this location.

IV. Financial Analysis  
There is currently no financial analysis available for moving Miller Park Disc Golf Course to another location within the District. Costs would vary depending on a site selected, if any. From the staff report on the subject of the Miller Park Disc Golf Course, submitted to the Board for their October 2024 meeting, the rough estimate for moving the disc golf course is noted at a cost of $20,000-$40,000.

Respectfully Submitted,  
Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

## I. Recommendation  
Approve the Operational Overview for the newly renovated Village Park Community Center and the Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center.

## II. Background  
The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District (FORPD) has developed a strategic operational plan following the recent renovations of the Village Park, Veteran’s Memorial Amphitheater, Community Clubhouse, and the new Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center. This plan is intricately designed to support the District's goals of celebrating community diversity, promoting inclusivity, and driving economic and cultural growth within Fair Oaks. Drawing upon insights from the AMS Planning & Research report (Attachment A), this Operational Plan provides an overview of the framework and programming strategy devised for enhancing and activating the District’s updated center.

## III. Problem / Situation / Request  
At the request of the Board of Directors, this overview addresses the strategic plans for facilities funded through Measure J, including the Fair Oaks Performance Art Center. As these facilities transition from development to operation, there are critical areas needing attention:  
- Establish clear operational guidelines and a comprehensive programming strategy to effectively meet the community's cultural, educational, and recreational needs.
<!-- Page 54 -->
- Develop a robust framework to manage the complexities and expectations that come with moving into full operational status.
- Seeking the Board’s approval to implement the outlined strategic operational plan, which includes finalizing operational frameworks and programming strategies and establishing performance metrics to gauge the facilities' success and impact on the community.

IV. Financial Analysis  
Approving the operational overview will not incur initial costs but is expected to enhance facility utilization and create new revenue streams through increased class enrollments, event attendance, and partnerships. These improvements will boost operational efficiencies and enhance community engagement, leading to a positive long-term financial impact for the district.

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael J. Aho

# I. Introduction

The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District (FORPD) has developed a strategic operational plan for the newly renovated Village Park, Veteran’s Memorial Amphitheater, Community Clubhouse, and the Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center. This plan aligns with the District's commitment to celebrating community diversity, promoting inclusivity, and fostering economic and cultural growth in Fair Oaks. Utilizing insights from the AMS Planning & Research report (Attachment A), this overview outlines the operational framework, programming strategy, and expected outcomes for the District’s plans for activating the renovated center.

**Project Timeline:**

The entire Village Park facility, encompassing Plaza Park, The Veteran’s Memorial Amphitheater, The Black Box Theatre, the Community Flex Rooms, Arts & Crafts Studio, Community Clubhouse, and Band Shell, is anticipated to open in mid-Spring 2025. A soft opening is planned from April through early Summer 2025 to allow for initial operations, staff training, and adjustments to programming before the official grand opening. A soft opening offers an opportunity to test facilities and services with smaller-scale events and rentals, ensuring a seamless experience for the community upon the full-scale launch. The grand opening celebration is tentatively scheduled for early Summer 2025 to formally commemorate the completion and welcome the community.

# II. Guiding Principles

The operational strategy is anchored in the following principles:

- **Celebrating Community:** Leveraging arts and culture to reflect the unique identity of Fair Oaks.
- **Inclusive Access:** Ensuring programs and facilities are welcoming and accessible to all.
- **Active Collaboration:** Partnering with local organizations to enhance programming quality and diversity.
- **Pragmatic Development:** Offering programs that are both innovative and financially sustainable.
- **Proactive Engagement:** Continuously refining activities to meet evolving community needs.

# III. Operational Model

The District will adopt a "Host/Presenter" model:

- **Host Role:** Providing spaces for key programming partners and supporting community-led events.
- **Presenter Role:** Directly organizing and promoting a curated lineup of events, including ticketed concerts, comedy shows, and family-friendly activities.

# 1. Background & Introduction

AMS conducted a two-phase arts and cultural programming and operational study for renovated facilities in the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District. After examining the current market and cultural environment, AMS recommended that the District consider shifting its programming approach from that of being a facility provider and landlord to an intentional strategy rooted in Board-adopted “guiding principles” where the District is an active programmer and partner, ensuring that arts and cultural programs are serving all constituencies of the community.

The following offers a summary of AMS’ research findings and modeling efforts.

AMS’s scope of work included the following steps:

- Reviewing background materials, planning documents, relevant reports on arts, entertainment, visitation, and regional growth,
- Conducting webinar and telephone interviews with regional leaders and stakeholders,
- Inventory and analysis of regional performance, conference, event, and meeting facilities,
- Review of comparable and inspirational programming venues and districts,
- Development of business plan and financial forecast.

2. Research Findings  
AMS began the project by researching and analyzing three key inputs: a survey of current and potential District facility users, personal interviews with stakeholders, and a review of available historical operating data. The team dissected current arts, culture, and entertainment programs in Fair Oaks, while listening to perceived gaps in current offerings from stakeholders and married those anecdotal inputs with quantitative responses from the user survey to form a snapshot of the current situation. Detailed information can be found in the appendices to this report. A summary of findings follows.

**Potential User Survey**  
AMS surveyed more than 30 local and regional arts organizations, receiving 16 responses. Potential users and local business leaders were asked to provide insights into the quantity and volume of demand for different types of performing spaces. Among survey respondents, the majority were interested mostly in the Amphitheatre and Outdoor spaces for entertainment and commercial events, and the community clubhouse for indoor rental activities. This finding informed AMS’ work, focusing on the market demand for those venues and ways to activate them.

**Current Space Utilization**

A review of background materials, including previous district surveys and plans, materials from regional arts organizations and service groups, and historic operational data provided context regarding the region’s existing market and arts assets.

The background review also highlighted opportunities for growth in arts and entertainment activity. Under current utilization, the team presented the following findings:

- **61*** Performances/Events  
- **139** Technical or Rehearsal Days  
- **165** Dark Days  
- **14,300** Attendees/Participants

# Interviews

AMS interviewed a diverse cohort of representatives from 36 organizations from Fair Oaks, including arts and cultural groups, local businesses, and service organizations. Representatives from the San Juan Unified School District, as well as Sacramento area entertainment professionals, were also interviewed for added input.

We summarized the input gained through the interviews into the following themes:

1. Fair Oaks is eclectic and should retain that part of its special appeal and character.

2. Gaps in programs exist for:
   a. Teenagers  
   b. Young Professionals  
   c. Singles Between 30-50 years old  

3. A younger and more entrepreneurial spirit is taking hold in the Village and driving momentum for increased foot traffic.

4. Traditional Mainstreet businesses may be reluctant to see dramatic increases in foot traffic, car traffic, and parking need.

5. Boosting District programs would be an economic multiplier for the community and the economy of the Village in particular.

![Guiding Principles Graphic](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Definition of Success – Guiding Principles**

Concluding the first phase, AMS synthesized feedback from the District Board and working groups, stakeholder interviews, comparable studies, and developed draft Guiding Principles which were then presented in late 2020 to the board for approval. The guiding principles serve as guard rails and constraints, but also as inspiration for the types of arts and entertainment programs the District will seek. AMS received guidance and edits, and final approval was given for the following Guiding Principal statements:

| Committed to Celebrating Our Community: | Active, Central, and Collaborative: | Diverse, Pragmatic, and Relevant: | Inclusive to All: | Proactive: |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|------------|
| FORPD plans for a vibrant future and embraces what makes Fair Oaks unique. | The Village is an active centerpiece of the District, driving social engagement and economic impact for Fair Oaks and neighboring communities. | FORPD supports programming that attracts and engages the entire community. | FORPD strives to sustain facilities and programs that are welcoming, affordable, and inclusive. | The district regularly ensures facilities and programs remain relevant to our community by testing and adjusting programs continuously. |

3. Preferred Scenario  
**‘Host/Presenter’ Model**  
**Operating Model**

As we considered various scenarios, we introduced an operating framework we call the “Landlord, Host, Presenter” framework. (see figure 5 below)

As we looked at the market data, community input, guiding principals, and facilities, we landed on a model that we call the “Host / Presenter” model. Were the District plays Host to certain key programming partners and helps them succeed, but the District also engages in Presenting to augment programming and insure a diversity of offerings by having a direct hand in the presentation of events, classes, concerts, and other activities.

The following section details the operating model for a ‘presenter/host-forward’ operation.

April 2021 | AMS Planning & Research
<!-- Page 68 -->
# Operating Frameworks

## Presenter
- Operator is responsible for operations and programming.
- Operator has programming and calendar control – and the majority of risk.
- Pro-active booking of available calendar dates.

## Host
- "Intentional" relationship between major tenants and owner/operator.
- Tenants provide the majority of programming.
- Owner/operator has limited programming risk – and limited control.
- Pro-active booking of available calendar dates.

## Landlord
- Passive operating model, often used in public sector.
- Typically not a-risk activity by the venue.
- No pro-active booking of the facility.

---

Figure 5 Operating Frameworks

As a "Host / Presenter" the District will have greater intentionality when working with facility renters and partners. It will also have intentionality when it comes to scheduling its spaces as it seeks to balance the needs of partners, its own ticketed presentations, and revenue-producing rentals, which are needed to support community-based activities that will also continue to be offered. Striking a balance in operations and programming will be key, and implementation of this model will require Board support and staff ingenuity. We believe that part of this new balance in operations will enable the District to offer an increased level of support and incentives for partners and community users that align with the Board’s principles.

Given the space assumptions outlined above and additional regional assumptions, including a full-time tax rate of 30%, facility fees of $2.00 per ticket, and an average of 70% of capacity sold for presented activity, AMS began by modeling activity for a presenter/host season of activity. The model assumes that the volume of activity comes primarily from nonprofit and local commercial event rentals, along with district subsidized educational activities. However, the bulk of revenue is derived from the 22 presented events which also drive the largest audiences/participants per event.

---

9  
April 2021 | AMS Planning & Research
<!-- Page 69 -->
Based on comparable research and market understanding, AMS modeled a base year of new activity in the amphitheater and maintained existing volume and mix of education and free programmed activity in other facilities. A total of 126 annual event rentals (including commercial, government, education, and not-for-profit rentals) with over 49,000 attendees are supplemented by 22 presented events adding an estimated 17,000 additional attendees to the district.

![Figure 6 Performance/Event Mix of Activities](attachment://image.png)

Total Presentations 15%  
Total Not-For-Profit Rentals 45%  
Total Commercial Rentals 40%  

Breaking down the presented activity, we forecasted an increase in music, comedy, and family-oriented content, based on interviews with stakeholders, survey demand interest, and guidance from the District governing board (Fig. 7).

Throughout the project, AMS heard from many members of the community that content such as a music series would thrive. Due to the formal and informal nature of venues, AMS prioritized the Amphitheater for presented activity as a ‘formal’ venue, one where there is control of tickets, seating, and stage access. Whereas the bandshell was treated as an informal space, optimal for pop-up and free or discounted events where control is not necessarily the priority.

April 2021 | AMS Planning & Research
<!-- Page 70 -->
![Figure 7 Presented Activity Mix](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Figure+7+Presented+Activity+Mix)

The breakdown of presented activity we found would work based on comparable venues, and regional research, showed that indeed commercial music was the most viable for the outdoor venue. We forecast a weekly concert series once a week during the summer months, which also considers the concerns raised by local shop owners and residents, that too much activity would be problematic. We increased the comedy series to 4, from its current 3 events, because it is highly successful, and has a lower cost than we typically see. Finally, we forecasted family-oriented programming based on the desirability we heard from residents, the District board, and survey responses.

**Figure 7 Presented Activity Mix**

11 | April 2021 | AMS Planning & Research
<!-- Page 71 -->
![Figure 8 Revenue Summary](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

Total revenues are just short of $400K, with over 41% of revenue coming from ticket sales, and nearly 30% of revenue from rentals. The balance of revenue is driven by a 33% net share of food and beverage from commercial performance bar sales and banqueting activity during event rentals (provided by a F&B contractor), and chargebacks for variable labor.

- **Ticket Sales:** 33%
- **Facility Rentals:** 23%
- **Ticket Fees/Surcharges:** 8%
- **Concessions (net):** 13%
- **Rental Additions / Chargebacks (gross):** 13%
- **Facility Rental Waiver:** -10%

Within the ticket sales, we forecast $162K in presented event revenues, largely from a new dedicated and regularly programmed music series.

Arts and Entertainment Expenses at the District of over $320K are driven by presented season programming costs and compensation costs. Compensation costs include additional staffing, plus part time and program specific staffing such as box office employees. We also built a contingency line which represents 4% of potential unexpected or unforeseen expenses which may be incurred.

Some new revenue streams for the District to capture are ticket fees and concessions. These will be important lines of business to develop and ‘get right’ to insure the smooth and consistent delivery of service to patrons as the goal is for them to come to expect a certain level of professionalism anytime they attend an event in the park or at any of the venues.

April 2021 | AMS Planning & Research
<!-- Page 72 -->
![Figure 9 Expense Summary](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Expense Summary**

- **Season Programming:** 36%
- **Compensation (FTE personnel):** 32%
- **Theatre Operations:** 15%
- **Programming Support:** 13%
- **Expense Contingency:** 4%

Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District maintains a budget for building operations and administrative 'fixed' costs; therefore, we have omitted such costs from our modeling forecast. This includes expenses such as compensation of shared district staffing, office supplies and utilities, costs which are allocated through the District facilities already.

The compensation of $127K represents new staffing of a Programming Director who AMS recommends is needed to engage new and existing partnerships, promoters, and rentals. The new compensation also includes at least one part time Event Coordinator to support events as necessary, such as box office set up, ticketing delivery, and engaging with renters.

A summary pro forma for the 'presenter/host-forward' model results in a modest net operating result of $4,000 annually. This summary represents a forecast rather than a formal budget. Each line item has variability, so AMS recommends this as a direction for a normalized.

**Looking Forward**  
In light of the research and modeling conducted, AMS submits the following questions and recommendations for further consideration:  
- Can Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District increase programming support to build and sustain activity levels?  
- How could summer programming and visitors factor into higher levels of activity and greater income?  
- Which partners will be best suited to help the District achieve its guiding principles?

Finally, we have noted some important Next Steps and considerations. As with any new venture, achieving the ‘base year’ we have forecasted may take up to 5 years...maybe less. It will be important for this effort to be supported the Board and to keep the vision in frame during the next few years. One thing to consider is to take-on a fundraising effort to seed this new direction to ensure success.

- **Will take several years to achieve ‘base year’**  
  During this time funds will be needed to implement these changes; expenditure on new staff will need to be made before programming revenue comes in, for example. How can the board support contributed revenue in the short term? And long term?

- **Support existing users**  
  In order to fulfill guiding principles, changes will need to be made to existing and long-standing relationships. How can board, staff and community support these organizations through this transition?

- **Equipping for the new model**  
  Now that there is some view into the future operations, what modifications need to be made to the capital plans and budget to support this? What is feasible? What is set in stone?

We also believe that staff and board will need to work with existing partners to bring them along with this new vision and to re-stabilize after the park renovation is completed and COVID has passed.

Finally, we think that it would be a good idea to revisit the renovation plans and budget to see what, if any, modifications could or should be made in light of this clarified operating plan.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** December 18th, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Mike Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Marketing Services RFP Selection  
**Prepared by:** Jen Schuler- Arts & Entertainment Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Staff recommends that GreyDot Media be selected to enter into contract for Marketing Services as laid out in the Marketing Services RFP (Attachment A) and that the District Administrator be authorized to execute the contract.

---

**II. Background**  
The District currently does not have an exclusive contract with a marketing agency. With the expansion of programming in our parks, there is a substantial need for dedicated marketing support, particularly for branding the new Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center, promoting rental facilities, and ongoing ticket sales and event advertising.

To meet this growing demand, staff developed a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Marketing Services. The RFP outlined three primary areas of support:  
1. Branding for the Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center  
2. Development of marketing materials and marketing strategies for Rental Facilities  
3. Ongoing marketing and ticket sales outreach for the new venue and other District events  

Four organizations responded to the RFP, each presenting strong qualifications. However, the staff was especially impressed by the presentation and expertise of GreyDot Media. After thorough discussion
<!-- Page 85 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

among the management team, staff recommends GreyDot Media as the preferred partner for the District’s marketing services.

A summary of the respondents and their proposed contract amounts is included in Attachment A.

### III. Problem /Situation/ Request
Due to the facility opening timeline, it is essential to select a marketing agency at the December Board of Directors meeting to ensure sufficient time for design review and strategy implementation.

We request that the Board of Directors approve the staff’s recommendation to proceed with GreyDot Media as the selected respondent.

### IV. Financial Analysis
The annual cost of the new contract with GreyDot Media is anticipated to vary based on specific project needs and service adjustments over time.

The initial $48,000 funding for this contract is expected to come from the $130,000 allocated to the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District, provided by Sacramento County through Supervisor Rich Desmond as part of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds.

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

**Executive Summary**

GreyDot Media is excited to present our proposal to the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District (FORPD) for providing comprehensive marketing services to support the successful launch and promotion of the Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center, the District’s facility rental programs, and event and ticket sales. Our approach is rooted in a deep understanding of digital marketing and analytics, ensuring that the District's objectives of increased participation, revenue generation, and enhanced brand visibility are achieved.

The Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center is a premier venue that will serve as a hub for arts, entertainment, and community gatherings. It requires a strong and cohesive brand identity that reflects its significance within the community. Additionally, the District's facility rental spaces offer valuable amenities that appeal to a diverse range of potential renters, from corporate clients and event planners to local community groups and individuals.

Our proposed scope of work is divided into three distinct phases:

This includes logo design, color schemes, typography, and brand messaging that aligns with the District’s mission and vision. We will create a comprehensive Brand Guide and integrate the new identity across all digital and physical materials.

2. **Facility Rental Marketing:** We will produce marketing materials that effectively present the value of the District’s newly renovated rental spaces. This includes the creation of a detailed facility rental brochure, targeted promotional materials, and digital campaigns to increase bookings.

3. **Event and Ticket Sale Strategies:** We will develop comprehensive event promotion strategies, utilizing audience segmentation, targeted messaging, and multi-channel marketing campaigns to maximize attendance and ticket sales. This includes integrating analytics tools to track performance and optimize future campaigns.

Throughout the project, our team will provide ongoing reporting and insights to ensure full transparency and alignment with the District's goals. GreyDot Media’s extensive experience in community-focused marketing and strategic advertising uniquely positions us to deliver impactful results for the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District.

We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with FORPD and make the Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center a centerpiece of community engagement and success.

Our pricing reflects the value of a full-service marketing team dedicated to achieving FORPD’s objectives. We offer the following benefits as part of our proposal:
<!-- Page 96 -->
- **Transparent Pricing:** Clear delineation of costs for each phase of the project, with no hidden fees.
- **Flexible Adjustments:** Ability to scale services up or down based on FORPD’s needs and project evolution.
- **Measurable Results:** Comprehensive performance tracking and monthly reports that demonstrate the impact of our work.

4. **Payment Schedule**

- **Quarterly Review:** A quarterly financial review will be conducted with FORPD to ensure transparency and alignment with project goals.

**Important Note:**

Per the RFP’s instructions, our detailed fee proposal including the fixed monthly amount and total annual cost will be submitted in a separate, sealed envelope as part of this proposal submission.

**Modifications and Recommendations**

GreyDot Media has carefully reviewed the scope of work outlined in the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District’s RFP and has identified several opportunities to enhance the project’s effectiveness. These modifications and recommendations are intended to maximize the impact of our marketing efforts and ensure the success of the Fair Oaks Performing Arts Center and other District initiatives.

1. **Enhanced Digital Integration**

We recommend incorporating additional digital tools and platforms to further extend the reach of marketing campaigns and streamline project management:
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System Integration:** Implement a CRM system to capture and manage leads generated through marketing efforts. This would enable FORPD to maintain ongoing communication with potential renters and event attendees, track interactions, and nurture relationships over time.
- **Marketing Automation:** Utilize marketing automation tools to streamline email campaigns and social media posts. Automated workflows can help manage repetitive tasks, allowing us to focus on higher-value activities, such as strategy development and creative design.
- **Retargeting Campaigns:** Deploy digital retargeting campaigns to re-engage users who have visited the website or interacted with ads but have not completed a booking or ticket purchase. This strategy can significantly increase conversion rates and improve overall campaign performance.
<!-- Page 97 -->
2. Additional Visual Media Services  
To further enhance the promotional materials for the Performing Arts Center and other rental facilities, we propose offering additional visual media services, including:  
- **Virtual Facility Tours**: Create 360-degree virtual tours of rental spaces to provide potential clients with an immersive experience of the facilities. This can increase engagement and help clients make more informed booking decisions.  
- **Drone Footage for Promotional Videos**: Use drone footage to capture dynamic views of the facilities and surrounding areas, adding a unique perspective to promotional content. This approach can help convey the scale and beauty of the venue more effectively than traditional ground-level footage.  

3. Expanded Community Outreach  
We recommend extending outreach efforts to further increase awareness and community engagement:  
- **Partnership with Local Organizations and Influencers**: Develop partnerships with local community organizations, businesses, and influencers to promote the Performing Arts Center and its events. This will help build credibility and reach new audiences through trusted local sources.  
- **Host Community Open Houses and Events**: Assistance in the organization of open houses or community events at the Performing Arts Center to showcase the venue and its capabilities. These events can serve as both promotional opportunities and community engagement initiatives.  

4. Data-Driven Optimization  
To ensure the highest level of effectiveness for all campaigns, we recommend implementing a robust data-driven optimization strategy:  
- **A/B Testing for Marketing Assets**: Conduct A/B testing for various digital ads, email templates, and social media posts to determine which assets resonate most with each target audience. Use the insights gained to continuously refine and improve campaign content.  
- **Advanced Analytics and Reporting**: Leverage advanced analytics tools to gain deeper insights into campaign performance, including heatmaps, session recordings, and user behavior flow analysis on the website. These insights can help identify areas for improvement and optimize the user experience.  

5. Contingency Planning and Flexibility  
Given the dynamic nature of event planning and marketing, we recommend building flexibility into the project plan:  
<!-- Page 98 -->
- **Adaptive Marketing Strategies:** Be prepared to adjust campaign strategies or budgets based on changes in event schedules, new facility offerings, or community feedback. This flexibility will allow us to respond quickly to any shifts in priorities and ensure that our marketing efforts remain aligned with FORPD’s evolving needs.
- **Crisis Communication Support:** Provide crisis communication support in the event of unforeseen circumstances that may impact events or the community. This could include developing prepared statements, managing social media responses, and coordinating with local media.

**Meeting Date:** December 18, 2024

**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Discussion and Possible Action Regarding Selection of SCI for Assessment Engineering Services  
**Prepared By:** Jennifer Larkin, Administrative Services Manager  

I. **Recommendation**  
SCI Consulting Group be selected to enter into a three-year contract for the District’s assessment engineering services and that the District Administrator be authorized to execute the contract.

II. **Background**  
Each year the District must commission the preparation of an Engineer’s Report and the submission of special assessment levies to Sacramento County for each of the District’s special assessment districts. SCI Consulting has provided this service to the District since the formation of the special districts. SCI Consulting is well versed on the property assessment requirements and property data for each of the Districts. In addition, SCI performs all coordination activities for the districts including serving as the primary contact for property owners and Sacramento County for assessment questions and issues.

The District follows the practice of releasing Requests for Proposals for services every 3-5 years. The RFP outlined additional items of work, enhanced overall standards of care, and increased the District’s avenues for recompense when standards are not met.

Two organizations responded to the RFP, SCI Consulting Group and NBS. Both proposals were responsive and impressive and are attached (Attachments A and B). Ultimately, SCI was the lower of the two bids and therefore selected by the District as its preferred provider.

![WORK PLAN AND APPROACH](https://example.com/image.png)

**WORK PLAN AND APPROACH**

Based on our understanding of the District’s requested services as detailed in the District’s RFP, we propose the following work plan and approach. We confirm that we have no modifications to propose. We will deliver all services and fulfill all requirements detailed in the RFP, ensuring full compliance with its specifications, including any elements not explicitly stated herein.

Our approach is designed to provide comprehensive services that minimize the District’s time and resource expenditure by adhering to solid project management principles. We ensure all project deliverables will be of the highest quality, legally defensible, and delivered on time and within budget.

**Assessment Engineering and Annual Assessment Levy Administration**

**Assessment Engineering and Engineer’s Reports.** As the Assessment Engineer of Record, SCI will annually prepare the preliminary Engineer’s Reports for the assessment districts. Each report will include a description of services and improvements, cost estimates, assessment methodology, the assessment diagram, and the assessment roll. We integrate any Proposition 218 developments and legal considerations that may influence the assessment levies.

In coordination with the District, SCI will establish the levy administration timeline for the upcoming fiscal year. We will obtain assessor data and other real property information required for annual assessments and upcoming year cost estimates. Additionally, SCI will research parcel attributes and ownership information to calculate and assign benefit assessments accurately. We will assist with budget preparation and prepare updated assessment diagrams and maps as needed. SCI will also prepare an updated benefit analysis, cost estimates, method of apportionment, and other assessment engineering elements for each Engineer’s Report.

**Determination of Preliminary Assessment Levies.** Twice a year, SCI will recalculate and confirm the assessment levies on a parcel-by-parcel basis for all subject properties. While more time-consuming than simply relying on County Assessor property characteristics and previous levy amounts, this additional step has consistently proven to result in more accurate levies and higher overall assessment revenues.

Beginning each March, based on the most current Assessor lien roll data, SCI will determine preliminary assessment levies. We will research property data changes, usage, valuations, and levy changes from the previous year for all parcels within the District’s boundaries and flag all parcels requiring property research to determine the appropriate assessment levy. This process lets us...

<!-- Page 108 -->
![Proposal for Assessment Engineering Services, November 22, 2024](https://example.com/image-url)

**Quality Assurance and Quality Control.** We take great pride in our levy administration process and our stringent quality control and oversight to ensure the accuracy of assessment levels. Each year, we run over 50 checks and validation queries on each parcel to identify and resolve any issues. After the preliminary assessment levies are determined, another levy administrator at SCI will perform an independent peer review and audit, including a parcel-by-parcel confirmation of the assessment levels. Any questions or issues uncovered are fully reviewed and resolved. These multiple-stage reviews ensure the highest level of accuracy and maximize assessment levy revenues for our clients.

**Determination of Final Assessment Levies.** After the close of each fiscal year, SCI will determine the final assessment levies based on final lien roll data as of July 1. All new or changed parcels will be identified, and the final assessment levies will be determined on a parcel-by-parcel basis.

**Levy Submittal and Confirmation.** Once the assessment levies have been internally approved, SCI will prepare the final assessment levy roll for submittal to the County Tax Collector. We will meet the Tax Collector’s submission requirements and provide all necessary documentation for the inclusion of the assessment levies on the County’s consolidated property tax bill, ensuring deadlines are met. Electronic levy rolls sorted by Assessor Parcel Number and Property Owner’s Name will also be prepared and submitted to the District. SCI will receive written confirmation of the approval of the assessment levies and communicate this confirmation with the District. We will confirm the final assessments prior to the issuance of tax bills.

**Resolutions, Notices, and Staff Reports.** SCI will prepare all resolutions for the preliminary and final approval of the Engineer’s Report, confirmation of assessment levies, and other necessary resolutions and associated staff reports. We will prepare and publish a notice of public hearing for the continuation of the assessments. Additionally, SCI will assist with the publication of notices to continue the assessment levies.

**Inquiries and Information Requests.** SCI will work with the County Tax Collector to incorporate our taxpayer inquiry line (800-273-5167) into the tax bill, allowing property owners, title companies, and other stakeholders to contact us year-round regarding assessment inquiries. Our bilingual representatives ensure responses within 24 hours, upholding a professional image for the District and minimizing any inconvenience to taxpayers and the District.

**District Resources**

# About SCI Consulting Group

Established in 1985, SCI Consulting Group is a recognized public finance consulting firm with leading expertise in assisting California public agencies with local funding of public services and improvements. SCI employs approximately 20 people at its primary location in Fairfield, California. The annual assessment engineering and administration work for this project will be conducted at the Fairfield office. SCI staff is well-experienced and well-trained in all aspects of assessment engineering, data analysis, mapping, and legal, political, and administrative work required for these services.

We also possess industry-leading expertise with the important legal and procedural requirements for establishing Community Facilities Districts, Benefit Assessment Districts, development impact fee programs, utility rate fees and charges, and other local financing mechanisms. Moreover, SCI annually administers over 1,000 special taxes, assessments, fees, and charges for over 200 public agencies throughout the State. This expertise and experience will ensure that your goals and objectives are met successfully, collaboratively, on schedule, and on budget.

We respectfully offer the following for your consideration:

**MOST COMPREHENSIVE LEVY ADMINISTRATION SCOPE**  
The administration of the District’s special levies is a very important fiduciary responsibility that should entail significant effort to ensure that the special levies are collected accurately and defensibly. Through the process of designing and establishing many new post-Proposition 218 benefit assessments, we have gained unparalleled and comprehensive Proposition 218 data flow and compliance expertise.

**EXISTING LEVY OPTIMIZATION EXPERTISE**  
As noted, SCI Consulting Group’s primary expertise is the levy administration of assessments, fees, charges, and special taxes for public agencies. With over 39 years of experience in this specialized field, we have never missed a levy submission deadline and have an unparalleled track record of finding additional revenues for agency levies that another firm previously administered. In fact, in nearly every case in which SCI has begun to administer special levies that another firm or public agency previously handled, we have often uncovered significant additional revenues due to incorrect previous amounts or missing parcels that should be subject to the levies.

**KNOWLEDGE OF THE DISTRICT AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY**  
We have worked extensively throughout Sacramento County, including serving as the Assessment Engineer and Levy Administrator for the District since 1998.

![Proposal for Assessment Engineering Services](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Proposal+for+Assessment+Engineering+Services)

**COLLECTIVE LEGAL EXPERTISE**  
SCI has also gained a considerable and unmatched advantage from the collective input of most of the State’s leading Proposition 218 specialized attorneys with whom we worked on formations and on the continued justification of the over 175 post-Proposition 218 agency-wide assessments we created and annually reauthorized.

**UNMATCHED ABILITY TO HANDLE LARGE AREA/COMPLEX LEVIES**  
SCI has successfully formed more agency-wide benefit assessments than all other firms in the State combined. This is further evidence of our ability to form and administer large levy assessments. These include new assessments covering all parcels in Alameda, Orange, San Diego, San Joaquin, San Mateo, and Santa Clara Counties.

**UNMATCHED TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES**  
Every person in our firm, aside from our administrative staff, is a database expert. We have developed in-house, specialized programs to improve our levy administration services. We are also GIS and mapping experts. We invite you to compare, or better yet test, our database and technical expertise with the staff of any other firm.

**LOW OVERHEAD/LOW-COST PROVIDER**  
We understand that levy administration services must be provided cost-effectively, particularly to keep the District’s costs within budget constraints. For this reason, we maintain the lowest overhead and leanest structure in the industry. While other firms maintain multiple offices, hierarchical administration, and much higher overhead costs, we operate more effectively and with much lower overhead out of one central office located in an economically favorable business area.

**UNMATCHED RESPONSIVENESS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE**  
We invite you to call our toll-free property owner assistance line at (800) 273-5167 and compare our level of service and responsiveness with any other firm. We answer calls directly with knowledgeable levy administration staff. We also provide the highest level of customer service and responsiveness for all our clients, including responding to all of our clients within the same day.

In 2004, SCI assisted the District with the passage of a districtwide benefit assessment measure to fund parks and open space. This assessment measure encompassed over 45,000 parcels and generated more than $1.2 million in revenue each year. In 2016, SCI assisted the District with the successful passage of a districtwide special tax measure to replace the benefit assessment, which had a 15-year sunset. This new tax has no sunset provision, so it will be able to provide a steady source of revenue for the foreseeable future.

SCI was initially hired in 1996 to administer over 50 existing landscaping and lighting assessments in the City and to assist the City with Proposition 218 compliance services. Upon review of all the existing assessments, we determined that eight assessments required ballot approval to continue, pursuant to Proposition 218. SCI assisted the City with the successful ballot and assessment re-confirmation for all eight assessment districts.

In the first year of administering the assessments that previously were handled by another firm, we uncovered over $25,000 of annual revenues that the previous firm had not correctly assessed. Since 1996, we have accurately and efficiently administered the City’s assessments and assisted the City in successfully establishing over 50 new landscaping and lighting assessment districts. The City’s assessment districts currently generate over $3 million in annual revenues for the City.

Administrative Services Manager  
Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District  
4150 Temescal Street  
Fair Oaks, CA 95628  

**RE: Proposal for Assessment Engineer and Related Services**  

Dear Jennifer and team,

We reviewed the Fair Oaks Recreation and Parks District (District) Request for Proposal in great detail, and we understand that the District requires experienced support in managing the existing Assessment Districts. It is imperative that the Assessment Districts are proactively managed in accordance with the respective assessment formulae and normal principles. The data must be managed well to achieve accuracy and appropriate revenues. These Assessments provide needed funding for many services across the community, and the Fair Oaks staff and community expect top notch service.

As you might know, NBS has a 28-year history of providing such services and support to communities across the State. We levied $1 billion of similar charges on parcels across many communities this past year, as an example of our capacity to do this work.

In just the past few years, NBS has been hired many times as a new consultant to complete a full review of existing Assessment Districts, as well as parcel taxes in some cases. Our methods allow us to analyze the relevant boundaries and levy amounts, and in all of these cases, we found many errors and problems with the data. For one special district client, we were able to increase the overall levies by more than $300K as well as correct parcels that were overcharged, resulting in a greater level of accuracy for the property owners than what had been provided by their current consultant. If hired, we are happy to offer optional additional audit services to ensure that the district is accurately levied.

We can also provide an enhanced level of service to you via our software, called D-FAST®. It would allow you and your staff full access to data for the Assessment Districts, such as ownership information, parcel data, maps, and levy amount history.

Please contact me in our San Francisco office at 800.434.8349 or via email at tseufert@nbs.gov.com if you have any questions or would like to discuss our professional qualifications further. We would genuinely like to provide administration on these Assessments to allow Fair Oaks to evolve and improve for the community.

With this letter, NBS affirms that we fully understand the Scope of Services, and we will commit to perform the work according to the timeline and specifications included in herein.

Sincerely,  

**Tim Seufert**  
Managing Director

![D-FAST® Online Software | Optional](https://example.com/image.png)

# D-FAST® Online Software | Optional
D-FAST® is an optional service enhancement for the District’s experience that allows direct access to the relevant data. This option is not part of the base Annual Administration services and fees.  
NBS developed D-FAST®, an acronym for District Fees, Assessments, and Special Taxes, which has become the industry-leading software. We use this powerful administrative tool in-house to administer a wide range of special taxes, special assessments, and other parcel charges for our clients. It is also licensed to public agencies across the United States for their internal use. D-FAST® is an optional service enhancement for the District’s experience to access the data; however, this selection is completely optional and is not conditional to perform the Annual Administration services.

Our D-FAST® web portal, called D-FAST® Online Pro, is available to our clients (small annual subscription fee) and uniquely combines real-time D-FAST data with County parcel boundaries and Google Maps. It provides “real-time” access to districts and underlying parcel data, allowing the District to:

- Gain enhanced insight with integrated Google Map’s satellite imagery, street maps, and 360° street view.
- View ownership, property information, and boundaries for each parcel.
- See detailed billing & payment history for each account.
- Understand a particular parcel’s background and status.
- Confirm if there are overlapping districts on a single parcel.

With D-FAST® Online Pro, District staff have enhanced access to the data while NBS still provides the full administration and toll-free phone support.

# Public Engagement Services | Optional
Public Engagement is a planned process where the District and the community work together to express their points of view and discover common ground. NBS recommends the District consider developing this critical stage of the governance process. We offer a unique perspective to engagement and outreach efforts because we understand the district formation and administration process. NBS offers ongoing engagement to support administration efforts and focused engagement during new formations and 218 proceedings.

Throughout our engagement, we provide sage guidance and recommendations. We are often called upon to present complex issues to councils, boards and interested parties.

We have supported thousands of SFDs including millions of parcels and have worked through virtually every conceivable challenge in their use. Our experience is with all manner of special assessments, special taxes – including Community Facilities Districts (CFDs) – and other fees.

#### NBS WROTE THE BOOK ON SPECIAL FINANCING DISTRICTS

We believe in continuing education, not only for our own team, but also for our clients and municipal staff. Our Special Financing Districts Primer may be of particular interest to the District:

- **Special Financing Districts (SFDs)** has been credited as the best publication on SFDs in a decade by prominent industry professionals.

Also available is a video covering NBS’ capabilities in Special Financing District Administration.

As industry leaders, we have a unique set of qualifications and experience in the work we perform. In that regard, in addition to the SFD booklet noted above, we have published three additional booklets on related industry topics, per below, that can be downloaded at no charge at [www.nbs.gov.com/insights](http://www.nbs.gov.com/insights) (click on NBS Publications). For a hard copy, please call 800.676.7516 or email contactnbs@nbs.gov.com.

- **Rates, Fees and Charges Compendium** has received high regard and interest from industry professionals.
- **Stormwater: A Ten-Step Funding Plan** addresses the spectrum of stormwater needs in California.
<!-- Page 139 -->
- **Community Facilities Districts (CFDs)** explains this robust funding and financing tool for local governments in California. Check out our video on this topic.

### Transitioning the Work
NBS has demonstrated dozens of times our ability to shift work from the previous consultant to us: We make this process as painless as possible by providing the District key action items needed to transition the work. We have a successful process in place to "onboard" new clients and create a seamless transition for District staff. Our proprietary software, D-FAST®, allows us to view the essential data in real-time to ensure the districts retain their accuracy.

NBS completed a full review of these districts’ boundaries and levies in March 2023. The result of our review was a net increase to the overall levies of the LLDs by more than $250k and CFD 1 was increased approximately $70k. Our review also corrected the levies for parcels that were being overcharged, resulting in a greater level of accuracy for property owners. We want to give the District peace of mind and the reassurance that their districts are being assessed accurately and completely going forward. Our experience with the District and across the many 100’s of similar SFDs, as well as the systems we have developed for this purpose will ensure that. For instance, in the illustration above, the parcels highlighted in green represent properties currently levied for that specific district. The parcels highlighted in red represent those located within the district boundary but not being levied, parcels that straddle the district boundary, and those parcels located outside of the boundary that are being levied in error (district boundaries are illustrated by the dark blue outline).

At NBS, we give your data a real time application and provide the District with a visual representation to tell the story. A picture is worth a thousand words, but when it illustrates missing parcels, it could highlight millions of dollars over time. It is our goal to capture as much revenue as possible for these essential services that the District provides to its constituents. This also ensures that local dollars are being spent within the designated local communities.

The East Bay Regional Park District hired NBS a few years back to manage their large special assessment and tax districts, replacing their previous consultant. These existing assessments and tax districts include large parcel count districts spanning a significant geographic portion of both Alameda and Contra Costa County. Subsequently, EBPRD also recently engaged NBS to replace a 20-year parcel tax with a CFD tax. The measure was successful and encompasses nearly 240,000 parcels across two counties. NBS also led the District in pursuit of their first CFDs a couple years ago. This effort included adopting Local Goals and Policies and Board-level interaction.

NBS currently administers five (5) CFDs (three of which are bonded CFDs that also include services components, and two of which are maintenance CFDs with multiple annexations per year) on behalf of the City, in addition to three maintenance assessments. For FY 2024-25, NBS levied over $42 million dollars in revenue across more than 56,000 parcels within the City’s Districts.

**NBS Project Team:**  
Corina Chavez, Adina McCargo, Sara Mares  

The City of Eastvale in Riverside County utilizes Special Financing Districts (SFDs) including Landscape Maintenance Districts, Benefit Assessment Districts and Community Facilities Districts (CFDs) to support infrastructure and services. NBS has assisted the City since incorporation with studies relating to the parks and SFDs within the city limits. We provided assistance with the required transfers of LMDs from the County at the time and again recently from the Jurupa Community Services District. We reviewed documents relating to the transfers and formations completed by other consultants, performed fund audits, and provide regular, ongoing consulting related to the incorporation of more SFDs as they increase control over the improvements within the City boundary. NBS provides a full range of annual administration and support services for the City and is an integral part of this function. In the most recent Fiscal Year, NBS levied 107 districts containing 22,500 parcels totaling $880K in revenue on behalf of the City. In addition, NBS has formed several SFDs for the City of Eastvale.

NBS has also assisted Eastvale with the formation of multiple maintenance assessment districts and CFDs related to new development in the community. The City has historically utilized assessment districts for maintenance funding; however, NBS helped the City adjust the language in their agreements with developers to allow for the use of CFDs as a more flexible tool for maintenance funding.
