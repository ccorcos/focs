Question from Gage Burget Bobo Construction, Inc. on Thursday, Jul 18, 2024 at 01:28 PM PDT  
The finish schedule on sheet A10.1 does not call for the stage walls or ceiling to receive any paint. During the site walk on 7/18/24, it was discussed that paint may be desired in these locations due to existing conditions (see photos attached). Please confirm if paint is desired here and what color is to be used.  

Additionally, per the finish schedule, rooms 007 and 008 are called out as having P1 as the ceiling paint color. In the site walk it was discussed that these should be P3 for the ceilings. Please confirm that the color is being changed to P3.

**Meeting Date:** September 18, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Reappointment of Bond Oversight Committee Members  

I. **Recommendation**  
The Board of Directors hereby authorizes the one-year reappointment of Garett McDermid and Diana Storo as members of the Bond Oversight Committee (BOC). Their new term will expire in September 2025.  

II. **Background**  
The Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District General Obligation Bond Measure (Measure J), approved by voters in November 2018, authorized the issuance of $26.9 million in bonds to fund a variety of park projects. As part of this measure, an independent citizen Bond Oversight Committee (BOC) was created to monitor the expenditure of bond funds and ensure that they are used exclusively for the projects specified in the Bond Project List.  

The BOC was established by Resolution 2019-01, approved on February 27, 2019. The resolution also adopted By-Laws that outline the committee’s structure, responsibilities, and procedures. BOC members serve as a vital source of public input and accountability, working with the Board and staff to review and advise on issues related to Measure J projects.  

Due to some delays in projects caused by external factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board amended the By-Laws in February 2023 to allow BOC members to serve multiple consecutive one-year terms, ensuring continuity until all bond projects are completed. Garett McDermid and Diana Storo have been dedicated members of the BOC, and with the bond projects nearing completion, their continued involvement is crucial.
<!-- Page 85 -->
### III. Problem /Situation/ Request
Garett McDermid and Diana Storo’s current term on the BOC will expire at the end of September 2024. Both members have expressed their desire to continue serving for another one-year term. Given that the Measure J bond projects are approaching completion, reappointing these experienced members will help maintain consistency and oversight as the final stages of the projects are executed.

#### Reappointment terms:

| Member           | Original Appointment | New Term Month |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Garett McDermid  | September 2021      | September 2025 |
| Diana Storo      | September 2021      | September 2025 |

### IV. Financial Analysis
There is no financial impact to the District.

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

**Meeting Date:** September 18, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Update to Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District’s Conflict-of-Interest Code  
**Prepared by:** Jennifer Larkin, Administrative Services Manager  

I. **Recommendation**  
Approve changes to the District’s Conflict of Interest (CIC) Code, as noted in Attachment A.

II. **Background**  
The Political Reform Act requires that every local government agency review its Conflict of Interest Code (CIC) biennially. Each agency must submit to the County Board of Supervisors a notice indicating whether or not an amendment is necessary.

III. **Problem /Situation/ Request**  
The Sacramento County Board of Supervisors sends fact sheets to affected agencies. If amendments to an agency’s CIC are necessary, the amended code must be submitted to the Board of Supervisors for approval within 90 days of filing the biennial notice. An agency’s amended code is not considered effective until it has been approved by the Board of Supervisors.

The District has had several changes to its organizational structure, including the elimination of the Recreation Superintendent and Parks and Facilities Superintendent positions, as well as the addition of the Recreation Manager, Administrative Services Manager, Parks and Facilities Manager and the Arts and Entertainment Manager. Accordingly, staff has made the recommended revisions to the CIC to reflect organizational changes. The revisions are non-substantive.
