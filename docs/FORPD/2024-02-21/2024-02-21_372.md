**Notes:**
1. Insert Contractor's basic hourly rate, health & welfare, pension, vacation/holiday and other payments in columns "D to H", then add training to column "J". Subtotal straight and over time hourly rates will be calculated at column "K" which includes "Fringes Benefits". Please note that ONLY "basic hourly rates" will change for over time and all other "Fringe Benefits" remain the same as straight hourly rates.
2. Insert Contractor's workman compensation rate at lower section of column "N" where shows "0.00%" for each contractor/trade. Total hourly rate including "Fringes Benefits" and all "Burdens" will be calculated at column "R". Since "Burdens" are percentages of the "subtotal straight/OT hourly rates" they will increase for over time rates and will be calculated automatically by the spreadsheet.

B. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS IN STRUCTURES:

1. There are many hazardous materials which can be present in older structures where installers perform work. Common hazards can include, but are not limited to, asbestos, lead, mercury, mold and PCBs.

2. Determination as to whether these or other potentially hazardous materials are present, may have been conducted by a consulting professional, certified industrial hygienist or other IEP. The installer should ask about whether such an evaluation was conducted, and what potentially hazardous materials were identified, if any. The contractor should not assume that hazardous materials are not present.

3. Lead: Even when building age suggests that lead paint is unlikely to be present, the owner or owner’s agent should be consulted to verify. Use of lead-based paint was not banned for residential use in the United States until 1978, but other uses of lead continue to present day.

4. Asbestos: Even when building age suggests that asbestos is unlikely to be present, the owner or owner’s agent should be consulted to verify. Use of asbestos in the United States declined significantly in the United States and Canada during the 1980s but import and uses of asbestos-containing construction products continues to present day.

5. Abatement or disturbance of asbestos or lead typically require contracting firms, supervisors and workers to have a state-issued license. License types and requirements vary, and the restoration firm or professional should contact the pertinent agency in the state where the site is located to ascertain minimum training and licensing requirements.

C. EXAMINATION:

1. Before any waterproofing work is started, the Pli-Dek certified applicator shall thoroughly examine all surfaces for any deficiencies. Where deficiencies exist, the Architect, Owner, or Contractor shall be notified in writing and corrections made.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** February 21, 2024  
**To:** Foundation Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Foundation By-Laws revision  
**Prepared By:** Jen Schuler, Arts & Entertainment Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Authorize the District Administrator to submit the draft By-Laws (Attachment A) for the Fair Oaks Foundation of Leisure and the Arts to FORPD’s Attorney, facilitating the proposed transition of FORPD’s foundation to Fair Oaks Foundation for Leisure and the Arts (FOFLA).

---

**II. Background**  
The Fair Oaks Foundation of Leisure and the Arts (FOFLA), a charitable organization, operates exclusively for charitable and educational purposes. Its mission is to enhance community life through various activities, including supporting high-quality recreation, arts, and entertainment programs, as well as maintaining parks and facilities for Fair Oaks residents.

Founded in 2001, the Fair Oaks Recreation Foundation empowered the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District through financial support and community involvement. As a nonprofit public benefit corporation, it served as the fundraising source for the district. Now, FOFLA and the Fair Oaks Recreation and Park Foundation are poised to merge, streamlining efforts to support art and recreation programs in our community. This strategic move benefits both groups and aligns with the auditor’s recommendation for an independent entity.

---

**III. Problem /Situation / Request**  
This request seeks permission for staff to have the “newly edited” draft By-Laws (Attachment A) reviewed by FORPD’s attorney. These By-Laws were initially presented to the Board during the January 17, 2024, Board meeting. Following a request for additional considerations, edits were made and subsequently reviewed by the Community Resource Committee on February 6, 2024. The Committee recommends that the Board approve the revision of the By-Laws.
<!-- Page 114 -->
To implement the By-Laws, we will follow these steps:

1. **FORPD Board Approval:** The FORPD Board must approve the draft By-Laws with the revisions.
2. **FOFLA Approval:** FOFLA will review and approve the draft By-Laws.
3. **Attorney Review:** FORPD staff will send the draft By-Laws to our attorney for legal review.
4. **Final FOFLA Approval:** After legal review, FOFLA will provide final approval.
5. **Secretary of the State Submission:** The approved By-Laws will be submitted to the Secretary of the State.
6. **Foundation Dissolution:** The FORPD Foundation Board will convene to formally dissolve their foundation and transfer all assets to FOFLA. This systematic process ensures compliance and a smooth transition.

IV. **Financial Analysis**  
The cost for the District’s Attorney to review and revise the By-Laws will come from FORPD’s Attorney Services budgeted line item. Estimated costs are $1500-$2500.

Respectfully Submitted,

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

### Audience/Public Comment:
Justin Drake, Vice Chair, convened the monthly meeting at 6:39 pm. No public comment.

### Construction Delay
Mike discussed the delay in opening which is now estimated to be October 2024. There were a number of issues which pushed the opening to Fall of 2024. Extremely rainy weather period in early 2023, Clubhouse water intrusion issues, delayed notice to proceed from County and sections of the Clubhouse foundation needed to be corrected due to part of the foundation being supported by boulders. Additional issues with SMUD, change orders, theatre box office upgrades, etc. all contributed to the delay. Bobo Construction works on ways to solve issues promptly and without increasing the cost if at all possible.

### Measure J Budget:
Mike gave a condensed budget update and stated that the full presentation was given at the September 2023 FORPD Board meeting. The project remains in budget. Garett said he attended the Board meeting and viewed the presentation.

## Minutes for October 3, 2023

### Expenditure Review:
The Committee is required to do an annual expenditure review. Members that were present at the meeting picked two items from the FY23 expenditure list to review. Members who were absent will receive the list via email and are asked to provide to the Clerk two items they may wish to review. Clerk will gather information from the District Accountant and disburse to each members their items to review. Kim said the role of the BOC is to review annual expenditures. It is not our responsibility to make decision on projects.

### Committee Comments:
Kim asked Mike if the current FORPD Audit was completed. Mike said he will follow up on this and get back to Kim. Justin asked Committee members if the next meeting on December 5, 2023 was a conflict for anyone. All in attendance agreed to the next meeting being in December. Justin would like to discuss and complete the expenditure review at that time.

### Staff Comments:
Mike said that the FORPD Board would like the BOC Chair to give a report annually to the Board. Justin noted this request.

Justin motioned to adjourn the meeting. Dana seconded. Meeting adjourned 7:29 p.m.

### Next meeting will be December 5, 2023 at FORPD District Office and via video conference.

Amy Larsen, Chair, convened the monthly meeting at 6:31 pm. No public comment.

### Construction Update – Dave Fukui, ICS
Dave gave an overview on the Construction status as well as reasons for the delay in opening the Clubhouse and surrounding areas. Issues on getting road paving completed around the area has been a major concern as well as working with SMUD on power issues. Last winter’s storms caused water intrusion problems. An unexpected issue has been the county inspectors guidelines on fire wall code. Dave said everyone on the team is working diligently to mitigate the cost of the various issues. Keith noted that he was dissatisfied with the progress of the project.

### Bond Budget Presentation – Jamie Fawcett, District Accountant
Jamie gave a presentation on the Measure J budget which was similar to the presentation Jamie gave to the FORPD Board of Directors earlier. Kim asked that the information presented be posted on the FORPD Measure J bond tab on the Districts web page.

# STAFF REPORT

**Meeting Date:** February 21, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Fiscal Year (FY) 23/24 Mid-Year Budget Update  
**Prepared By:** Jennifer Larkin, Administrative Services Manager  

## I. Recommendation  
Receive and file this report which outlines the District’s financial status through January 2024.

## II. Background  
The Board of Directors adopted a budget totaling $3,312,068 for FY 23/24 including a contingency of $50,000. The adopted budget provided funding for all permanent positions, continued funding for current year capital expenses and anticipated annual operational expenses.

## III. Problem /Situation / Request  
The District continues to operate within the adopted budget and conservative year-end projections are included based upon the best financial and programmatic information available when this report was prepared. Attachment A provides a comparison of the FY 23/24 Adopted budget to year-to-date data as well as the same comparison for the previous three fiscal years.

### Expenditure Recap  
**Salaries and Benefits**  
The FY 23/24 Final Adopted Budget contained funding for all permanent positions as well as associated personnel costs. End-of-year projections show that the District is on target to meet, not exceed, the budgeted amounts, despite the extra cost incurred with some unexpected salary adjustments.  
**Estimated Savings in Salaries and Benefits:** $ 0  

**Services and Supplies**  
There are no anticipated savings for general operating expenses if all programs run as intended.  
**Estimated Savings in Services and Supplies:** $ 0  
<!-- Page 143 -->
Other Charges  
Expenditures are expected to be at budgeted levels in the Other Charges category which includes only the District’s assessment district taxes for District parcels.  
**Estimated Savings in Other Charges** $ 0  

**Capital Expenditures**  
The Buildings and Structures category funds Capital Projects that have been approved by the Board. Here is the breakdown for projects included in the total:  

| Project                          | Amount     |
|----------------------------------|------------|
| Old Library Roof Replacement      | $30,000    |
| Park Master Plan                 | $200,000   |
| **TOTAL**                        | **$230,000** |

The Old Library roof replacement is on hold until there is a determination about the future use of the facility; those funds remain unexpended. The Master Plan process has not started as of mid-year, but it is expected the process will begin in the next 6 months. The expense will roll over in the budget for FY 24-25.  

**Use of Contingency**  
No funds from the Contingency account have been expended to date.  

**Revenue Recap**  
**Property Tax Collections**  
Current-year property taxes are anticipated to be close to or slightly above budgeted levels.  

**Program and Facility Rental Revenues**  
Program revenues are projected to be close to budgeted levels based on historical information at mid-year; expenditures will be reduced based on whether programs run. Facility Rental Revenues are projected to be at or slightly higher than budgeted levels based on the total revenue at mid-year. It is notable that the projected revenue assumptions included the new facilities being open in the spring of 2024 with a couple of months of revenue included in the budget. Despite the delay in construction, rental revenue is still on track.  

**Cell Tower Lease Revenue**  
Cell tower revenue is anticipated to be at the budgeted amount.  

**IV. Financial Analysis**  
Expenditures and revenues are conservatively estimated for year-end. There is no anticipation of savings in expenditure accounts; however, areas of potential savings have been identified should program revenues not reach anticipated budgeted levels. Staff continues to research property tax revenue collections and changes in assessed values to validate the assumptions for FY 24/25 property tax revenues that will determine the impact on current and future operations. The most recent assessed valuation for next fiscal year has increased 4.5% over FY 23/24, and the next valuation will be available in March.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** February 21, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Approval of a Change Order in the Amount of $95,800 with WMB for Work Related to the Veteran’s Memorial Amphitheatre and the Community Clubhouse.

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Recommend that the Board approve the Change in Project Scope with WMB Architects and authorize the District Administrator to sign the Change. The Change in Project Scope will be $36,000 for the Community Clubhouse and $59,800 for Veterans Memorial Amphitheater for a total of $95,800 from the Measure J budget due to the increased scope and time for the Village/Plaza Park renovation project. (Attachment A).

**II. Background**  
The Village/Plaza Park renovation project has had many delays and increases in the scope of work due to various reasons including weather, utility design and construction, fire inspections and design changes. These delays and challenges have extended the completion time and will cause an increase in the need for Architectural Services for the Clubhouse and Veterans Memorial Amphitheater. WMB has been the Architectural Firm for this part of the project.

**III. Problem /Situation / Request**  
The Board has given the District Administrator the authority to sign changes in the project costs up to $70,000. Any change that exceeds this amount needs the Board’s approval. This change is $95,800, which is above the limit. Therefore, the Board’s permission is requested for this expense.

**IV. Financial Analysis**  
$95,800 from the Measure J Bond budget.

**Meeting Date:** February 21, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Adoption Of Resolution In Support Of Application For Senator Alex Padilla Fiscal Year 2025 Congressionally Directed Spending Requests.

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Adopt the Resolution 022124-03 approving the application for assistance in funding for ADA improvements in Village Park from Senator Alex Padilla Fiscal Year 2025 Congressional Directed spending request (Attachment A).

**II. Background**  
- Village/Plaza Park, the Community Clubhouse, and the Veterans Memorial Amphitheater have historically lacked accessibility for people with mobility challenges.  
- In October 2018, the voters of Fair Oaks approved Measure J, which aimed to enhance accessibility to FORPD’s facilities.  
- The Padilla Funding, if awarded, will play a crucial role in funding the necessary work to complete the accessibility improvements.

The Senate Appropriations Committee places significant emphasis on projects that are “shovel ready” or require a one-time infusion of funding to complete. Notably, the voters of Fair Oaks have demonstrated their commitment to this project by passing Measure J. Additionally, during the design phase, active community outreach has further bolstered our efforts. By aligning with these principles, we aim to secure the necessary funding and enhance accessibility in Fair Oaks.

**III. Problem /Situation / Request**  
The procedures established by the Fiscal Year 2025 Appropriations Process require the Applicant to certify by resolution the approval of the application before submission of said application. Therefore, we recommend that the Board approve the Resolution, as it is a mandatory requirement for the application process. This endorsement is necessary.

before submitting the application to Senator Padilla’s office. If funding is secured it will assist us in improving accessibility in Fair Oaks. The economic benefits resulting from these enhancements will positively impact the Fair Oaks area.  

IV. Financial Analysis  
If funds are awarded from Senator Padilla, the impact of material price increases, labor cost escalations, and project delays will be mitigated. These challenges would have a lesser financial impact on the Measure J budget.
