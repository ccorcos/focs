Per RFI 110 the distance of the 2” supply from meter to building will be about 355ft which will likely change these calcs.

Response from Gage Burget Bobo Construction, Inc. on Wednesday, Dec 14, 2022 at 06:16 AM PST:  
Please see the following from Mark III:  

In speaking with the team, we assumed a pressure range 30-45psi with at least 150ft from the meter to the building. Based on this, 1-1/2” branch line only allows 80 fixture units while we will need 105. Can you advise if our assumptions about the PSI and length from meter to building are correct or not?

Based on a meter distance of 355', a 1-1/2" CW line will serve 21 fixture units. Line serving the second floor restrooms will therefore need to be upsized to 2", which can serve 116 fixture units.

Meter location is within 150' of the building based on coordination with civil engineering. During design, we confirmed with the Fair Oaks Water District that the water pressure in the area is 67 PSI, which was used for the calculations. Based on this, the 1-1/2” line is sufficient for the fixtures served on the second floor. The difference between 130' and 150' did not affect the calculation. In general, a larger pipe size is acceptable as it will result in a smaller pressure drop.

Please reference Sheet P0.0 (dtd 03.26.21) "Domestic Water Sizing Calculation" for maximum fixtures units serving flush valve fixtures. Per this calculation, a 1-1/2” cold water line is sufficient to serve the first floor restroom fixtures. A 2” cold water line is an acceptable alternative. Please clarify which code requirements limit a 1-1/2” to (2) flush valve fixtures.

Please reference Sheet P0.0 (dtd 03.26.21) "Domestic Water Sizing Calculation" for maximum fixtures units serving flush valve fixtures. Per this calculation, a 1-1/2" cold water line is sufficient to serve the first floor restroom fixtures. A 2" cold water line is an acceptable alternative. Please clarify which code requirements limit a 1-1/2" to (2) flush valve fixtures.

![WATER COOLER WARRANTY AND LICENSE](https://www.hawsco.com)

**WATER COOLER WARRANTY AND LICENSE**

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN, MANUFACTURER HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARISING BY LAW OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THIS WARRANTY MAY NOT BE MODIFIED OR EXTENDED WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF HAWS. REMEDIES AND REPLACEMENTS STATED HEREIN ARE EXCLUSIVE. IN NO EVENT SHALL HAWS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OF ANY PERSON, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF USE OR PROFITS, SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR COSTS, PROPERTY DAMAGE, OR OTHER MONETARY LOSS.

1. **LIMITED BASED WARRANTY FOR AUTHORIZED RESELLERS AND INITIAL PURCHASERS.** Haws Corporation (“Haws”) warrants that every cooler and bottle filling station will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for one (1) year from the date of installation or if earlier, eighteen (18) months from date of shipment from Haws’ factory. Haws warrants that the compressor and hermetically sealed refrigeration system, which includes cooling coils and tank assembly, insofar as either is part of the hermetically sealed refrigeration system, will be free from material defects in materials and workmanship for one additional four (4) years from the end of the initial nine period described in the first sentence of this paragraph. (This warranty for years 2 through 5 is prorated for the remaining replacement value based on the portion of the warranty period expired.) The warranties collectively referred to herein as the “Limited Warranty”. This Limited Warranty applies only to coolers and bottle filling stations produced by or authorized resellers of Haws’ products, and (i) the initial purchaser (first owner) who purchases the product for their own resale.

2. **WARRANTY VOID.** The product must be installed and operated in accordance with Haws’ written instructions included with each unit. The Limited Warranty will be null and void. The products are designed to operate on 30 - 90 psi flowing inlet pressure. Depending on water temperature and flowing inlet pressure, Haws water coolers, ADA-compliant bottle stream heights are not guaranteed when both bottles are activated simultaneously. Where products are found to be have been subjected to negligence, recklessness, accident, alteration, abuse, carelessness, misuse, vandalism, corrosive type atmospheres, unapproved installations, faulty installation, or abnormal use, this Limited Warranty will be null and void.

3. **RESPONSIBILITIES.** The owner must be responsible for any repairs or maintenance not covered by this Limited Warranty, including service for issues that are limited hereunder. The owner must diligently notice Haws of any imperfections at the time of installation. Haws’ obligations under this Limited Warranty are limited to labor and parts to repair or replace any part which is expressly covered by this Limited Warranty at its factory repair department, if the product is in the United States or Canada. The Limited Warranty shall apply to any replacement unit until such time as the warranty period of the original unit (e.g., if a replacement cooler is installed in the same location as the original cooler, the replacement cooler will be covered for 4 months from installation). Haws’ duties also include costs of outbound freight (but not express freight) of the part or parts from the factory repaired to (but not beyond) the point in the United States from which the part or parts are shipped to the final destination, but only if the part or parts, and the purported defects or defects, are covered by this Limited Warranty, in Haws’ sole discretion. To obtain warranty service, Owner must call the factory. For the nearest Manufacturer factory, call (800) 766-5612.

4. **EXCLUSIONS.** This Limited Warranty does not include the costs of any labor for normal maintenance including adjustments such as water stream quality, water temperature or energy savings mode. The water system and laminar flow inserts are not covered by this Limited Warranty if Haws determines that they have become inoperative due to timing, and or similar residue or decomposition. This Limited Warranty is voided if repairs are made by any unauthorized party or the serial number data plate is removed or has been modified from its original state. Normal deterioration of finish caused by ordinary wear and tear, corrosion, or exposure is not covered by this Limited Warranty. Haws is not responsible for any repairs whatsoever to walls on which the coolers and bottle filling stations are installed. If inlet pressure is above 90 psi, a pressure regulator must be installed in the supply line to preserve this Limited Warranty. Any damage caused by connecting the water cooler and bottle filling stations to supply line pressures lower than 30 psi or higher than 90 psi is not covered by this Limited Warranty. If the coolers or water filling stations, as applicable, are altered, modified, or combined with any other machine or device this Limited Warranty is null and void. Caution: alteration or modification of the coolers and/or water filling stations may cause serious flooding and/or hazardous electrical shock or fire.

5. **LICENSE.** If the water cooler or bottle filling station includes embedded software, the owner and those using the product are granted a limited, restricted, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use such embedded software solely for the operation of the product in owner’s business and not for any commercial purpose. Haws retains title to the embedded software and all intellectual property rights therein and in any derivatives thereof. The owner and those using the product shall not remove or alter notices, legends or trademarks contained in the embedded software, nor shall they translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the embedded software except to the extent applicable law specifically prohibits this restriction. Any use of such embedded software not contemplated herein will void this Limited Warranty. The embedded software is provided “as is” and no warranty is provided by Haws.

Team,  

I have included two plan sheets highlighting where we would like to verify the built elevation in green. If you could get these elevations over to us quickly that would be greatly appreciated so we can get the ASI #28 out.  

Thanks, Amanda

**Meeting Date:** April 17, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho, District Administrator  
**Subject:** Request for Approval of Proposed FY24/25 Capital Improvement Plan  
**Prepared By:** Sean Ventura, Parks & Facilities Manager  

**I. Recommendation**  
Staff recommends approving the proposed 3-year Capital Improvement Plan as presented.  

**II. Background**  
Staff reviews the 3-year Capital Improvement Plan each year in an effort to identify changing goals within the District. The proposed Capital Improvement Projects will reflect only the upcoming fiscal year with the remainder of proposed projects listed for tracking purposes.  

Prior to being presented to the full Board of Directors, the 2024/2025 Capital Improvement Plan is brought before the Capital Committee for review, revision and approval. The committee meeting for the currently proposed Capital Improvement Plan was held on April 4th, 2024. Approval of the plan was received from the committee at that time.  

Projects proposed for the Capital Improvement Plan are separate to those receiving Measure J funding and will typically not utilize resources from the general obligation bond.  

**III. Problem / Situation / Request**  
It is requested that the proposed fiscal year 2024/2025 Capital Improvement Plan be approved. When proposals are ready to be requested on individual projects from the plan, staff will return to the Board of Directors to seek final approvals.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Meeting Date:** April 17, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Allocation Request of Funds from the District’s Awarded American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Funds to Support Future Salary for a Technical and Operational Supervisor Position  

I. **Recommendation**  
Designate $88,500 of the $130,000 that Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District received from Sacramento County through Supervisor Rich Desmond from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Funds for wage costs for fiscal year 2024/25 for the Technical and Operational Supervisor role.  

II. **Background**  
Sacramento County has been proactive in utilizing the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021 to support local entities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The County developed a Beneficiary Questionnaire Form to assist small businesses, nonprofits, and special district organizations in evaluating and quantifying negative economic impacts experienced as a result of the pandemic. Organizations that have faced such impacts would be eligible for financial assistance from the County’s State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund, which aims to provide grants to mitigate financial hardship, including support for payroll and benefits, employee retention costs, and other operating expenses.  
Our staff lead, Sean Ventura, recognizing the potential of these funds to help mitigate the loss of revenue experienced during COVID, requested ARPA funds with the intent to support the Fair Oaks Performance Art Center and the facilities funded by Measure J. This request aligns with the County’s objective to provide relief to organizations that have been financially impacted by the pandemic, ensuring they can continue to serve the community effectively.

### III. Problem /Situation / Request
The Fair Oaks Performing Art Center, along with the facilities being developed through Measure J funds, are at a pivotal stage where the appointment of a dedicated Technical and Operational Supervisor is crucial for the operational success. We are requesting the authority to set aside $88,500 to cover a full year’s salary, inclusive of benefits, for this position. The role is envisioned to be central to the operation of the Fair Oaks Performance Art Center and associated facilities. The funds requested will be set aside as staff finalize the job duties and description and conducts a comprehensive financial analysis. This analysis will assess the sustainability of the position, taking into account projected program fees, charges, and facility rental income. Furthermore, at a subsequent Board Meeting, staff will present a detailed job description and a fiscal plan to sustain the position in the coming years. By requesting that the funds be placed in reserve, we can proceed with the assurance of having a one-year cushion to work towards sustainability.

We believe that this strategic investment will not only enhance the operational efficiency of our new facilities but also ensure that they are utilized to their full potential, providing cultural enrichment and community engagement opportunities.

Your approval of this request will enable us to move forward with planning the necessary staffing to support the anticipated growth and success of the Fair Oaks Performance Art Center. The Board’s approval of this request will not only provide immediate financial relief but also contribute to the long-term sustainability and success of the Fair Oaks Performance Art Center, reinforcing its role as a cornerstone of cultural and community engagement in our region.

This allocation would provide time for staff to create and stabilize a revenue source for the on-going funding of the position. The creation of this role is deemed essential for the efficient operation and management of the new Arts and Entertainment program. This position will play a pivotal role in ensuring seamless execution of productions, events, and performances at the new performing arts center and other related district facilities. The new Technical and Operations Position would provide expertise in technical theater operations, equipment management, facility operations and team leadership, contributing significantly to the overall future success of the program.

![Financial Analysis](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Financial+Analysis)

**IV. Financial Analysis**  
Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District was awarded $130,000 from Sacramento County COVID relief funds through the American Rescue Plan Act and is asking that $88,500 of those funds be allocated for salary for the potential Technical and Operational staff position for one year. At a future Board Meeting Staff will be requesting the authority to create a new position for the Arts and Entertainment Division. The request presented by staff will include an official job title, description, duties and salary and will include a financial analysis of how the position can be sustained financially. If the Board does not agree to create the new position, the $88,500 will remain in the District’s budget for future use.

Respectfully Submitted,  

Michael J. Aho  
District Administrator

**Meeting Date:** April 17, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho – District Administrator  
**Subject:** Adoption Of Resolution In Support Of Application For Congressman Ami Bera Fiscal Year 2025 Congressionally Directed Spending Requests.  

**I. Recommendation**  
Adopt the Resolution 041724-01 approving the application for assistance in funding for ADA improvements in Village Park from Congressman Ami Bera's Fiscal Year 2025 Congressional Directed spending request (Attachment A).

**II. Background**  
- Village/Plaza Park, the Community Clubhouse, and the Veterans Memorial Amphitheater have historically lacked accessibility for people with mobility challenges.  
- In October 2018, the voters of Fair Oaks approved Measure J, which aimed to enhance accessibility to FORPD’s facilities.  
- The Bera Funding, if awarded, will play a crucial role in funding the necessary work to complete the accessibility improvements. The House Appropriations Committee places significant emphasis on projects that are “shovel ready” or require a one-time infusion of funding to complete. Notably, the voters of Fair Oaks have demonstrated their commitment to this project by passing Measure J. Additionally, during the design phase, active community outreach has further bolstered our efforts. By aligning with these principles, we aim to secure the necessary funding and enhance accessibility in Fair Oaks.

**III. Problem /Situation / Request**  
The procedures established by the Fiscal Year 2025 Appropriations Process recommend that the Applicant certify by resolution the approval of the application before submission of said application. Therefore, we recommend that the Board approve the Resolution, as it is a recommendation for the application process. This endorsement is

necessary before submitting the application to Congressman Bera’s office. If funding is secured it will assist us in improving accessibility in Fair Oaks. The economic benefits resulting from these enhancements will positively impact the Fair Oaks area.

IV. Financial Analysis  
If funds are awarded from Congressman Bera, the impact of material price increases, labor cost escalations, and project delays will be mitigated. These challenges would have a lesser financial impact on the Measure J budget.

**FAIR OAKS**  
**RECREATION & PARK DISTRICT**

**Meeting Date:** April 17, 2024  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Michael J. Aho - District Administrator  
**Subject:** Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District (FORPD) Submission to the 2023 State Controller’s Government Compensation in California Report  
**Prepared By:** Jennifer Larkin, Administrative Services Manager  

---

**I. Recommendation**  
Receive and file the FORPD submission to the Government Compensation in California (GCC) Report of the California State Controller’s Office (SCO) for the 2023 calendar year.

**II. Background**  
The SCO uses its independent authority to guard taxpayer dollars, fight waste and uncover fiscal fraud and abuse. This report is mandated by the order of the State Controller.

In 2010, the SCO created the GCC website to enhance government transparency and provide a single statewide database that is accessible by anyone at any time. At first, the SCO collected government compensation data as a component of the financial transaction reports from cities, counties, and special districts under the authority of Government Code sections 53891 and 53892. In 2015, the Legislature explicitly authorized SCO to collect compensation data. The SCO is required to publish the information on its website under the authority of Government Code section 12463.

The GCC website contains pay and benefit information for positions in cities, counties, special districts, and state government, including California State University (CSU). Other public employers submit pay and benefit information.

information on a voluntary basis for positions in superior courts, the University of California, community college districts, K-12 education providers, First 5 commissions, and fairs and expositions.

The attached report contains compensation information for all employees who worked for the District in 2023, including wages, retirement contributions and group insurance contributions.

IV. Financial Analysis  
There is no financial impact associated with the staff recommendation.
