**VIII. REPRESENTATIVE REPORTS**

1. **Sacramento Groundwater Authority (SGA)**
   - Vice President Marx reported that costs are going up 15% due to regulatory requirements.
<!-- Page 5 -->
2. Regional Water Authority (RWA)  
- Vice President Marx reported that RWA saved $75,000 last year. They discussed priorities for next year including the water bank.  
- Director Page read the following statement:  

“Thank you for providing the briefing materials. I appreciate the strategic approach being taken by the RWA. In particular, the planning goals, objectives and sub-objectives are comprehensive, on “point” and clearly written.  

It is important going forward to clearly understand the various roles and responsibilities being undertaken by the RWA, the SGA and the Water Forum. Each of these organizations are developing, and each serve with a regional perspective. This is important because their work counters the need for merging the operations of independent water agencies.  

Because we are a ground water producer, we take steps to ensure that any water that is put into the ground is clean and safe and that steps are taken to ensure inferior water is treated before transferred to others. For example, many wells in the Mather Field area have cancer causing contaminants. If SSWD wants to share their ground water with others, it should be required to source the water from wells that are not contaminated or treat the contaminated water before transferring it.  

I understand that water can be “legally used” for consumption even though it is known to contain cancer-causing elements. But my view is that we should continue to strive and insist on using only the best available water for our customers. Perhaps there is a role for RWA to develop policies around this issue and perhaps we need a water treatment plant to function as a “clearing house” for ground water that is shared within the region.  

At our last meeting we had a presentation by SJWD regarding the Hinkle Reservation Project, and the plans SJWD has made to facilitate the relining of the reservoir and other work. I bring this up now because SJWD has decided to serve ground water from SSWD within its service area. It is important that SJWD more clearly defines its roles and responsibilities. I think RWA, SWA and the Water Forum are providing all the regional collaboration we need. But within the SJWD service area, we need better planning and communication around strategic plans and how we can work better together.  

I am not satisfied with the plan SJWD presented at our last meeting. That plan is to pump inferior ground water about 11 miles uphill to then serve to SJWD customers primarily in the Orangevale area. We have better ground water within the service area from the Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks area that could be used to support the Hinkle project. Better water, and less transfer difference. I would like to see a better plan.  

Finally, FOWD needs to find ways to be compensated for its ground water. The ground water we have in the Fair Oaks area is a type of “wealth” that belongs to the property.
