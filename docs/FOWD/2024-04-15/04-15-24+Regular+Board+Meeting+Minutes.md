addressed his concern regarding the lack of response from Board Members, except from President Petersen—he always responds. This is inexcusable. He expects a response every time he writes a letter. He would also like to know where he can find more information regarding the current lawsuit.

- Director Sarkovich advised Visitor Corcos to visit the FOWD website to obtain lawsuit information, as it is posted there. Director Sarkovich stated he read Visitor Corcos’ email and is puzzled at his objective of moving the Corporate Yard somewhere else. Director Sarkovich stated that this is not the first time Visitor Corcos has attacked General Manager Gray’s character and he does not understand how doing so helps in convincing the Board to go along with his plan. Director Sarkovich stated he will not engage in those type of emails.

- Visitor Corcos responded that when they presented to the Board last March, three out of the five Board Members already had their written response, even before their presentation began. He does not believe any of the Board Members will change their mind.

- Director Marx stated that when an argument is presented, he weighs the pros and cons. Before writing his response, he spent four to five months analyzing the situation and nothing new was presented that day. It was a close call, but he decided to move forward with the Corporation Yard Project. He is not set in his ways; he will always continue to listen.

- Director McRae stated that he tries not to engage in inflammatory emails. If this is the way he approached, he agrees. He reminded Visitor Corcos of giving him one-on-one time. He spent about an hour and a-half to two hours listening to what Visitor Corcos wanted to share. Director McRae believes he has gone above and beyond with him, compared to other rate payers.

- SJWD General Manager Helliker commended FOWD for posting the Board Packet on the website. He also commented that there doesn’t appear to be capacity for water transfer this year. There has been progress in the water forum agreement and the goal is to have a draft ready by this summer.

- Visitor Joe M. introduced himself and stated he has been working with East Bay Mud upgrading facilities. He inquired about the bids for the Corporate Yard Project.

- President Petersen responded that the Corporate Yard Project is currently at the permitting process stage with Sacramento County. No contractors have been selected yet.

<!-- Page 5 -->

- General Manager Gray stated that SSWD’s report indicates that SJWD initiated the discussion of a potential merger.

- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated that he is unsure what SSWD’s General Manager was referring to in that statement. SSWD’s General Manager could have been referring to conversations he has had with SJWD Board Members. SJWD General Manager Helliker guarantees there has been no conversations with his staff.
- Board President Petersen inquired what would be the need or benefit for SJWD to merge, instead of remaining independent. This is a topic of discussion that has come up in the past.
- SJWD General Manager Helliker referred to a 2014 report. This report argued that a merger would make it administratively easier to share water. However, this was not a detailed analysis. In order to consider the idea of a merger, a full case analysis would need to be conducted.
- President Petersen stated that the ongoing discussion of a potential merger has soured the relationship between SJWD and FOWD. FOWD was hopeful for a conjunctive use agreement. A SJWD Board Member expressed it was a waste of time. However, SJWD seems interested in a conjunctive use agreement, but with another entity. It would make more sense for SJWD to work with a wholesale customer. FOWD remains interested in this agreement.
- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated the comments made by SJWD’s Board Members were inaccurate.

XI. PUBLIC COMMENT  
   • Visiting Customer Babcock commented that for any Fair Oaks residents visiting Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District (FOPRD), it’s easier and closer to park on the East end. There is an unspoken advantage to putting the parking lot on the West side for the two evening restaurants that are owned by the advocate of moving the yard. If one of those establishments does not survive, that person gets less income. He believes there was an error in seeking multiple evening eating establishments in that property, as opposed to mixing it with more of a day-time establishment; having only one restaurant. There is not enough parking for multiple evening restaurants. There is an invested financial interest for the owner of this property. Modifying the current plans and resubmitting them to the county will be costly.  
   • General Manager Gray stated that FOWD works with the homes located on the North side. Operations cannot be moved to the East side because FOWD does not have an agreement with those homes. FOWD’s mission statement is to serve water. FOWD is not a parking business. FOWD is a self-contained entity.  
   • Visiting Customer Babcock thanked the Board of Directors and the Management Team and stated that they are doing a splendid job.
