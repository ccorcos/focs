# AGENDA ITEM III.4
## REGULAR Board Meeting April 15, 2024

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Chi Ha-Ly  
**Date:** April 12, 2024  
**Subject:** Accept and File Financial Expense Report for the month of March 2024  

### Recommendation:
None at this time. Monthly financial expenses presented for informational purposes.

### Discussion:
Attached is the financial report for the month of March 2024.

Please note that the monthly financial report is on a cash basis; therefore, a budgeted line item could be 100% expended as of March 2024.

As of March 2024, the District has 79.21% of remaining adjusted budget.

This report provides a quick snapshot of the operating expenses incurred by the District and does not include items that are capitalized (i.e. costs of construction jobs, fixed assets). The capital projects are reported separately under the “Capital Projects Status Report.”

### Policy Implications:
None as a result of recommended action.

### Fiscal Impact:
None as a result of recommended action.

# AGENDA ITEM V.2
**REGULAR Board Meeting April 15, 2024**

To: Board of Directors  
From: Tom R. Gray  
Date: April 11, 2024  
Subject: Update on RFP to provide professional design services required to redrill and equip a new groundwater well at the existing Northridge Well Site in Fair Oaks  

**Recommendation:**  
None – information item.

**Discussion:**  
In 2023 the FOWD Board of Directors approved the replacement of the existing groundwater production facility located at 8251 Kaula Drive in Fair Oaks.

- The existing well was drilled and equipped over thirty-three years ago using outdated methods and technology.
- The existing well is near the end of its estimated useful life and producing water at nearly 25% below its designed capacity.
- Given current water production design and construction methods, it is estimated that a replacement well at the same site will exceed the designed production capacity of the existing well.
- It is estimated that the FOWD will receive grant funding of over two million dollars to drill and equip the new well.

At the March 18, 2024 FOWD Board meeting, the Board directed staff to prepare a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide professional design services to redrill and equip a new groundwater well at the existing Northridge Well Site in Fair Oaks.

- FOWD staff completed the RFP on March 29, 2024.
- FOWD staff posted the RFP for response from qualified consultants on April 1, 2024.
- Responses from qualified consultants are due for delivery to the FOWD office at 3:00 PM on Tuesday April 30, 2024.

A copy of the RFP has been attached for your information and use.

**Policy Implications:**  
None because of the recommended action.

**Fiscal Impact:**  
To be determined.

CONSULTANT shall defend itself against any and all liabilities, claims, losses, damages, and costs arising out of or alleged to arise out of CONSULTANT’S performance or non-performance of the work hereunder and shall not tender such claims to DISTRICT nor to its directors, officers, employees, or authorized volunteers, for defense or indemnity.

b. Other than in the performance of services, to the fullest extent permitted by law, CONSULTANT will immediately defend, indemnify and hold harmless DISTRICT, its directors, officers, employees and authorized volunteers from all claims and demands of all persons arising out the performance of the work or furnishing of materials; including but not limited to, claims by the CONSULTANT or CONSULTANT’S employees for damages to persons or property except for the sole negligence or willful misconduct of DISTRICT, its directors, officers, employees, or authorized volunteers.

c. By their signature hereunder, CONSULTANT certifies that they are aware of the provisions of the California Labor Code which requires every employer to be insured against liability for workers’ compensation or to undertake self-insurance in accordance with the provisions of that code, and that CONSULTANT will comply with such provisions before commencing the performance of the services under this Agreement. CONSULTANT and SUB-CONSULTANTS will keep workers’ compensation insurance for their employees in effect during all work covered by this Agreement.

Professional Liability – CONSULTANT will file with DISTRICT, before beginning professional services, a certificate of insurance satisfactory to Fair Oaks Water District evidencing professional liability coverage of not less than $1,000,000 per claim and $2,000,000.00 annual aggregate, that coverage shall not be cancelled except with notice to DISTRICT. Coverage is to be placed with a carrier with an AM best rating of no less than A-VII, or equivalent, or as otherwise approved by DISTRICT. The retroactive date (if any) is to be no later than the effective date of this Agreement. CONSULTANT shall maintain such coverage continuously for a period of at least five (5) years after the completion of the contract work. CONSULTANT shall purchase a five-year extended reporting period; i) if the retroactive date is advanced past the effective date of this Agreement; ii) if the policy is canceled or not renewed; or iii) if the policy is replaced by another claims-made policy with a retroactive date subsequent to the effective date of this Agreement.

**AGENDA ITEM V.3**  
**REGULAR Board Meeting April 15, 2024**

To: Board of Directors  
From: Tom R. Gray  
Date: April 8, 2024  
Subject: Discussion and possible action on the New York Water Main Replacement Projects  

**Recommendation:**  
- Complete Phase I of the New York Avenue Water Main Replacement Project, from north of Lemon Street to Orange Avenue, in 2024.  
- Complete Phase II of the New York Avenue Water Main Replacement Project, south from Lemon Street to Monal Court, after New York Well Project has been completed.  

**Discussion:**  
The New York Avenue Water Main Replacement Project was developed to maximize the beneficial use of water production from the newly installed New York Well.  
- The entire New York Avenue Water Main Replacement Project was included in the 2024 Board approved budget at an estimated cost of $2,132,000.  
- The existing New York Avenue water main is made of welded steel installed in the early fifties and cement lined in 1980.  
- The existing New York Avenue water main is over 74 years old and has experienced several leaks in recent years.  
- Given the age, and documented decline in structural integrity of the existing New York Avenue water main, FOWD staff is concerned that it could fail given the estimated water capacity and water pressure of the newly installed New York Well.  
- In accordance with Board approval, FOWD pre-purchased 3,600’ of 12” ductile iron pipe for the project at a cost of $212,375.25 to avoid delays with procuring the pipe and to save contractor markup.  

**Positives of Recommended Action:**  
- Completing only Phase I of the New York Avenue Water Main Replacement Project in 2024 is estimated to save approximately $1,000,000 in 2024 budgeted expenses.  
<!-- Page 82 -->

- Avoids conflicts with upcoming above ground construction at the New York Well site.

**Negatives of Recommended Action:**

- FOWD must take delivery and store approximately 1,800 LF of purchased 12-inch water main until the Board authorizes the construction of Phase II of the New York Water Main Replacement Project.

- It is estimated that the cost of materials and construction will increase with delaying Phase II of the New York Water Main Project.

- Increased mobilization and material handling cost.

- Limited risk of failure of existing water main in New York Avenue from south of Lemon Street to Monal Court.

**Policy Implications:**

None because of the recommended action.

**Fiscal Impact:**

Estimated $1M savings in 2024 Board approved budgeted expense.

The Annual Comprehensive Financial Report includes the management discussion and analysis which should be read in conjunction with the transmittal letter. The District’s management discussion and analysis can be found immediately following the independent auditor’s report.

This report includes all funds, agencies, boards, commissions, and authorities that are financially accountable to the District’s Board of Directors. Financial accountability was determined on the basis of budget adoption, imposition of will, funding, and appointment of the governing board. Based upon these criteria, the Fair Oaks Water District Financing Corporation (the Financing Corporation) is considered a component unit of the District.

**District History and Service Description**

Fair Oaks Water District was originally formed as the Fair Oaks Irrigation District in 1917. By 1979, residential development in the community had replaced all significant agricultural land; therefore, the Board of Directors passed a resolution declaring “irrigation district” no longer described the District’s actual functions and changed the name to Fair Oaks Water District. Even with the name change, the District is legally structured as an irrigation district operating under the California Water Code, Division 11. On March 26, 2017, the District celebrated 100 years of service to the community.

The District is a retail water agency supplying water to a population of approximately 36,200 people on approximately 6,240 acres in Fair Oaks and a small portion of Orangevale. The District purchases a majority of its water from San Juan Water District (“San Juan”) as treated water, and delivers it to approximately 14,380 residential and commercial service.

connections. Additionally, the District maintains six groundwater wells, 186.12 miles of pipeline, a three-million-gallon water storage facility and a booster station.

## Mission Statement

“Our mission is to provide our community with an adequate and reliable supply of water, exceeding all drinking water standards, at the lowest reasonable cost.”

## Economic Condition and Outlook

Fair Oaks is primarily a residential community, with some commercial enterprises within its boundaries, located in the eastern portion of Sacramento County in Northern California. The District’s existing service area is almost built out; therefore, the District does not depend upon new growth to maintain revenue. Based on historic data, the District is forecasting a slow but steady revenue increase based on 10 new service connections per year from the demand for semi-custom housing in the Fair Oaks area.

The District continues the practice of establishing and maintaining funds to offset expected and unexpected significant expense fluctuations encountered year to year.

The Fair Oaks Water District and its wholesale water supplier continue to encounter changes in operations due to new regulations. The impact of current and future regulations, and the resulting cost on water supply operations, are an ongoing challenge for District management. The District anticipates 9% rate increase from its wholesale water suppliers in 2024. The District used the best available data at the time of its budget preparation to forecast the impact of the regulatory environment on operational costs in the 2024 budget as adopted by the FOWD Board of Directors on December 18, 2023.

Meters  
The District completed the Metering Implementation Plan (MIP) program in 2011. The District maintains the meters through the Meter Maintenance Program. The District replaces meters based on manufacturers’ recommended replacement schedule, District’s maintenance records, and FOWD Policy 6300.

Cash Flow  
FOWD Management is tasked with monitoring the cash flow of the District to ensure that the District is financially sound. The District prepares five-year financial projections each year during the annual budget process.

Water Efficiency  
Efficient water use is an integral component of the District’s operations. The District’s water efficiency program was developed to meet local, state, and federal guidelines such as those outlined by the: State of California, Sacramento Water Forum Agreement, and the U.S. Bureau Reclamation Central Valley Project Improvement Act. The District’s objective is to implement water conservation best management practices (BMPs) in an efficient, cost effective and positive manner.
<!-- Page 92 -->
The District has developed the following proactive water efficiency outreach programs:

- Water-wise house calls; onsite water efficiency reviews that provide information on efficient water application at the specific property.
- The District low flow toilet incentive rebate program; offered in partnership with the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District and Sacramento Regional Water Authority.
- The water efficiency poster contest. This program reaches out to grades 4 through 6 within the District, stressing an annual water efficiency theme.
- Public outreach through community events such as: Sacramento Convention Center Landscape Exposition, Home and Garden Shows, Fair Oaks Spring Fest, Get W.E.T. sponsored in part with the US Bureau of Reclamation, Fair Oaks Harvest Day and annual Department of Fish and Game events.
- Public information through full participation by the Fair Oaks Water District in the Sacramento Regional Water Authority’s (RWA’s) Water Efficiency Program (WEP).
- Student education events at local schools.
- Water waste prohibition education and enforcement.
- Water education programs.

These programs are designed to raise water efficiency awareness among our customers and increase water supply available to the District.

The District has formal water conservation requirements that are documented in District Policy Number 6060.

Regional Planning

In early 1998, the District, along with other water utilities, initiated an effort to study and evaluate projects and programs for using surface water and groundwater resources better, particularly during supply shortages. This conjunctive use effort continues today, and generally calls for the use of surface water from lakes and rivers in wet periods, while storing underground water supplies for later use, when surface water is needed for environmental purposes. Participating members are motivated to meet the greater Sacramento areas’ current and future water needs.

Financial Information

Internal Control

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure its assets are protected from loss, theft, or misuse; along with ensuring adequate accounting data is compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The internal control structure is designed to:
(1) provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance these objectives are met;
(2) ensure transactions are executed in accordance with management’s authorization; and

iv  
Page 92 of 173
<!-- Page 93 -->
![DRAFT](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

(3) ensure transactions are recorded properly.

The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes:

(1) the cost of the control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived; and  
(2) the evaluation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by management.

## Budgetary Control

While the District is not mandated to prepare budgets by State law, the District does prepare budgets as a matter of policy and financial control. The budget is a financial plan for detailing operating expenses, capital infrastructure investments, debt obligations, designations and reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the budget was adopted on December 19, 2022. This annual financial plan established project priorities based upon District goals, policies and water supply needs. The budget was developed following these steps:

- Assess current conditions and needs, including system quality and safety;  
- Develop goals, objectives, policies, and plans based upon the assessment;  
- Prioritize projects and develop work programs, based upon short-term and long-term cost effectiveness; and  
- Prepare a plan to evaluate the effectiveness and shortcomings of the budget.

The annual budget was prepared on a cash basis, which differs from the basis used in preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The District staff worked with a budget committee, which extensively reviewed the proposed budget. The proposed budget was then presented to the Board of Directors for comments, suggestions, and feedback during public meetings.

The District follows a very extensive and open budget process. The process is designed to educate and inform customers about the District’s financial operations and requirements. The District adopts its budget at a Public Hearing. The adopted budget is then used as a management tool for projecting and measuring revenues and expenses required to meet the future needs of the District.

## District Reserve Fund

The District adopted a new reserve policy on May 9, 2016. The current reserve policy includes the following funds: Certificate of Participation (COP) fund, connection fee fund, and emergency fund. The policy requires the District to maintain four months of operating expenses for emergency and other operating designation. The connection fee fund is used for capacity expansion based on proposed development and has no designated balance. The District paid off its 1999 COP in full in 2010, so the COP fund is no longer required but is kept in the policy for possible future use.

# Other Information

## Independent Audit

California Government Code Section 26909 requires independent annual audits to be conducted for special districts. JJACPA, Inc. was selected to conduct the annual audit of 2023 District operations. The auditor’s report is included in the financial section of the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report.

## Awards and Acknowledgements

The preparation of the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report on a timely basis requires the dedicated efforts of several staff members. We wish to express our appreciation to all District staff and managers who contributed to this report. Additionally, thank you to the Fair Oaks Water District Board of Directors for their interest and support in planning and conducting the financial operations of the District. The preparation of this report could not have been accomplished without the combined effort of the District leadership, JJACPA, Inc. and the entire FOWD staff.

The Fair Oaks Water District received an award for its submission of the fiscal year 2022 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report for the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting from the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA). This was the 22nd consecutive year that the District received this award.

In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement, a government must publish an easily readable and efficiently organized Annual Comprehensive Financial Report. This report must satisfy both generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legal requirements. A Certificate of Achievement is valid for a period of one year only. We believe that this report will again meet the program requirements to receive the award.

Respectfully submitted,

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

To the Board of Directors of the  
Fair Oaks Water District  
Fair Oaks, California  

## Report on the Financial Statements

### Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of the business-type activities of Fair Oaks Water District, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the business-type activities of the District, as of December 31, 2023, and the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

### Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.

### Other Matter

#### Prior-Year Comparative Information

The financial statements include partial prior-year comparative information. Such information does not include all of the information required to constitute a presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Accordingly, such information should be read in conjunction with the District’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, from which such partial information was derived.

**DRAFT**  

**Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements**  

The District’s management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the District’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter.  

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**  

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.  

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we:  

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the District’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.  

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control–related matters that we identified during the audit.

**DRAFT**  

**Required Supplementary Information**  

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management’s discussion and analysis on pages 4-12, the Schedule of the Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability – Miscellaneous Plan on page 36, and the Schedule of Contributions to the Pension Plan – Miscellaneous Plan on page 36, be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.  

**Other Information**  

Management is responsible for the other information included in the annual report. The other information comprises the introductory and statistical section but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinions on the financial statements do not cover the other information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and the financial statements, or the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the other information exists, we are required to describe it in our report.  

**Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards**  

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated April 12, 2024 on our consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Page 102 of 173
<!-- Page 103 -->
![DRAFT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=DRAFT)

# MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

As management of the Fair Oaks Water District (the District), we offer readers of the District financial statements this narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities for the District for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. We encourage readers to consider the information presented here in conjunction with additional information that we have furnished in our letter of transmittal and the audited financial statements.

## Financial Highlights

The District has reviewed its current year financials and determined that its financial position remained the same (not improving or deteriorating) as prior year given the current economic conditions. The District had a 10% rate increase in 2023 and no rate increases in 2022.

- The net position of the District for 2023 was $48,076,876 and for 2022 was $47,527,342. The unrestricted net position amounts, $7,098,625 for 2023 and $7,021,035 for 2022, may be used to meet the District’s ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors. The District designated $3.0 and $2.7 million of the unrestricted net position for emergencies and rate stabilization for 2023 and 2022, respectively.
  
- The District’s total net position increased by $549,534 in 2023 and increased by $1,324,103 in 2022. The net increase in 2023 and 2022 was primarily from the water transfer revenue, capital grants and contributed capital assets.
  
- Water sales increased by $741,438 (8.38% net increase) in 2023 due to a 10% increase in rate and a decrease in water consumption by the District customers. The District received revenue of $713,189 in 2022 from transferring water to other agencies and no water transfer was completed in 2023; amount collected in 2023 was from 2022 water transfer. Other operating revenues increased in 2023 by $58,206 due to reconnection and processing fees collected.
  
- Water supply and pumping cost had a net decrease of $5,797 in 2023. Operations and maintenance costs had a net increase of $609,342 in 2023. Customer service costs had a net increase of $28,122 in 2023. Administration and general costs had a net increase of $335,179 in 2023. The net decrease in water supply and pumping was attributed to decrease in water demand. The net increase in the operating expenses was due to system maintenance and pension liability costs.

## Overview of the Financial Statements

This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the District’s basic financial statements which are comprised of the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements.

## Financial Statements

The financial statements are designed to provide readers with a broad overview of the District’s finances, in a manner similar to a private-sector business.
<!-- Page 104 -->
The statement of net position presents information on all of the District's assets and liabilities, with the difference between the two reported as net position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the District's financial position is improving or deteriorating.

The statement of revenues, expenses and changes in net position presents information showing how net position changed during the most recent fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (i.e. uncollected water sales and amounts due to vendors).

The District's primary function is to provide water delivery to its customers, with recovery of all the costs through user fees and charges.

The accounts of the District are organized on the basis of fund accounting. A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. Because the District provides water delivery services and recovers these costs through user fees and charges, the District’s funds are accounted for as an enterprise fund type of the proprietary fund group.

The District has determined that the Fair Oaks Water District Financing Corporation (Financing Corporation) meets the requirements for inclusion within the reporting entity and has, therefore, included the Financing Corporation as a blended component unit in the District’s financial statements. However, this Financing Corporation had no activity in 2023 and 2022.

The District maintains a single fund account for all its programs and operations.

The financial statements can be found on pages 13 to 16.

**Notes to Financial Statements**

The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the financial data provided in the financial statements. The notes to the financial statements can be found on pages 17 to 35 of this report.

**Other Information**

In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this report also includes a required supplemental information section and a statistical section that provides the selected District information over a 10-year period. This information can be found on pages 36 to 46 of this report.
<!-- Page 105 -->
Financial Analysis

As noted earlier, net position may serve as a useful indicator of a government’s financial position over time. In the case of the District, assets and deferred outflows of resources exceeded liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $48,076,876 as of the current fiscal year.

The largest portion of the District’s net position (85 percent) reflects its investment in capital assets (e.g., land, buildings, machinery, and equipment). The District uses these capital assets to provide water delivery to its users. Consequently, these assets are not available for future spending.

The increase in net position in 2023 was due to water transfer revenue, capital grants, and contributed capital. The increase in net position in 2022 and 2021 was due to an increase in capital contributions.

A portion of the District's net position represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used. The 2022 and 2021 restricted net position were related to connection fees that were not expended by year-end. The District has also designated $3.0M in 2023, $2.7M in 2022, and $2.5M in 2021 for emergencies and rate stabilization (see footnote F, page 27).

Economic Factors and assumptions in preparing the 2024 Budget and Rates

- The unemployment rate for the greater Sacramento County in which the District resides averaged 4.4% in 2023, up from an average of 4% in 2022.
- The District is largely built out, serving approximately 14,380 customers.
- Inflationary trends in the region are comparable to national indices.
- The District continues to face increasing regulatory requirements that ultimately add new costs to delivering the water service.
- There will be a 10% water rate increase in 2024.
- Health benefit premium costs on average are expected to increase by 8.7% in 2024.
- The District’s 2024 budget shows a shortfall in revenues and intends to use the reserve to fund the shortfall.

All of these factors were considered in preparing the District’s budget for the 2024 fiscal year.

Economic Factors related to future water supply

The District is currently working to revise our Wholesale Water Supply Agreement, which could result in a financial impact related to future water purchases.

The District is currently completing an analysis of how to meet future water supply demand relative to groundwater and surface water – future implementation of a new water supply strategy may have a financial impact to the District.

## NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

### December 31, 2023 and 2022

---

### NOTE A – REPORTING ENTITY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The basic financial statements of the Fair Oaks Water District (the District) have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles as applied to government units. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the accepted standard setting body for establishing governmental accounting and financial reporting principles. The more significant of the District's accounting policies are described below.

**Reporting Entity:** The District was formed March 26, 1917 under the provisions of the California Water Code. The District is governed by a five-member Board of Directors elected by the voters within the District for staggered, four-year terms, every two years. The District provides water to retail customers in the Fair Oaks area. The accompanying basic financial statements present the District and its component unit. The component unit discussed below is included in the District’s reporting entity because of the significance of its operational and financial relationship with the District.

The District has created the Fair Oaks Water District Financing Corporation (the Financing Corporation) to provide assistance to the District in the issuance of debt. Although legally separate from the District, the Financing Corporation is reported as if it were part of the primary government because it shares a common Board of Directors with the District and its sole purpose is to provide financing to the District under the debt issuance documents of the District. Debt issued by the Financing Corporation is reflected as debt of the District in these financial statements. The Financing Corporation has no other transactions and does not issue separate financial statements.

**Jointly Governed Organization:** The District is a signatory to the Regional Water Authority’s (the RWA) Joint Powers Agreement, formally known as Sacramento Metropolitan Water Authority. The mission of the RWA is to serve and represent the regional water supply interest, and to assist the members of the RWA in protecting and enhancing the reliability, availability, affordability and quality of water resources. The goals of the RWA are to assist in voluntary consolidation of services provided by existing industry associations; develop and provide subscription-based support services; and coordinate and implement regional water master planning, grant-funding acquisition, and related planning efforts.

RWA carries out its missions and goals, yet does not exercise governing or regulatory authority over its members. The relationship between the District and the RWA is such that the RWA is not a component unit of the District for financial reporting purposes. Additionally, the District does not have an ongoing financial responsibility to the RWA and therefore is

**December 31, 2023 and 2022**

**NOTE A – REPORTING ENTITY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)**

considered a jointly governed organization. The District has only a residual equity interest in the related entity, and is not liable for the liabilities of the entities if they dissolve under the related JPA agreement. However, Senate Bill 1912, effective January 1, 2019, requires members of a JPA that participates in a public retirement system to agree on the apportionment of the JPA’s retirement liability to the members of the JPA if the JPA dissolves or otherwise terminates its contract with the public retirement system. Separate financial statements are available from RWA.

**Basis of Presentation – Fund Accounting:** The District’s resources are allocated to and accounted for in these basic financial statements as an enterprise fund type of the proprietary fund group. The enterprise fund is used to account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business enterprises, where the intent of the governing body is that the costs (expenses, including depreciation) of providing goods or services to the general public on a continuing basis be financed or recovered primarily through user charges, or where the governing body has decided that periodic determination of revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for capital maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability, or other policies. Net position for the enterprise fund represents the amount available for future operations.

**Basis of Accounting:** The accounting and financial reporting treatment applied to a fund is determined by its measurement focus. The enterprise fund type is accounted for on a flow of economic resources measurement focus. With this measurement focus, all assets and all liabilities associated with the operation of this fund are included on the statement of net position. Net position is segregated into investment in capital assets, restricted and unrestricted amounts. Enterprise fund type operating statements present increases and decreases in net total position.

The District uses the accrual basis of accounting. Under this method, revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. Earned but unbilled water services are accrued as revenue. Water lines that are constructed by private developers and then dedicated to the District, which is then responsible for their future maintenance, are recorded as capital contributions when they pass inspection by the District. The estimated costs for materials and installation are capitalized as part of the distribution system.

Operating revenues and expenses consist of those revenues and expenses that result from the ongoing principal operations of the District. Operating revenues consist primarily of charges for water service. Non-operating revenues and expenses consist of those revenues and expenses that are related to financing and investing types of activities and result from nonexchange transactions or ancillary activities.

When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the District’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are needed.

**NOTE A – REPORTING ENTITY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)**

**Budgetary Principles:** The Board of Directors does not operate under any legal budgeting constraints. Budget integration is employed as a management control device. Budgets are formally adopted by the Board and take effect on each January 1.

**Use of Estimates:** The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

**Cash and Cash Equivalents:** For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the District considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents, including restricted assets. Cash in banks, deposits in the State of California Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) and deposits with fiscal agents are considered to be cash and cash equivalents.

**Water Service Receivable and Unearned Revenue:** Under normal operations, bills for water service are rendered to each customer on a bi-monthly basis. Fixed charges (e.g. service charge) are billed in advance of the service period. Commodity charges are billed after the meters are read. Advanced collections on water service invoiced in the current year for service in the following year are recorded as unearned revenue since these collections have not been earned as of December 31. Customers who are invoiced on a metered basis receive their bills bimonthly in arrears of the service provided. Unpaid amounts as of December 31 are recorded as water service receivable. Water invoices that remain unpaid when the new water invoices are issued may have a lien placed on the property.

**Capital Assets:** Capital assets are recorded at historical cost. Contributed assets are valued at acquisition value on the date received. Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives:

| Description                                   | Estimated Life  |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Wells and pumps                               | 10 - 40 years    |
| Transmission and distribution system          | 10 - 40 years    |
| Maintenance equipment                          | 5 - 30 years     |
| Trucks, trailers, and mobile equipment        | 5 - 10 years     |
| Buildings                                     | 5 - 30 years     |
| Office equipment and furnishings               | 3 - 5 years      |
| Contributed distribution systems               | 40 years         |
| Water tank and pumping stations                | 10 - 40 years    |

NOTE A – REPORTING ENTITY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  

Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations when incurred. It is the District’s policy to capitalize all capital assets with a cost of $500 or more. Costs of assets sold or retired (and the related amounts of accumulated depreciation) are eliminated from the statement of net position in the year of sale or retirement, and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations.  

Inventory: Inventories are stated at cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventories consist of materials and supplies.  

Compensated Absences: The District’s policy allows employees to accumulate earned unused vacation and administrative leave which will be paid to employees upon separation from the District’s service, subject to a vesting policy. The cost of vacation and administrative leave is recorded in the period earned.  

Deferred Outflows and Inflows of Resources: In addition to liabilities, the statement of net position reports separate sections for deferred outflows and deferred inflows of resources. Deferred outflows of resources represent an acquisition of net assets that applies to future periods. These amounts will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (expense) or an inflow of resources (revenue) until the earnings process is complete. Deferred outflows and inflows of resources represent amounts deferred related to the District’s pension plan under the GASB 68 as described in Note G.  

Pensions: For purposes of measuring the net pension liability and deferred outflows/inflows of resources related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the Commission’s California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) plans (Plans) and additions to/deductions from the Plans’ fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by CalPERS. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value.  

Reclassification: Certain amounts have been reclassified to provide for comparable results on a year-to-year basis.

### NOTE B – CASH AND INVESTMENTS (Continued)

The District complied with the provisions of the California Government Code pertaining to the types of investments held, the institutions in which deposits were made and the security requirements. The District will continue to monitor compliance with applicable statutes pertaining to public deposits and investments.

**Interest rate risk:** Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Generally, the longer the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value to changes in market interest rates. Information about the sensitivity of the fair values of the District’s investments (including investments held by bond trustee) to market interest rate fluctuations is provided by the following table that shows the distribution of the District’s investments by maturity:

|          | 2023                |                     | 2022                |                     |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
|          | Remaining Maturity   |                     | Remaining Maturity   |                     |
|          | 12 Months           | Total               | 12 Months           | Total               |
| **Total**| $ 9,929,369        | $ 9,929,369        | $ 8,567,042        | $ 8,567,042        |

LAIF has an average maturity of 230 days and 287 days as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

**Credit Risk:** Generally, credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment. This is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. LAIF is unrated.

**Concentration of Credit Risk:** The investment policy of the District limits the amount that can be invested in any one issuer to the California Government Code. There are no investments in any one issuer (other than external investment pools) that represent 5% or more of total District investments.

**Custodial credit risk:** Custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that, in the event of the failure of a depository financial institution, a government will not be able to recover its deposits or will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. The custodial credit risk for investments is the risk that, in the event of the failure of the counterparty (e.g., broker-dealer) to a transaction, a government will not be able to recover the value of its investment or collateral securities that are in the possession of another party. The California Government Code and the District’s investment policy do not contain legal or policy requirements that would limit the exposure to custodial credit risk for deposits, other than the following provision for deposits: The California Government Code requires that a financial institution secure deposits made by state or local governmental units by pledging securities in an undivided collateral.

pool held by a depository regulated under state law (unless waived by the governmental unit). The fair value of the pledged securities in the collateral pool must equal at least 110% of the total amount deposited by the public agencies. California law also allows financial institutions to secure public agency deposits by pledging first trust deed mortgage notes having a value of 150% of the secured public deposits.

At December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the District’s deposits was $72,216 and the balance in financial institutions was $400,785. Of the balance in financial institutions, $250,000 was covered by federal depository insurance and $150,785 was collateralized as required by State law (Government Code Section 53630), by pledging financial institution with assets held in a common pool for the District and other agencies, but not in the name of the District. At December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of the District’s deposits was $110,102 and the balance in financial institutions was $190,828. The total amount of $190,828 was covered by federal depository insurance.

**Investment in LAIF**: LAIF is stated at fair value. The LAIF is a special fund of the California State Treasury through which local governments may pool investments. The total amount invested on December 31, 2023 by all public agencies in LAIF is $157,991,742,836 managed by the State Treasurer. Of that amount, 2.05% is investments in structured notes and asset-backed securities. The total amount invested on December 31, 2022 by all public agencies in LAIF is $199,649,025,189 managed by the State Treasurer. Of that amount, 2.29% is investments in structured notes and asset-backed securities. The Local Investment Advisory Board (Board) has oversight responsibility for LAIF. The Board consists of five members as designated by State Statute. The fair value of the District’s investment in this pool is reported in the accompanying financial statements at amounts based upon the District’s pro-rata share of the fair value provided by LAIF for the entire LAIF portfolio (in relation to the amortized cost of that portfolio). The balance available for withdrawal is based on the accounting records maintained by LAIF, which are recorded on an amortized cost basis.

FAIR OAKS WATER DISTRICT

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

December 31, 2023 and 2022

NOTE C – CAPITAL ASSETS (Continued)

Capacity Entitlements: In 1993, the District participated with four other water districts in a cooperative transmission pipeline project for the construction of additional transmission pipeline facilities. As a result of this project, the District participated with San Juan Water District (SJWD) to finance their share of the pipeline costs. The District’s share of these pipeline costs totaled $3,956,248. The Capacity Entitlements asset represents the capacity rights the District has purchased in the cooperative transmission pipeline project with SJWD. The asset will be amortized over the pipeline’s estimated useful life of 40 years. In addition, the District has entered into an agreement with SJWD to pay for its share of these transmission pipeline facilities costs.

Depreciation and Amortization Reconciliation: Depreciation and amortization for 2023 of $2,291,244 included capacity entitlements amortization of $98,906 and capital assets depreciation of $2,192,338. Depreciation and amortization for 2022 of $2,382,326 included capacity entitlements amortization of $98,906 and capital assets depreciation of $2,283,420.

NOTE D – ECONOMIC DEPENDENCY

The District purchased 64.59% and 62.10% of its water supply from SJWD in 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the District’s total cost for water purchases from SJWD were $1,941,906 and $1,967,020, respectively.

# FAIR OAKS WATER DISTRICT

## NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

### December 31, 2023 and 2022

### NOTE G – EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT PLAN

**Plan Description:** The District contributes to the California Public Employees Retirement System (PERS), a cost-sharing multiple-employer public employee defined benefit pension plan. PERS provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. PERS acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating public employers within the State of California. PERS requires employers with less than 100 active members in the plan to participate in the risk pool. All full and part time District employees working at least 1,000 hours per year are eligible to participate in PERS. Under PERS, benefits vest after five years of service. Upon retirement, participants are entitled to an annual retirement benefit, payable for life, in an amount equal to a benefit factor times the monthly average salary of their highest thirty-six consecutive months full-time equivalent monthly pay. Copies of the PERS annual financial report may be obtained from their Executive Office, 400 P Street, Sacramento, CA 95814.

The District has the following rate plans:

- Miscellaneous Plan
- PEPRA Miscellaneous Plan

**Benefit provisions** under the Plan are established by State statute and Board resolution. CalPERS issues publicly available reports that include a full description of the pension plans regarding benefit provisions, assumptions and membership information that can be found on the CalPERS website at www.calpers.ca.gov.

**Funding Policy:** Active plan members are required to contribute 7% (for Miscellaneous 2 percent at 55 members) of their annual covered salary. The District makes 0% in 2023 and 2022 of the contributions required of District employees on their behalf and for their account.

Under the Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA), District employees hired on or after January 1, 2013 will have a retirement formula of 2.0 percent at 62 and are required to contribute 50% of the total normal cost rate for the benefits for miscellaneous members.

The District also requires classic members hired on or after January 1, 2013 to pay the 100% of the normal member contribution amount. Classic members are employees that have PERS retirement benefits from previous employment that do not fit within the definition of a new member.

**Benefits Provided:** CalPERS provides service retirement and disability benefits, annual cost of living adjustments and death benefits to plan members, who must be public employees and beneficiaries. Benefits are based on years of credited service, equal to one year of full-time employment. Members with five years of total service are eligible to retire at age 50 (52 for PEPRA Miscellaneous Plan) with statutorily reduced benefits. All members are eligible for non-

The Miscellaneous Plan is closed to new members that are not already CalPERS eligible participants.

**Contributions:** Section 20814(c) of the California Public Employees’ Retirement Law requires that the employer contribution rates for all public employers be determined on an annual basis by the actuary and shall be effective on the July 1 following notice of a change in the rate. Funding contributions for the Plan are determined annually on an actuarial basis as of June 30 by CalPERS. The actuarially determined rate is the estimated amount necessary to finance the costs of benefits earned by employees during the year, with an additional amount to finance any unfunded accrued liability. The District is required to contribute the difference between the actuarially determined rate and the contribution rate of employees.

**December 31, 2023 and 2022**

**NOTE G – EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT PLAN (Continued)**

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, District’s contributions to the Plan were $243,927 and $206,137, respectively. Employee contributions to the Plan were $177,535 in 2023 and $153,907 in 2022.

**Pension Liabilities, Pension Expenses and Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions:** As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the District reported a net pension liability for its proportionate share of the net pension liability of the Plan of $4,188,678 and $3,825,699, respectively.

The District’s net pension liability for the Plan is measured as the proportionate share of the net pension liability. The net pension liability of the Plan is measured as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the total pension liability for the Plan used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 rolled forward to June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, using standard update procedures. The District’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on a projection of the District’s long-term share of contributions to the plan relative to the projected contributions of all participating employers, actuarially determined. The District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:

| Proportion - December 31, 2022 | 0.08176% |
|----------------------------------|----------|
| Proportion - December 31, 2023 | 0.08377% |
| Change - Increase (Decrease)    | 0.00201% |

**December 31, 2023 and 2022**  

**NOTE G – EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT PLAN (Continued)**  

The underlying mortality assumptions used in the June 30, 2023 valuation includes mortality improvements using Society of Actuaries Scale 80% MP 2020. For more details, please refer to the 2021 experience study report that can be found on the CalPERS website. The underlying mortality assumptions used in the June 30, 2022 valuation includes 15 years of mortality improvements using Society of Actuaries Scale 90% MP 2016. For more details on this table, please refer to the December 2017 experience study report that can be found on the CalPERS website.

**Discount Rate:** The discount rates used to measure the total pension liability were 6.90% as of June 30, 2023 and 6.90% as of 2022. The current rate of 6.90% reflects the long-term expected rate of return for the Plan net of investment expenses and without reduction for administrative expenses. To determine whether the municipal bond rate should be used in the calculation of a discount rate for each plan, CalPERS used the amortization and smoothing periods adopted by the Board in 2013. For the Plan, the crossover test was performed for a miscellaneous agent plan selected as being more at risk of failing the crossover test and resulting in a discount rate that would be different from the long-term expected rate of return on pension investments. Based on the testing of the plans, the tests revealed the assets would not run out. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. The crossover test results are presented in a detailed report that can be obtained from the CalPERS website.

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class.

In determining the long-term expected rate of return, CalPERS took into account both short-term and long-term market return expectations as well as the expected pension fund cash flows. Using historical returns of all the funds’ asset classes, expected compound returns were calculated over the short-term (first 10 years) and the long-term (11+ years) using a building-block approach. Using the expected nominal returns for both short-term and long-term, the present value of benefits was calculated for each fund. The expected rate of return was set by calculating the rounded single equivalent expected return that arrived at the same present value of benefits for cash flows as the one calculated using both short-term and long-term returns. The expected rate of return was then set to equal to the single equivalent rate calculated above and adjusted to account for assumed administrative expenses.

The table below reflects the long-term expected real rate of return by asset class for each of the Plans. The rate of return was calculated using the capital market assumptions applied to determine the discount rate and asset allocation. These rates of return are net of administrative expenses.

# REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

To the Board of Directors of the  
Fair Oaks Water District  
Fair Oaks, California  

We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the business-type activities of Fair Oaks Water District (District) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise District’s basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated April 12, 2024.

### Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. We identified certain deficiencies in internal control, described in the schedule of findings and responses as item 2023-001 that we consider to be significant deficiencies.

**DRAFT**

**Report on Compliance and Other Matters**

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

**Fair Oaks Water District’s Response to Findings**

Government Auditing Standards requires the auditor to perform limited procedures on the District’s response to the findings identified in our audit and described in the accompanying schedule of findings and responses. The District’s response was not subjected to the other auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response.

**Purpose of this Report**

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

**Water Agencies File Lawsuit to Protect Water Rates and Local Control**  
Citrus Heights Water District and Fair Oaks Water District stand with customers against alleged San Juan Water District wholesale water rate overcharge  

Citrus Heights, CA (April 11, 2024) – As a last resort, Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD) and Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) filed a joint lawsuit against their wholesale water provider, San Juan Water District (SJWD). CHWD and FOWD elected officials, who represent about two-thirds of SJWD’s population, unanimously backed the case. The districts allege that SJWD’s rate increase illegally overcharges CHWD and FOWD customers.

“Wholesale water from SJWD is CHWD’s single largest outbound cost. We are committed to making sure our customers pay their fair share - and no more,” said CHWD Board President Caryl Sheehan. “Local residents, business owners, and our Districts pleaded with the SJWD Board to work with us, but they simply approved the rates over our opposition.”

SJWD’s Board of Directors voted to approve the higher rates on December 13, 2023, with only Director Pam Tobin voting against the increase, and urging more coordination with CHWD and FOWD.

“SJWD approved unfair rates that also make it more expensive to use local water supplies that we’ve already invested in,” said Chris Petersen, FOWD Board President. “At the end of the day, litigation is something that FOWD and CHWD wanted to avoid, but found necessary for better, fairer rates.”

SJWD is a wholesale water agency that provides water to local water agencies, including FOWD and CHWD, who in turn deliver it to homes and businesses. SJWD provides water directly to homes and businesses in the Granite Bay area. SJWD also sells much of its least expensive water to others, which the districts allege leaves CHWD and FOWD customers with higher bills.

The complaint suggests that under the new rate plan that SJWD recently approved, local water agencies are disincentivized to conserve or use local, reliable groundwater. This appears to conflict with State policy or decades-long efforts to build regional water supply resiliency. The current rate plan could make the region more vulnerable to water shortages and keep rates artificially high for CHWD and FOWD customers.

The Superior Court of California, County of Sacramento will assign a judge to oversee the case. CHWD and FOWD will keep the community up to date as the lawsuit progresses. The Districts encourage customers to stay informed about this important issue.
