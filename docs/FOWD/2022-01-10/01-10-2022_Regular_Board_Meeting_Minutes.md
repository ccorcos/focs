4. Discussion on FOWD receiving grant funding for the Skyway Well Project
- General Manager Gray provided an overview of the approximately $1.2 million grant received for completion of the project. He also recommended FOWD meet January, February, and March 2022 water demand from customers with a mix of 90% surface water and 10% groundwater. Since 2004, FOWD constructed or has construction underway for five new groundwater wells and has received grant funding for all five projects.
- Board Vice President McRae approved recommendation.
- Director Sarkovich approved the staff recommendation. He inquired if we are on track for the overall annual 70/30 split.
- General Manager Gray explained this will be reevaluated at the end of March to determine water supply along with our financials. The Board will give direction at that time.
- Director Page inquired about sharing water during time of drought and what would happen if the lake dried out. FOWD does not have anything in place to decide how to move the groundwater to those in need or how to get reimbursed for that water.
- Director Petersen stated there will be an opportunity for that as the regional groundwater bank becomes more established. The opportunities will naturally emerge, and that FOWD should be tracking opportunities.
- General Manager Gray explained that ideally FOWD should be revenue neutral, regardless of using groundwater or surface water to meet customer demand.
- Board President Marx stated FOWD has received over $4 million in grants, all due to the District RWA membership.
  
5. Update and discussion on Regional Water Supply
- Report provided.

6. Update and discussion on the agreement between the FOWD and the Fair Oaks Historical Society for use of the property located at 10340 Fair Oaks Boulevard
- General Manager Gray stated FOWD staff has no recommendation. There is a current ten-year lease agreement that is not due for renewal. This item is listed on agenda once a year for discussion.
- Visitor George Babcock mentioned he was not aware of this agreement and was glad it was on the agenda.

7. Discussion and possible action on sponsoring the Fair Oaks Harvest Festival (UC Master Gardener Program)
- General Manager Gray mentioned Fair Oaks Harvest Festival (FOHF) is local and part of the FOWD public relations campaign. FOHF asked FOWD to support the UC Davis Master Gardener Program, requesting a donation of $100, $200, $250 or $500.
- Board Member Page inquired about different ways in which FOWD could support FOHF and fulfill the District objectives at the same time.
- General Manager Gray replied that it is absolutely possible with FOHF, but the UC Master Gardener Program is a bit vague. He stated that staff recommendation would be to support FOHF and defer on the UC Master Gardener Program.

8. Discussion and possible action on additional funding for 2021/2022 and 2021 funds for work in progress projects to be carried forward to 2022

- General Manager Gray stated it would be slightly impacted, between $30,000 - $50,000 based on the recommendation to increase the salary ranges.
- Board Vice President McRae stated it is the right thing to do.
- Board Member Page opposed. He stated that FOWD should wait, as there is a current process in place and payment was provided a few months ago to compensate for inflation.
- Director Sarkovich agreed with the one-time increase of 3.2% to keep FOWD competitive in the market for new recruits and to help maintain current employees.
- Director Petersen inquired about when to expect completion of performance reviews.
- General Manager Gray stated they should be completed by the end of the month.
