#### II. PUBLIC COMMENT
- Mr. Leon Corcos stated that he has lived in Fair Oaks 30 something years. He wanted to read some ideas that he has. Mr. Corcos thanked members of the Board for letting him speak. He stated that as Board Members you are the stewards of the Water District. The District's primary responsibility is to give us safe, quality water at an affordable cost. Currently, you are proposing an increase of water rates. Running parallel to that increase, you are proposing, actually planning to spend several million dollars of rate payer’s money to remodel the utility yard across the street; that’s a lot of money. Its money that is unwisely being earmarked with unwise solutions....both fiscally and smarter for the village. He had lunch a couple weeks ago with Supervisor Desmond across the street at Brahma on another matter and he asked me, "Why is a prime piece

- of real estate being used as a utility yard?” I never really thought about it and I had no answer, but I had to agree. It’s a terrible use of prime real estate in the Fair Oaks Village. That said, he mentioned that he thought there must be some County land closely nearby that could be used for the maintenance yard and offices. Mike Aho from the Park District also mentioned that he would be interested in finding some land outside of the core Village area to share with the water District because they too need space for their maintenance and utility yard. I believe he brought that up to the Fair Oaks Water District’s attention. So this could be a win-win for the District, for the residents and for the Village. So I propose this - put brakes on this project immediately. Think about selling the land; that part could be a great asset to the Village. Could be Co-op style grocery store, cooperatives and restaurants …arts construction could all be part of it. Any of those things could bring more people to Fair Oaks, make the people of Fair Oaks happy. The resurgence happening in Fair Oaks continues rather than having a maintenance yard on the prime corner of our Village. The funds from a sale could be used to relocate, to rebuild outside of the core area. These funds from the sale could decrease and possibly get rid of the rate hike because it is a lot of money. He believes this is what the community would prefer. Mr. Corcos stated that you folks are a member of this community and I believe that this property is a member of Director Marx’s district. So he would like to sit down with Board member Marx and see….He knows that FOWD has gone through CPAC and sadly it was during COVID. He did not think there was a lot going on with the plan. There was not a lot of community input because it was during COVID. He believes that keeping this a maintenance yard and seeking millions of dollars would be a huge mistake for the Village of Fair Oaks.

- Board President Marx stated he appreciates Mr. Corcos’s comments and would be happy to discuss this matter further.

- Mr. Corcos’s stated his email is on the signup sheet.

- General Manager Gray to forward the email to President Marx.

- Director Sarkovich stated that this ship has sailed a long time ago. When FOWD built the Administrative Building, it was decided that the Corp Yard would be refurbished in the future. FOWD hired an architecture firm and it took four years to go to CPAC and Sacramento Planning Commission; four years to get entitlement. FOWD is ready to build the Corporate Yard. FOWD decided not to split the staff into two (Operations and Management). FOWD has been at this site for a long time; long before other businesses opened up in this Village.

- Mr. Corcos stated he understands. FOWD was here when they made the SBA and the maintenance yard was listed as the business that can be…

- Director Sarkovich stated that FOWD will build something that would be an asset to the community. There would be new parking spaces that will be opened to the public after business hours; so, it is a win-win. FOWD will not go across the river; going back and forth, it will stay in the Fair Oaks Village.

- Mr. Corcos stated he understands that is Director Sarkovich’s opinion.

- Director Sarkovich stated that it was a collective opinion and FOWD has the money.
<!-- Page 3 -->
![Page 3 of 15](https://via.placeholder.com/768x992.png?text=Page+3+of+15)

- allocated for the Corporate Yard. FOWD has reserved money for this project and did not raise rates for this project. FOWD raised rates primarily to rebuild the two transmission pipelines.
  
- Mr. Corcos questioned: “So Director Sarkovich, you believe that the Maintenance Yard and parking lot for the Water District is in the best interest of the community on that property when you could be far less visible?”
  
- Director Sarkovich stated that Mr. Corcos is thinking about what is highest use of real estate; you would think is retail or something else. That is fine but FOWD will not sell this land and it is not just him; it is a collective opinion of the Board.
  
- Mr. Corcos stated he understands that they missed the 30 days to protest the Planning Department granting a permit. He stated all that was completed during COVID, and it was challenging to go to CPAC meetings. He understands that FOWD has been working on the project for a long time.
  
- General Manager Gray stated he just wants to set the record straight and not get into a debate. He stated that in 2006 the planning was done for this Administrative Building. FOWD met with Jim Racy, a long-term pillar in the community, in 2003, 2004 and 2005 working out what would be the best use of Jim Racy’s property. Jim Racy saw that FOWD’s vision for the development of the property was a great investment in the Village. When FOWD did the outreach in 2006, the Browns, the McWilliams, a lot of people from the community, long time investors in the vision of the community, founding members of FOVEC were participants in the vision and planned out the next phase of the Corporate Yard development. The Village leadership was primarily involved in the vision of building the FOWD Administrative Building and the future development vision of the FOWD Corporate Yard - what it would look like. The vision was established in 2006 and FOWD is implementing that vision now. So it was planning then and the Leadership of the community voted yes and yes. In 2018, FOWD had the funding and there were issues with the Corp Yard Building, the FOWD Board voted to go forward. It wasn’t “willy nilly”. It was brought forward with the vision of Fair Oaks Village community leaders.
  
- Mr. Corcos stated that he is not stating it was “willy nilly”. What I am disputing is there are a lot of changes since 2006 and there has been a lot of changes to be a really interesting place. Many other people and I don’t feel that having a maintenance yard in the core area of Fair Oaks …when you could be a mile or two miles away on County property…that Desmond would be willing to try and find for you…you are stealing the Village and giving me a gravel pit, okay. That’s unfair. And if FOWD is going to take the attitude of “we are going forward with it” I am going to take my attitude and I will start a campaign on social media and I will get 10,000 people signing saying you guys are doing the wrong thing. If you want 10,000 people or 5,000 people of Fair Oaks whatever I can get against you…Don’t be condescending…
  
- Director Sarkovich stated he is not being condescending.
  
- Mr. Corcos stated, “Yes you are, you are making a little smirk and turning your head.” If you would like to piss me off…
<!-- Page 4 -->
- Director Sarkovich stated so are we supposed to be afraid now. You are threatening us with 10,000 people?
- Mr. Corcos stated he is not threatening the FOWD. He stated if the community does not want FOWD to put a gravel yard in the most visible corner of the community when the FOWD could put it somewhere else; you people as shepherds of this whole situation, this is a public District. FOWD should be doing what the public wants not necessarily what FOWD wants.
- Board President Marx stated that FOWD needs to move to the next item; he is happy to discuss offline with Mr. Corcos.

- Information only.

V. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: OLD BUSINESS

1. Update and discussion on November 2022 General Election Costs
   - General Manager Gray provided an overview of the actual cost of the November 2022 General Election.

2. Update and discussion on the SJWD wholesale water place of use issues
   - General Manager Gray stated there is no staff recommendation; this is for information only. He stated the most important and reliable water supply asset available to the FOWD is the Pre-1914 Water Right surface water supply from the SJWD. The FOWD Board has made protecting this asset one of the Staff’s most important tasks.
   - General Manager Gray stated over the past couple of years both the SJWD and Carmichael Water District (CWD) have published statements indicating that the CWD service area, or some undefined portion of the CWD service area, is within the SJWD place of use – indicating that this area has established rights to SJWD Pre-1914 water. These claims were a surprise to FOWD staff.
   - General Manager Gray stated based on direction from the FOWD Board, FOWD has been seeking all information from both the SJWD and CWD supporting their claims that any portion of the CWD is within the SJWD place of use for Pre-1914 Water rights. He stated letters and responses to date are included to provide the Board with an update.
   - General Manager Gray stated he attended the CWD Board meeting with representatives from Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD) and discussed this issue with them. FOWD is concerned about Pre-1914 Water Rights water only, but down the road, at any given time, FOWD is happy to endorse putting the CVP water to beneficial use to anybody that would want to help. Before tonight’s meeting General Manager Gray contacted SJWD and CWD General Managers and reaffirmed the position of the FOWD Board that, if FOWD is educated and understands that the claim is valid, FOWD will relent to that, but FOWD wants to be educated so that it knows the claim is valid. Furthermore, FOWD 100% supports the SJWD putting the CVP water rights to beneficial use anywhere with anybody that wants to help them do that.
   - SJWD General Manager Helliker stated the Board has documents that were transmitted back and forth. He stated with respect to the CVP water, that is not water that SJWD can transfer to CWD. CWD is not a CVP contractor. SJWD appreciates FOWD’s support in making full use of the CVP water. In 2022, there is no allocation of CVP water, even if SJWD could have transferred to CWD, SJWD wouldn’t be able to transfer. SJWD received report from JRP and it is not in the Board packet but General Manager Gray has a copy of it; that was adequate documentation that CWD is within the place of use of SJWD Water Right Water from SJWD’s point of view. Even short of that, the agreement with CWD flows.
<!-- Page 6 -->
![Page 6 of 15](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+6+of+15)  
from the Wholesale Water Supply Agreement which stipulates that SJWD cannot do deliveries to CWD until SJWD satisfies FOWD’s needs first. That is the provision that is in the agreement and will stay in any future agreements that SJWD has with CWD. SJWD has this provision in the agreement with SSWD. SJWD values FOWD as its customers and considers FOWD to be SJWD’s most important partners. No matter what happens to FOWD’s queries about this, SJWD General Manager Helliker stated that he has not seen or not researched the various sources of documents referenced in the JRP Report, but SJWD considers documents he received from CWD to be adequate documentation for proving CWD is within the place of use of SJWD Water Right Water. SJWD Board approved both agreements last year and this year.

- General Manager Gray stated there is one other concern that was brought to the Board in prior meetings. CWD and SSWD are looking at a potential merger and that their study document references that CWD has rights to SJWD Pre-1914 water and if they merge, that is one of the values that SSWD gets and that if they merge, they should work feverishly as one of their number one goals on protecting that and getting access to the SJWD Pre-1914 water for SSWD.

- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated he does not read the SSWD and CWD consolidation study that way and the documents he has shows portions of CWD that would qualify as place of use water, that does not apply to SSWD. He does not think that it would be wise for SJWD to consider and he will certainly not propose while he is there to deliver water to SSWD as part of SJWD’s historic place of use. SJWD has been transferring water to SSWD pursuant to a Notice of Exemption. SJWD will continue to do so with the provision of meeting FOWD’s needs first. This will allow SJWD to take advantage of all water sources and optimize the use of it. It puts us in a position to do well water substitution transfers with SSWD and provides conjunctive use benefits. He stated that he can guarantee SJWD would not consider any merger by SSWD and CWD to be grounds for delivering water anywhere but CWD.

- General Manager Gray stated, he respects that 100% and he stated that in no way shape or form would he say that SJWD General Manager Helliker is not representing FOWD fairly. What FOWD is after, what FOWD values most is the Pre-1914 water from SJWD – it’s the gold of California water. He stated FOWD would like to not be working with attorneys and to be sitting in a room and take everything that everybody has and educate all the players; all stakeholders. What FOWD has is a document prepared by a consultant for the possible merger of CWD and SSWD that states, generally, CWD…is in place of use of SJWD Water Right Water and references several documents that may or may not exist and nobody is giving them to FOWD. He stated if everyone is collaborating, why not share the referenced documents. If it’s true, fair and reasonable, FOWD is on board, but so far FOWD has not received anything to true it up.

- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated he does not have the documents, has not seen the referenced documents, and he has not taken the time to go to the places
<!-- Page 7 -->
![Page 7 of 15](https://via.placeholder.com/768x992.png?text=Page+7+of+15)

- where the documents are referenced; they are in the State library and County records. They are available for FOWD to research.
- General Manager Gray stated that FOWD finds it puzzling that SJWD General Manager Helliker just indicated on behalf of SJWD and their board, that they (CWD) are in the place of use, but all SJWD has is this one document that is redacted. SJWD does not have the information that was redacted either and never researched the supporting documents to make sure it is true.
- Director Petersen asked for the name of consultant report and a copy of the report.
- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated that the report was by JRP.
- General Manager Gray stated he can email the report to Director Petersen.
- General Manager Gray was curious about the documents being redacted and the generalized claims with no documents provide in support.
- Director Petersen stated he read through the report and thanked staff for putting the packet together; it was a good information. He would like to confirm his understanding of the 300 AF per year.
- General Manager Gray stated the 300 AF per year is not what FOWD is concerned about. He stated FOWD is looking at the long-term use SJWD Pre-1914 water rights.
- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated 26,000 AF of Pre-1914 and 7,000 AF of post 1914; total of 33,000 AF.
- General Manager Gray stated that with 33,000 AF of the most valuable water in California combined with FOWD’s and CHWD’s groundwater, the entire SJWD service area, including San Juan Retail, is pretty much whole for water at build out. That is why it is so valuable.
- General Manager Gray stated when there is a claim made that CWD has a portion of the SJWD Water Right Water ... that CWD has never paid for ... and then CWD is filing a report and adopting reports that say they are merging and they have a right to the SJWD water ... FOWD needs to ask that they prove this prior to going forward.
- Board directed staff to continue working and monitoring this process.
- General Manager Gray stated he contacted SJWD General Manager Paul Helliker and CWD General Manager Cathy Lee to work on this matter.

3. Update and discussion on the collaborative effort to develop a SJWD Cost Allocation Plan
- General Manager Gray stated this is information only. This is a collaborative effort between staff of FOWD and CHWD identifying that SJWD didn’t have a written plan or policy for allocating costs between retail and wholesale operations. SJWD is working together with FOWD and CHWD (Folsom and Orange Vale are invited), but primarily it will be SJWD, FOWD and CHWD to develop a formal written plan.
<!-- Page 8 -->
![Page 8 of 15](https://via.placeholder.com/768x992.png?text=Page+8+of+15)

- or policy for assigning costs to the wholesale and retail operations. Included in the packet are all the updates and proposals from the consultant for doing the work.
  
- Board President Marx stated this an important issue that General Manager Gray needs to keep working on and it would be another high priority.

- Vice President McRae inquired when a formal plan will be released.

- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated within a month. He stated SJWD met with the consultant and they have received information SJWD provided to the consultant including the methodology SJWD has been using. The consultant has reviewed the information and are in the process of analyzing the information and will provide written recommendations. He stated in his conversation with the consultant, they were comfortable with the methodology SJWD has been using with some tweaks. For example, his time is currently 90% Wholesale and 10% Retail. He went through very exhaustive analysis of his time expenditures for past 12 months and it turned out 85% Wholesale and 15% Retail. One of the changes will likely be that adjustment. The consultant did go through all SJWD’s categories of expenses. They identified percentages and salaries and benefits are on top of the list; capital expenses are included as well. He stated a draft report will be completed within a month or so and SJWD can have a conversation with FOWD and other customers to get feedback to come up with a final plan. SJWD hopes to satisfy everybody’s interest and our goal is to allocate costs accurately.

- General Manager Gray stated that in general, it is hard to understand that SJWD Retail Operation, which is FOWD’s size, and only needs 15% of General Manager’s time to run.

- Board President Marx inquired if this cost allocation covers both ongoing cost as well as special/capital projects.

- SJWD General Manager Helliker clarified specific project with specific allocation?

- Board President Marx emphasized that previously he and former FOWD Director Dave Underwood and SJWD Director Bob Walter sought strategy for cost allocation to a specific new project that benefits one or more agencies and has nothing to do with other agencies in the family to avoid situations like the Fair Oaks 40. Is this part of the plan SJWD is working on with the consultant?

- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated if there is a specific project with those characteristics, SJWD would do that. At this time there is no specific project with that characteristic.

- Board President Marx asked if there would be a written procedure for a specific project with that characteristic in case it does come up in the future?

- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated SJWD has cost allocation for the CTP pipeline. SJWD has a very complicated and comprehensive cost analysis that SJWD does every year and he hopes that this is a very unique situation. That is the way SJWD’s joint agreement works for the members. He provided the Hinkle Project as another example. SJWD goes through every year and allocates costs per
<!-- Page 9 -->
![Page 9 of 15](https://via.placeholder.com/768x991.png?text=Page+9+of+15)

the formula SJWD developed. After completing the cost methodology, SJWD completes the Wholesale Master Plan; it is almost done. He provided comments for the Master Plan a few days ago. Next project SJWD will take on is the Wholesale Financial Plan. SJWD will revisit this again, including specific cost allocations for specific projects. He stated that any projects that has a unique allocation, SJWD will identify the cost and anyone spending time on that project will charge their time appropriately.

- General Manager Gray stated SJWD General Manager Helliker mentioned he received final comments for the Wholesale Master Plan. FOWD and Board members wanted to review the SJWD Wholesale Master Plan and provide comments. FOWD never received a copy of the Wholesale Master Plan and FOWD was told it would get an opportunity to comment.

- SJWD General Manager Helliker clarified that he provided his comments to the draft that was part of SJWD’s internal process. Next step is to provide to FOWD.

- General Manager Gray thanked SJWD General Manager Helliker for the clarification.

- Director Petersen thanked SJWD General Manager Helliker for the explanation. He inquired on the MGT report, “We understand that time is not tracked at the position level, with the limited resources available at SJWD to implement a tracking system at may not feasible.” So when you said your time is 85% Wholesale and 15% Retail, how is that determined?

- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated he went back for the past 12 months and categorized them by Wholesale and Retail.

- Director Petersen inquired about timecards.

- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated that SJWD does timecards but only charges to specific projects such as for cost recovery type projects; SJWD does not charge time in increments like 6 minutes etc. Distribution System Operators with 100% of time to Retail, they are not charging on specific values A or B because it is not necessary to do so. For employees that are both SJWD Wholesale and Retail, SJWD is looking through and reviewing time expenditures.

- General Manager Gray stated if SJWD is not doing timecards and allocating time through project accounting, what is time expenditure?

- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated SJWD does not do things like law firms do.

- General Manager Gray stated that he understands SJWD does not charge in time increments. However, if SJWD does not use project accounting, how does SJWD account the time to the project for staff like SJWD Finance Manager and SJWD Operations Manager?

- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated for his staff, if it is a capital or developer project, they capture their time. For SJWD General Manager Helliker, he would
