**AGENDA ITEMS**  

**I. CALL TO ORDER**  
- President Petersen called the meeting to order at 6:30 p.m.  

**II. PUBLIC COMMENT**  
- Visitor Corcos stated he would like FOWD to modify its parking signs to announce public parking availability after business hours and on weekends.  
- General Manager Gray stated that FOWD’s mission is to provide our community with an adequate and reliable supply of water, exceeding all drinking water standards, at the lowest reasonable cost. FOWD provides the community self-sufficient parking for its employees and customers with no negative impacts to the Fair Oaks Village.

“Providing public parking to the Fair Oaks Village is secondary to the mission of FOWD. Though important to the FOWD as neighbor and friend to the Fair Oaks Village, any significant or ongoing negative issues with public parking will result in restricting use to accomplishing the FOWD mission.” The Village suffers from a parking shortage, something that all new development should have taken into consideration.

- Visitor Corcos responded that according to the County, the Village has sufficient parking; otherwise, they would not be open. He inquired what it would take for FOWD to add a sign that states parking is allowed after 5:00 p.m. and on weekends.
- General Manager Gray commented that in the past, there has been improper use of the parking lot, utilizing vehicles for sleeping arrangements.
- Visitor Corcos stated that the Village is currently suffering from a lack of parking spaces, and it will get worse once the Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District project is completed.
- President Petersen inquired visitor Corcos if he was asking FOWD to replace its parking signs to reflect that parking is permitted after business hours and on the weekends.
- Visitor Corcos offered to pay to have the new signs made. New signs will avoid questions and confusion to the public.
- An unknown visitor inquired if the parking lot will be utilized by the public or by restaurant employees.
- General Manager Gray stated that there is a lack of parking in the Village. Both Fair Oaks customers and restaurant employees are well aware of the after-business hours parking rule and make use of it.
- Visitor Corcos stated that allowing parking after business hours and on weekends should not be a secret.
- President Petersen stated that visitor Corcos’ request will be taken into consideration.
- Visiting customer Babcock suggested having a supplemental sign instead of replacing the current FOWD signs.
- Visitor Corcos agreed with the idea. He requested a sign that clearly states public parking is permitted after business hours and on the weekends.
- Visitor Corcos provided feedback on the Spanish style construction. He believes the Spanish eclectic style will dominate the Village.
- General Manager Gray encouraged everyone to go to the FOWD’s website and familiarize themselves with the documents concerning the Corporate Yard Project.
- Visitor Bramson expressed her concerns about having new signs posted. She is worried about people lacking a residence parking at 5:01 p.m., remaining there over the weekend, and causing problems for the community.
- President Petersen stated this issue has occurred in the past.
- General Manager Gray stated that people have abandoned stolen vehicles in the FOWD parking lot.
- President Petersen stated there might be a middle ground and it will be discussed with staff. However, if FOWD moves forward with this, towing will be enforced; something that has not been done before. If problems arise, towing will need to be part of the solution.
<!-- Page 7 -->
- An unknown visitor stated that the Board has not lived up to what was presented on the Corporate Yard document. In a year’s time, FOWD probably experienced one parking issue.
- Visitor Bramson introduced herself and expressed that the recall signs are upsetting and feels like an attack on the Board, it’s unwarranted. The water quality is exemplary. Rates are extremely reasonable. The Board has done consistent good work. FOWD is like an institution, and she appreciates it and is in favor of the Spanish Motif.

III. CONSENT CALENDAR  
The following consent calendar items were considered and acted upon as follows:  
1. Approval of Minutes  
   a. Regular Board Meeting of July 15, 2024  
2. Accept and File Treasurer’s Report for the month of July 2024  
3. File Investment Report for the month of June 2024  
4. Accept and File Financial Expense Report for the month of July 2024  
5. Approval of Warrants  
6. Approval of Cal-Card Statements for the month of July 2024  
7. Approval of Board Expense Report for the month of July 2024  

- Director Sarkovich addressed the issue about financial transparency. FOWD is one of the few public agencies that display absolutely everything. Financial transparency is presented on a monthly basis. This, along with the Board Packet, is posted on FOWD’s website.
  
- Visitor Corcos stated that the financial aspect, although posted, is challenging to understand. The transparency he’s referring to consists of hiring a third-party agency to analyze if the 25% rate increase over three years is reasonable and rational. No independent study was done for the water rate increase or for the Corporate Yard Project.

- Director Sarkovich stated that FOWD is a public agency, not a private business. The 25% rate increase over the next three years is basically governed by Prop 218. Prop 218 is very specific on how it needs to be advertised to the public and what type of analysis is needed. FOWD met every single requirement of Prop 218. This document is also posted on FOWD’s website. The specific reason there was a 25% rate increase was due to the transmission main. This project alone will cost about $30 million.

- General Manager Gray stated that all this information is on FOWD’s website. Despite the 25% increase over a period of three years, FOWD remains the lowest rates in the Sacramento region. In 2025, FOWD will complete several projects. Once completed, FOWD will have $2.5 million above operating expenses to put toward the transmission main every year until it’s finalized.

- President Petersen inquired about the SMUD expense reflected on page 15 of the pdf file in the check register for the amount of $15,342.17, specifically about the average.
<!-- Page 8 -->
![Page 4 of 12](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+4+of+12)

rate increase. He also inquired about Regional Water Authority (RWA) expense of $53,092.00.

- General Manager Gray replied that SMUD rates have increased approximately 20% in the last couple of years. SMUD has a peak rate and have also added a super peak rate that begins around 5:00 p.m. The $15,342.17 is a partial payment for a couple of sites. He also addressed the RWA’s expense and stated that this amount is a combination of various resources, and regional support received from RWA for the water efficiency program that FOWD participated in regionally. All these fees are reflected in one payment. He will report back to the Board to clarify if this is an annual payment.

Director Sarkovich moved to approve the consent calendar as presented.

Director Dolby seconded the motion.

Motion carried with the following votes: Dolby – aye, Petersen – aye, and Sarkovich – aye.  
Absent: Director McRae and Director Marx

IV. PRESENTATIONS AND CORRESPONDENCE  
1. None.

V. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: OLD BUSINESS  
1. Update and discussion on the New York Water Main Project Phase I  
- Information only.  
- General Manager Gray provided an overview including that it will take approximately 84 days to complete.

2. Update and discussion on the proposed merger of the SJWD and SSWD  
- Information only.  
- General Manager Gray provided an overview.  
- Director Sarkovich mentioned that SSWD has about $100 million in debt. By merging, FOWD will indirectly be liable for some of the debt. SSWD also has a larger population. If this merger takes place, there is nothing positive for FOWD.  
- Visitor Bramson inquired about SJWD’s reasoning for wanting to merge.  
- President Petersen stated that there are two main reasons: 1) the more water they sell, the more revenue they generate, 2) dry year supply reliability. SSWD has a lot of groundwater infrastructure and can provide aide to SJWD in a dry year. This is one of the things FOWD has been investing in—groundwater wells. FOWD always envisioned partnering with SJWD.  
- General Manager Gray stated that the Board Packet contains information about this topic and a fact sheet is available on the FOWD website.

3. Discussion and possible action on a request to form a FOWD Customer Advisory Committee  
- General Manager Gray provided an overview.
<!-- Page 9 -->
- Visitor Corcos questioned the reason for not having a Customer Advisory Committee. He stated that apparently, you don’t want the Customer Advisory Committee or you would have said we welcome that. He also stated that according to SJWD, the FOWD buys 90% of water, so this is all about 10%.
- Director Sarkovich provided an explanation of SJWD’s rate structure for water.
- Visitor Corcos stated that having a Customer Advisory Committee will allow customers to provide their input and recommendations on budgeting decisions versus sitting in meetings.
- General Manager Gray clarified that FOWD staff does not make decisions, the Board provides FOWD staff direction on what to do. There are many opportunities throughout FOWD’s monthly Board meetings for public input and the Prop 218 process is exhaustive. FOWD staff is outlining for the Board that the FOWD process is robust and in some cases, more than what other agencies are doing.
- Visitor Corcos stated that there is a huge difference between having the meeting where the public comes to give comment or having a group of rate payers and community members sitting down in back room bearing through; helping to make recommendations to the information FOWD will bring to the public. He went on to state that just because FOWD is supposed to have 3 or 2 meetings that barely anyone shows up to because they are poorly advertised, that’s different.
- President Petersen inquired about visitor Corcos’ reasoning behind that comment.
- Visitor Corcos replied that there has only been three or four people attending the Board meetings he has attended.
- Director Sarkovich stated that how public attendance is a sign of success. If FOWD had the highest rates in the region, the room would be packed.
- General Manager Gray stated that FOWD is no different than any other public government process. Some of FOWD’s outreach is more robust than typical public outreach. Local government is set-up to have Board meetings seeking public input and the Board is elected to make decisions.
- An unknown visitor asked if there is a downside to having a Customer Advisory Committee and inquired if this would be costly or time-consuming for FOWD.
- President Petersen responded that having a Customer Advisory Committee would require additional time allocation for staff than what is currently spent to prepare for Board meetings. He stated that on average, the Board of Directors spend six to eight hours preparing for Board meetings. Each Board Member gets a stipend of $100.00 per meeting; it is essentially a volunteer position. This is money coming out of the District, in addition to staff and the Board’s time to participate in these meetings.
- An unknown visitor inquired if the Board’s decision would be swayed if there is enough public interest to participate in a Customer Advisory Committee.
- President Petersen stated that FOWD is very open and transparent with the budgeting process. The purpose of the monthly Board meetings is to solicit input and comments from the public. There has been hardly anyone that provides public comment when discussing the budget. It has happened, but it’s rare. It has never risen to the point of needing more engagement.
- An unknown visitor shared her perspective and noted she recently found out about these meetings. She believes having the Board Packet online is only accessible for
<!-- Page 10 -->
![Page 6 of 12](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+6+of+12)

- The younger audience. If more people are aware of these meetings, maybe they will become more interested in participating. It doesn’t mean that the Board is not doing an excellent job, but maybe it will encourage people to be more involved.
- An unknown visitor commented that he believes there is no need for a Customer Advisory Committee. The financials are always laid out. He is curious to know what percentage of FOWD’s customers are asking for a Customer Advisory Committee. It seems to be the 1% that is badgering the District, those involved in the “move the yard campaign.” FOWD is very transparent and doing a great job delivering water at a very low cost.
- General Manager Gray shared his experience when he first joined the District in 2004 and there was a need for a Customer Advisory Committee. The District was under investigation by the grand jury. FOWD implemented things from that committee to get to where it is at today. We implore people to seek the truth.
- Visitor Corcos commented that having a Customer Advisory Committee will help get the truth out. If it worked back in 2004, it should also work out now.
- General Manager Gray responded that a Customer Advisory Committee was created in 2004 because there were issues to resolve back then. The issues being brought up recently are not the real purpose. The truth is that some people would like FOWD to move and take over the yard.
- Visitor Babcock commented that there is absolutely nothing stopping anybody from attending these meetings. He shared his experience from 2015, when San Juan Water District (SJWD) was doing a drastic cut of FOWD’s water supply and he began attending SJWD’s meetings. Visitor Babcock began attending FOWD’s Board meetings in 2017 and has only missed a couple on rare occasions. He stated that he is the only public attendee in most of the monthly FOWD Board meetings. He believes there is no need for a Customer Advisory Committee.
- Director Sarkovich stated that the Customer Advisory Committee is a bad idea because there is no need for it. Numbers do not lie; one picture tells you a thousand words. FOWD has by far the lowest water rates in the region, this information is posted on FOWD’s website. He doesn’t understand how having a Customer Advisory Committee would improve these facts. FOWD is very efficient, it has expertise, and it has delivered. FOWD is very transparent. Everything of financial substance is posted online (the budget and financial audit). It’s there for anyone to see. FOWD has accountability. Every two years, at least two Board Members are up for reelection. This year, there are three Board Members running for reelection, it’s part of the democratic process. He stated that visitor Corcos is running a slate to recall President Petersen and Director McRae. In his opinion, this is abuse and overreach. There is nothing these Board Members did deserve to be recalled. Recall is deserved when there is most egregious acts of public abuse. The Board decided to deny visitor Corcos’ request to move the corporate yard and build a parking lot as his motivation was driven by self-interest. This is the only reason we are here. Instead of the Board spending time to discuss and run a water business, time is being spent by talking about visitor Corcos—property owner and developer in the Fair Oaks Village.
- Visitor Corcos stated that he doesn’t have the money to buy FOWD’s property, but somebody can.
<!-- Page 11 -->
- Director Sarkovich is happy Mr. Corcos has built a successful business.
- An unknown visitor stated that the property belongs to FOWD and it’s not up for sale.
- Director Sarkovich stated that when visitor Corcos decided to develop in this area, he was well aware of the corporate yard’s existence; and yet he decided to build.
- Director Sarkovich decided not to move forward with any motion, as he does not consider a Customer Advisory Committee necessary. He stated that Mr. Corcos is not here for financial transparency or the low cost of water service. He stated that Mr. Corcos is here to move FOWD out of the Fair Oaks Village.
- President Petersen stated he is not in favor of forming an oversight committee at this time. He believes the Board meetings serve that venue. FOWD is very open and transparent with the budgeting process and welcomes input from ratepayers. FOWD has very qualified staff that run the organization. We are very lean and that’s why we have such low rates, but we also do very good planning. One of the things that attracted President Petersen to join the Board was the “pay as you go” structure, it’s great financial stewardship. The information in the staff report and meetings at FOWD are an opportunity for public input. The Board will take as long as it needs to take to be sure we are accounting for the interests of our rate payers.
- Director Dolby stated that there is plenty of opportunity for the public to engage. If you want the information, it’s available. He already volunteers a lot of his time to prepare for FOWD Board meetings. He does not see the need for a Customer Advisory Committee.
- General Manager Gray stated that as a public water agency, FOWD needs to stay within the mission of quality and reliable water at a reasonable cost. Sometimes, the discussion is about parking and real estate, but our mission, no matter who is on the Board, needs to stay on that task. FOWD does not get a lot of questions about water quality or water reliability. We get questions about rates and FOWD rates are the lowest. Staff stand perplexed at what’s going on.

VI. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: NEW BUSINESS
1. Discussion on FOWD Water Supply for the month of July 2024
   - Technical Services Manager Siebensohn provided a summary of the water supply report and addressed questions from the public.
   - Visitor Babcock asked for an explanation of the Fair Oaks 40.
   - Technical Services Manager Siebensohn provided an explanation.

2. Discussion and possible action on the “Request for Qualifications” to select a new Special District Financial Auditor – prior Auditor termed out in accordance with District policy
   - General Manager Gray recommended Board authorize the “Request for Qualifications” to select a new Special District Financial Auditor.

Director Sarkovich moved to adopt the “Request for Qualifications” to select a new Special District Financial Auditor.

Director Dolby seconded the motion.
<!-- Page 12 -->
![Page 12 of 132](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+12+of+132)

**Motion carried with the following votes:** Dolby – aye, Petersen – aye, and Sarkovich – aye.  
**Absent:** Director McRae and Director Marx

### 3. Discussion on Board direction for the development of a 2025 FOWD Annual Budget
- General Manager Gray presented the proposed 2025 budget schedule and provided an overview of Board direction.
- Visitor Corcos stated that FOWD is using “pay as you go” and he has been asking for two years if FOWD is spending millions of dollars for the Corporate Yard. He inquired if that money is in the bank ready to go.
- Director Sarkovich stated that FOWD is still waiting on the building permits. Once acquired, the next steps involve demolition and temporarily moving the existing facility somewhere in our service territory. FOWD will not be spending much of its budget in 2025, this is a multi-year project. It will take approximately three years to complete this project.
- An unknown visitor stated that an investment in the water infrastructure in Fair Oaks to maintain the quality and services of water is vital. It costs a lot of money to maintain and improve water quality. He believes FOWD has done its job effectively over the years.
- Director Sarkovich stated that on an annual basis, FOWD spends approximately 40% of its revenue on infrastructure. Year after year FOWD invests in the system, prefers to avoid debt and interest. FOWD currently has zero debt. In 2004, the District had debt. It was paid off and FOWD intends to remain on a “pay as you go” basis.
- General Manager Gray stated that the water system needs to be safe and robust in order to produce reliable water. During his twenty years with the District, he is proud that on average, 40% of ratepayers’ money has been reinvested into capital projects. During this time, FOWD has also received over $18 million in grants.
- Visitor Bramson inquired about the ongoing litigation with SJWD.
- Director Sarkovich stated that it is about SJWD changing the rate structure, and a possible violation of Prop 26.
- President Petersen clarified that this is the beginning of the budgeting process for 2025 and it gets adopted in October.
- Director Sarkovich stated that there will be a public hearing on October 21st. It will be open to the public. The Board will vote on October 28th for possible adoption.
- General Manager Gray stated that the Board publishes a schedule every year for adoption of the budget. On October 21, 2024, a Board Meeting will take place to discuss the draft budget. On October 28, 2024, a Special Board Meeting and hearing is scheduled to discuss the draft budget. There are multiple opportunities for input.
- Visitor Bramson inquired if these meetings will be held at FOWD and also questioned how they are being advertised.
- President Petersen replied that meetings will be held at FOWD, and they will be advertised on the website and outside the administration building.
- Visitor Corcos inquired if these dates will be in the bills.
<!-- Page 13 -->
- Director Sarkovich stated that FOWD plans to send announcements regarding October 21st and 28th to publicize broadly, in addition to the public knowledge of the meetings and website.
- General Manager Gray stated that when the rates are adjusted, there is a mailing that goes out to every customer (Prop 218). This is about a $20,000 expense.
- Director Sarkovich stated that he does not want to be accused of approving the budget without public input. A mailing will ensure that the public is aware of what is being proposed for the 2025 budget so they can clearly see that rates are not going through the roof and there will be no new debt. He would like to see public outreach for the October 21st and 28th dates to rate payers about the budget process.
- President Petersen agreed with Director Sarkovich’s proposal.
- Director Sarkovich stated that he would like a simple letter sent to customers about what is being proposed with a summary of the staff report.
- Director Dolby also supports this idea.
- Director Sarkovich stated that the staff has direction from the Board that there will be some public outreach in addition to the other points in the staff report.

4. Discussion and possible action on additional funding for 2024 expenses
- Finance Manager Ha-Ly recommended for the Board to authorize a transfer of $18,800 from the contingency fund to cover 2024 expenses and provided a summary of each expense.
- Director Sarkovich and General Manager Gray provided an overview of how the contingency budget works.

Director Sarkovich moved to authorize the transfer $18,800 from the contingency fund to cover 2024 expenses as presented.  
Director Dolby seconded the motion.  
Motion carried with the following votes: Dolby – aye, Petersen – aye, and Sarkovich – aye.  
Absent: Director McRae and Director Marx.

   • President Petersen stated that Fair Oaks is not an incorporated city, the County does approve all the projects, including the development of the park (Fair Oaks Village).  
   • General Manager Gray stated that in recent developments, municipalities are implementing social engineering, they want people to use public transportation and walk. This results in what is currently happening with the Fair Oaks Village – lack of parking. FOWD hopes to be the best neighbor one could have.

### Recommendation:

Reference: November 2024 FOWD Elections  

All:  

The mission of the Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) is to provide our community with an adequate and reliable supply of water, exceeding all drinking water standards, at the lowest reasonable cost. The role of the FOWD General Manager is to fulfill the mission of the District while maintaining compliance with all regulations and laws. Though the General Manager works at the pleasure of the Board of Directors, the General Manager role is clear – to accomplish the mission of the FOWD and ensure that all regulations and laws are followed by District staff. In addition, it is the role of the General Manager to ensure the truth about the District is available to the public, independent of the perception.  

Candidates, and people involved in the current FOWD election process, have made a variety of public statements about the FOWD, with some of the statements being misrepresentations of the truth. FOWD staff wants to believe that no individual or group is intentionally making false statements about the FOWD. FOWD staff chooses to believe that anyone making false statements about the FOWD is doing so because they do not have access to the truth.  

Given my role as the FOWD General Manager, I am actively attempting to ensure that accurate information related to the FOWD is easy to access for all – believing that all Candidates and people involved in the current FOWD election process only want to speak the truth.  

Please note that my intent is not to endorse any candidate for the FOWD Board of Directors, it is only to ensure that accurate information is available to all candidates and ratepayers.

# AGENDA ITEM V.1
## REGULAR Board Meeting on September 16, 2024

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tom R. Gray  
**Date:** September 11, 2024  
**Subject:** Update and discussion on the New York Water Main Project Phase I  

### Recommendation:
None – information item.

### Discussion:
Following the notice to proceed provided on August 5th, Flowline Contractors, Inc. (Flowline) began preliminary construction work by potholing the project area. Based on field conditions, it was determined that minor modifications were needed to the original water main alignment and a revised design was created. The final design was then provided to the Sacramento County Department of Transportation (DOT) for review and approval.

Flowline began construction of the new main on August 29th. Programmable message boards were placed near the Winding Way intersection 10 days prior to the start of construction to alert commuters about the project. To date, approximately 800 feet of main from north of Lemon Street to the Winding Way intersection has been installed. Installation of the northern portion from the Winding Way intersection to Orange Avenue will continue next, with final tie-ins scheduled to be made once all main is installed and tested. Due to an approximately two-week delay for design revisions, the final project schedule may need to be extended to Mid-November.

### Policy Implications:
None.

### Fiscal Impact:
Phase I of the project is included in the FOWD Board approved 2024 Budget with sufficient funding available.

# AGENDA ITEM VI.1
**REGULAR Board Meeting September 16, 2024**

To: Board of Directors  
From: Paul Siebensohn  
Date: September 10, 2024  
Subject: Discussion on FOWD Water Supply for the month of August 2024  

## Recommendation:
None.

## Discussion:
According to the Accuweather.com website, the recorded average daily temperature in August 2024 was 76.0° F, which is 0.5 degrees below the historic average of 76.5° F for August. Precipitation for August 2024 was recorded at 0.04” according to the Department of Water Resources Chicago rain station located in Fair Oaks.

The wholesale connections provided 1,232.23 AC-FT (89.99%) of surface water and FOWD groundwater wells produced 137.12 AC-FT (10.01%) to meet the total water demand of 1,369.35 AC-FT.

A graph of total consumption to date versus projected budget target is found in Exhibit A.

A graph of groundwater and surface water use in 2024 to date is found in Exhibit B.

Both the FO-40 and CTP wholesale connections remained open to provide surface water supply to the District.

According to the data provided by SJWD, the recorded volumes from wholesale connections are:

| Connection | Forward Flow, AC-FT | Reverse Flow, AC-FT | Total, AC-FT |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| CTP Connection | 755.34               | 0.00                | 755.34        |
| FO-40 (39°)   | 476.89               | 0.00                | 476.89        |
| **TOTAL FROM SJWD** | **1,232.23**         | **0.00**            | **1,232.23**  |

The average daily flow from wholesale connections for the month of August 2024 was recorded at 8,976 GPM (12.9 million gallons per day).

The maximum day water demand was reached on August 4, 2024, and was recorded at approximately 15.67 million gallons (MG) with the wholesale connections providing 13.76 MG and FOWD groundwater wells providing 1.91 MG. The minimum day water demand was recorded on August 24, 2024, at 12.06 MG. The average day demand was calculated at 14.36 MG.

The 10-year total average water use for the month of August is 1,340.47 AC-FT and August 2013 total water demand was recorded at 1,631.80 AC-FT. The August 2024 total water demand of 1,369.35 AC-FT represents an increase of 2.15% from the August 10-year average, a 16.08% decrease from August 2013 consumption, and a 4.11% increase from 2023 consumption.

# AGENDA ITEM VI.2
**REGULAR Board Meeting on September 16, 2024**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tom R. Gray  
**Date:** September 11, 2024  
**Subject:** Discussion and possible action on the Transmission Main Phase I Design Request for Qualifications  

## Recommendation:
- Approve combining two scheduled transmission main replacement phases into one project for long term cost savings and to expedite retirement of the existing transmission main.
- Approve the attached Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and direct FOWD staff to distribute to consulting firms for response.

## Discussion:
In 2021, Peterson Brustad Inc. (PBI) prepared a technical report for the FOWD with recommendations for replacing sections of an existing FOWD transmission main in phases over the next 8 years.

FOWD staff has recommended modifying the scope of work for the proposed RFQ from what was originally planned in PBI’s technical report. This recommendation involves combining the phases that were planned for years 1 and 2 into a single project, now named Phase I. There are multiple estimated advantages to performing design and construction at a larger scale for Phase I. FOWD could save money on services that do not need to be performed twice such as mobilization, traffic control, construction support services, and project design. In addition, potential exists for materials and equipment to be bid at a lower rate due to economies of scale.

Another significant factor in the decision to combine original two phases of the project is that a section of FOWD’s existing transmission main, where there have been two recent leaks, can be retired once construction is complete. This includes a leak at the Rollingwood Condominium Complex that is being actively monitored by Operations. If the original phases were to be separated as originally planned, replacement of this “leaky” section of main would remain delayed.

The requested completion date for design services in the RFQ is January 31, 2025, with the bid process for construction scheduled to begin thereafter. The target date for construction to be completed is May 31, 2025, to avoid conflicts with a County paving moratorium planned on Madison Avenue during the summer of 2025.
<!-- Page 69 -->
![Fair Oaks Water District](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Fair+Oaks+Water+District)

Below is a summary of the estimated costs for design from PBI’s 2021 report. A more accurate cost will be determined once RFQ responses are received and can be used to make a final decision on project phasing.

**Transmission Main Replacement Year 1 Design**  $131,000  
**Transmission Main Replacement Year 2 Design**  $143,500  
**Transmission Main Replacement Phase I (Combined) – Design**  $274,500  

**Policy Implications:**  
None.

**Fiscal Impact:**  
$145,000 is included in the 2024 Board Approved Budget for the design of the original Phase I Transmission Main Replacement Project.
- This amount will need to increase if both original project phases are combined.
- A more accurate figure can be determined once RFQ responses are received.
- For planning purposes, $200,000 would be placed in the proposed 2025 FOWD Annual Budget – providing a $345,000 total budget for design of the proposed Phase I Transmission Main Replacement Project in 2024/25.

4.0 Project Description

4.1 FOWD has a network of existing transmission main piping that has been identified for replacement as part of a multi-year capital improvement program. This project encompasses Phase 1 of the planned transmission main replacement. Design services for the project are scheduled to be completed by January 31, 2025, and construction will follow thereafter.

4.2 Phase 1 consists of Sections A and B, which each make up a portion of the total alignment. This structure will allow FOWD to determine whether both sections can be completed together or if Section B should be deferred to a future project based on the estimated design and construction costs.

4.3 For Section A, approximately 2,180 linear feet of 24-inch ductile iron pipe will be installed to replace the existing 30-inch steel main. Alignment of the new main will begin on Blue Oak Drive at Brome Court and travel northwest to Madison Avenue. It will then continue southwest along Madison Avenue, terminating at Winding Oak Drive. This section includes one connection point to the existing transmission main at Brome Court, which is constructed of newer ductile iron pipe.

4.4 For Section B, approximately 1,200 linear feet of 24-inch ductile iron pipe will be installed to replace the existing 30-inch steel main. Alignment of the new main will begin on Blue Oak Drive at Madison Avenue and travel southwest along Blue Oak Drive, terminating past Great Dome Court. This section includes one connection point to the existing transmission main past Great Dome Court, which is constructed of newer ductile iron pipe.

4.5 All available data including as-builts, map records, and reports will be provided to the selected consultant.

Dear Members,

It’s easy to lose sight of the challenges faced in negotiating the original Water Forum Agreement over 20 years ago. The years of conflict that led to the negotiations, the countless hours of discussions, and the hard-won compromises were all necessary to achieve the successes we have experienced over the past two decades. As the Water Forum, we have navigated historic droughts, maintained water supply reliability, supported economic growth, and guided environmental stewardship of our beautiful river. Without your hard work, we wouldn’t have the Regional Water Authority, the Freeport Water Intake, or 10 habitat enhancement sites on the LAR. Without the Water Forum, we wouldn’t have the trusted relationships, the network of agencies and organizations, and the collaboration that drives our collective success.

This year’s annual report highlights the extensive range of work we are doing in addition to renegotiating the Water Forum Agreement. Thanks to our partnerships with state and federal agencies, we are achieving a milestone this fall: five years of steady implementation of habitat projects (over $14 million in work) with the completion of the River Bend project. In addition, this work is raising awareness of the Water Forum through new educational signage, door-to-door outreach, and earned media coverage.

As we approach the final stages of the Water Forum 2.0 negotiations, let’s not forget the fundamentals. “The Water Forum Way” has long been the basis for our interactions, a shorthand phrase to remind us of our commitment to a mutual gains approach of interest-based negotiation—or as one member paraphrased from the Rolling Stones, “we all can’t get what we want, but we can all get what we need.” It is through this process of compromise that we can identify durable approaches to addressing the needs of the region.

The challenges we face in the current climate are rapidly changing—in many ways faster than our ability to adapt to the political, regulatory, and infrastructure systems that we have in place. I remain optimistic and look forward to another year of working with you to build on the Water Forum’s successes and continue to shape a future for the Sacramento region, where water supply reliability, economic vitality, and environmental stewardship go hand in hand.

Warm regards,

Jessica Law, Executive Director  
August 2024

![WATER FORUM 2.0 PROCESS MAKES PROGRESS TOWARDS DRAFT AGREEMENT](https://example.com/image.png)

**WATER FORUM 2.0 PROCESS MAKES PROGRESS TOWARDS DRAFT AGREEMENT**

This year marks a pivotal moment as Water Forum members work to present a draft agreement to their respective boards and governing bodies. We have a lot of momentum going into the last phase of the agreement, as well as financial support. In 2023 water purveyors collectively invested over $1 million to complete the agreement, allowing the Water Forum to stay on track. This substantial financial commitment underscores the importance of the Water Forum 2.0 Agreement to our region and demonstrates a strong belief in the value of this collaborative effort.

### Why the Water Forum Agreement?
- Assesses threats to water supply and river health due to climate change
- Maintains interest-based, collaborative venue
- Strengthens emphasis on the lower American River
- Elevates conjunctive use for regional water supply reliability
- Addresses human dimensions of natural resource management
- Integrates use of best-available science to support decision making

Over the past year, frequent working group and caucus meetings have been instrumental in navigating the complexities of the agreement negotiations, and have fostered a shared understanding and commitment to our mission. One of the most significant achievements this year has been the high level of agreement reached on the guiding principles and program elements for key program areas. This consensus has provided a solid foundation for drafting the Water Forum 2.0 Agreement.

We also initiated outreach efforts to engage local elected leaders and community leaders regarding the Water Forum 2.0 Agreement. This initiative is designed to build broad support for the new agreement and secure funding to support our work moving forward.

In just a few months we will begin the work of integrating draft language for American River Corridor Health, American River Flows and Operations, Regional Water Supply Sustainability, and Governance, Funding, and Administration sections that have been developed by working group members. The target is to present the final agreement for signatures by March - June 2025.

### What to Expect in the Integrated Document
Looking ahead, the integrated draft Water Forum 2.0 Agreement will include:

- **Coequal Objectives:** The agreement will reaffirm the long-standing mission and vision of the Water Forum, emphasizing our dual commitment to water supply reliability and environmental stewardship.
  
- **Guiding Principles:** These foundational guidelines will drive the actions of the Water Forum and its members, helping to ensure that our efforts remain aligned with our core values and objectives.
  
- **Program Elements:** The agreement will be organized into four main elements, defining our roles and responsibilities, and specific program areas within American River Corridor Health, American River Flows and Operations, Regional Water Supply Sustainability, and Governance, Funding, and Administration.

- **Supported Projects:** A list of regional initiatives and projects broadly supported by the Water Forum, highlighting our collective efforts to enhance water supply reliability and environmental stewardship.

- **Funding Commitments:** Information on the long-term financial support for the Water Forum, helping to ensure sustained progress and stability.

- **Purveyor Specific Agreements:** The agreement will include revised Purveyor Specific Agreements, a hallmark of the original agreement. These agreements, along with other implementing agreements, will identify how Water Forum members and other partners will work together on Water Forum 2.0 initiatives, detailing the specific commitments and responsibilities of participating entities.

# EXISTING PROGRAM AREAS

## 1.1 HABITAT ENHANCEMENT

The Water Forum has made significant progress in achieving and, in many areas, completing the priorities outlined in the Business Strategy released in January 2022. This second annual report of the Business Strategy highlights progress for the period July 2023 to July 2024.

### Grant Funding: Enhancing Salmonid Habitats on the American River

The Water Forum submitted two grant funding applications to support the habitat enhancement program. Below are the details of two significant efforts submitted in 2024:

- **Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) Notice of Funding Opportunity (March 2024)**: The Water Forum requested $10 million in federal funds, with an additional $250,000 in matching funds through Program Manager staff time for Federal FY 2025-2029. There would be no cash cost share required from the Water Forum. This project, titled "Maintenance and Habitat Effectiveness Monitoring of Salmonid Habitat Program Restoration Sites on the American River," aims to leverage previous habitat construction, programmatic regulatory compliance, and ongoing monitoring to maintain and optimize effectiveness for up to 21.6 acres of previously enhanced spawning habitat and 8.5 acres of rearing habitat constructed since 2018.

- **USBR WaterSMART Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration Projects (January 2024)**: The Water Forum requested $1 million to advance conceptual rearing habitat sites to a "shovel-ready" condition. This grant would fund physical and biological baseline data collection, hydraulic analysis, stakeholder engagement, cost estimation, and a 60% level of design preparation for up to 12 rearing sites. The planned projects would eventually expand juvenile salmonid rearing habitats, primarily between River Mile 13 and the Sacramento River confluence, and completing initial data collection, outreach, and design/feasibility will enhance the attractiveness of these projects for future implementation grant funding. Once implemented, these project sites will fulfill a significant portion of the rearing habitat commitment under the Agreements to Support Healthy Rivers and Landscapes (formerly Voluntary Agreements) proposed for the LAR. The outcome is expected in fall 2024.

### Supporting local river educational programs:

The Water Forum sponsored several new nesting boxes in partnership with Soil Born Farms. These boxes provide crucial places for native birds to lay their eggs and opportunities for humans to monitor and enjoy our winged neighbors. They are located close to the American River Parkway bike trail in Rancho Cordova, near the Cordova Creek bridge.

![The Water Forum’s 2023 Habitat Project at Upper River Bend](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**The Water Forum’s 2023 Habitat Project at Upper River Bend**

In 2023, the Water Forum completed a significant habitat enhancement project at Upper River Bend, located near Ancil Hoffman Park on the American River. This initiative aimed to improve habitats for native fall-run Chinook salmon and steelhead trout.

The project provided:

- Nearly 5 acres of spawning habitat for adult salmon and steelhead to create redds (underwater depressions or “nests”), constructed by placing 30,000 cubic yards of clean gravel into the flowing river.
  
- Nearly 6 acres of rearing habitat for young fish to hide from predators, find food, and grow, created by carving a 2,000-foot side channel into the existing gravel bar and shaping 3.7 acres of seasonal channel margin habitat.
  
- Hiding and resting places for young fish by placing about 60 large woody tree structures into the side channel.
  
- Over 3 acres of enhanced riparian landscape by planting 6,600 willow cuttings, seeds for native wildflowers and grasses, and 1,600 plugs of Santa Barbara sedge. These plants are vital both ecologically and culturally, as they are significant to California’s indigenous peoples.

The $3.6 million project concluded in October 2023, and within weeks, giant Chinook salmon were observed spawning in the newly created gravel beds beside Ancil Hoffman Park. The site has also been heavily utilized by rearing juveniles during the spring 2024 monitoring season.

![Interpretive Signage Illustrates the Water Forum's Habitat Projects](https://example.com/image1.jpg)

The Water Forum installed several interpretive signs and exhibits to educate the public about their vital habitat enhancement projects and the extraordinary journeys of native salmon and steelhead.

- **The 2021 Habitat Enhancement Project and Tribute to Jonas Minton:** A new interpretive sign was installed along the Main Trail at the Effie Yeaw Nature Center in Ancil Hoffman Park, Carmichael. This sign details the Water Forum’s 2021 Habitat Project and honors the late Jonas Minton, a visionary leader of the Water Forum. The tribute portion of the sign was generously donated by the Minton family.

- **"Salmon Highway" Exhibit at Effie Yeaw Nature Center:** Visitors to the Effie Yeaw Nature Center can explore the wonders of the "Salmon Highway" through a new museum exhibit. This display showcases the Water Forum’s 2021 Habitat Project and provides insights into the remarkable lives of native salmon and steelhead, illustrating their journeys through the Delta and Sacramento River to their spawning grounds in the LAR.

- **Permanent Signage at Lower Sailor Bar and Upper River Bend:** The Water Forum installed permanent signage for habitat projects at Lower Sailor Bar and Upper River Bend in Ancil Hoffman Park. These signs, required by the Prop 68 grant, briefly explain the work accomplished, recognize project partners, and provide links to information in six languages for broad accessibility.

---

**Lower American River Task Force: Honoring the past, re-envisioning the future.**

In 2024, the Lower American River Task Force (LARTF) celebrated 30 years of collaborative efforts. Established to address erosion and flood risk along this nationally recognized Wild and Scenic River, the group collaborates with federal, state, and local agencies, environmental organizations, and community stakeholders. Their efforts address sustainable flood control measures and urban development while preserving the river’s ecological integrity and recreational value, marking a pivotal contribution amidst the challenge of climate change. The Water Forum is working closely with the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency (SAFCA) and LARTF members to re-envision the role of LARTF in the context of the Water Forum 2.0 Agreement process, specifically related to River Corridor Health and implementing agreements with SAFCA and County Parks.

# 1.2 FLOWS AND OPERATIONS

## Cross-Caucus Meetings—LAR Conditions and Folsom Reservoir Operations

The Water Forum organized weekly meetings throughout the year to update members on current conditions along the LAR and the operational status of Folsom Reservoir. During these sessions, Water Forum staff and consultants provided the most recent data on river flows, water temperatures, reservoir storage levels, and snowpack accumulation, along with information from the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) on the forecasted inflows and releases. Information focused on the American River, and also included data from other areas in the state relevant for Central Valley Project operations. The meetings allowed time for members to digest the information, ask questions, and consider, and potentially recommend, strategies to best support the coequal objectives.

## American River Group Meetings

The Water Forum was actively engaged in the American River Group (ARG), a monthly forum where stakeholders discuss crucial updates on reservoir inflows, operations, river conditions, and fisheries status along the LAR. Reclamation established the ARG in 1996 as a working group to coordinate fishery and operational requirements for the LAR. Reclamation is the lead coordinator, bringing together those with either a legislated or resources-specific interest in the operation of Folsom Dam and Reservoir and the LAR. Formal members include Reclamation, the Water Forum, and agencies with public trust responsibilities for LAR fisheries, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) Fisheries, and California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). Members of the public and other agencies may attend and comment on ARG matters. Reclamation considers ARG insights when making decisions on temperature and flow management critical for sustaining LAR fish resources. The Water Forum actively contributed to developing the 2023 Annual Temperature Management Plan, providing modeling results crucial for optimizing summer and fall temperature controls.

## Collaboration on Bay-Delta Plan Update: Guiding Technical Accuracy

The Water Forum collaborated with the Regional Water Authority (RWA) to review the extensive 6,000+ page Draft Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document for the Bay-Delta Plan update issued by the State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board). Water Forum staff led discussions regarding data utilized in the Draft Staff Report and advocated for an appropriate representation of conditions on the LAR with State Water Board staff. This document evaluated alternatives for unimpaired flows and Agreements to Support Healthy Rivers and Landscapes. Although the Water Forum did not formally submit comments, it worked closely with the RWA team to ensure the technical accuracy of information related to the habitat management program and flow management standard.

## Advocacy at Key Conferences

The Water Forum represented member interests concerning Folsom operations and American River flows at the Mid-Pacific Region Water Users Conference in Reno, Nevada. Post-conference, the team briefed Reclamation staff on Water Forum 2.0 and the Reclamation Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). In November 2023, the team also actively engaged at the Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA) conference, furthering their engagement in critical water management issues.

![Watershed Resilience Planning](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Watershed+Resilience+Planning)

**Watershed Resilience Planning**

The Water Forum is actively engaged in the RWA's Watershed Resilience Steering Committee meetings. Recently, RWA secured a $2 million Watershed Resilience grant from the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to unite regional partners in assessing local climate variability and risks, and to develop strategies for adapting to climate change and weather variability. This grant initiative includes a dedicated Watershed Resilience Steering Committee tasked with shaping a comprehensive work plan. Comprising 10 members representing diverse stakeholders across the supershed, including environmental organizations and the Water Forum, this committee will play a pivotal role in guiding the effective implementation of the grant program.

# 1.3 SCIENCE AND MONITORING

## Planning for Successful Adaptive Management and LAR Stewardship: Finalizing a Long-Term Physical Habitat Monitoring and Maintenance Plan

The Water Forum has developed its inaugural Gravel Maintenance and Monitoring Plan (Plan) in collaboration with cbec eco engineering. This comprehensive Plan includes a three-tier monitoring protocol that assesses various parameters on actionable timeframes. Annual completion of this monitoring is mandated by regulatory permits and responds to stakeholder requests for detailed plans on habitat site maintenance.

Monitoring activities encompass stakeholder engagement, spatial and photographic analysis, field inspections, and integration with fisheries surveys to evaluate habitat functionality and provide safe passage for recreational and public safety vessels. Additionally, the Plan mandates a comprehensive assessment of the river corridor's physical habitat evolution every five years to document long-term geomorphic changes within the American River Parkway. These changes result from erosion, deposition, operational decisions, and human impacts.

The synergy between different habitat types—such as spawning and rearing areas—is deliberately maintained through the Plan's protocols. For instance, gravel maintenance in spawning areas indirectly benefits adjacent rearing areas by influencing water surface elevation and flow dynamics. This integrated approach underscores the importance of evaluating habitat projects to meet ecological needs while balancing recreational and safety requirements on the river.

## Utilizing Best Available Science for 2024 Long-Term River Corridor Evolution Monitoring

To fulfill the Water Forum’s Tier 3 Corridor Evolution Monitoring commitment, the Water Forum completed data collection and is analyzing geomorphic changes in the LAR that have occurred since 2017/2018. This effort included acquiring topobathymetric LiDAR data in December 2023 and conducting multi-beam SONAR surveys in spring 2024. Ongoing analysis involves updating a Digital Elevation Model, detecting topographic changes compared to previous data, and enhancing the Program’s 2D hydraulic model by fall 2024 to confirm our actions do not increase flood risk. Beyond regulatory compliance, this analysis informs our understanding of how habitat projects have been affected by the previous five years of operational decisions and how project construction has affected the LAR. The updated models will also support future habitat planning, design, and quantification efforts.

## Leveraging Water Quality Data to Inform LAR Real-Time Operations and Benefit the Fishery

During the 2021 drought, a Water Forum-funded study highlighted concerning in-river conditions and the need to monitor and potentially manage additional parameters like dissolved oxygen (DO) beyond temperature. Following a year-long pilot study showing persistent low DO levels below Nimbus Dam and at Watt Avenue, the Water Forum led ongoing DO monitoring with Cramer Fish Sciences.

This effort informed our understanding of diurnal and seasonal dissolved oxygen patterns and directly contributed to a positive change in river operations during the 2023 fall-run Chinook spawning season. 

Page 111 of 132
<!-- Page 112 -->
![Page 112 of 132](https://example.com/image-url)

At the October 2023 ARG meeting, concerns raised by CDFW about DO levels during early Chinook spawning prompted swift action. Using pilot study data, the team immediately informed ARG discussions and quickly deployed additional monitoring below Folsom Dam to assess planned power bypass impacts on DO. Rapid analysis allowed them to offer a scientifically defensible, data-centered recommendation to ARG that Reclamation modify operations by bypassing power at Nimbus Dam and spilling at multiple gates to aerate the water and increase DO concentrations for along the river continuum.

Beyond fisheries, DO levels reflect overall river health influenced by factors like algae. Continuous monitoring under the Habitat and Science Program supports fall 2024 operations and long-term trends. The Water Forum’s real-time, data-driven collaboration with Reclamation, CDFW, and stakeholders protects LAR ecosystem health and sustainable fisheries practices.

**Unlocking the Secrets of Chinook Salmon Success in the American River**

As part of its broader evaluation of habitat enhancement effectiveness and to guide adaptive management and planning, the Water Forum collaborated with Cramer Fish Sciences on a scientific paper titled "Applying Parentage Methods to Detect Gravel Augmentation Effects on Juvenile Chinook Salmon Recruitment Rates."

This study, authored by Cramer Fish Sciences, highlights significant results for the Water Forum’s habitat program by shedding light on how genetic samples from spawning adults and juveniles can be used to measure changes in reproductive success. The Water Forum organized multiple briefings on the results of this study to key State and Federal agency staff, the ARG, and parties to the Healthy Rivers and Landscapes program.

The study demonstrates that analyzing genetic samples from fall-spawned female adult fish and matching them with samples from juveniles at the Watt Avenue rotary screw trap in spring allows for assessing juvenile production in the LAR. This method is particularly effective in rivers with smaller adult populations, like the LAR, where sampling more adults enhances the accuracy of estimating spawning success and juvenile production rates.

Traditionally, juvenile production estimates relied solely on adult abundance, assuming equal contribution from all spawning adults. However, this study shows that habitat-enhanced project sites on the LAR result in higher offspring production per successful spawner compared to non-enhanced sites.

This groundbreaking study, the first of its kind in California, not only supports the current strategy for habitat enhancement projects but also directly addresses hypotheses in the Science Program for Healthy Rivers and Landscapes regarding natural juvenile production associated with the Water Forum’s initiatives on the LAR.

**Advancing Fishery Science: Presentation at American Fisheries Society Meeting**

The Water Forum presented its ongoing efforts to monitor the long-term effectiveness of and adapt management strategies on the American River, highlighting their integration with the habitat program and FMS components of the Agreements to Support Healthy Rivers and Landscapes Science Program.

Water Forum's Habitat and Science Program Manager, Erica Bishop, presented on "Long-term Effectiveness Monitoring and Adaptive Management on the American River and Integration with the VA Science Program," at the California-Nevada Chapter American Fisheries Society 58th Biennial Meeting.
<!-- Page 113 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

A key outcome highlighted was the long-term monitoring results on the LAR, showing Water Forum projects significantly contribute to naturally spawning salmonid populations. Allowing for inter-annual variability based on water year type, program sites support 30-56% of in-river Chinook and steelhead spawning annually, accounting for inter-annual variability.

The presentation was part of a habitat and flow actions session for native species, featuring presentations from tributaries involved in the Agreements to Support Healthy Rivers. The session concluded with a panel discussion and Q&A, where presenters discussed the Science Committee's value and efforts to enhance conditions for native species.

**Regional and Statewide Collaboration to Improve Outcomes for Native Salmonids**

**Agreements for Healthy Rivers and Landscapes Science Committee**

The Water Forum is helping to provide a regional voice and expertise as a member of the Science Committee for the Agreements for Healthy Rivers and Landscapes program.

The program requires rigorous application of the best available science in planning, implementing, evaluating, and monitoring habitat projects that will be fulfilling commitments and testing Science Plan hypotheses under the program. Flow and habitat measures must meet strict criteria for timing, suitability, and effectiveness to earn "credit" for actions and the program. Prior to implementation, habitat projects must undergo third-party design reviews and as-built condition assessments, creating a continuous feedback loop aimed at achieving optimal outcomes for implemented by vetted scientific information and tributary-developed data.

The Water Forum's involvement on the Committee spans multi-tributary coordination, design review, habitat accounting, monitoring, discussions with the State Water Board, and reporting/tracking. The Water Forum also oversees the planning, implementation, and monitoring of habitat measures linked to LAR commitments under the program, coordinating closely with the RWA (the American River’s representative in the program).

**Central Valley Program Improvement Act, Science Integration Team (CVPIA SIT)**

Reclamation and USFWS established the Science Integration Team (SIT) to utilize the Structured Decision Making (SDM) process. This framework prioritizes actions for Chinook salmon, steelhead, and sturgeon under the CVPIA Near-Term Restoration Strategy Guidance and Requirements. The Water Forum contributes to the SIT, providing insights into LAR habitat, science efforts, and operational impacts. Their contributions help refine the SDM process with the latest scientific findings and lessons learned from Water Forum projects and monitoring efforts.
