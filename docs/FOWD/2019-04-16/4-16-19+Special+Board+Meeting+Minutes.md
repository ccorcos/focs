### AGENDA ITEMS
I. **Call to Order**
- President McRae called the meeting to order at 5:30 p.m.

- None.

III. **DISCUSSION AND POSSIBLE ACTION**
1. **Discussion and possible action on the funding for the 5442 Hazel Avenue Water Main Replacement**
   - Operations Manager Nisenboym stated that 200 feet of 10-inch main was installed without cathodic protection and has a history of leaking. In April 2019, Western Engineering Inc. dug an investigatory hole for a sewer project which resulted in the pipe leaking. The steel is not structurally sound and FOWD was unable to make a proper repair. Western Engineering Inc. provided a quote for $279,000 to repair the leaking main. Operations Manager Nisenboym recommended to the Board to authorize funding for 5442 Hazel Avenue Water Main Replacement.

- Director Sarkovich inquired if Hazel Avenue will be retrofitted in the future.
- Operations Manager Nisenboym replied that this area is not included in the Hazel Avenue Main Replacement Project.
- Director Marx stated that he is not comfortable with the high cost of the project and will abstain from voting.
- Finance Manager Ha-Ly emphasized that the $279,000 does not include inspections or staff time. She stated the funds will be allocated to the project and decreased from the operating salary expense which will result in no change to the 2019 budget.

Director Page moved to authorize funding for the 5442 Hazel Avenue Water Main Replacement.

Director Carey seconded the motion.

Motion carried with the following votes: Carey – aye, Page – aye, McRae – aye and Sarkovich – aye.

Abstained: Marx.

IV. PUBLIC COMMENT
- Mr. Babcock stated that it is prudent to have the contractor complete the work since there is not enough FOWD staff to work on the project.
- Mr. Menezes mentioned that the original plan that FOWD staff brought forward was to have the contractor replace a portion of the main. He questioned whether Petrovich Development should be responsible for the cost of the main.
- Operations Manager Nisenboym stated that the Contractor decided not to tap into the water main.

V. ADJOURNMENT
With no further business to come before the Board, Vice President McRae adjourned the meeting at 6:10 p.m.

The Board approved the preceding minutes on May 13, 2019
