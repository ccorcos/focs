# Making Conservation a California Way of Life Regulation

The State Water Resources Control Board on July 3 adopted the Making Conservation a California Way of Life regulation. The regulation implements Assembly Bill 1668 and Senate Bill 606, which were signed into law in 2018, to develop a regulatory framework to achieve long-term water use efficiency with the purpose of adapting to climate change and more intense and frequent droughts in California.

## What is included in the Making Conservation a California Way of Life regulation?

Under the regulation, urban retail water suppliers must comply with three major components:

- A unique **urban water use objective**;
- **Commercial, industrial and institutional (CII) performance measures**; and
- **Annual reporting**.

### Urban Water Use Objective

The **urban water use objective** is a supplier-specific water budget that is the sum of water use efficiency standards for urban water uses for residential indoor water use, residential outdoor water use, CII landscapes with dedicated irrigation meters and supplier system real water loss. These standards are applied to unique local service area characteristics, such as population, climate and landscape area. The urban water use objective also includes adjustments for specified unique water uses, such as evaporative coolers and seasonal tourism, temporary provisions, and/or a bonus for potable reuse, if applicable.

Urban retail water suppliers can learn more about their expected urban water use objective by visiting the State Water Board’s Water Use Objective Exploration Tool and reviewing the Provisional Data.

![CII Performance Measures](https://www.acwa.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/CII-Performance-Measures-Page-4.jpg)

**CII Performance Measures**

Every urban retail water supplier must comply with the following CII performance measures. These CII performance measures are services and programs water suppliers can offer to increase the indoor and outdoor water use efficiency of CII water users. A simplified overview of the CII performance measures is as follows:

- **Classification of CII water accounts** into ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager’s broad categories, plus four additional categories.
- **Convert CII large landscapes** (over 0.5 acres) with mixed use meters (MUMs) to dedicated irrigation meters or employ in-lieu technologies such as advanced metering infrastructure. This requires identifying all CII-MUM landscapes that meet this threshold in a service area.
- **Implement CII best management practices** for the top CII water users (with three possible track options).

**Annual Reporting**

Starting Jan. 1, 2024, and by Jan. 1 every year thereafter, each urban retail water supplier is required to submit annual reporting requirements to the State Water Board and the Department of Water Resources that includes their urban water use objective, actual urban water use, documentation of the implementation of CII performance measures and a description of progress made towards meeting their urban water use objective (§ Water Code 10609.24).

**When does compliance start?**

Suppliers must work with their customers to achieve water savings that may be needed to meet the new regulation. Individual customers are not required to comply with the urban water use objective.

Beginning Jan. 1, 2025, and by Jan. 1 every year thereafter, each urban retail water supplier is required to calculate its urban water use objective for the previous year. Each year, the objective will be based on dynamic data such as weather and population. Beginning Jan. 1, 2027, each urban retail water supplier must demonstrate compliance with its urban water use objective.

![07/03/2024 BOARD MEETING – ITEM #5 CHANGE SHEET #1 (CIRCULATED 07/03/2024) STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD RESOLUTION NO. 2024- ADOPTING A REGULATION TO MAKE CONSERVATION A CALIFORNIA WAY OF LIFE WHEREAS: 1. Many Californians and urban water suppliers have taken bold, creative, and sometimes-challenging steps over the years to use water more efficiently. 2. In 2018, the California State Legislature enacted Senate Bill (SB) 606 and Assembly Bill (AB) 1668 to establish guidelines for efficient urban water use and a framework for the implementation and oversight of new efficiency standards. 3. Water Code section 10609.2, added by AB 1668, directs the State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board or Board), in coordination with the Department of Water Resources (Department), to adopt, through a regulation, standards for the efficient use of water and performance measures for commercial, industrial, and institutional water use. (Wat. Code, § 10609.2, subd. (a).) These standards, along with other standards, such as indoor residential water use standards set by the Legislature in Water Code section 10609.4, standards for water losses set by the Board pursuant to Water Code section 10608.34, and variances, guidelines and methodologies adopted by the Board, are to be used by urban retail water suppliers to set urban water use objectives. (Wat. Code, § 10609.2, subd. (e); Wat. Code, §§ 10609.12, 10609.14, 10609.16, 10609.20.) 4. Water Code section 10609, subdivision (c) established principles to apply to the development and implementation of the long-term standards and the urban water use objective, chief among them that urban retail water suppliers shall retain the flexibility to develop their water supply portfolios, design and implement water conservation strategies, educate their customers, and enforce their rules to meet their urban water use objective. 5. As part of its process for developing recommendations, the Department led 29 public meetings, seven working group workshops, and six stakeholder discussions. The Department provided recommendations to the State Water Board in November 2022. The State Water Board relied on those recommendations in developing the attached regulation. 5 of 11 Page 56 of 119](https://via.placeholder.com/768x996)

07/03/2024 BOARD MEETING – ITEM #5  
CHANGE SHEET #1 (CIRCULATED 07/03/2024)  

6. Prior to starting the official rulemaking process, the State Water Board conducted public engagement efforts to inform the framework for the regulation. Board staff hosted 12 public workshops covering an array of topics, including how the regulatory framework might specifically impact trees, parklands, and local wastewater management, and how it might impact water suppliers, communities, and the state. After the rulemaking began, the State Water Board held two public hearings, receiving 140 oral public comments, and staff held 21 working group meetings to better understand issues and concerns raised about the draft regulatory framework by interested parties. Staff also hosted 20 meetings with individual urban retail water suppliers serving disadvantaged communities. Over the course of the multiple comment periods, more than 1,000 formal comment letters were received.  

7. The California Water Supply Strategy, the California Water Plan, the Water Resilience Portfolio, and the Climate Adaptation Strategy recognize the importance of water conservationMaking Conservation a California Way of Life in safeguarding water resources and preparing California communities for more extreme drought and precipitation conditions.  

8. The standards for efficient outdoor water use are achievable now and in the future. More than 70 percent of Californians receive water from suppliers that, according to available data, are already meeting or exceeding their urban water use objectives and will through 2035, when the outdoor standards become a Landscape Efficiency Factor (LEF) of 0.63.  

Protecting Water Resources  

9. As much as 50 percent of the water applied outdoors in the urban sector is lost due to wind, evaporation, or runoff caused by inefficient irrigation methods or systems. Climate-ready landscapes can reduce dry-weather and wet-weather runoff. With deeply rooted climate-appropriate plants and soils enriched with compost and mulch, these landscapes are efficiently irrigatedrequire less irrigation and excel at slowing, spreading, and absorbing precipitation. Limiting runoff protects our water resources from harmful pesticides, nutrients, metals and bacteria, keeping them drinkable, fishable, and swimmable.  

Mitigating and Adapting to Climate Change  

10. Conserving water can reduce energy use, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions and other co-emitted air pollutants. Energy savings come primarily from avoiding energy used for extracting, conveying, treating, distributing, and

![07/03/2024 BOARD MEETING – ITEM #5 CHANGE SHEET #1 (CIRCULATED 07/03/2024)](https://via.placeholder.com/768x998.png?text=07%2F03%2F2024+BOARD+MEETING+%E2%80%93+ITEM+%235+CHANGE+SHEET+%231+%28CIRCULATED+07%2F03%2F2024%29)

the end uses of water (especially heating), as well as the energy use for collecting, treating, and discharging or reusing wastewater.

11. As plants in urban landscapes, trees can require four to ten times less water than turf and can be irrigated much more efficiently, ensuring more of the applied water reaches and is used by the plants. Expanding the urban tree canopy forest can therefore save water; it can also reduce the urban heat island effect and sequester carbon.

12. California is preparing for changing precipitation patterns, including more frequent and intense atmospheric river storms, more frequent and intense droughts, and other weather extremes. Water conservation will help California communities be more resilient to climate whiplash. In recent droughts, for example, water conservation has been shown to increase carryover storage and enhance water supply reliability.

13. Actions suppliers may take to implement the regulation could include programs to incentivize more efficiently irrigated climate-ready landscapes. In addition to the benefits noted above, climate-appropriate plants need less water in the summer and can provide more habitat for pollinators, insects, and birds. Furthermore, cultivating climate-ready landscapes with the addition of compost and mulch can build healthier soils by using organic materials that might otherwise go to landfills.

Advancing Affordability and Equity

14. Additional water conservation can, in some cases, help keep customers' future water costs more affordable, relative to what costs might be if suppliers instead invested in additional water supplies, which are often more expensive than conservation. Water conservation has been shown to make water more affordable by avoiding the need for more expensive supplies. Additional effort is needed to ensure that low-income households can benefit from water conservation programs.

15. Studies have found less tree canopy in disadvantaged communities in California cities. Expanding the urban tree canopy forest can lower water use, and water bills, as well as reduce cooling needs and costs.

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT:

1. The State Water Board adopts a new article 1 in California Code of Regulations, title 23, division 3, chapter 3.5, as appended to this resolution as a regulation, and renumbers existing articles in chapter 3.5.

2. State Water Board staff shall submit the regulation to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for review and filing with the Secretary of State.

3. If, prior to OAL filing the regulations with the Secretary of State, State Water Board staff, the State Water Board, or OAL determines that minor corrections to the language of the regulation or supporting documentation are needed for clarity or consistency, the State Water Board Executive Director or the Executive Director's designee may make such changes.

4. The State Water Board directs staff to identify frequently asked questions and broadly disseminate information regarding the regulation.

5. The State Water Board directs staff to coordinate with the Department to identify and pursue opportunities to update residential landscape area frequently and as soon as feasible, ensuring stakeholder engagement in the process. The Board recognizes the importance of landscape area data for this framework and the challenges involved in updating the data.

6. The State Water Board directs staff to consider affordability and equity when implementing the regulation. To this end, the Board further directs staff to, to the degree possible:

   a. In coordination with the Department, prioritize technical assistance and compliance support for suppliers that are struggling to meet regulatory obligations and serving areas where the majority of customers reside in disadvantaged communities. This technical assistance may include helping water agency staff understand the regulation and its requirements; providing support regarding alternative compliance; identifying possible sources of funding for the supplier’s efforts; developing or aggregating outreach and education materials; conducting analyses of the accuracy of relevant data; and evaluating whether a supplier could have qualified for any variances.

   b. Engage with suppliers and other organizations to help forge partnerships dedicated to multi-benefit water conservation projects.

CHANGE SHEET #1 (CIRCULATED 07/03/2024)

c. Assess potential equity impacts, including the benefits, of the implementation of the regulation.

d. Develop guidance for suppliers regarding strategies to support low-income households. Such strategies may include integrating conservation and low-income rate assistance programs; partnering with community-based organizations to develop or expand programs for the direct installation of water efficient fixtures, appliances, and landscapes; and changing rate structures.

7. The State Water Board will make every effort to implement the regulation in a manner that protects water resources, mitigates and adapts to climate change impacts, and accelerates nature-based solutions. To these ends, the Board directs staff to, to the degree possible:

a. Coordinate with CalRecycle to develop guidance for suppliers regarding strategies that can be used to help Californians to conserve water while also supporting local and statewide efforts to divert organic waste from landfills, improve soil health with the addition of compost and mulch, and reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants.

b. Coordinate with CalFIRE to develop guidance for suppliers regarding strategies to keep existing trees healthy, and identify climate-ready trees suitable for suppliers’ service areas, and increase the urban forest, in alignment with state goals, and coordinate with CalFIRE to provide technical assistance regarding the variance for the irrigation of existing trees.

c. Coordinate with the California Energy Commission to better integrate and leverage water and energy programs and initiatives, such as the Building Energy Benchmarking Program and the Residential Appliance Saturation Study.

d. Coordinate with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to develop guidance and strategies that help Californians conserve water while also supporting urban biodiversity.

e. Coordinate with the California Air Resources Board to better document and quantify the greenhouse gas emission reductions associated with water conservation programs and projects.

8. The State Water Board will, to the degree possible, work to streamline suppliers' data reporting by integrating relevant data, including, but not limited to, data that have been previously reported to the state. To this end, the Board directs staff to:

   a. Facilitate annual reporting by compiling and making relevant data publicly available in a machine-readable format.

   b. Evaluate the sources and quality of relevant data and develop recommendations to better facilitate data streamlining by minimizing duplicative reporting and integrating data reported through other systems and to other state agencies.

   c. Explore ways to develop an online reporting form that incorporates relevant data.

   d. To better integrate water conservation and certain supplier operations data, include in the reporting form a field where a supplier can voluntarily provide a link to analyses the supplier conducted in the course of setting fees or charges for water service, or other pertinent information.

9. The State Water Board commits to integrating urban water conservation and the goals of this regulation into other State Water Board programs, to the degree appropriate, including:

   a. Evaluating whether and how the Board could allocate funding to support water conservation efforts. Division of Financial Assistance staff should consider whether and how to incorporate conservation into Drinking Water and Clean Water Intended Use Plans, or the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund and Clean Water State Revolving Fund Policies, as appropriate.

10. With respect to suppliers' possible violations of the regulation, the State Water Board values fair, consistent, progressive, and transparent enforcement. To this end, the Board directs staff to:

   a. Consider the sequencing of actions outlined by the Legislature in Water Code section 10609.26.

   b. Consider what conservation measures the supplier is taking and whether those measures are resulting in the expected and intended savings.

   c. Consider the degree to which the supplier is taking reasonable steps to protect existing trees and whether meeting the irrigation needs of existing trees could be preventing the supplier from meeting its urban water use.
<!-- Page 62 -->
07/03/2024 BOARD MEETING – ITEM #5  
CHANGE SHEET #1 (CIRCULATED 07/03/2024)  

objective. Consider the degree to which the supplier is using or is eligible to use the variances and provisions available, including the variance for the irrigation of existing trees.  

d. Consider the degree to which the supplier is taking reasonable steps to assist and support conservation investments for disadvantaged communities and low-income households.  

11. Unless and until directed otherwise, staff shall bring periodic information items to the Board describing the progress staff have made in carrying out the actions identified in this resolution and summarizing the progress suppliers have made in calculating and meeting urban water objectives and carrying out CII performance measures.  

12. By December 2028, staff shall bring an information item to the Board describing any compliance actions taken and recommend whether the Board should adopt a policy or guidelines establishing enforcement procedures for the conservation program, present at a Board meeting an update on progress made under the regulations and across the state, coupled with a proposed strategy, developed following public engagement, for Board consideration to prioritize compliance and enforcement actions, recognizing the efforts undertaken by that time to make conservation a California way of life.  

13. Nothing in the regulation or in the enforcement provisions of the regulation precludes a local agency from exercising its authority to adopt more stringent conservation measures. Local agencies are encouraged to develop their own progressive enforcement practices to promote conservation.  

CERTIFICATION  
The undersigned Clerk to the State Water Board does hereby certify that the foregoing is a full, true, and correct copy of a resolution duly and regularly adopted at a meeting of the State Water Resources Control Board held on July 3, 2024.

# AGENDA ITEM V.3

**REGULAR Board Meeting on July 15, 2024**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tom R. Gray  
**Date:** July 10, 2024  
**Subject:** Update and Discussion on reconciling the main replacement agreement between the FOWD and FORPD  

**Recommendation:**  
No staff recommendation – information only.

**Discussion:**  
In July of 2021, the FORPD Board of Directors and FOWD Board of Directors reached a conceptual agreement to relocate public water facilities that will be impacted by planned improvements to the Village Park area.

In accordance with direction from the FOWD Board, FOWD staff worked with FORPD staff to develop a formal agreement to complete the required public water improvements. The FOWD Board approved a capital improvement expense not to exceed $260,000 – with $158,000 included in the 2022 budget and $102,000 funded from FOWD cash reserves.

In exchange for this investment on behalf of the FORPD, the FOWD was to receive a future water well site that was detailed in the agreement.

For reasons that benefited both the FORPD and FOWD, the project scope expanded resulting in an additional cost of $106,706 to complete the public water infrastructure installed with the FORPD project.

FORPD staff have rejected FOWD’s request for the final payment of $106,706.

To continue successful collaboration on behalf of the community of Fair Oaks, FOWD staff recommended that the FOWD Board approve splitting the outstanding $106,706 cost between the two agencies and close the project.

At a public FOWD Board meeting held on June 17, 2024 the FOWD Board authorized the General Manager to finalize negotiations to split the outstanding project cost balance of $106,706 equally between the Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) and Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District.

At a public FORPD Board meeting held on June 26, 2024 the FORPD Board approved the offer to split the outstanding project cost balance of $106,706 equally between the Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) and Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District.

Date: July 9, 2024  
Subject: Update and discussion on the proposed merger of the SJWD and SSWD  

**Recommendation:**  
No staff recommendation – information item.

**Discussion:**  
In 2011 the San Juan Water District (SJWD) and Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) approved the investigation and analysis of merging the two agencies.

In June of 2015 the two agencies agreed to stop further merger discussions.

In March and April of 2024 the SJWD Board and SSWD Board approved restarting the SJWD and SSWD Merger Project.

A joint SJWD and SSWD Board meeting was held on June 25, 2024 to discuss the SJWD and SSWD Merger Project.

A second joint SJWD and SSWD Board meeting has been scheduled for July 13, 2024 to continue discussions on the SJWD and SSWD Merger Project.

Dear President Zamorano and President Thomas:

Based on statements made at recent meetings of the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) and San Juan Water District (SJWD) Boards of Directors, it is our understanding that the Districts are going to restart discussions of a proposed merger of the two Districts. Given the potential direct impacts of a merger on Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) ratepayers, FOWD is committed to participating in these discussions to ensure that our ratepayers are aware of the SJWD merger discussions with the SSWD and the potential effects on FOWD water rates and related interests.

Though FOWD has never taken a position on the potential merger of the SJWD and SSWD, we did submit written comments and concerns on behalf of our ratepayers during the prior merger discussions. We are happy to resubmit those comments, and look forward to the Districts’ responses and learning more about how the concerns will be addressed. We request the opportunity to work through those concerns and questions directly with us as part of your process.

The FOWD hopes that the proposed merger analysis will include reasonable and collaborative interaction between all potentially impacted Agencies. We look forward to working with the SSWD and SJWD boards and assigned staff on meeting the objectives of your proposed merger analysis.

**Important Information for Fair Oaks Water District Customers**

**"Merger of Local Water Districts Proposed"**

The San Juan Water District is researching a possible merger with the Sacramento Suburban Water District. The plan to merge may be proposed to local regulators very soon. The San Juan Water District was founded by the Fair Oaks Water District, Citrus Heights Water District and Orange Vale Water Company to manage, operate and maintain surface water for the customers of a specifically defined area. The San Juan Water District currently has a defined service area that includes the customers of the Fair Oaks Water District, Citrus Heights Water District, Orange Vale Water Company, along with Granite Bay and limited areas within the City of Folsom. The planned merger would effectively double the current area served by the San Juan Water District using surface water facilities paid for by existing customers. Given this fact, the Board of Directors of the Fair Oaks Water District believes that it is very important that you are made aware of the planned merger, have access to information on the proposed merger and understand how you may express your ratepayer’s position on the proposed merger.

- Information on the proposed merger has been made available at [www.sjwd.org](http://www.sjwd.org)
- While concerned, the FOWD Board of Directors has not yet taken a position to support or oppose the merger, awaiting response to requests for additional details
- Comment letters on the proposed merger can be sent to: Fair Oaks Water District at 10326 Fair Oaks Boulevard, Fair Oaks, CA 95628 – Attention SJWD & SSWD Merger (a copy of all letters will be filed and the original forwarded to the official merger committee)

**Merger Discussion Issues for Fair Oaks Water District Customers**

- Availability of Water Supply
- Cost of Water Supply
- Water Rights
- Elected Representation
- Over $100,000,000 of debt

If you have any questions for your Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) staff regarding the proposed merger of the San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District, please contact the FOWD office at 916-967-5723. Please Note that your Fair Oaks Water District currently has no debt and has invested over 35% of every ratepayer dollar back into water system improvements for the past ten years!

**AGENDA ITEM V.5**  
**REGULAR Board Meeting on July 15, 2024**  

To: Board of Directors  
From: Tom R. Gray  
Date: July 8, 2024  
Subject: Update and discussion on the proposed SJWD 2024 transfer of Pre-1914 Water Right Water outside of the SJWD Wholesale Service Area  

**Recommendation:**  
No staff recommendation - information only.  

**Discussion:**  
The highest priority surface water rights in the State of California are referred to as “Pre-1914,” because they were claimed before the State Water Resources Control Board was formed in 1914, and thus are less regulated by the State Water Board. In general terms, Pre-1914 Water Right Water is the most reliable and valuable water in all of California.  

On behalf of the FOWD ratepayers, the Board of Directors has directed staff to make protecting ratepayer access to Pre-1914 Water Right Water made available through the SJWD a top priority.  

Attached are documents related to recent actions taken by both the FOWD and CHWD to protect our ratepayers access to Water Right Water that is owned by the existing SJWD wholesale service area ratepayers.  

**Policy Implications:**  
TBD  

**Fiscal Impact:**  
TBD

Re: Initial Study and Negative Declaration for 2024 Conserved Water Transfer of Pre-1914 Water Rights water to Sacramento Suburban Water District project  

Dear Mr. Zlotnick:  

Citrus Heights Water District (“Citrus Heights”) received San Juan Water District’s (“SJWD”) Notice of Intent to adopt a Negative Declaration for its proposed 2024 Conserved Water Transfer of Pre-1914 Water Rights water to Sacramento Suburban Water District (“Project”). Through the Project, SJWD proposes the transfer and sale of up to 6,000 AF of pre-1914 water rights water to Sacramento Suburban Water District (“SSWD”) between August 1, 2024 through February 28, 2025 (“Project”). Citrus Heights submits these comments in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”) and the other areas of law and policy addressed below.  

**CEQA Comments**  
Historically, SJWD does not appear to have conducted any substantive CEQA review for its previous transfers of pre-1914 water rights water to SSWD. It thus appears that SJWD’s decision to prepare the Initial Study and Negative Declaration (“IS/ND”) is in response to Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks Water District’s 2023 legal challenge to SJWD’s illegal delegation of authority regarding the water transfers, and Citrus Heights’ April 22 and 23, 2024 comments objecting to SJWD’s contemplated use of an exemption for the Project. Although Citrus Heights appreciates SJWD’s attempt to comply with CEQA, the IS/ND is legally insufficient and fails to satisfy CEQA’s mandate to fully inform the public and decision-makers about the environmental consequences of the Project.  

**Inaccurate Project Description**  
Every CEQA project must be adequately described. (Stopthemillenniumhollywood.com v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 1, 16.) “[A]n accurate description of the project is necessary in order to decide what kind of environmental impact statement need be prepared.”

(County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192-194.) An accurate and complete project description is “necessary for an intelligent evaluation of the potential environmental impacts of the agency’s action. ‘Only through an accurate view of the project may affected outsiders and public decision-makers balance the proposal’s benefit against its environmental cost, consider mitigation measures, … and weigh other alternatives in the balance.’” (City of Redlands v. County of San Bernardino (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 398, 406.) In determining the adequacy of the Project’s description, “the governing principal is whether the project description may have thwarted the public’s ability to participate in the process and comment meaningfully on the [environmental review document]. Inadequate or unstable descriptions … may mislead the public and thwart” the CEQA process. (Save Our Capitol! v. Dept. of General Services (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 655, 673.)  

Here, the Project description is both inaccurate and incomplete. The IS/ND states repeatedly that the transfer is temporary or short-term and relies on the allegedly temporary short term nature of the Project as the basis for its no impact conclusions. (E.g., IS/ND, pp.8, 10, 12, 17, 18, 20.) The Project, however, is neither temporary nor short-term. SJWD has been transferring pre-1914 water rights water to SSWD on a yearly basis since at least 2020. (See SWD Proposed Budget FY 2024-2025, p. 37 (June 26, 2024 SJWD Board packet).) Transfers that have been occurring on a yearly basis for at least four years are not temporary or short-term, making the Project description factually inaccurate.  

The Project description is also incomplete because it omits any mention of the prior yearly transfers. This omission misleads the public into thinking that the proposed Project is a “one-off,” rather than the yearly transfer that it actually is.  

The failure to accurately describe the Project directly translates into a failure to accurately identify and disclose the Project’s potentially significant direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts as well as potentially significant cumulative impacts. The IS/ND must be revised to accurately describe the Project and a new initial study must be prepared to analyze impacts from the accurately-described Project.  

Illegal Piecemealing  
CEQA’s “requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces, which individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the environment …” (Plan for Arcadia, Inc. v. City Council of Arcadia (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 712, 726.) Instead, CEQA requires evaluation of the “whole of the action.” (CEQA Guidelines § 15378, subd. (a).)  

The whole of the action here is a long-term water transfer—not a temporary, short term transfer as the IS/ND mischaracterizes it. The IS/ND must be revised to analyze the potentially significant environmental impacts that would result from the long-term yearly transfers of pre-1914 water rights water.

There is a fair argument the Project may have significant impacts on the environment

CEQA creates a “low threshold” for preparation of an environmental impact report. (Preserve Poway v. City of Poway (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 560, 575-576.) SJWD may rely on a negative declaration only if there is “no substantial evidence, in light of the whole record ... that the project may have a significant effect on the environment.” (Public Resources Code § 21080, subd. (c)(1); see also, CEQA Guidelines § 15070, subd. (a).) If there is a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the lead agency shall prepare an EIR. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064, subd. (f)(1).)

The IS/ND implicitly concludes that the Project would have no impacts whatsoever on the environment. However, the discussion of Project impacts is both cursory and conclusory, with no supporting evidence. Expert reports from hydrologists, biologists and other experts are necessary to analyze the Project’s direct, reasonably foreseeable indirect and cumulative impacts on sensitive hydrological and biological resources. Yet, SJWD did not conduct any expert studies and so there is no evidence to support SJWD’s conclusion that the Project will have no impacts on the environment. SJWD has an obligation to investigate and it cannot simply refuse to conduct feasible studies and then declare, without any substantial evidence, that there will be no impacts. Citrus Heights requests that SJWD conduct the necessary hydrological and biological studies (as well as any other necessary studies) and make them available to Citrus Heights and the public. The IS/ND should be re-done after these necessary studies have been completed.

As noted above, a negative declaration may only be adopted if there is no substantial evidence that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. The IS/ND, with its lack of any meaningful and substantive analysis or expert reports, does not meet this standard. The IS/ND also asserts—again without evidentiary support—that the Project will have beneficial impacts on groundwater recharge. But “[a]ny potential significant effect triggers the EIR requirement, even if” the Project would “provide a ‘net’ or overall positive for the environment.” (Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1197.)

Even worse, the no impacts conclusion is largely based on the false premise that the transfer is temporary and short term (IS/ND, pp. 8, 10, 12, 17, 18, 20). This premise in turn derives from the inaccurate and incomplete Project description. The inaccurate Project description—which omits the crucial fact that these are actually long-term yearly transfers— precludes disclosure and analysis of the Project’s impacts on the environment, particularly its potentially significant cumulative impacts and potentially direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect significant impacts on biological resources, hydrology, population and housing, growth inducement and utilities. This could lead to increased reliance on surface water, which could also result in significant direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts and cumulative impacts, particularly to biological and hydrological resources. Because the IS/ND omits critical information about the Project, the public is not able to meaningfully comment on the Project and its potentially significant environmental impacts.

In short, the IS/ND’s omission of information necessary for informed public participation and informed decision-making thwarts CEQA’s statutory purpose and constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion. (Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line Construction Authority (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 463.) SJWD must revise the IS/ND to accurately define the Project as a long-term series of yearly water transfers and conduct new analysis and investigation of potentially significant impacts that could result from these transfers.

**Financial Impacts of the Proposed Transfer**

Citrus Heights remains confounded by the alleged financial benefits to wholesale of the proposed transfer of pre-1914 water supplies to SSWD. During the SJWD April 24, 2024 SJWD Board meeting, one or more SJWD Directors alleged that Citrus Heights would receive an approximate $400,000 benefit through SJWD’s receipt of $1.1 million in payments from SSWD for the Project. (See SJWD Board meeting minutes 4/24/24, p. 5.) However, this allegation is contrary to SJWD’s own staff report. (See SJWD 4/24/24 Board packet, Staff Report for Agenda Item W-3, p. 2.) That staff report states that while the gross revenue from the sale of 4,000 acre feet to SSWD would be $1,060,000, the net revenue (aka, the profit) would amount to only $36.82 per acre foot, or $147,000, after wheeling and treatment costs are deducted. The staff report is confusing in that it also states the net revenue to SJWD would be only $40,160 for 4,000 acre feet. Regardless of whether the alleged net “profit” to wholesale from the proposed sale to SSWD is $147,000 or $40,160, it certainly does not equate to a $400,000 wholesale benefit to Citrus Heights, as alleged by SJWD’s Directors. And, it is also unclear whether SJWD staff time and CEQA document preparation costs are included in the net figures, thus further reducing any alleged financial benefit of the transaction. Moreover, it is also not clear how the proposed charges to SSWD conform to SJWD’s new wholesale water rates, thus driving further questions about whether there is any “profit” at all associated with the water sale.

**Conclusion**

From the perspective of Citrus Heights, the proposed transfer of pre-1914 water to SSWD is not worth the alleged financial benefit, if it generates any “profit” at all, particularly given the exposure created for SJWD on the deficient CEQA documentation and the potential erosion of the pre-1914 water rights in favor of the wholesale customer agencies. Citrus Heights has repeatedly shared that SJWD should focus on delivering pre-1914 and 1928 water supplies to the wholesale customer agencies, so that we may enjoy the reliability, low cost and other benefits of the water rights acquired with the foresight and at the sole expense of customers of the wholesale service area.

If SSJWD needs further surface water supplies, the family may be able to assist in that effort through transfer of excess SJWD Central Valley Project and Placer County Water Agency supplies to SSJWD or finding other supplies to provide to SSJWD.

# AGENDA ITEM VI.1
**REGULAR Board Meeting July 15, 2024**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Siebensohn  
**Date:** July 10, 2024  
**Subject:** Discussion on FOWD Water Supply for the month of June 2024  

---

**Recommendation:**  
None.

**Discussion:**  
According to the Accuweather.com website, the recorded average daily temperature in June 2024 was 75.5° F, which is 4.0 degrees above the historic average of 71.5° F for June. Precipitation for June 2024 was recorded at 0.00” according to the Department of Water Resources Chicago rain station located in Fair Oaks.

The wholesale connections provided 1,155.76 AC-FT (92.46%) of surface water and FOWD groundwater wells produced 94.19 AC-FT (7.54%) to meet the total water demand of 1,249.95 AC-FT.

A graph of total consumption to date versus projected budget target is found in Exhibit A.

A graph of groundwater and surface water use in 2024 to date is found in Exhibit B.

Both the FO-40 and CTP wholesale connections remained open to provide surface water supply to the District.

According to the data provided by SJWD, the recorded volumes from wholesale connections are:

| Connection | Forward Flow, AC-FT | Reverse Flow, AC-FT | Total, AC-FT |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| CTP        | 662.87               | 0.00                | 662.87        |
| FO-40 (39°)| 492.89               | 0.00                | 492.89        |
| **TOTAL FROM SJWD** | **1,155.76** | **0.00** | **1,155.76** |

The average daily flow from wholesale connections for the month of June 2024 was recorded at 8,693 GPM.

The maximum day water demand was reached on June 30, 2024, and was recorded at approximately 15.06 million gallons (MG) with the wholesale connections providing 14.56 MG and FOWD groundwater wells providing 0.50 MG. The minimum day water demand was recorded on June 3, 2024, at 12.01 MG. The average day demand was calculated at 13.54 MG.

The 10-year total average water use for the month of June is 1,162.68 AC-FT and June 2013 total water demand was recorded at 1,495.23 AC-FT. The June 2024 total water demand of 1,249.95 AC-FT represents an increase of 7.51% from the June 10-year average, a 16.40% decrease from June 2013 consumption, and a 16.04% increase from 2023 consumption.
<!-- Page 81 -->
During the month of June 2024, all wells performed in accordance with the approved operations plan.

The Skyway Tank and Booster Station operated within normal parameters and in accordance with the seasonal operational schedule.

The production breakdown per groundwater source for the month of June 2024 was:

- Town Well – 30.29 AC-FT
- Heather Well – 37.81 AC-FT
- Northridge Well – 4.30 AC-FT
- Madison Well – 21.79 AC-FT
- Skyway Well – 0.00 AC-FT

**TOTAL GROUNDWATER** 94.19 AC-FT

A graph of the production of each well to date may be found in Exhibit D.

The water distribution system and water supply facilities performed within design parameters during June. District staff produced water supply in accordance with FOWD Board direction for all of June 2024.

A graph of water consumption per month for 2013, 2023, and 2024 with average trendline is displayed in Exhibit C.

**Fiscal Impact:**
None.

**Policy Implications:**
None.

Discussion and possible action on the required payment of the employer accrued unfunded liability for pension benefits  

*Page 86 of 119*  
<!-- Page 87 -->
# AGENDA ITEM VI.2  
**REGULAR Board Meeting on July 15, 2024**  

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tom R. Gray, General Manager  
**Date:** July 9, 2024  
**Subject:** Discussion and possible action on the required payment of the employer accrued unfunded liability for pension benefits  

## Staff Recommendations:  
Authorize payment of $291,917 to CalPERS for the employer accrued unfunded liability for the fiscal year 2024-2025.  

## Discussion:  
Attached are the invoices from CalPERS for the employer required contribution of the unfunded accrued liability starting July 2024. CalPERS billing consists of two components to the employer required contribution, an annual fixed amount of $301,679 (prepayment amount is $291,917 [$288,598 + $3,319]) and the employer normal cost rate (11.88% of the payroll amount) for the classic members (7.87% of the payroll amount) for PEPRA members. Prepayment saves FOWD $9,762 in fiscal year 2024-2025.  

At the July 13, 2015 FOWD Board meeting, the Board elected to make annual payments. A payment of $291,917 needs to be paid by July 31, 2024.  

## Policy Implications:  
None.  

## Fiscal Impact:  
The District has budgeted for this employer accrued unfunded liability amount in the 2024 Annual Budget.

**Miscellaneous Plan of the Fair Oaks Water District (CalPERS ID: 7635333358)**  
**Annual Valuation Report as of June 30, 2022**  

Dear Employer,  

Attached to this letter is the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation report for the rate plan noted above. Provided in this report is the determination of the minimum required employer contributions for fiscal year (FY) 2024-25. In addition, the report contains important information regarding the current financial status of the plan as well as projections and risk measures to aid in planning for the future.  

Because this plan is in a risk pool, the following valuation reports have been separated into two sections:  
- Section 1 contains specific information for the plan including the development of the current and projected employer contributions, and  
- Section 2 contains the Risk Pool Actuarial Valuation appropriate to the plan as of June 30, 2022.  

Section 2 can be found on the CalPERS website (www.calpers.ca.gov). From the home page, go to "Forms & Publications" and select "View All". In the search box, enter "Risk Pool" and from the results list download the Miscellaneous Risk Pool Actuarial Valuation Report for June 30, 2022.  

Actuarial valuations are based on assumptions regarding future plan experience including investment return and payroll growth, eligibility for the types of benefits provided, and longevity among retirees. The CalPERS Board of Administration (board) adopts these assumptions after considering the advice of CalPERS actuarial and investment teams and other professionals. Each actuarial valuation reflects all prior differences between actual and assumed experience and adjusts the contribution requirements as needed. This valuation is based on an investment return assumption of 6.8%, which was adopted by the board in November 2021. Other assumptions used in this report are those recommended in the CalPERS Experience Study and Review of Actuarial Assumptions report from November 2021.  

**Required Contributions**  

The table below shows the minimum required employer contributions for FY 2024-25 along with estimates of the required contributions for FY 2025-26. Employee contributions other than cost sharing (whether paid by the employer or the employee) are in addition to the results shown below. The required employer contributions in this report do not reflect any cost sharing arrangement between the agency and the employees.  

| Fiscal Year | Employer Normal Cost Rate | Employer Amortization of Unfunded Accrued Liability |  
|-------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|  
| 2024-25     | 11.88%                    | $298,249                                            |  
| **Projected Results** |                           |                                                     |  
| 2025-26     | 11.9%                     | $353,000                                           |
