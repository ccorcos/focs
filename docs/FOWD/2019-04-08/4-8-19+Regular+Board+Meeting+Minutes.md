   - General Manager Gray provided an update on the water services to 5442 Hazel Avenue. He presented two possible solutions.

The second option is to tap into the main, requiring it to be replaced per the original conditions placed on the contractor. FOWD offered a cost sharing of 50% if the second option is pursued.
