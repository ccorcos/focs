   - General Manager Gray summarized the Board’s decision from the August 15, 2022, Board Meeting.  
   - SJWD General Manager Helliker mentioned they would like to be as prepared as possible during the duration of the project. A direct mailer was sent to the wholesale service area in early August to inform the public of SJWD’s plans and provide an update.

SJWD’s emergency response plan must be in place before this date. SJWD would like to have the mailer done by the 7th or 8th of October.
