IV. PRESENTATION & CORRESPONDENCE  

1. Presentation by Dominic Figueroa from the nonprofit organization "Californians for Safe Drinking Water and a Clean and Reliable Water Supply"  
   - Mr. Figueroa spoke about the scope of the bond proposed under Proposition 3 on the November ballot. He gave a presentation citing who is supporting this and noted fund allocation would be through the Department of Water Resources. Mr. Figueroa noted that state-wide support is looking good and he is asking for the endorsement of FOWD.  
   - Director McRae noted water conservation has been a big issue regionally and that is included in this bond. He asked if there is any consideration given to local communities already financing efforts to meet safe drinking water standards. Could it relieve a financial burden on a city?  
   - General Manager Gray said the main driver for this bond is to find funding and serve underprivileged areas to have access to safe drinking water.  
   - President Marx noted he will not participate in this discussion as he is part of the Sacramento State University Office of Water Programs that would receive funds.  
   - Director Sarkovich asked if there is any official opposition. He asked if RWA has taken a position, as FOWD is part of that coalition. He noted that ACWA is shown to endorse it.  
   - Mr. Figueroa says there is no official opposition. He said he has not approached the RWA yet.  
   - General Manager Gray offered to present information and to take a poll at the RWA meeting on this coming Thursday to see if they have a response to this bond or would like a presentation. Depending on response they will inform Mr. Figueroa of interest.  
   - Director Sarkovich asked why seek FOWD support versus go to the larger water agencies. He said it is up to the public to decide, but he would be 100% behind supporting water infrastructure.  
   - Mr. Figueroa said it helps to have local support shown for voters.

V. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: OLD BUSINESS

1. Update and discussion on Regional Water Authority (RWA) Lobbying Subscription Program activities
   - General Manager Gray shared there was a meeting last week that he did not attend but he noted RWA is recruiting for a new program manager for the lobbying program.
   - President Marx said he would be attending the upcoming meeting and would provide updates.

2. Update and discussion on the Fair Oaks 40 Pipeline Relining Project (Fair Oaks 40 Phase II Project)
   - General Manager Gray shared information on the costs. No new action on awarding the bid. The low bid, with contingency, for FOWD portion is around three million dollars.

3. Update and discussion on FOWD Information Technology and SCADA Projects
   - General Manager Gray shared information that the project is up and running. He gave thanks to Operations Manager Nisenboym and staff for their efforts. He also noted FOWD is working with a consultant currently on technology projects and staffing discussions, such as whether to hire a replacement for the IT position or contract it out. The migration to cloud computing also is underway.

4. Update and discussion on the 2018 Water Transfer Project
   - General Manager Gray noted as of Saturday, July 7, 2018, FOWD is the only agency out of the American River group pumping for water transfer. FOWD is using pre-1914 water rights. He stated the delay in groundwater pumping will cost FOWD about $80,000. FOWD is monitoring for any water quality and water pressure issues or customer impact.
   - Vice President McRae asked about the time period for such pumping.
   - General Manager Gray said it was scheduled from about July 1, 2018 to the end of September, which cannot be pushed out. He noted there is discussion about strategic planning for future sales.
   - Director Page complemented SJWD General Manager Helliker on the agreement, but also asked if FOWD could transfer water using rights to Aerojet water. General Manager Helliker said maybe next year they could talk.

VI. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: NEW BUSINESS

1. Discussion and possible action on the required payment of the employer accrued unfunded liability for CalPERS pension benefits
   - General Manager Gray referred to the staff recommendations and the July 13, 2015 Board decision to make annual payments to CalPERS for employer accrued unfunded liability for pension benefits. This year’s annual payment to be authorized is $107,388.
<!-- Page 4 -->
- Director Sarkovich noted that by pre-paying annually versus monthly, it saves about $4,000 per year.

Director Sarkovich moved to approve the annual payment for fiscal year 2018-2019.

Director Page seconded the motion.

Motion carried with the following votes: Marx – aye, McRae – aye, Page – aye and Sarkovich – aye

2. Update and discussion on FOWD water supply for the month of June 2018
- Operations Manager Nisenboym reported average temperature in June was about normal for historic average. FOWD total system demand from all sources for the month of June was recorded at 1,179 AC-FT. The San Juan wholesale connections provided 936 AC-FT and groundwater wells produced 243 AC-FT of the total water demand. No problems in June. CTP connection is the only wholesale connection. The June 2018 total demand represents a decrease of 12.8% from the June 10-year average and a 21.1% reduction from June 2013. Total groundwater production was 243 AC-FT for the month.
- Vice President McRae asked about next month and if FOWD is meeting water demands.
- General Manager Gray said FOWD is looking at how to make up for delay of start in July of groundwater pumping for sale. He said FOWD can meet about 50% of demand with groundwater supply. The new normal is about 28% below 2013 baseline demands.

3. Discussion on the scope of work for the FOWD Transmission Main Replacement Project
- General Manager Gray presented a staff report and referred to a Board directive from 2017 to master plan the major transmission mains that run East to West across the FOWD water system. The recommendation is to seek from qualified consultants to complete a T-Main Master Plan.
- Director Sarkovich asked about consultant costs for this review and what is involved with hydraulic modeling.
- General Manager Gray estimates it will be in excess of six figures for the analysis and modeling. He offered to send it out to bid and review results with the Board, noting FOWD already has one consultant with the needed experience. Hydraulic modeling allows FOWD to turn off wells and create levels of demand to predict system reactions. The system was built as a surface water system, so an analysis of increased groundwater pumping needs to be included along with changed customer demand.
- Vice President McRae wants the phased approach to help plan funding. He also asked if any work over Hazel bridge or capacity for that part would be part of it?
- General Manager Gray said Hazel is a separate project. The ability to move water to other agency areas or to downsize are alternatives to consider along with their related costs.
