III. CONSENT CALENDAR

The following consent calendar items were considered and acted upon as follows:
1. Approval of Minutes
   a. Regular Board Meeting of October 21, 2024
   b. Special Board Meeting of October 28, 2024
2. Accept and File Treasurer’s Report for the month of October 2024
3. File Investment Report for the month of September 2024

6. Approval of Cal-Card Statements for the month of October 2024
7. Approval of Board Expense Report for the month of October 2024

- Director McRae inquired about the rate increase for both liability and auto insurance. He suggested that FOWD compare to other insurance companies, including self-insurance.
- General Manager Gray stated that rates have increased, and additional funding will be requested to cover those expenses. ACWA JPIA is a self-insurance pool with all the other water agencies to reduce overall costs. FOWD staff can do the price comparison, but in general, ACWA JPIA has the lowest cost. He also noted the value of the cyber insurance ACWA JPIA offers.
- SJWD Board Member Tobin stated that ACWA JPIA has the lowest insurance rates. There is no need to reinvent the wheel as they can provide FOWD with price comparisons.

   - Information only. General Manager Gray provided an overview and reported on the election results.
   - Director Sarkovich stated he would like the Corporate Yard Project to be completed in the next two years. He believes FOWD should do a better job at communicating what vote by division means.

He would like the banners to stay up to make people aware.
   - SJWD General Manager Helliker congratulated FOWD Board on the election results. He visited the Sacramento County website and stated that the current results are only showing 91% of the votes; there are still 60,000 ballots left to count.

**V. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: OLD BUSINESS**  
1. Update and discussion on the New York Water Main Replacement Project Phase I  
   General Manager Gray provided an update and overview.  

**VI. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: NEW BUSINESS**  
1. Discussion and possible action on FOWD Resolution No. 24-03: “A Resolution of the Board of Directors of the Fair Oaks Water District Opposing the Proposed Merger of the San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District”  
   - General Manager Gray provided an overview and read the resolution.  
   - President Petersen suggested modifying item #4 to “insufficient to protect” instead of “do not protect.”  
   - General Manager Gray suggested “may be insufficient to protect.”  
   - President Petersen agreed to modifying item #4 to “may be insufficient to protect.”  
   - Director McRae stated that item #7 of our resolution is speaking for FOWD and CHWD. He asked if the resolution should be limited to only the FOWD Board.  
   - General Manager Gray stated no because it was purposeful. The resolution was developed in consultation with CHWD. We believe CHWD will take action on a similar resolution very quickly after FOWD. The purpose of common wording is to demonstrate that it’s the majority of SJWD customers that oppose the merger and that is a powerful statement.  
   - Director Sarkovich inquired that assuming FOWD passes the resolution, can the item be added to SJWD’s agenda for the SJWD December 18, 2024 meeting when Director McRae is there to discuss the resolution and potential action to stop the merger; stop the waste of money?  
   - SJWD Board Member Tobin agreed to propose that this item be added to SJWD’s agenda.  
   - SJWD General Manager Helliker stated that any Board Member may propose to have an item added to the agenda, one of our Board Members plans to do so, and it will be added to the agenda.  
   - Director Marx stated that there are other concerns with SSWD’s debt and water quality. These did not make it into the resolution, but that may be because it’s not meant to be comprehensive to all the issues.  
   - General Manager Gray responded that FOWD wanted to keep it general and focused on the majority of FOWD customers who don’t want the merger.  
   - SJWD General Manager Helliker provided his response on the proposed FOWD Resolution No. 24-03. First, he addressed the statement in the resolution that states significant components of the merger are unknown, and additional analysis is not necessary. He commented that SJWD had two reports as part of preparation for merger discussions completed in 2015 and they were not comprehensive. SJWD Board disagrees that additional analysis is not necessary. It’s clearly necessary and the next phase.
<!-- Page 5 -->
- Second, General Manager Helliker addressed item #2 of the resolution that it would benefit all SJWD customers to immediately stop spending additional resources. He stated that to make any kind of determination about what the pros and cons are, a business case analysis is necessary. The SJWD Board has decided that to get that information, a business case analysis is needed. SJWD Board represent all customers and the business case analysis was their choice. He stated that we disagree with the second item in the resolution.
- Third, SJWD General Manager Helliker addressed the statement in the resolution that the merger between SJWD and SSWD would result in a loss of control. He stated that every individual Board Member represents the interests of all the voters in the community services district. No matter where they are elected, they are representing all customers in the SJWD. That’s another inaccurate statement that there is any loss of control.
- Fourth, SJWD General Manager Helliker addressed the statement in the resolution that existing agreements do not protect water rights water. He stated that these agreements will not change unless there is mutual agreement between FOWD and SJWD or whatever the water district will be with the merger. So, protections are in these agreements which give FOWD and the wholesale water agencies the first call on all water supply. Not just water rights water, all water supply. That first call will not change. Again, the item is not correct.
- Fifth, SJWD General Manager Helliker addressed the statement in the resolution that potential benefits of a merger are not worth the long-term impacts of sharing water with SSWD. He stated that SJWD shares water with SSWD now and that it benefits FOWD. Every time SJWD transfers water to SSWD, first SJWD has to meet FOWD needs and second, SJWD needs to get FOWD statement that SJWD has met FOWD needs. Any revenue SJWD generates by transfers to SSWD or to any, come back to SJWD and they offset FOWD costs. That’s built into the water supply agreement with FOWD and SJWD can’t do anything differently.
- Sixth, SJWD General Manager Helliker addressed the statement in the resolution that the potential benefits of a merger can be obtained through collaborative operations and agreements. He asked how do we know that? How does FOWD know that? SJWD has not done a business case analysis and has not looked at what the benefits or costs may be. At this point, not sure how FOWD can conclude that is the case, that the benefits can be obtained through collaborative operations and agreements rather than a merger.
- Lastly, General Manager Helliker stated that to Director McRae’s comment, he has asked CHWD if they could give him any resolution that they have adopted that matches this (FOWD resolution) to comport with what FOWD is asserting and they don’t have one. So, at this point this last statement (in FOWD resolution) is not accurate. The CHWD Board of Directors has not made any statement about this. They have not stated they support this resolution. That statement in and of itself is false. Recommending that FOWD not adopt the resolution because many parts of it are not correct.
- General Manager Gray responded to SJWD General Manager Helliker’s comments that in general, it is somewhat disrespectful to stand up in front of our Board and say they are wrong in stating how they feel about something. He stated that SJWD

<!-- Page 7 -->
- SJWD Board Member Tobin stated that ACWA is the acronym for Association of California Water Agencies. The association represents over 470 public water agencies in the state of California and SJWD Board Member Tobin provided an overview.
- SJWD General Manager Helliker commented that the question of what would be the structure of a new organization is undecided at this point. There are a couple of options with one of the proposed being reorganization and the one in the study recommended that San Juan annex SSWD once SSWD is dissolved. These options are part of the business case analysis to look at best alternatives. The SJWD Board believes they need that analysis to be able to determine whether or not there are benefits that would be worth considering. There are many steps even after LAFCO receives the resolutions for the merger from SJWD and SSWD.
- Director Tobin stated that she is on the Advisory Committee of LAFCO and there are many ways of doing this. To throw any item at the wall to see if it sticks is not really a good option.
- General Manager Gray stated that the current proposed merger has been stated as a continuation of the original process (2015). The primary driver for the merger was water supply reliability and currently, the merger is being called a continuation, but he was told directly that water supply reliability has nothing to do with the current needs. How can SJWD continue the process that has been proposed process? If water supply reliability is a key objective of the proposed merger, in the words of SJWD staff, FOWD and CHWD get no benefit from that.
- SJWD General Manager Helliker responded that he would send the scope of work to FOWD. Water supply and reliability is one of the topics covered as well as all other aspects of SJWD operations. It’s a complete analysis of both organizations. In 2013, 2014 and 2015 we were in one of the worst droughts on record and there was a focus on water supply reliability, but that’s just one component of the current analysis.
- Director McRae stated that one big concern is this opens a pandoras box and there are so many unknowns. We don’t know how it will turn out. Bottom line is FOWD has no protection for water, voting strength and water finances. The new merged entity could possibly come up with creative ways to pay off debt and currently, FOWD is debt free. He is really worried about taking on someone else’s debt and not willing to roll the dice that it turns out good. Director Sarkovich stated that he was opposed to the merger in 2015 and is opposed today. In his book, nothing has changed.
- Director Sarkovich moved to approve the FOWD Resolution No. 24-03 as amended.
- Director McRae seconded the motion.
- Motion carried with the following votes: Dolby – aye, Marx – aye, McRae – aye, Petersen – aye, and Sarkovich – aye.

2. Discussion and possible action on the approval of an updated FOWD Salary Schedule
- General Manager Gray provided an overview of the proposed salary schedule. He noted there are three new positions listed and provided an overview of their duties. He stated that having these positions listed does not mean they will all be filled. 

Page 7 of 12
<!-- Page 8 -->
![Page 8 of 12](attachment://image.png)

This is an adjustment to the salary schedule, potentially filling these positions and diversifying the workforce without adding any extra employees. Position descriptions for the Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer will be developed by FOWD staff.
- General Manager Gray addressed questions from the Board and the public.

Director Sarkovich moved to approve the updated FOWD Salary Schedule as presented.

President Petersen seconded the motion.

Motion carried with the following votes: Dolby – aye, Marx – aye, McRae – aye, Petersen – aye, and Sarkovich – aye.

3. Discussion on FOWD Water Supply for the month of October 2024
- Technical Services Manager Siebensohn provided a summary of the water supply report.
- General Manager Gray addressed questions from the Board. He stated that FOWD developed and invested in groundwater so we could have redundancy in case of an emergency. It was also developed so FOWD could have the ability to adjust the water supply cost. Once it was developed, SJWD changed its rate structure and FOWD does not have incentives to pump groundwater. FOWD is not looking for SJWD to lose money but to work with FOWD for mutual benefit.
- Director Sarkovich stated that FOWD is adding more groundwater assets (wells).
- SJWD Board Member Tobin stated that she voted against the merger with SSWD during their last Board meeting because no one on the Board had seen the contract. She stated that something important needs to be read. She also stated that we need to work collaboratively on the business of water and ratepayers.

4. Discussion and possible action on additional funding for 2024 expenses
- General Manager presented staff’s recommendation for the Board to authorize the transfer of $69,800 from the contingency fund to cover 2024 expenses.

Director Sarkovich moved to authorize the transfer of $69,800 from the contingency fund to cover 2024 expenses as presented.

Director McRae seconded the motion.

Motion carried with the following votes: Dolby – aye, Marx – aye, McRae – aye, Petersen – aye, and Sarkovich – aye.

VII. UPCOMING EVENTS

1. November 20, 2024 / SJWD Regular Board Meeting / SJWD Office
- General Manager Gray encouraged people to attend this meeting and stated it can also be attended remotely.
<!-- Page 9 -->
- SJWD Board Member Tobin suggested that FOWD Board request SJWD to add "FOWD Resolution No. 24-03" to the agenda, so it could be discussed during the meeting. Otherwise, her request to include it will be dismissed by the SJWD Board.  
- SJWD Board Member Tobin mentioned SJWD’s discussion about destroying records after thirty days (30), instead of two years as mandated by state laws. She stated that to her, this is an attempt to hide things. With the recent election, the dynamics of SJWD Board has started to shift. SJWD Board Member Tobin feels that she has a target on her back because she daylighted many issues, but this is business, it’s not personal.

XI. PUBLIC COMMENT

• Director Sarkovich stated that FOWD should make customers aware that FOWD has the lowest rates and no debt.  
• General Manager Gray stated FOWD does not brag about ourselves.  
• SJWD Board Member Tobin stated making this information public knowledge highlights FOWD’s functionality – it’s a fact.  
• An unknown visitor inquired about the water agreement and its expiration.  
• General Manager Gray stated that the wholesale water agreement with SJWD expires in 2045. When the contract expires, the water rights might go away. FOWD would need to do something to enhance it.  

Page 10 of 12
<!-- Page 11 -->
- SJWD Board Member Tobin stated that the water agreement has to do with water reliability. Folsom Lake, CHWD, Orange Vale and FOWD makeup the wholesale water agencies; it’s part of the family of the San Juan wholesale district. Folsom Lake is the first responder. Folsom Lake affects everybody, it affects the family and everything that happens in the region. SJWD does not run Folsom Lake. The water rights are worth fighting for. She summarized the 2015 drought.
- General Manager Gray stated that when the drought took place in 2015, FOWD had enough water to provide its customers with average-day water, even when there was no surface water. This water came from FOWD’s investment in groundwater wells. FOWD has had the opportunity to share this groundwater with the family.
- President Petersen noted that Folsom Lake holds 972,000 acre-feet of water when it’s full. The groundwater basins in the Sacramento area have enough evacuated storage space because of over pumping that we can fill the groundwater, and this will hold over a million acre-feet of water. There’s a lot of potential for groundwater storage to improve our overall water supply reliability. He believes there is a bright future for water supply.
