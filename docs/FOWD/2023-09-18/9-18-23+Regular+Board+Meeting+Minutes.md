V. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: OLD BUSINESS

1. Update and discussion on FOWD Groundwater Well Projects
   - General Manager Gray reported that there are no updates on the New York Well, but it is on his priority list. Northridge Well has taken more time than anticipated. He provided an update on the wells, grant, and agreement on Northridge Well.
   - Technical Services Manager Siebensonh provided an update on the Skyway Well. He reported that testing and operations are looking great, and the project is currently working on programming. A DDW (Division of Drinking Water) onsite inspection also took place, and FOWD is currently waiting for the operation permit.
   - General Manager Gray noted that FOWD is not allowed to use the Skyway Well for its customers until the permit has been granted.
   - General Manager Gray stated that projects are being prioritized and provided an overview of expectations. He also mentioned that piping materials have already been purchased for the New York Avenue Project.

   - General Manager Gray provided an explanation.
   - Director Sarkovich inquired about the next steps for New York Well.
   - General Manager Gray explained that New York Well is one of the top three priorities on his list. FOWD is currently looking at lead times and planning on purchasing materials for the New York Well, specifically motors because it takes at least a year to receive a motor or a pump.

   - Director Sarkovich inquired if FOWD had plans to hire a firm to design the Northridge Well.

The FOWD will invite other water districts to participate.
