3. Accept and File Investment Report (none)  
4. Accept and File Financial Expense Report (none)  
5. Approval of Warrants  
6. Approval of Cal-Card Statements for the month of December 2022  
7. Approval of Board Expense Report for the month of December 2022  
   - Board President McRae inquired about the water system fee amount from the State Water Resource Control Board.  
   - General Manager Gray stated the amount has tripled in the past five years. The amount paid was for annual inspections for the water supply permit.  
   - Board Vice President Petersen stated SJWD General Manager Helliker attended the last board meeting and was not listed on the Minutes.  

- A visitor stated that in 2006 FOWD had 40 employees and 31 in 2023, that’s a 25% decrease in staff. And yet FOWD wants to make a gigantic building like their staff tripled in size. He questioned how FOWD justifies spending $10 million of rate payers’ money to build something that is unnecessary. If FOWD spends $1 million in the existing building, it would look beautiful. He considers FOWD’s thought process to be from 2006, he does not understand it.  

- Visitor Corcos stated he has worked in the neighborhood since January 2020. He recently learned about FOWD’s construction plans.

- Board President McRae asked if she had seen FOWD’s architectural drawing.  
- The Fair Oaks neighbor responded she has.  
- Board President McRae asked if she considered it nice.  
- Visitor Brian Fisher stated it looks functional.  
- A person identifying herself as a Fair Oaks neighbor stated she would like the opportunity to see if there are other options available for the yard construction, rather than building it in the town.  
- Board President McRae asked if she had seen FOWD’s architectural drawing.  
- The Fair Oaks neighbor responded she has.

- Visitor Corcos stated that in 2006 FOWD had 40 employees and 31 in 2023, that’s a 25% decrease in staff. And yet FOWD wants to make a gigantic building like their staff tripled in size. He questioned how FOWD justifies spending $10 million of rate payers’ money to build something that is unnecessary. If FOWD spends $1 million in the existing building, it would look beautiful.

   - Information only.

   - General Manager Gray mentioned the New York Well is being built as an aquifer storage and recovery well. FOWD is fortunate to have high quality groundwater.  
   - A visitor asked if there is an educational process that FOWD is planning for residents and businesses relative to reclaimed water use.  
   - General Manager responded that new building areas, that have brand new infrastructure, can include installation of both potable and non-potable water systems. In older areas though, it’s currently cost prohibitive to build this type of infrastructure.

VI. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: NEW BUSINESS

### Update and discussion on the agreement between FOWD and the Fair Oaks Historical Society for use of the property located at 10340 Fair Oaks Boulevard
- General Manager Gray provided an overview of how this property was obtained. This property is leased to the Fair Oaks Historical Society (FOHS) for a $1.00 annual fee. FOHS treats this property as their own and they insure it. This item is listed on the agenda every year, to provide the Board an opportunity to provide any new direction to staff.
- A visitor inquired what the future use of the property would look like, when it would be implemented, when FOHS would need to move.
<!-- Page 6 -->
- The FOHS has made the property even nicer than when it was acquired. FOHS will have the property for about fifty (50) years, unless there is a FOWD operational need before then. If that happens, FOWD will contact FOHS and they will need to relocate. This property was purchased for the future of FOWD’s ratepayers. In the meantime, FOWD is putting the property to community benefit.
- Visitor inquired if there was a way for them to be helpful as common stewards to help mitigate circumstances.
- General Manager Gray responded that FOWD is not in the real estate business. Communication with FOHS has been easy and cordial. Any concerns are addressed and managed.
