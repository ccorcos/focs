VI. Discussion and Action Items: New Business

1. Update and discussion on FOWD water supply for the month of December 2017
   - Operations Manager Nisenboym reported that the FOWD total system demand from all sources for the month of December was recorded at 407.88 AC-FT. The wholesale connections provided 178.02 AC-FT (43.65%) and groundwater wells produced 229.86 AC-FT (56.35%) of the total water demand. The December 2017 total demand of 407.88 AC-FT represents a decrease of 8.6% from December 10-year average and 22.98% reduction from December 2013.
   - Director Mortein inquired if the cost per unit referenced in the report is the same monthly.
   - General Manager Gray stated it varies depending on the month as it is impacted by the energy costs (i.e. peak hours).
   - Director Sarkovich stated FOWD should not pump water during the peak hours (between 3-7 PM).
   - Operations Manager Nisenboym stated staff has to pump continuously to meet the goal set by the Board of 40% groundwater. He also explained that during the summer FOWD has to pump to meet customer demands. He also noted that good operation of the wells includes minimizing the stop and start of the pump during the day.
   - Mr. Babcock stated that additional storage west end of FOWD’s system would be beneficial to the water system.
   - General Manager Gray stated the cost per unit in the report is operational only; it does not include capital costs.
   - Director Sarkovich stated he would like to learn more about FOWD groundwater pumping.

2. Update and discussion on 2017 water supply – surface water and groundwater use
   - General Manager Gray provided an overview of the year-end results. He stated the Board provided the goal of 40% groundwater pumping; staff pumped 35% groundwater.
<!-- Page 4 -->
3. Discussion and possible action on 2018 water supply targets for surface water and groundwater use
- Director Sarkovich stated that the 2018 budget is based on 60% (surface water)/40% (groundwater). He stated staff will not be penalized if they do not meet the ratio. The Board can meet and change the ratio when needed during the year.
- Director Page agreed that FOWD should keep 60% (surface water) and 40% (groundwater).
- The Board directed staff to continue the 60% (surface water) and 40% (groundwater) in 2018.
- Director Underwood inquired on the baseline for groundwater substitution transfer.
- General Manager Gray stated in theory once FOWD established the pumping baseline amount and filed it properly, FOWD can substitute surface water for that amount. He cautioned that SJWD is calculating based on a five-year rolling average for surface water allocation.
- President Marx suggested providing more detail on surface water cost on the water supply report, similar to the groundwater cost per unit.
- The Board directed staff to schedule a Technical Advisory Committee meeting to discuss groundwater vs. surface water.

5. Update and discussion on 2017 water loss results
- Staff reported a 6.6% water loss.
- Director Page asked if staff can try to reduce that percentage.
- Operations Manager Nisenboym stated it would take a lot of staff’s time to look at the system as some of the loss could be leaks from old pipes but is generally recognized as unaccounted for water loss.

6. Discussion and possible action on the Draft Environmental Report for the El Dorado Water Reliability Project – use and storage of up to 40,000 AF of water from the American River
- The Board directed General Manager Gray to report back on the impact of the Draft Environmental Report for the El Dorado Water Reliability Project on SJWD’s surface water supply.
