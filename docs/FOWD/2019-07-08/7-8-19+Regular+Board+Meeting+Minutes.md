- Director Marx stated there isn’t enough agreement in the Board tonight and would like to bring it to the next Board meeting.
- Director Page stated that he is opposed to the idea of the merger and the study. He feels that the problem is San Juan Water District. He suggested that San Juan Water District look internally before trying to merge with outside districts.
- Director Marx stated he sides more with the idea of consolidation and feels that there are too many water districts in the same area.
