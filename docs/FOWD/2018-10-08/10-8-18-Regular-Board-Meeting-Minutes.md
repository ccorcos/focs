**V. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: OLD BUSINESS**

1. **Update and discussion on proposed revisions to the Wholesale Water Supply Agreement with the San Juan Water District.**

   - President Marx stated that the Board’s desire to negotiate a revised wholesale water supply agreement resulted in the formation of a working committee. The committee met three times; March, April and July of 2018. He stated the committee discussed possible revisions to the wholesale water agreement. The Board proposed a take or pay agreement with a set volume and set costs. SJWD Board President Marty Hanneman wrote an email responding to the following proposals from FOWD:
   
     1. FOWD requested a three-year contract term ending in 2021 instead of 2045. San Juan Wholesale’s response: this would cause a problem with any debt SJWD would issue between now and 2021 by downgrading the credit rating and interest rates which would cost wholesale customer agencies more in debt repayment and increase the financial cost to San Juan Wholesale.
     
     2. FOWD proposes to switch from a quarterly service charge; two debt payments and a volumetric charge to a single volumetric charge. They would increase this charge through 2021. San Juan Wholesale’s response: SJWD felt the FOWD rates would be lower than the rates charged to the other customers; Folsom, Orange Vale, Citrus Heights and San Juan which is a violation of state law.
     
     3. FOWD proposes that future rates be subject to negotiation. San Juan Wholesale’s response: These provisions would provide an advantage to FOWD that other wholesale customers would not have. More importantly such provisions would compromise San Juan Water District’s fiduciary duty to generate adequate revenue to meet its bond obligations and is inconsistent with the industry standards in which wholesale agencies set rates for water delivered to retail agency customers.

   - President Marx stated that it looks like we are at an impasse and will discontinue negotiations-but will keep the committee forum to discuss future topics.

   - Director Sarkovich stated that the primary issue is the proposed rate structure. The District does not want to be in these contracts to 2045. The Board must determine what is in the best interest of the rate payers.

   - President Marx stated the 3 options from the 2017 water management flexibility and preparedness evaluation to ensure water supply and economic sustainability; 1-Do what we are doing now, status quo. 2-Develop groundwater supply to meet the average daily demand of the entire system and 3-Renegotiate the water supply agreement.

   - Vice President McRae stated he has a similar feeling, stating the new rate structure from San Juan is a game changer. Pricing changed from a community rate to a significant fixed rate regardless of water use. He stated FOWD will pay even if we turn off the spigot, San Juan has got their hand in our check book and that isn’t right. Vice President McRae expressed concern over the increasing rate structure.

1. **Discussion on Water Rates**
   - Director Sarkovich expressed concerns about the increasing water rates of 16%, 9%, 9%, 9%, 5%, and uncertainty after the 5th year. He noted San Juan's history of raising rates and questioned financial sustainability, suggesting the need to explore other options.
   - Director Sarkovich stated he wants to go on record as having worked on this for 2 years.

2. **Update and discussion on Regional Water Authority (RWA) Lobbying Subscription Program activities (verbal)**
   - General Manager Gray reported that RWA has not yet selected a legislative advocate for its staff. Most significantly, after two tries, the state legislature gave up, and there will not be a water tax in 2018.

3. **Update and discussion on the 2018 Water Transfer Project**
   - General Manager Gray reported on the transfer of groundwater from FOWD to outside agencies for a total reimbursement of $457,186.
   - Director Sarkovich inquired about the status of providing water to Carmichael Water District.
   - General Manager Gray replied that FOWD should have another 2x2 meeting with CMW to discuss the future possibility of water transfers to Carmichael Water District and the potential to reroute water across the American River for use on the south side.

4. **Discussion and possible action on the IT Support Plan**
   - General Manager Gray recommended the Board authorize him to execute an agreement with Shandam Consulting to help FOWD determine who to hire for an IT solution. He stated the Board had already agreed to take funds from the vacant IT position to put into a fund for IT support.
   - President Marx motioned for possible action on the IT support plan.
