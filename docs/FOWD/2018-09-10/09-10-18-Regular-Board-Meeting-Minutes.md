approval as instructed. Based on the information provided by LiveImpact, the FOWD management team questioned the fit relative to them meeting the needs of the FOWD Website Project. General Manager Gray provided a listing of issues for Board consideration.

- General Manager Gray provided an overview of the cost comparisons for Michael Baker International ($44,700), LiveImpact ($30,600), Streamline ($3,600). Streamline was the lowest because there is no upfront cost. General Manager Gray stated the goals/direction from the Board is to have the website a) fully ADA and Section 508 compliant; b) simple and intuitive to navigate by the customers; and c) efficiently used to convey current information to customers. Attached are the background and proposal from each company.
- Director Sarkovich inquired how staff discovered Streamline.
- General Manager Gray stated staff attended a training that Streamline provided through the California Special District’s Association on ADA and Section 508 compliant websites. He stated staff contacted Streamline representatives seeking help relative to the FOWD Website Project. General Manager Gray stated many Special Districts are using Streamline including SJWD.
- Director Page stated he disagrees with General Manager Gray as to what the Board was looking for on the website. He stated he would like FOWD to have an interactive website that can make an impact not based on costs. He was looking for a more advanced, proactive and world class website. Director Page stated that if FOWD wanted cheaper then Streamline is cheaper.
- General Manager Gray stated he understood that the main driver for redoing the website was ADA and Section 508 compliance and that LiveImpact did not include ADA compliance in their proposal.
- Director Page stated that making the website ADA and Section 508 compliant will not be difficult to do. He believes that LiveImpact should not be eliminated based on these criteria alone. LiveImpact’s platform allows for data collection and client interactivity which FOWD does not have and Streamline does not offer.
- Director Sarkovich inquired if Streamline’s contract is month to month.
- General Manager Gray stated that Streamline is month to month.
- Director Sarkovich stated the District can pay $300 month to month. If it does not work out, FOWD can discontinue using Streamline.
- General Manager Gray stated that Streamline has a transparency hub that will allow customers to search for documents easily.
- Director Sarkovich stated that FOWD can continue to explore interactive website capabilities with Streamline.
- Director Page stated FOWD’s current website only allows posting of information. He would like the website to have the ability to interact with customers.
- Director Sarkovich stated Streamline has a feature that can easily embed social media feed and an event calendar. Director Sarkovich stated he agrees with Director Page that FOWD needs a better website. He stated Streamline is an improvement and cost effective.
- Director Page stated he agrees with Director Sarkovich that Streamline is an improvement and cost effective; but he does not believe it can go as far as he would like it to go.

- Director McRae inquired on the website being mobile friendly.
- General Manager Gray stated that it would provide a mobile friendly platform.
- Director McRae stated he would like to give kudos to Director Page for pushing forward and being persistent for a better FOWD website.
- Director Page suggested that after the FOWD website is made compliant and up and running, FOWD should contact LiveImpact again to explore more on interactive websites to better engage the community.
- General Manager Gray stated that staff can work with the vendor to provide customers the ability to view their account history and invoice online. He stated this would be an interactive feature that customers have been requesting.
- Director Sarkovich stated that based on the rate payers in his area, they are primarily interested in price and quality of the water and nothing else.
- Director Page stated that staff has been operating at the lowest cost. He would like staff to open up a little; as not everything of value can be measured by price alone.
- The Board directed staff to use Streamline for FOWD’s website and provide a review within six months on an interactive website.
- General Manager Gray stated top of his list is the online interactive billing where customers can view their invoice and pay online. He stated this item would be implemented immediately.
- Customer Service Manager Huckaby stated that the number one request from FOWD customers is to have the ability to view their consumption and bill online. Another feature they would like to see is to be able to have recurring payments based on the invoice amount.
- The Board agreed that the online billing feature is important.
- General Manager Gray emphasized that unless redirected, staff will immediately implement the online bill pay, the initial startup may be around $20,000.
- Director Page stated he would like staff to look at all the possible interactive features available to FOWD and come back with a list.
