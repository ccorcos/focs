### 6. Update and discussion on RWA and ACWA lobbying and legislative activities
- General Manager Gray provided an update on RWA and ACWA lobbying and legislative activities. He stated the water tax is going to happen. Currently there are four plans being discussed. The first plan is $0.50 per connection charged monthly. The second plan is $0.92 per connection charged monthly. The per connection charge would be implemented as a surcharge listed on the bill and the District would act as a tax collector for the state. The third option is a per District fee based on the number of connections and each district will have power to determine collection methods for the tax.

- Director Carey inquired as to who is enacting the tax.
- General Manager Gray replied that the state of California is enacting a tax to fund disadvantaged communities who cannot afford clean drinking water.
