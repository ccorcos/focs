- Visitor CanField introduced himself.

He requested documentation of such and stated his disbelief of its existence. He also
<!-- Page 6 -->
![Page 2 of 9](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Page+2+of+9)

addressed his concern regarding the lack of response from Board Members, except from President Petersen—he always responds. This is inexcusable. He expects a response every time he writes a letter. He would also like to know where he can find more information regarding the current lawsuit.

- Director Sarkovich advised Visitor Corcos to visit the FOWD website to obtain lawsuit information, as it is posted there. Director Sarkovich stated he read Visitor Corcos’ email and is puzzled at his objective of moving the Corporate Yard somewhere else. Director Sarkovich stated that this is not the first time Visitor Corcos has attacked General Manager Gray’s character and he does not understand how doing so helps in convincing the Board to go along with his plan. Director Sarkovich stated he will not engage in those type of emails.
- Visitor Corcos responded that when they presented to the Board last March, three out of the five Board Members already had their written response, even before their presentation began. He does not believe any of the Board Members will change their mind.
- Director Marx stated that when an argument is presented, he weighs the pros and cons. Before writing his response, he spent four to five months analyzing the situation and nothing new was presented that day. It was a close call, but he decided to move forward with the Corporation Yard Project. He is not set in his ways; he will always continue to listen.
- Director McRae stated that he tries not to engage in inflammatory emails. If this is the way he gets approached, he ignores it. He reminded Visitor Corcos of giving him one-on-one time. He spent about an hour and a-half to two hours listening to what Visitor Corcos wanted to share. Director McRae believes he has gone above and beyond with him, compared to other rate payers.
- SJWD General Manager Helliker commended FOWD for posting the Board Packet on the website. He also commented that there doesn’t appear to be capacity for water transfer this year. There has been progress in the water forum agreement and the goal is to have a draft ready by this summer.
- Visitor Joe M. introduced himself and stated he has been working with East Bay Mud upgrading facilities. He inquired about the bids for the Corporate Yard Project.
- President Petersen responded that the Corporate Yard Project is currently at the permitting process stage with Sacramento County. No contractors have been selected yet.

Page 4 of 9  
Page 8 of 177  
<!-- Page 9 -->
- General Manager Gray explained that CMW decided not to move forward with the merger to protect their surface water rights. There was an immediate pivot to get surface water rights from another agency.
- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated that General Manager Gray was quoting from a SSWD staff report presented at their Board Meeting. SSWD had an agenda item to consider initiating a merger conversation with SJWD. This is something SJWD will address if SSWD decides to pursue it.
- General Manager Gray stated that SSWD’s report indicates that SJWD initiated the discussion of a potential merger.
- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated that no one from his staff has had any conversations with SSWD. He is unsure as to what SSWD was referring to.
- For the record, General Manager Gray stated that this meeting is being recorded. He inquired if SJWD General Manager Helliker believes SSWD’s General Manager is misinformed and misrepresented.
- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated that he is unsure what SSWD’s General Manager was referring to in that statement. SSWD’s General Manager could have been referring to conversations he has had with SJWD Board Members. SJWD General Manager Helliker guarantees there has been no conversations with his staff.
- Board President Petersen inquired what would be the need or benefit for SJWD to merge, instead of remaining independent. This is a topic of discussion that has come up in the past.
- SJWD General Manager Helliker referred to a 2014 report. This report argued that a merger would make it administratively easier to share water. However, this was not a detailed analysis. In order to consider the idea of a merger, a full case analysis would need to be conducted.
- President Petersen stated that the ongoing discussion of a potential merger has soured the relationship between SJWD and FOWD. FOWD was hopeful for a conjunctive use agreement. A SJWD Board Member expressed it was a waste of time. However, SJWD seems interested in a conjunctive use agreement, but with another entity. It would make more sense for SJWD to work with a wholesale customer. FOWD remains interested in this agreement.
- SJWD General Manager Helliker stated the comments made by SJWD’s Board Members were inaccurate.

5. Update on the FOWD Corporation Yard Redevelopment Project
- General Manager Gray provided an update. The project is currently undergoing the planning and approval process with Sacramento County.
- Director Sarkovich commented that FOWD has been receiving invoices from different branches of Sacramento County, which indicates they are actively working and reviewing the project.
- Visitor Corcos mentioned there should have been more community involvement with the planning of this project. He expressed his discontent about the parking structure; it’s not beneficial for the community.

   - Director Sarkovich stated FOWD is trying to build an asset for the community. The traffic design will not be changed.

XI. PUBLIC COMMENT  
   - Visiting Customer Babcock commented that for any Fair Oaks residents visiting Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District (FOPRD), it’s easier and closer to park on the East end. There is an unspoken advantage to putting the parking lot on the West side for the two evening restaurants that are owned by the advocate of moving the yard. If one of those establishments does not survive, that person gets less income. He believes there was an error in seeking multiple evening eating establishments in that property, as opposed to mixing it with more of a day-time establishment; having only one restaurant. There is not enough parking for multiple evening restaurants. There is an invested financial interest for the owner of this property. Modifying the current plans and resubmitting them to the county will be costly.  
   - General Manager Gray stated that FOWD works with the homes located on the North side. Operations cannot be moved to the East side because FOWD does not have an agreement with those homes. FOWD’s mission statement is to serve water. FOWD is not a parking business. FOWD is a self-contained entity.  
   - Visiting Customer Babcock thanked the Board of Directors and the Management Team and stated that they are doing a splendid job.

**From:** Chi Ha-Ly  
**Date:** May 17, 2024

### Recommendation:
None at this time. Monthly financial expenses presented for informational purposes.

This report provides a quick snapshot of the operating expenses incurred by the District and does not include items that are capitalized (i.e. costs of construction jobs, fixed assets). The capital projects are reported separately under the “Capital Projects Status Report.”

### Policy Implications:
None as a result of recommended action.

### Fiscal Impact:

**FAIR OAKS WATER DISTRICT**  
**AGENDA ITEM V.1**  
**REGULAR Board Meeting May 20, 2024**

To: Board of Directors  
From: Tom R. Gray  
Date: May 16, 2024  
Subject: Discussion and possible action on the selection of a consultant to provide professional design services for the Northridge Well Project  

**Recommendation:**  
Direct the General Manager to negotiate a fair and reasonable agreement for providing professional services to drill and equip a new groundwater well at the existing Northridge Well site with KASL Consulting Engineers for FOWD Board approval.

**Discussion:**  
The Healthy Rivers and Landscapes Alternative is the current iteration of the effort started in 2018 that was dubbed the “Voluntary Agreements.” The Newsom administration convened key water districts, state agencies, and other interested parties to work out this alternative method to meet Bay-Delta Plan goals that did not rely wholly on the State Water Board staff-generated concept of extreme unimpaired flow requirements. As part of this program the Fair Oaks Water District had an opportunity to obtain funding for a new groundwater production facility.

At a public Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) meeting held on August 17, 2023 the FOWD Board of Directors unanimously voted to approve a Project Agreement with the Sacramento Regional Water Authority that included funding for the Northridge Groundwater Well Project. In accordance with the general terms of the agreement, and exchange for the funding, the FOWD will complete a new groundwater well at the existing Northridge Well property and make annually available 1,374 AF of water in three years over an eight-year period. In exchange the FOWD will receive project cost reimbursement of up to $2,470,000. FOWD staff will be responsible for coordination commitments such as technical team meetings, flow accounting, and annual collaboration to provide flow recommendations and reviews.

Given external factors outside of the control of the FOWD, the project was placed on hold for a few months.

At a public FOWD Board of Directors meeting held on March 18, 2024 the Board directed staff to prepare a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide professional design services to redrill and equip a new groundwater well at the existing Northridge Well Site in Fair Oaks.

![Fair Oaks Water District](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

Design and Construction Management Services:

A. March 29, 2024 - FOWD staff completed the RFP - a copy of the RFP is attached.

B. April 1, 2024 - FOWD posted the RFP for response from qualified consultants.

C. April 30, 2024 - Responses from qualified consultants were due at the FOWD office.

D. Three consulting firms responded to the solicitation:
- Luhdorff & Scalmanini Consulting Engineering (L&S)
- Kasl Consulting Engineering (KASL)
- Mark Carey Engineering (MCE)

All three firms met the minimum requirements for submittal of a response to the RFP, therefore all three responses were evaluated in accordance with the Section 8 of the RFP.

E. Analysis of Proposals

1. Project Team Qualifications & Experience (25 Points)
MCE has experienced personnel, qualified for design and inspection of pumping plants. The senior hydrogeologist scheduled to lead the design of the well is qualified and has designed many groundwater wells. The project design team for the well equipping lacked project experience when compared to the other two responses.

L&S and KASL teams provided responses indicating that their teams have extensive experience in all aspects of groundwater production.

KASL references were clear, relevant, easy to contact, and local. L&S references were detailed but included one local contact. MCE references were limited to one actual well project.
- KASL 24.0 Points
- L&S 25.0 Points
- MCE 19.0 Points

2. Project Approach (35 Points)
The three proposals clearly demonstrate that their team: understand the project requirements and key issues, will maintain compliance with regulatory permits, and have local understanding of resources and agencies.

Page 59 of 177
<!-- Page 60 -->
![Fair Oaks Water District](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Fair+Oaks+Water+District)

L&S provided good detail on their project approach. Their proposal varied from the RFP by sole sourcing the well drilling to a L&S subcontractor. While we invited alternative approaches to the work, we expected all to respond directly to the RFP and then provide an alternative approach for FOWD consideration. Though highly qualified, the review team was concerned that L&S may struggle in responding to FOWD recommendations relative to project details.

MCE responded to the RFP well and provided alternative approaches after responding directly to the RFP. Overall, their proposal was good. Detailed review of their proposal indicated that their team was the least experienced of the responding teams.

KASL provided good detail on their project approach. Their team’s response was in accordance with the RFP. Based on recent experience, they highlighted “lead time” issues that could impact project delivery and offered solutions. They also demonstrated a positive record with recent projects of similar scope.

- KASL 32.5 Points
- L&S 31.0 Points
- MCE 29.0 Points

3. Ability to Meet Schedule (25 Points)

The FOWD recognizes that the project delivery date listed in the RFP is aggressive and will require multitasking during design and construction. Both MCE and KASL did a good job of acknowledging this in the responses provided by their teams – while MCE seemed more concerned that the aggressive schedule could be met.

- KASL 24.0 Points
- L&S 23.0 Points
- MCE 23.0 Points

4. Resource Allocation (15 Points)

All three of the responding teams have experienced qualified engineers and hydrogeologists for design and inspection of water supply facilities. MCE and KASL are located near the project site, while L&S is located slightly further away in Woodland. The L&S response leaned more towards virtual interaction than did the responses from MCE and KASL. Concern was that the FOWD Project may be competing for resources internally at L&S.

- KASL 13.5 Points
- L&S 13.0 Points
- MCE 12.5 Points

![Final Scoring of Proposals](https://via.placeholder.com/768x992.png?text=Final+Scoring+of+Proposals)

| Item                                   | KASL | L&S  | MCE  |
|----------------------------------------|------|------|------|
| Experience of Team (25 Points)        | 24.0 | 25.0 | 19.0 |
| Resource Allocation (15 Points)       | 13.5 | 13.0 | 12.5 |
| Work Approach (35 Points)             | 32.5 | 31.0 | 29.0 |
| Schedule (25 Points)                  | 24.0 | 23.0 | 23.0 |
| **Total**                              | **94** | **92** | **83.5** |

The KASL proposal demonstrated that they: understand the project requirements and key issues, will maintain compliance with regulatory permits, have local understanding of resources and agencies, and understand the aggressive project delivery date.

### Items of Note:
Professional services are unique by their nature; therefore, they are not subject to competitive bidding. When procuring specialized services, the District is principally dependent upon the skill, integrity, judgment, and ability of the service provider rather than the dollar cost of the direct labor and material. Pursuant to Section 37103 of the California Government Code, the FOWD may contract with any specially trained and experienced person, firm, or corporation for special services and advice in financial, economic, accounting, engineering, legal or administrative matters. It may pay such compensation to these experts as it deems proper. When contracting for architectural, landscape architectural, engineering, environmental, land surveying, and construction project management services, requirements of Sections 4525 through 4529.5 of the California Government Code must be met.

FOWD Policy 5110 Section 5.13.1. Request for proposal or qualification may be used in lieu of the bid process when selection is based on qualification, quality, experience, design, past performance, or work approach.

California Government Code Section 37103. The legislative body may contract with any specially trained and experienced person, firm, or corporation for special services and advice in financial, economic, accounting, engineering, legal, or administrative matters. It may pay such compensation to these experts as it deems proper.

### Policy Implications:
None because of the recommended action.

### Fiscal Impact:
To be determined.

# BID FORM

## Background
The New York Avenue steel water main to be replaced was installed in the early 1950s and cement lined in the early 1980s. The main is over 70 years old, experienced several leaks in the past years, and has observed loss of pipe integrity due to corrosion.

## Project
This project provides for the installation of 12-inch class 350 ductile iron pipe from north of Lemon Street on the south end to Orange Avenue on the north end, with tie-ins at each intersection: a total estimated lay length of 1,810 ft. The FOWD has pre-purchased 18’ sections of 12-inch class 350 ductile iron pipe, tyton joint, which is available to the contractor for this project. Installation of 12-inch ductile iron pipe will allow for replacement of 12-inch aged steel main on New York Ave., to be abandoned in place per FOWD Standard. A second phase is planned from Monal Ct. to Lemon St., to be bid and constructed at a later time.

## Note:
The Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) reserves the right to reject any or all bids, to waive any informality in any bid, and to determine which bid, in the judgment of the FOWD, is the lowest responsive bid of a responsible bidder.

**Section 15 – SAFETY**  
The Contractor shall execute and maintain the Contractor's work to avoid injury or damage to any person or property. The Contractor shall comply with the requirements of the specifications relating to safety measures applicable in particular operations or kinds of work.

1. In the performance of this contract the contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local statutory and regulatory requirements including, but not limited to California Department of Industrial Relations (Cal/OSHA) regulations; and the U.S. Department of Transportation Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act related to their scope of work and operations. In case of conflict in regulations, the most stringent shall apply. The contractor shall provide all safeguards, safety devices and protective equipment and take any other needed actions necessary to protect the health and safety of employees on the job and the safety of the public and to protect property in connection with the performance of the work covered by the contract. Safety precautions shall include but shall not be limited to: adequate life protection and life saving equipment; adequate illumination; instructions in accident prevention for all employees, such as the use of machinery guards, safe walkways, scaffolds, ladders, bridges, gang planks, confined space procedures, trenching and shoring, fall protection, and other safety devices; equipment and wearing apparel as are necessary or lawfully required to prevent accidents, injuries, or illnesses; and adequate facilities for the proper inspection and maintenance of all safety measures.

2. Contractor must obtain all applicable Division of Occupational Safety and Health (CAL-OSHA) permit(s) and others required by California Labor Code and California Government Code, prior to the initiation of any practices, work, method, operation, or process related to the work covered in the contract. Permits required by governmental authorities will be obtained at Contractor's expense.

3. It is a condition of this contract, and shall be made a condition of each sub-contract which the contractor enters into pursuant to this contract, that the contractor and any subcontractor shall not permit any employee, in performance of the contract, to work in surroundings or under conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous to their health or safety, as determined under Cal/OSHA safety and health standards.

4. The Contractor shall be responsible for the safeguarding of all utilities.

Page 928 of 129
<!-- Page 93 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

plan shall be submitted to and accepted by Fair Oaks Water District prior to starting excavation. The trench safety plan shall have details showing the design of shoring, bracing, sloping or other provisions to be made for worker protection from the hazard of caving ground. If such a plan varies from the shoring system standards established by the Construction Safety Orders of the California Department of Industrial Relations (Cal/OSHA), the plan shall be prepared by a California registered civil or structural engineer. As part of the plan, a note shall be included stating that the registered civil or structural engineer certifies that the plan complies with the Cal/OSHA Construction Safety Orders, or that the registered civil or structural engineer certifies that the plan is not less effective than the shoring, bracing, sloping or other provisions of the Safety Orders. In no event shall the Contractor use a shoring, sloping, or protective system less effective than that required by said Construction Safety Orders. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the Contractor of the requirement to maintain safety in all areas. If excavations or trench work requiring a Cal/OSHA permit are to be undertaken, the Contractor shall submit their permit with the excavation/trench work safety plan to Fair Oaks Water District before work begins.

6. In the event of damage to any property or bodily injury to any person, the Contractor's Representative will provide immediate verbal notification (to be followed by a detailed written report thereon within forty-eight (48) hours) to the FOWD Inspector, or alternatively, to the Authorized FOWD Representative named in the Contract Agreement, or alternatively, Task Order.

*Page 111 of 177*
<!-- Page 112 -->
# AGENDA ITEM VI.1
**REGULAR Board Meeting May 20, 2024**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Siebensohn  
**Date:** May 8, 2024  
**Subject:** Discussion on FOWD Water Supply for the month of April 2024  

## Recommendation:
None.

## Discussion:
According to the Accuweather.com website, the recorded average daily temperature in April 2024 was 58.5° F, which is 2.5 degrees below the historic average of 61.0° F for April. Precipitation for April 2024 was recorded at 1.49” according to the Department of Water Resources Chicago rain station located in Fair Oaks.

The wholesale connections provided **485.21 AC-FT (92.41%)** of surface water and FOWD groundwater wells produced **39.83 AC-FT (7.59%)** to meet the total water demand of **525.04 AC-FT**.

A graph of total consumption to date versus projected budget target is found in Exhibit A.

A graph of groundwater and surface water use in 2024 to date is found in Exhibit B.

Both the FO-40 and CTP wholesale connections remained open to provide surface water supply to the District.

According to the data provided by SJWD, the recorded volumes from wholesale connections are:

| Connection | Forward Flow, AC-FT | Reverse Flow, AC-FT | Total, AC-FT |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| CTP Connection | 287.59 | 0.00 | 287.59 |
| FO-40 (39°) | 197.62 | 0.00 | 197.62 |
| **TOTAL FROM SJWD** | **485.21** | **0.00** | **485.21** |

The average daily flow from wholesale connections for the month of April 2024 was recorded at **3,601 GPM**.

The maximum day water demand was reached on April 24, 2024, and was recorded at approximately 8.14 million gallons (MG) with the wholesale connections providing 6.73 MG and FOWD groundwater wells providing 1.41 MG. The minimum day water demand was recorded on April 5, 2024, at 4.16 MG. The average day demand was calculated at 5.63 MG.

The 10-year total average water use for the month of April is **574.58 AC-FT** and April 2013 total water demand was recorded at **839.24 AC-FT**. The April 2024 total water demand of **525.04 AC-FT** represents a decrease of **8.62%** from the April 10-year average, a **37.44%** decrease from April 2013 consumption, and a **3.36%** decrease from 2023 consumption.

On the morning of April 24, 2024, instrumentation monitored by Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) staff indicated a significant water pressure drop within the FOWD water system at approximately 5:50 AM. Field investigation by FOWD staff found that a 27-inch water transmission main located at the corner of Pershing Avenue and Chestnut Avenue was leaking and causing significant localized flooding.
- By approximately 6:45 AM the main break was isolated and all FOWD customers were receiving water.
- The water loss is estimated at 1,811,000 gallons.
- By approximately 7:30 AM FOWD employees, with help from a contractor crew, immediately started clean-up.
- By approximately 8:00 AM the FOWD customer service staff was responding to water quality calls.

### Customer Notification:
- The FOWD website was updated with information about the incident and addressed water quality concerns.
- FOWD staff had delivered a notice to customers in the immediate area of the main break notifying customers about the incident, anticipated construction activity, and estimated schedule for repairs.

### Cause of Main Break:
- The cause of the main break is unknown.
- San Juan Water District (SJWD) staff were exercising transmission main valves located nearby at the intersection of Filbert Avenue and Pershing Avenue when the water main break occurred.
- FOWD staff contacted ACWA JPIA (FOWD insurance provider) for advice on how to proceed with a claim for damages caused by the incident. ACWA JPIA (JPIA)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tom R. Gray  
**Date:** May 14, 2024  
**Subject:** Update and discussion on the 2023 Consumer Confidence Report  

**Recommendation:**  
Information item – no staff recommendation.  

**Discussion:**  
In accordance with State requirements every community water system must publish and distribute information regarding the quality of water they serve customers annually. This is done in a document known as the Consumer Confidence Report (CCR).  

The CCR delivered to FOWD customers provides water quality information for both surface water and groundwater. Since a majority of the information contained in the report is the same for all SJWD Wholesale Member Agencies, we join together to produce one CCR for the entire SJWD Wholesale service area at a cost savings to all. The FOWD has developed and delivered the required CCR to FOWD customers in this manner for my entire 20-year tenure as General Manager.  

Attached is the most recent CCR providing water quality data for the 2023 year. Please note that this report indicates that water delivered to FOWD customers exceeds all California and Federal standards for water quality.  

**Policy Implications:**  
None.  

**Fiscal Impact:**  
None.

# 2023 CONSUMER CONFIDENCE REPORT

This report is published by the San Juan Wholesale Customer Agencies: San Juan Water District, Citrus Heights Water District, Fair Oaks Water District and Orange Vale Water Company. San Juan Water District provides reliable, high-quality water supplies to our customers. We serve nearly 151,000 customers in our retail and wholesale service areas throughout Sacramento and Placer counties. We test our surface water, which comes from the American River watershed, and our local groundwater for microbiological and chemical quality.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the State Water Resources Control Board maintain strict water quality standards designed to protect customers from waterborne disease organisms and harmful chemicals. As a public agency, we are required by the U.S. EPA to provide you with an annual Consumer Confidence Report.

This report provides you with information about drinking water quality and how we comply with drinking water quality standards. As your water provider, we are proud to report this year’s CCR concludes that, once again, your drinking water meets all federal and state drinking water standards.

## WHERE DOES YOUR WATER COME FROM?

Water from the Agencies comes from two sources: treated surface water and groundwater. San Juan Water District diverts and treats surface water from Folsom Lake. The treated water is then distributed to the Agencies. Orange Vale Water Company and San Juan Water District receive 100 percent of their supply as treated surface water. If you are a consumer of Citrus Heights or Fair Oaks water districts, your water is a mixture of treated surface water from San Juan Water District and groundwater from local wells.

- SJWD - 100% surface water
- CHWD - 100% surface water
- OVWC - 100% surface water
- FOWD - 90% surface water, 10% groundwater

Source water assessments have been conducted for all the water sources to enable the Agencies to understand the activities that have the greatest potential for contaminating the drinking water supplies. The groundwater sources were assessed in 2002 and the surface water source was evaluated in 2001. New wells for Fair Oaks Water District were assessed in 2014 and 2020. These assessments were conducted in accordance with State Water Board guidelines and copies of the complete assessments are available for review at the respective agency offices.

San Juan Water District conducted the evaluation of the Folsom Lake source. It was found to be most vulnerable to potential contamination from the Folsom Lake State Recreation Area facilities, high-density housing and activities such as sewer and septic systems and fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide application, as well as illegal activities and dumping. In addition, San Juan Water District conducts a watershed sanitary survey update every five years for the Folsom Lake source. This survey evaluates the water quality and potential contaminating activities in the watershed to ensure adequate treatment is provided and water quality regulations have been met. The most recent update was completed in December 2023. The source water is typically treated with conventional treatment with filtration and disinfection that is designed to remove many contaminants. Again this year, your water meets all federal and state drinking standards.

Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks water districts conducted assessments of their local groundwater wells. It was found that all the wells are vulnerable to commercial activities, such as active and historic gas stations, dry cleaners, leaking underground storage tanks, known contaminant plumes, automobile repair shops, and sewer collection systems, none of which are associated with any detected contaminants. One well for Fair Oaks Water District was found to be vulnerable to irrigation, associated with low levels of nitrate.

Although Orange Vale Water Company does not currently utilize available local groundwater, assessments found that wells within their service area would be most vulnerable to rural grazing activities.

# WHAT’S IN YOUR WATER?
The sources of drinking water (both tap water and bottled water) include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs, and wells. As water travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally-occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity.

Contaminants that may be present in the source water include:
- Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, that may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock operations, and wildlife.
- Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, that can be naturally-occurring or result from urban stormwater runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, and oil and gas production, mining, or farming.
- Pesticides and herbicides, that may come from a variety of sources such as agricultural runoff, urban stormwater runoff, and residential uses.
- Organic chemical contaminants, including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, that are byproducts of industrial processes and petroleum production, and can also come from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff, agricultural runoff, and septic systems.
- Radioactive contaminants, that can be naturally-occurring or be the result of oil and gas production and mining activities.

In order to ensure that the water is safe to drink, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and the State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) prescribe regulations that limit the amount of certain contaminants in water provided by public water systems. State Water Board regulations also establish limits for contaminants in bottled water that provide the same protection for public health.

Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate that water poses a health

# AGENDA ITEM VI.7
**REGULAR Board Meeting on May 20, 2024**

To: Board of Directors  
From: Tom R. Gray  
Date: May 15, 2024  
Subject: Update and discussion on State proposed “Water Budgets” for FOWD customers  

**Recommendation:**  
Information item – no staff recommendation.

**Discussion:**  
Urban water agencies in California are required to comply with water efficiency standards that are being developed from State Senate Bill 606 and State Assembly Bill 1688, touted as the framework for *Making Conservation a California Way of Life*. The proposed new regulations aim to squeeze additional water from urban water users who have been making significant strides to conserve water since 2013 – it can be documented that average FOWD customer water demand is currently over 20 percent less when compared to 2013. The new standards have yet to be finalized but are anticipated to be adopted in July of this year.

The Regional Water Authority will be giving a presentation regarding proposed “water budgets” on May 16, 2014. Slides for that presentation are attached for your information. The data presented in the slides contains provisional data which are known to have errors, but the presentation provides a representation of what may be expected.

**Policy Implications:**  
None at this time with potential future Policy impacts.

**Fiscal Impact:**  
None at this time with potential future financial impact.

May 16, 2024  

**BE WATER SMART**  
**Outline**  
- SB 606/AB 1668 Supplier Water Budgets  
- Non-Volumetric Requirements  
- Reporting, Compliance and Enforcement  
- Outstanding Concerns  
- RWA Leadership and Assistance  
- Next Steps  

---

**SB 606 and AB 1668 (2018)**  

**Water Agency Water Use Objective =**  
- Indoor Residential Use Standard  
- + Outdoor Residential Use Standard  
- + Commercial, Industrial, Landscape Standards  
- + Water Loss Standards  
- + (Variances)  
- + (Recycled Water Bonus)  

---

**BE WATER SMART**  
**Compliance**  

A couple of key points:  
- Water targets will be set based on the overall water use of water provider (targets will not be set for individual customers!)  
- Water agencies do not need to meet each standard individually but can choose what strategies to deploy to meet overall objective.  
  EXCEPT... Maybe water loss???  
- Targets rolled up to XXXX gallons and will be compared to relevant meter data to determine "over" or "under" budget

# AGENDA ITEM VI.8
**REGULAR Board Meeting on May 20, 2024**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tom R. Gray  
**Date:** May 16, 2024  
**Subject:** Discussion and possible action on additional funding for 2024 expenses  

**Recommendation:**  
Authorize the General Manager to transfer $325,000 from the reserves to cover 2024 expenses as detailed below.

**Discussion:**  
**System Maintenance / Repair - Damages (E24SMDAM)**  
Due to the ongoing damage repairs for the Transmission Main Break at the corner of Pershing Ave. and Chestnut Ave., costs will exceed the Board approved 2024 funding for System Maintenance / Repair – Damages of $25,000.  
Staff requests an additional $325,000 from the reserves to cover the total anticipated capital project cost. FOWD staff will be seeking recovery through ACWA JPIA.

**Policy Implications:**  
None.

**Fiscal Impact:**  
This fund transfer will decrease the 2024 reserves by $325,000.  
Final financial impact has yet to be determined - with FOWD staff anticipating partial recovery of costs for surface restoration from insurance claims.

![Out-of-Basin Transfers](https://via.placeholder.com/768x996.png?text=Out-of-Basin+Transfers)

**Out-of-Basin Transfers**  
**Decision #1**  
Under the proposed project for CEQA, the maximum annual recharge and recovery quantities would be still be 65 taf/yr and 55 taf/yr, respectively. (Those maximum amounts are based on 2024 discussions with Participating Agencies.)  
Voluntary Agreement commitments would range from 0-20 taf/yr.  
In years when no recovery actions would be taken to satisfy the VA, up to 55 taf/yr could be transferred out-of-basin (if all other conditions and requirements were met).  

**Staff Recommendation:** Include program-level analysis of out-of-basin transfers of up to 55 taf/yr. This also includes appropriate revisions to NOP and CEQA Project Description.

---

**Leave Behind vs Losses**  

**Losses** - Portion of banked water that migrates out of the basin to water bodies (accretions to streams) or adjacent basins (subsurface flow).  
Losses will be reviewed and revised if appropriate on a 5-year cycle in conjunction with updating GSPs.  

**Losses Benefit:**  
- Losses to streams/rivers result in accretions which lessens or eliminated stream depletion from Recovery.

**Page 162 of 177**
<!-- Page 163 -->
![Leave Behind vs Losses](https://via.placeholder.com/768x992.png?text=Leave+Behind+vs+Losses)

**Leave Behind vs Losses**

Leave Behind - Designated portion of banked groundwater that is set aside to support groundwater basin sustainability and enhance local water supply reliability.

Leave behind volume is never to be recovered as part of water banking operations.

Subject to 5% (or to be informed by modeling analysis) at time of recharge.

**Leave Behind Benefit:**
- Bolsters groundwater in storage
- Percent can be increased by Participating Agency(ies) to augment local groundwater conditions
- Benefits all users of the groundwater basin

### Leave Behind

**September 7, 2023, Program Committee Meeting Summary**

**Recommendation #4e: Recharge/Recovery – Leave Behind**

**Action/Decision:** At a minimum, there will be a "leave behind" for out-of-basin water transfers. This leave behind will be no less than 5 percent.

No objections. Vote: passed by unanimous consent.

**Staff Recommendation:** Include a leave-behind for all banked water for banked water made available for out of subbasin and external transfers and apply the leave-behind upfront. Percentage applied will be informed by WB analyses (to be conducted).

# SPLASH Alert
**ACWA JPIA Risk Management and Member Services Departments**

## CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY (CISA)
### Alert and Advisory
**May 2024**

In May 2024, CISA released an important alert that water and wastewater agencies may find beneficial. In addition, the JPIA is sharing another relevant NSA and CISA Advisory.

The JPIA's Risk Management Department monitors and shares cyber security resources with our members to assist in keeping current with potential cyber threats of critical water and wastewater infrastructure.

Cyber Liability Insurance is an essential component of the JPIA's risk management strategy. In Fall 2023, the JPIA's Member Services Department announced the complementary cybersecurity services of KYND and KnowBe4 for members participating in the JPIA's Cyber Liability Program. The implementation of KYND and KnowBe4 services will result in Member's reduced cyber vulnerabilities.

### NEW CISA ALERT
**Defending OT Operations Against Ongoing Pro-Russia Hacktivist Activity** – May 1, 2024. CISA, in collaboration with U.S. and international partners, published this joint fact sheet that provides information and mitigations associated with cyber operations conducted by pro-Russia hacktivists who seek to compromise industrial control systems (ICS) and small-scale operational technology (OT) systems in North American and European critical infrastructure sectors, including Water and Wastewater Systems, Dams, Energy, and Food and Agriculture Sectors.

### NSA AND CISA ADVISORY
**NSA and CISA Recommend Immediate Actions to Reduce Exposure Across all Operational Technologies and Control Systems** – October 2020. Internet-accessible operational technology (OT) assets are becoming more prevalent across the 16 U.S. critical sectors as companies increase remote operations and monitoring, accommodate a decentralized workforce, and expand outsourcing by skill areas such as instrumentation and control, OT asset management/maintenance, and in some cases, process operations and maintenance. The National Security Agency (NSA) along with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recommend that all DoD, NSS, DIB, and U.S. critical infrastructure facilities take immediate actions to secure their OT assets.
