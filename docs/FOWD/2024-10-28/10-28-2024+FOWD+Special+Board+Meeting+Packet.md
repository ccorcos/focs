# INTRODUCTION

The Fair Oaks Water District was originally formed as Fair Oaks Irrigation District in 1917. By 1979 residential development in the community had replaced all significant agricultural land; therefore, the Board of Directors passed a resolution declaring “irrigation district” no longer described the District’s actual functions and changed the name to Fair Oaks Water District (District). Even with the name change the District is legally structured as an irrigation district operating under the California Code, Division 11.

The District is a retail water agency supplying water to a population of approximately 40,000 people on 6,160 acres in Fair Oaks and a small portion of Orangevale. The District has reliable access to both surface water and groundwater, and delivers it through approximately 14,000 residential and commercial service connections.

## BUDGET OVERVIEW AND HIGHLIGHTS

The Board provided staff with general guidelines on developing the 2025 Proposed Budget at the August 19, 2024 Regular Board Meeting. The 2025 Proposed Budget was prepared by staff and presented at a public workshop held on October 21, 2024. The 2025 Proposed Budget will be presented to the full Board for approval and adoption at the Special Board meeting scheduled on October 28, 2024. The 2025 Proposed Budget includes a 5% water rate increase from 2024 rates that was previously adopted by the Board in 2022.

The primary purpose of the budget is to provide the Board of Directors and the District’s customers with an accurate picture of total available resources and planned spending for 2025. The budget includes setting program priorities and cash flow projections. The District maintains its financial records in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for annual reporting purposes set by the Government Accounting Standard Board (GASB).

### Water Rate Hearing Process

District staff developed a five-year financial plan and presented it to the District Budget Committee for review on August 30, 2022 and September 19, 2022. The Board proposed.

# Expenses

The District’s total estimated expenses for 2025 are $19,253,300. These expenses include cost for the meter maintenance program, facility and equipment replacement, and transmission and distribution system improvements. It is projected that 89% of total revenue from water sales will be spent on capital investment in 2025.

The District projects a 2.9% decrease in total operating expenses for 2025 Proposed Budget ($9,300,100) over the 2024 Adjusted Budget ($9,573,064). The decrease is primarily due to net decrease in system maintenance and repairs, water supply costs, Board expenses, and utilities.

The breakdown of expenses by major expense categories is presented in the table below.

| Fair Oaks Water District | 2025 Budgeted Expenses |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Salaries                  | $ 2,941,600           |

![Reserves and Designations](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Reserves+and+Designations)

**Reserves and Designations**

The District’s reserves consist of restricted and designated funds. The District’s restricted reserves include capacity system fees.

The District’s 2025 Proposed Budget projects a net loss of ($5,087,700). The District will use reserve(s)/designation(s) to offset the ($5,087,700) projected deficit. The District’s current reserve policy is to maintain a total of $3.1M (four months of operating expenses). The District projects a year-end total cash reserve balance of $4.8M. See reserve balance summary for more detail on pages 40-41.

**BUDGET PRINCIPLES AND PROCESS OVERVIEW**

Budget planning begins annually at mid-calendar year, following completion of the audit for the fiscal year ending December 31, and a review of the first six months' of actual revenues and expenses for the current fiscal year. In July, the District's senior staff provides updated information for the timing and costs of scheduled activities over the next year. The impact on operations of capital projects, legislation and economic factors are reviewed and communicated to the General Manager.

The budget is developed through several processes. The Board of Directors provides certain priorities and guidelines to the General Manager. The General Manager communicates these criteria to staff. The District’s annual budget is then developed consistent with District’s mission, goals, policies and water demands.

The financial model is updated to determine whether adequate funds exist to meet requirements; while maintaining Board approved reserves over the budget period. All unfunded needs will be documented, if any. The budget and forecast will be prepared by the staff and General Manager to ensure consistency with District policies. A Budget Committee, comprised of two Board of Directors and staff, will then review the draft document and assist in preparing the final document for the public information sessions, public hearing, and Board adoption.

A discussion draft of the budget document will typically be reviewed by the Board in August. Customers are notified at least 45 days in advance about a public hearing if a new rate increase is proposed. One or more public meetings usually occur in October, to allow extended discussion on major issues. The budget process culminates in its adoption at a public meeting normally scheduled in November.

Any budget amendments required during the year will be submitted to the Board of Directors at a board meeting for public discussion and possible Board action.

![Budget Control](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Budget+Control)

**Budget Control**

The approved budget is entered in the District's accounting system, which will provide up to date financial information throughout the year.

The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the General Manager, establishes overall budgets and policy programs. The approved budget is then monitored by the respective department managers.

The General Manager controls the budget at the operating level. While line-item expenses are in some cases shown in the budget worksheets, the intent of this information is to provide internal budget monitoring controls for staff, and are not intended to be explicit appropriations by the Board of Directors. Upon request from staff, and approved by the Board of Directors, reserve funds may be transferred or added to throughout the fiscal year. This bottom-line approach to budget management is intended to prioritize overall District spending, while making senior staff accountable for internal operations and expenses.

Capital projects and program budgets are adopted for specific non-operational needs of the District. These budgets often span multiple budget years. For each project or program, subsequent Board approval is sometimes required for approving bids and contracts.

**Basis of Budgeting**

The statistical sections of the budget are prepared on a cash basis and include expenditures for capital outlay and the principal and interest portions of debt service, while non-cash expenditures such as depreciation and bad debt write-off are excluded.

# District Principles, Goals and Objectives

The purpose of the District's financial planning is to demonstrate fiscal solvency and a balanced budget over the long-term, to provide early warning signs of adverse trends, and to serve as a resource for financial planning and policy making. The annual budget utilizes detailed assumptions, such as population, new connections, infrastructure age, parcel area, and historical and projected operating trends while maintaining consistency with District-wide goals and objectives as well as Board approved fiscal and operational policies.

Growth projections are prepared based on past experience and are reviewed for consistency with the Sacramento County General Plan and economic development forecasts. A financial model (discussed later) then generates revenue forecasts and inflates or deflates future year operating and project costs on a consistent basis for all operating activities. Budget projections may or may not occur as predicted, depending upon changes in the economy, future service level changes, and mandates from other government agencies. In order to keep the District Board and management up to date, District staff compares the approved budget with actual expenses monthly.

## District Principles

### Customer and Community Service
The District is dedicated to excellence in customer service, to representing the community’s interest and to serving as a role model for integrity, dependability, enthusiasm and professionalism. These objectives are translated into functional level objectives for the District’s staff. To fulfill these goals, the District continually develops problem solving policies and procedures that benefit the District’s customers and community.

### Planning and Preparedness
The District believes that proper programmatic and fiscal planning allows the organization to provide the utmost service benefit to its customers. Strategically planning District activities results in a structured and supportable allocation of resources and reduces cost, down time, and customer inconvenience.

### Quality
The District is dedicated to providing quality service and long-term value to the community and its customers. Long-term value is not always synonymous with cost. Our customers deserve quality, and expect to pay fairly for it. We want to build a utility that generates community pride, yet provides a value to the ratepayer.

### Teamwork
Delivering high quality water and reliable service and maintaining excellence in customer service requires a diverse set of knowledge and disciplines. The District believes teams of people can accomplish more than similar numbers of people acting alone. Through

**Collaborative Efforts**  
The District is stronger, more competent, more sensitive, more considerate, and provides more consistent service.

### Setting Priorities  
The District believes in putting first things first. In matters of priority, the District's customers, both internal and external, will always come first. We believe we must take care of our customers. In prioritizing our activities, we will place matters of safety and public health protection first, matters of system and property value retention second, and matters of aesthetics third.

### Continuous Improvement  
The District believes in continuous improvement. We believe in life-long learning and will create an environment where the status quo will be challenged. We will ask questions, execute, and learn. In the process of improving, we will take reasonable risks and make mistakes. We will always be honest about risk and own our mistakes.

### District Goals and Objectives  
While the District operates by a fundamental set of overriding principles, the fiscal and operational functions of the organization are guided by the District’s long-term goals and objectives.

#### Enhance Reliability of Water Supply and Delivery  
As its core mission, the District is dedicated to providing a high quality, reliable source of water supply to the community. As part of this goal, the District has outlined the following specific objectives:  
- Continue to provide leadership in regional conjunctive use, and drought planning opportunities.  
- Continue in an active role in groundwater contamination cleanup.  
- Provide an updated system Master Plan every five years.  
- Continue with best management practices for water quality and conservation.  
- Continue promoting and educating customers about water issues.

#### Support Employee Development and Professionalism  
The District believes that the power of the organization and its ability to meet its goals and objectives lies in its human resources. As such, the District is keenly aware of the necessity of supporting its employees in their professional development. To that end, the District has defined the following specific objectives:  
- Continue to promote education, formal, and informal training in matters of communication and public relations, finance, management, leadership, and computer science.  
- Continue the requirement that all water system operators be State Certified.

- Continue to provide all employees with a respectful workplace, providing fair and reasonable compensation.

**Promote Multi-District Resource Sharing Opportunities**  
Given the constant economic pressures and the mission to provide the most cost-effective service to the community, the District is committed to identifying and promoting resource sharing opportunities. In so doing, the District strives to balance cost savings, efficiency and customer benefit with minimal service disruption. As part of this goal, the District has defined the following specific objectives:
- Continue to participate in RWA’s collaborative water conservation activities.
- Continue to work with the San Juan Family of Water Agencies on mutually compatible activities and services, including grant applications.
- Continue to work with the local community in areas that provide customer benefit.

**District Financial Policies**  
The District Board of Directors has established a number of financial policies to guide the organization in its budgeting and operating activities. The significant financial policies are summarized (discussed) below.

**Budget Preparation**  
An annual budget on a calendar year basis shall be prepared by the General Manager and approved by the Board of Directors.

The amended proposed budget will then be reviewed and discussed at a public meeting scheduled for November.

The emergency designation was established to fund District fixed asset, operating and maintenance expenses not currently budgeted. The designated fund balance has been set at a minimum of four months of operating costs. Annual contributions will be designated in the budget process to maintain a minimum of four months of operating costs.

## Connection Fee Reserve

The Connection Fee Reserve was established to segregate fees charged to new development and direct the money collected to capacity enhancement projects in compliance with AB1600. AB1600 does not designate a target reserve balance. Annual contributions will depend upon new construction within the District. Additionally, interest earnings will be added to this balance on a monthly basis, using the District’s earnings rate on investments.

## Certificate of Participation (COP) Reserve

The Certificate of Participation (COP) Reserve was established to segregate certificate of participation (COP) reserves according to governing documents. The proceeds of a COP issue establish the maximum COP reserve available for use. COP reserve balances are created upon issuance of debt. These balances are used according to the COP’s installment purchase agreement. Use of the COP reserves will be accounted for on a monthly basis, according to the COP’s installment purchase agreement. Contributions will occur upon issuance of COP’s. Additionally, interest earnings will be added to the balance on a monthly basis, using the District’s earnings rate on investments.

## Investment of District Funds:

The District established the investment policy to provide a clear understanding of the objectives, policies and guidelines for the investment of District’s idle or surplus funds. This policy is used to effectively manage the District’s available cash and investment portfolio in conformity with the provisions of California Government Code Section 53600.

- The General Manager or other persons designated by the Board shall invest idle funds not immediately needed by the District within the limitations of the California Government Code.

- The primary goals, in priority order, of investment activities shall be safety, diversification, liquidity, and rate of return.

- This policy shall be reviewed and updated annually by the Board of Directors.

Authorization of Expenses:

The authorization of expenses policy was established to monitor spending of District’s funds in accordance with the approved budget. Expense authority is generally delegated to the General Manager by the Board of Directors through the adopted annual operating budget and through board policy. Expenses requiring Board approval are brought to the Board for approval through the regular Board meeting process.

The commodity charge covers the variable costs of water service, which fluctuates according to actual water use. The commodity charge represents approximately 22% of the total water bill and is designed to cover the costs of water purchases, pumping, treatment and conservation costs.

## Other Revenues

### Connection Fees
Connection fees represent the cost to connect to Fair Oaks Water District distribution system for new customers; the funds collected are restricted by AB1600 to capacity enhancement projects. The District service area projected to experience little growth in 2025. Most new service connections will be derived from in-fill developer projects. Connection fees are a small portion of the District’s revenues and are projected to be a small amount relative to other revenues. Future connection fee revenues will be minimum due to the built-out nature of the FOWD service area and limited land available for in-fill projects.

### Interest Revenue
The District invests its funds in accordance with the California Government Code, Section 53600, Chapter 4 – Financial Affairs and the District’s investment policy 5070; with a majority invested in LAIF (Local Agency Investment Fund). Interest earnings fluctuate based on rates and cash balances.

## District Expenses
The District’s expenses can be categorized into three major groups:
- Water Supply
- Capital Projects
- Operating Costs

### 2025 Projected Expenses by Major Category
| Category                | Amount      |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Operating Costs        | $ 6,974,600 |
| Water Supply           | $ 2,325,500 |
| Capital Program Expenses| $ 9,953,200 |
| **Total**             | **$ 19,253,300** |

The following pie chart illustrates the percentage of the total District expenses allocated to each of these categories.

# Reserves and Designations

Reserves and designations are established to minimize adverse annual and multi-year budgetary impacts from anticipated and unanticipated District expenses. The District’s long-term goal is to finance major capital improvements on a “pay as you go” plan, as opposed to issuing new debt. The reserves and designation are designed to assist in this goal. See pages 13-14 for specific definitions on each reserve. The following chart and graph illustrate the District’s ending cash reserves and designations.

# APPENDIX B – GLOSSARY OF TERMS

**Assets** – Assets can include cash, investments, inventory, property, pipelines, long-term agreements, or accounts receivables.

**Budget** – The primary purpose of the Budget is to provide the Board and public with an estimate of the total available resources of the District, to set spending and program priorities, and to account for and allocate cash flows. A budget is viewed as a planning tool that can and often does change over the fiscal cycle.

**Budget Committee** – A Committee appointed by the Board president to develop and review the budget and proposed rates prior to presenting to the full Board.

**Capacity Costs** – A component of the metered rate, which includes fixed water costs, which vary in relation to the capacity of the water system. The sizing of the water system is based on the potential demand each customer could place on the water system. Capacity costs are allocated to customers based on the size (hydraulic capacity) of the water meter (or service connection). A customer with a larger water meter will bear a larger allocation of fixed capacity-related costs than one with a smaller water meter. Capacity costs include debt service, maintenance costs, capital outlay, meters, public fire hydrants, etc. and are included as a component of the fixed metered service charge.

**Capital Program** – Equipment replacement, meter installations, well improvements, pipeline improvements and service line upgrades are components of the capital program.

**CCF** – One CCF stands for one hundred cubic feet. One hundred cubic feet equals 748 gallons. Metered water use is measured in cubic or one hundred cubic feet.

**Commodity Costs** – Variable costs of water delivery that vary with the amount of actual water use. Water purchase, pumping, treatment, and conservation costs are some examples of commodity costs.

**Connection Fees** – Represent the cost to ‘buy into’ the FOWD water system and are restricted for capacity enhancement projects by AB1600.

**CPI** – Consumer Price Index is a general measure of inflation of consumer products, but does not account for inflation in several building related products regularly used by the District.

**COP** – Certificates of Participation proceeds from the sale of debt. Repayment of principal and interest is scheduled annually, usually over 20 years.

**Customer Costs** – Fixed costs of water delivery that tend to vary as a function of the number of customers being serviced. Examples of customer service costs include meter reading, billing, and customer service.

**Debt Service** – Payments of principal and interest on indebtedness incurred to finance the construction of a capital project.

**Designated Funds** – A separate set of accounts used to record receipts and use of money designated or restricted by the Board for specific purposes. The District’s finances are distributed into separate funds required by state or federal government, or by prudent finance practices. Designated fund types include the following:

- **Certificate of Participation (C.O.P.) Reserve** is funds received from COP proceeds earmarked for a specific purpose. Financing agreements typically restrict these funds.
  
- **C.O.P. Retirement Reserve** funds are used to repay the principal and interest on indebtedness, as well as any fees associated with debt issuance.
  
- **Connection Fee Reserve** funds are connection and related fees segregated according to AB1600. These funds can be used for expanding water system capacity.
  
- **Emergency Designation** funds are set funds designated by the Board to be used for emergencies as defined by the Board.

**Expense** – A term used to describe the operating costs of the District.

**Expenditure** – A term used to describe any type of authorized District costs, either operational or capital in nature.

**Fiscal Year** – The 12 month accounting period used by some governmental agencies, usually from July 1, through the following June 30. The District accounting period is from January 1 through December 31, and coincides with the calendar year.

**Fixed Assets** – The assets of the District representing pipeline, wells, tanks, meters, equipment, furniture, and property.

**Fixed Service Charge** – A component of metered rates that includes customer costs and capacity costs. These charges vary based upon the meter size since meter size affects capacity costs.

**Fund Balance** – The excess of the total assets of a fund over its total liabilities. The fund balance does not equal designated cash reserves.

**Interest Income** – Income earned on the investment of available cash balances.

**Liabilities** – Amount of funds obligated by the District, such as accounts payable, deferred revenues, debt service payments or amounts due other funds.

**Operational Costs** – Costs for labor, contractual services, repairs and maintenance, electricity, water purchases, internal services, supplies and other expenses. These expenses are generally predictable and consistent with the service demands of the District.

**Other Income** – Includes property sales and income from developments that are not assignable to distinct activities or funds.

**Projects** – Long-term investments in public facilities and infrastructure; also known as capital improvements. Amounts spent may widely vary from year to year.
