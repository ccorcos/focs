**AGENDA ITEMS**  

**I. CALL TO ORDER**  
- Board President McRae called the meeting to order at 6:30 p.m.  

**II. PUBLIC COMMENT**  
- Board President McRae stated that thirty minutes will be given to this category. He asked for everyone to be respectful and civil. Given the amount of people present, not everyone will have the opportunity to talk. He stated that each side will have fifteen minutes to express their opinion.  

- An unknown visitor objected to the idea of giving equal time to each side. He suggested an agenda for proper debate, the notion of cutting out public comment makes no sense and is offensive. They are not here for Mr. Corcos.  

- Board President McRae inquired if this will be a regular agenda item for next month.  

- General Manager Gray stated that it will be on next month’s agenda if directed to do so. Public Comment is set for tonight, it is usually limited to three minutes per person. Typical protocol, according to the Brown Act, is that if it’s not on the agenda, there’s  
<!-- Page 3 -->
- no public debate.
  
- Board President McRae stated this will be a good way to move forward.

- An unknown visitor suggested a head count of each opinion. Those in favor and those against the construction of the yard.

- General Manager Gray responded it sounded logical.

- An unknown visitor suggested to split the meetings into two. One meeting dedicated for those who are in favor and another meeting for those who are against it. He asked who is in favor of the yard increase.

- Board President McRae stated FOWD is not increasing the yard.

- Visitor Corcos stated that if he is not done in three minutes, someone else could relinquish their time so he can finish his speech. Visitor Corcos stated he is a long-time resident, ratepayer and property owner in the Downtown Village. For the record, he stated there are ninety-two (92) people present today.

- Visitor Nan Danford stated she is the 2023 President of Fair Oaks Village Enhancement Committee (FOVEC). On behalf of FOVEC board, they unanimously asked for the maintenance yard to be moved out of the Village.

- Visitor Deborah Stark stated she has been asked to represent the community for young families and the next generation. The yard does not fit what they are striving for, it distracts from everything they have become and are becoming. The yard belongs somewhere but not here. She is concerned that the estimated $10 million for the construction of the new yard will end up being more. She would like FOWD to justify their spending, raising the rates to potentially 25% within the next several years and the operating debt. She would like to be shown where the general fund is going and why.

- General Manager Gray stated there has been a lot of discussion about finance and he would like to make a clarification. FOWD has the lowest water rates in the entire Sacramento Region and over 100% less than the San Juan Water District (SJWD), over 80% less than the Carmichael Water District and about 70% less than the Citrus Heights Water District. All Districts get water from the same source. Hearing about the mismanagement and the funding, sounds a little disingenuous.

- An unknown visitor stated he is not here for the rates; he does not want the yard here.

- General Manager Gray suggested the public see what the District has been good at.

- An unknown visitor stated that indeed FOWD has the lowest rates, but FOWD also wants to raise them 25% and spend a lot of money unnecessarily. She does not want.

- the yard there and too bad if it’s repetitive. They do not want an industrial park where they live, keep it out of their backyard.
- Board President McRae stated he has a question for Staff. There’s been a couple of comments that FOWD is in some kind of operational debt and he would like Staff to clarify that.
- General Manager Gray stated that FOWD has incurred no debt. However, like every CalPERS member public agencies, FOWD has an underfunded retirement plan. FOWD has zero debt and the lowest rates, even after raising the rates, FOWD will still be the lowest in the region.
- An unknown visitor stated that FOWD’s budget report states otherwise.
- General Manager Gray responded that if the Board decides to place this item on the agenda, he can make a presentation and clarify any misinformation statements.
- Director Marx stated that the last presenter mentioned egos and condensing looks, he is happy that people are here. He lives one-hundred yards across the street, has been here for thirty years. He is very aware of the Village and is supportive of doing the right thing. The Board is happy to listen and take the pulse of the community, The Board is not condescending to anyone.
- Board President McRae asked General Manager Gray for this item to be on next month’s agenda.
- Visitor David McFarlane encouraged to have the yard moved. He asked for the yard to be moved to an industrial area.
- Visitor John Whitney thanked the Board for all their hard work and he would love the opportunity to work together. Maybe the yard was a good plan at the time, but sometimes adjustments are needed along the way. Adjustments are needed now.
- Visitor Chris Grenz stated Folsom pays around $36 per month for water. When there is a public facility like this one next door, it brings a tax base. There are residential and commercial zones. If the yard is moved, new development will bring more taxes to the area.
- Visitor Daneece Fraizer stated she agrees with everything that has already been said. She watches dump trucks pull in, for this reason, the yard should be moved to a less congested place. She asked for FOWD to reconsider their plan and move the yard.
- Visitor Brian Fischer stated that he would like to honor a couple of board members, including Board President McRae, who took a walk with him. He implores all the Board to come on another walk. It only takes three board members to really come to the table and be with them. He is asking for those three votes to slow down and involve more voices. They would like to find out how the yard could be shared with Fair Oaks Recreation & Park District and how FOWD could collaborate with other counties and agencies that could lower the cost and create new efficiency and ideas by collaborating on equipment yard.
- Visitor Keith Walter stated he is thankful that FOWD has provided them with high
<!-- Page 5 -->
![Page 5 of 18](attachment://image.png)

- quality water and low rates for a long time. The yard was probably a well-intended idea that has simply gotten out of hand. He stated that Board President McRae stated at the beginning he would like to give equal time to the groups and Visitor Walter stated he would like to encourage him to find someone in the room that is in favor of the yard. There is no basis for this construction to be a good idea, financially, from the Village perspective and from a tax perspective. Everything indicates that it would be more cost-effective to move the yard out of the Village.
  
- General Manager Gray asked visitor Keith Walter to send him information that proves it’s more cost-effective for FOWD to move the yard elsewhere.
  
- Visitor Keith Walter said of course.
  
- Visitor Kaelee Cornell stated this is not a strong opposition, it’s a strong willingness to work together and to find a solution that works for both parties. She would like the notes to reflect that although not every single person had the opportunity to speak tonight, every single one should count as a voice spoken for the opinion they came here to voice. Meeting notes should reflect every person that attended the meeting tonight.
  
- Visitor Wes Trunnell asked how many people have read the Fair Oaks Neighborhood Preservation Area (NPA) and Special Planning Area (SPA). He mentioned that if this project is not built and the FOWD is forced out, they will end up with an empty lot, it will not make economic sense.
  
- There were visitors who interrupted visitor Wes Trunnell when he was making comments.
  
- General Manager Gray intervened and stated everyone’s viewpoint should be respected.
  
- Visitor Wayne Nickel asked that whatever FOWD decides to do, to please not make it Carmichael; it cannot get any worse than that. He is here to get educated. He understands the restaurant industry and understands what is going on with the parking. He asked what comes from a new building, and what will the Village get.
  
- Visitor Jennifer Webb stated she got involved in the Parks Recreation Foundation work and they are trying to fill out what this taxpayer bond funded project is doing. She thinks that by moving the yard it will keep the momentum going.
  
- Visitor Denise explained that she feels that the Village is wonderful but it’s too small. There are too many people that would like to spend time there, but they have outgrown it and more space is needed. This street is what is needed, this expansion is needed.
  
- Visitor Krystal Safona stated the Village has outgrown this space and everyone hates talking about the parking issue. There is nowhere for people to park. FOWD’s yard could be shared to have a better infrastructure and to support people coming to the Village and to support those that work here as well.
  
- Visitor Dan introduced himself and mentioned the #TajMahal and #GarageMahal. He pointed out what Gary and Leon have done for the community. He does not care about the money he pays for water. Water rates is not what everyone here is talking about, it’s about the Village. He will get the #GarageMahal trending if it’s the last thing he’ll.
<!-- Page 6 -->
![Page 6 of 18](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+6+of+18)

- do. He asked the Board to please listen to what everyone is saying. This plan started after the Taj Mahal was built, but he does not want the Garage Mahal to be built. The plan started a long time ago and things change.
- An unknown visitor stated that if this project had been brought out to the public, there would be a lot of people outside. The majority of people do not want the construction of the yard.
- Visitor Rick Tower mentioned that if we look across the United States, California and Sacramento area, towns and villages are either stagnating, thriving, or dying. To some extent, it is due to the opportunities and availabilities of amenities in the hub. Citrus Heights and Orangevale do not have a hub. He believes a relocation of the yard will allow Fair Oaks to supplement the opportunities to build this hub and enhance its attractiveness.
- Visitor Alison Kalsbeek stated that she and her husband are both avid cyclists and there is nothing more terrifying than cycling to the Village and getting caught behind a dump truck or trying to dodge people ferociously looking for parking, this is very dangerous.
- Visitor Susannah Martin stated she has two daughters, and they continuously share with her about safety issues. It is important to remember that they are here for the future as well. Wise decisions must be made, especially when it affects the next generations.
- Visitor Ryan Parra stated it does not take long to understand that land and real estate here is very limited. He believes the yard’s land should be utilized in a manner that will enhance the quality of life of everyone in the room and in the town.
- An unknown visitor stated that when they go after the yard, they also go after a historical building and are basically asking FOWD to extricate themselves from the Village. They own the Fair Oaks Historical Office Building, they can turn that into parking. They are being asked to leave entirely.
- Visitor Leon Corcos mentioned that if people look at FOWD’s online power point presentation, it stated the following: more public interaction, to move the yard out of the area, the design does not fit the design of the Village and promises were not kept. These concerns were not addressed, a box was checked that they listened but no changes were made. That lot will not be an empty lot.
- An unknown visitor commented on the FOWD’s budget, coming from a construction background, asked if FOWD has looked at the cost with inflation. Construction has gone up 30% in the last two years. Has the $10 million budget taken that into consideration.
- General Manager Gray stated he does not know where the $10 million came from.
- An unknown visitor asked if there is a bid in place for the yard project and if it has reassessed the cost given the inflation rate.
- An unknown visitor stated that the bid and the approval can be looked up from the county and it states $10 million.
- An unknown visitor stated that when someone applies for a permit, an evaluation must
<!-- Page 7 -->
- General Manager Gray stated FOWD not having detailed drawings at this time.
- Unknown visitors commented that this is a good time to stop the project.
- An unknown visitor mentioned she is in real estate, when trying to sell a house in Fair Oaks, she points out the Village because it’s unique. Nothing has what Fair Oaks has here.
- Visitor Colleen Sugarman introduced herself as a former FOVEC chair member. She knows FOWD has been a good neighbor and they have helped out in the past. She trusts that FOWD will take their needs and will consider them deeply, because FOWD has done it in the past.
- General Manager Gray stated that it’s a powerful statement and if the public allows it, FOWD will do a presentation at the next board meeting. The FOWD owns four parcels in the Village and he would like to think that three of the parcels are some of the better looking and well maintained parcels in the Village. FOWD invested in this building before the new wave of investment in the FO Village. FOWD has one of the best producing wells north of the American River, right in the Village. FOWD reached out to the Fair Oaks Historic Society (FOHS), which did not have a home, and offered them to home in a FOWD owned property to benefit the community. FOWD is not a landlord, FOHS invested in improving the property and it looks good. FOWD wanted FOHS to have a presence in the Village. FOWD wants to add to the positive reputation of what they have done for the Village with improvements to existing Corporation Yard.
- Visitor Robin Kalsbeek asked people to raise their hands if they do not want the yard.
- Board President McRae stated he believes ninety-two people had their hand raised. Given that this is the number of attendees Mr. Corcos mentioned at the beginning of the meeting.
- Visitor Wes Trunnell stated he is neither for nor against the yard being constructed.
- Visitor Allen Cooper mentioned having a deep sense of appreciation for FOWD’s leadership. It is worth knowing that Fair Oaks has low rates. There is no doubt the yard will be a pretty building but it’s just not in the right place. FOWD chose to move forward with the planning process at a time where the federal government said not to leave the house, when everything was shut down. And yet, FOWD was debating the greatest issue of the residents’ backyard—this does not sit well. FOWD needs to make this right and has to be accountable for that. It was not the right thing to do at that time.
- Board President McRae asked if anybody else would like to make a comment. He thanked everyone for attending the meeting and voicing their comments. This will formally be added as an agenda item for next month’s FOWD board meeting.
- General Manager Gray stated that on behalf of the Board and the community, he would like to ask everyone to have an open mind and to listen to each other. He would like the public to give the FOWD an opportunity to answer the public’s questions. In regard to the meeting.
<!-- Page 8 -->

to the public outreach, he personally went from door-to-door hand-delivering notices and talking to neighbors. Some of these neighbors provided their input and many of their issues were mitigated. Some called this morning to state their support of the FOWD Corporation Yard Redevelopment Project.

- Various visitors asked where these neighbors are.

- An unknown visitor stated to be one of the neighbors that General Manager Gray knocked on her door. She is curious to know how many new neighbors Fair Oaks has gained.

- Visitor Leon Corcos asked if someone got a handshake from General Manager Gray. He counted one person.

- General Manager Gray asked to allow him to give his presentation at the next board meeting.

- Visitor Leon Corcos inquired if the public information could come directly to them. He would like to have the documents before General Manager Gray’s presentation, a public records request from FOVEC. They would like to do their own pitch and would like as much information as possible. It has been very difficult to get information from FOWD.

- Visitor Tarmae inquired if they could send questions to FOWD so they could be addressed at the March board meeting, so there would be no need to keep coming in and ask to be included in the agenda. She would like to know how the public outreach was handled, when the special permit expires and if a renewal is necessary, what the deadlines are, etc. They want to know about the process, they want transparency.

- Visitor Leon Corcos stated that FOWD’s attorneys stated it will take ninety (90) days to receive any information, which seems ridiculous.

- Visitor Tarmae stated that she would like this information so the March meeting could be productive. She would like information, not just a presentation.

- Visitor James Sofona inquired if there is a message board or inbox they can utilize.

- General Manager Gray stated he receives a lot of contact about this issue and that the FOWD has contact information for customer on the FOWD website. FOWD does not have improvement plans for the project yet, only development plan approval from the County of Sacramento. The improvement plans are being worked on now. Then an engineer cost estimate for the project will be completed based off County of Sacramento approved improvement plans - followed by construction bids.

- An unknown visitor asked to give them what FOWD does have.

- General Manager Gray responded that FOWD wants to provide accurate and truthful information; FOWD is not trying to hide anything. FOWD will not tell the public how to feel about the project. Information will be given in a fair and reasonable manner. Sometimes it may not be available and sometimes it may not be what you want.

- An unknown visitor asked how soon FOWD is proposing to build this yard. She asked for FOWD to change the direction of the current path and start looking at other
<!-- Page 9 -->
![Page 9 of 18](attachment://page9.png)

alternatives. Investigate how long it would take to move the yard out of the Village.

- General Manager Gray stated he will try to address questions at the next board meeting.
- An unknown visitor asked if the venue could be changed to a bigger venue.
- Board President McRae replied he will let staff look into this request to see if it’s a possibility.
- Visitor Ched Corcos stated he appreciates what FOWD has done so far. He does not care about other districts’ rates; he wants cheap rates. He wants to know where the money is coming from, where is it going and what’s the budget. This is something FOWD can give to the public, that’s all they are asking for. Rates went up 25%, he would like to know where the money is going. He reviewed the annual budget and understood that FOWD is $6 million in the hole, he is curious to see how this is not true.
- Visitor Danielle James stated she does not want the yard in the Village.
- Board President McRae stated there is a sign in sheet in the back of the room. He would like every attendee to be accounted for, given that they took the time to come to this board meeting.
- An unknown visitor inquired about the plan to dig up water meters and replace them. He would like to see some kind of plan to be in place that addresses how 14,000 meters will be dug and replaced in less than twenty years. The meters should be on the Capital Budget list. There is $3 million invested in meters, and yet it is not on the list.
- General Manager Gray responded that FOWD does have a plan. Meters are capitalized and depreciated.
- Visitor Krystal inquired if the current plan has any possibility to increase the footprint. She heard that FOWD purchased the land that Sunflower is currently on.
- General Manager Gray responded that this is untrue, it’s propaganda.

IV. PRESENTATION & CORRESPONDENCE  
1. None.  

V. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: OLD BUSINESS

   - General Manager Gray stated that about two years ago, Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District Office (FORPD), Fair Oaks Rotary and San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD) worked together on a project to upgrade the sports fields at the Northridge Elementary School in the FOWD service area. These groups requested participation from FOWD. In accordance with our mission, FOWD cannot just donate money; it must be in accordance with FOWD’s mission. FOWD has an existing well on the Northridge campus that is at its end of its useful life and there is no room to redrill there. FOWD agreed to complete water improvements there required by the project in exchange for additional well land. He is happy to report that all the work is done. The SJUSD, on January 9, 2023, took action to provide
<!-- Page 11 -->
![Page 11 of 18](attachment://page11.png)

the land to FOWD. The agreement has been fulfilled. There is an exhibit included in the board packet that shows the land.
- Board President McRae inquired if the land is an easement.
- General Manager Gray responded that an easement - which is a better acquisition for FOWD.

2. Update and discussion on the FOWD and FORPD agreement to install a water main in support of FORPD Bond Projects
- General Manager Gray stated that when FORPD received the bond and planned to do major improvements with the Village area, it impacted an existing water main that FOWD had in the area. FOWD executed an agreement with FORPD where FOWD would fund the relocation of the water main in exchange for a future well site. The work has been completed and reconciled. The report included in the board packet reflects the breakdown of the expenses and the amount FOWD agreed to pay. The next step is to negotiate payment with FORPD beyond what was in the agreement.
- Board President McRae inquired if this would be a negotiation.
- General Manager Gray responded it would be a negotiation. Some work and repairs were done that were not part of the agreement, it will be discussed with FORPD.

3. Update and discussion on the SJWD Wholesale Master Plan Analysis Project
- General Manager Gray stated that SJWD is FOWD’s wholesale water provider. The SJWD has been developing a master plan for providing water supply over the next twenty to thirty years; FOWD needs to provide comments on the draft plan. FOWD received notification on February 16, 2023, that the plan was ready for comments. They would like to receive FOWD’s comments by March 3, 2023. He will request more time to provide comments from the SJWD.

4. Update and discussion on the SJWD Cost Allocation Plan Project
- General Manager Gray stated that FOWD pays about 23 cents of every dollar SJWD spends in wholesale operations, making this FOWD’s highest operating cost. SJWD has never had a formal plan for allocating costs to retail and wholesale, but they agreed to develop a plan when requested to do so by the FOWD and CHWD. The process has been ongoing and there is a meeting scheduled for tomorrow.
- Board President McRae stated that this is moving in the right direction.

5. Update and discussion on the FOWD and SJWD Water Banking Project
- General Manager Gray stated that the board packet includes a copy of first-generation ideas that came from SJWD, this represents positive movement. The next step is to do a formal letter for the 2x2 meetings.
<!-- Page 12 -->
6. Update and discussion on SJWD water right water place of use issues
- General Manager Gray mentioned this is an ongoing issue. Sacramento Suburban Water District and Carmichael Water District (CWD) are looking at merging. Their documents mentioned that CWD has place of use rights to SJWD’s surface water, which is the most precious water in the state of California. The documents provided to the FOWD do not back up that claim. On behalf of our ratepayers, FOWD is trying to protect the most senior rights in the state of California. There is a scheduled 2x2 meeting next week that FOWD is planning to attend.

7. Update and discussion on the FOWD Groundwater Well Projects
- General Manager Gray stated that FOWD received grant funding for both projects. FOWD is required to provide quarterly updates; they are included in the board packet.
- Director Petersen inquired if the schedule for New York groundwater well has been accepted by DWR.
- General Manager Gray responded he believes so. In general, due to COVID, there is flexibility. Due to material availability, many projects have been delayed.
- Director Petersen asked if the original New York Well has been destroyed.
- General Manager Gray responded it has.
- Director Petersen inquired if FOWD had any water quality problems with the original well.
- General Manager Gray responded that there were not actual water issues. There were issues because it was an oil lubed well.
- Director Petersen inquired if the new well has been drilled.
- General Manager Gray responded it has.
- Board President McRae inquired if this well has been designed for potential aquifer storage.
- General Manager Gray stated that it has been designed for aquifer storage and recovery. FOWD’s groundwater basin is a big reservoir, in wet years surface water would be injected into the ground. It gets stored there and released when it’s dry.
- An unknown visitor commented he is here to get educated. He inquired if there is a map showing each number of the wells and how they operate.
- General Manager Gray responded yes and no. After 9/11, the location of water supply is not publicly acknowledged. Some other general information about FOWD is public information.

6. **Employee Update**
   - Completion of all employee performance evaluations.
   - Human Resource Administrator Simon commented that the performance evaluations were robust, the most robust process she has experienced. Its uniqueness involves giving the employee the opportunity to open up and lead the first thirty minutes of the meeting, releasing any tension or nervousness. It is a great process.
   - Operations Manager Huckaby commented this process takes a long time because it’s taken seriously. The questions are intended to provide a dialogue. It usually takes about one to two hours per employee.
   - Technical Services Manager Siebensohn commented that the goals set for each employee is for the betterment of the District.
   - Director Marx inquired if there is any mid-year check in with the employees.
   - Operations Manager Huckaby responded the employee “check-in” is done on a quarterly basis.
   - Finance Manager Ha-Ly agrees that it’s a time-consuming process, but it gives her the opportunity to learn more about employees and the type of work they do in the field.
   - General Manager Gray stated that it is an exhausting process and it’s worthwhile. These evaluations are about employees, and he wants to ensure employees have been heard and respected.
   - General Manager Gray mentioned that FOWD still does not have a Superintendent. This position connects the administration and the field. One of Human Resource Administrator Simon’s goals for the year is to fill in this position.
   - Human Resource Administrator Simon discussed all the sites where this position has been advertised.
   - Director Petersen recommended advertising this position on ACWA’s career webpage.

8. Other

XI. PUBLIC COMMENT
- Visitor George Babcock expressed his surprise by the amount of people that showed up. He thinks the next meeting should take place at a bigger venue with a thorough explanation of the project and its cost. It would help to have all this information with charts so the audience can look at it. He also suggested some kind of special mail containing all this information. He believes the ratepayers should have the opportunity to vote. FOWD has designed the yard with surplus parking. He believes the new building will be practical and better looking than any strip mall. It would not hurt to look into other locations and obtain some cost amounts. It would probably be a wash.
- Visitor Wes Trunnell disagrees with one aspect of what Visitor Babcock stated. He believes that it needs to be a real vote, something that is tied to an election process.
- Visitor Brian Fisher commented this is an opportunity. Problems sometimes come with unmeasurable opportunities to communicate with each other, to think and to hear. No one knew how many people were coming, it was a surprise. This shows that there is a lot of conversation out there. He does not want to focus on the negativity. There is wisdom of being able to step back in order to move forward. Everyone wants a well-run water district. This is an opportunity for people to become more involved and educate themselves. He appreciated the time the board members and visitors took with him. He would like the same quality of work that was involved with employees to be done with ratepayers, it would be an opportunity to engage.
- Visitor Wes Trunnell commented that Folsom water has a rebate. He encourages the Board to do a similar rebate or get a grant to reduce water waste. He also suggested adding relocation costs to the Operations Superintendent position.
- General Manager Gray stated that the FOWD has been part of what happens to the Village for over one hundred years and the FOWD has been a good neighbor. FOWD is a business, however. There is a business plan that FOWD invested in to build this building and to build phase two across the street. The comments about selling and relocating - claiming FOWD would financially net out are simply not true.
- Visitor Brian Fisher feels this is disingenuous. He has asked for the budget. In order to be a good neighbor, one must continue to be one. People will learn to care more because they will be more involved.
- General Manager Gray responded fair enough.
