- Visitor Brown complimented FOWD for being frugal. He commented the proposed cumulative rate increase is closer to 27% rather than 25%.
  
- Visitor Clawshell suggested FOWD post an outdoor sign, include a note on the invoices or perform more public outreach to spread the message regarding the proposed rate increase. She pointed out the Public Hearing is scheduled during Thanksgiving week, which may also hinder attendance and awareness of the proposed rate increase.
  
- General Manager Gray explained the timing of the hearing is based on regulatory statute to have it completed before the end of the year.
  
- General Manager Gray provided an overview on current and on-going capital projects.
  
- The public requested FOWD to provide detail on key projects.
  
- Board President Marx commented that a lot of the money going back to wells will have a payback, this will make FOWD more reliable and self-sufficient. This is an investment in FOWD’s sustainability and being able to control its own destiny.
  
- General Manager Gray stated FOWD has been absorbing the costs (SJWD increase and inflation) for many years. The proposed rates are what FOWD needs to keep serving its customers and is irrelevant for the rate increases of other water districts.
  
- The public recommended smaller increments for a longer period of time to minimize the financial impact, especially for fixed income households.
  
- The public stated FOWD should provide detail commitments on the S&M reserves.
  
- Visitor Babcock summarized how FOWD has made decisions based on their customers’ benefit. He stated there is never a good time to increase rates.
  
- Director Sarkovich thanked everyone for attending the meeting. He stated that inflation is the reason why he agreed to these proposed rates. Most of the money gets invested in capital projects such as groundwater wells and transmission pipeline that customers don’t get to see. FOWD will ask rate payers for money only when it is needed and now is the time. FOWD is gaining its financial independence by investing in wells.
  
- Board President Marx suggested revising some slides to reflect more transparency, based on today’s comments, before posting it on FOWD’s website.
