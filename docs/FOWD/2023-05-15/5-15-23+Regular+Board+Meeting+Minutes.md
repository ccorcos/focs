V. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: OLD BUSINESS  
1. Discussion and possible action on recruitment of the FOWD Assistant General Manager  
   - Human Resource Administrator Simon provided an overview of the proposed recruitment firms. She recommended Bob Murray & Associates to conduct the recruitment for a FOWD Assistant General Manager position.  
   - General Manager Gray shared that Ralph Andersen & Associates was used for his recruitment in 2004.  
   - Director Sarkovich inquired if there was a sense of urgency, as he was under the impression this process would take place later.  
   - General Manager Gray emphasized that recruitment is a long process, even if it begins now, it will take a while for the recruitment to be finalized. FOWD is currently behind with the completion of Board approved projects, given that most of the work is in-house. The hiring of an Assistant General Manager will provide more value than outsourcing the work.  
   - Director Sarkovich stated he is satisfied with General Manager Gray’s response.  
   - General Manager Gray stated FOWD will provide the draft job description and requirements to the recruitment firm and they will polish it. He will resend the Board a draft description of the Assistant General Manager position.  
   - SJWD General Manager Helliker mentioned he had worked with all three recruiting firms in the past. Bob Murray & Associates is a good choice.  

Vice President Petersen moved to authorize General Manager Gray to enter into a contract with Bob Murray & Associates for the recruitment of an Assistant General Manager.  
Director Sarkovich seconded the motion.
