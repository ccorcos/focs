- President Petersen requested that staff provide an update at the next Board meeting.

III. CONSENT CALENDAR

The following consent calendar items were considered and acted upon as follows:

1. Approval of Minutes
   a. Regular Board Meeting of October 21, 2024
   b. Special Board Meeting of October 28, 2024
2. Accept and File Treasurer’s Report for the month of October 2024
3. File Investment Report for the month of September 2024
4. Accept and File Financial Expense Report for the month of October 2024
5. Approval of Warrants
6. Approval of Cal-Card Statements for the month of October 2024
7. Approval of Board Expense Report for the month of October 2024

- Director McRae inquired about the rate increase for both liability and auto insurance. He suggested that FOWD compare to other insurance companies, including self-insurance.
- General Manager Gray stated that rates have increased, and additional funding will be requested to cover those expenses. ACWA JPIA is a self-insurance pool with all the other water agencies to reduce overall costs. FOWD staff can do the price comparison, but in general, ACWA JPIA has the lowest cost. He also noted the value of the cyber insurance ACWA JPIA offers.
- SJWD Board Member Tobin stated that ACWA JPIA has the lowest insurance rates. There is no need to reinvent the wheel as they can provide FOWD with price comparisons.
<!-- Page 8 -->
![Page 3 of 11](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+3+of+11)

- General Manager Gray mentioned that FOWD uses many ACWA JPIA educational programs that are available at no cost. They offer many benefits.
- Operations Manager Huckaby stated that insurance rates increased by about 7.75% across the board. However, the invoice received from ACWA JPIA is just an estimate. They reassess at the end of the year and send refunds once calculations are finalized.

Director Sarkovich moved to approve the consent calendar as presented.

Director McRae seconded the motion.

Motion carried with the following votes: Dolby – aye, Marx – aye, McRae – aye, Petersen – aye, and Sarkovich – aye.

   - Information only. General Manager Gray provided an overview.

   - Information only. General Manager Gray provided an overview and reported on the election results.
   - Director Sarkovich stated he would like the Corporate Yard Project to be completed in the next two years. He believes FOWD should do a better job at communicating what vote by division means. He received many calls from people stating that they did not see his name or FOWD’s name on the ballot. Many people are unaware that FOWD has the lowest rates in the region. He would like the banners to stay up to make people aware.
   - SJWD General Manager Helliker congratulated FOWD Board on the election results. He visited the Sacramento County website and stated that the current results are only showing 91% of the votes; there are still 60,000 ballots left to count. The results will be certified on December 6, 2024. If Director McRae wins, he will need to send his letter of resignation to FOWD between December 6-18, 2024. He can be sworn in after his resignation.
   - General Manager Gray stated that a FOWD vacant Board seat will be included in next month’s agenda.

   - Director McRae stated that Fair Oaks has not been represented at the SJWD Board for many years. Due to this, discussions at the SJWD go a certain way without
<!-- Page 9 -->
![Page 9 of 104](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+9+of+104)

Fair Oaks people being represented. He feels that Fair Oaks needs the voice of someone that lives in the Fair Oaks service area. He thanked everyone for voting for him and hopes to be a good voice for Fair Oaks.

## V. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: OLD BUSINESS
1. **Update and discussion on the New York Water Main Replacement Project Phase I**
   - General Manager Gray provided an update and overview.

## VI. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: NEW BUSINESS
1. **Discussion and possible action on FOWD Resolution No. 24-03: “A Resolution of the Board of Directors of the Fair Oaks Water District Opposing the Proposed Merger of the San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District”**
   - General Manager Gray provided an overview and read the resolution.
   - President Petersen suggested modifying item #4 to “insufficient to protect” instead of “do not protect.”
   - General Manager Gray suggested “may be insufficient to protect.”
   - President Petersen agreed to modifying item #4 to “may be insufficient to protect.”
   - Director McRae stated that item #7 of our resolution is speaking for FOWD and CHWD. He asked if the resolution should be limited to only the FOWD Board.
   - General Manager Gray stated no because it was purposeful. The resolution was developed in consultation with CHWD. We believe CHWD will take action on a similar resolution very quickly after FOWD. The purpose of common wording is to demonstrate that it’s the majority of SJWD customers that oppose the merger and that is a powerful statement.
   - Director Sarkovich inquired that assuming FOWD passes the resolution, can the item be added to SJWD’s agenda for the SJWD December 18, 2024 meeting when Director McRae is there to discuss the resolution and potential action to stop the merger; stop the waste of money?
   - SJWD Board Member Tobin agreed to propose that this item be added to SJWD’s agenda.
   - SJWD General Manager Helliker stated that any Board Member may propose to have an item added to the agenda, one of our Board Members plans to do so, and it will be added to the agenda.
   - Director Marx stated that there are other concerns with SSWD’s debt and water quality. These did not make it into the resolution, but that may be because it’s not meant to be comprehensive to all the issues.
   - General Manager Gray responded that FOWD wanted to keep it general and focused on the majority of FOWD customers who don’t want the merger.
   - SJWD General Manager Helliker provided his response on the proposed FOWD Resolution No. 24-03. First, he addressed the statement in the resolution that states significant components of the merger are unknown, and additional analysis is not necessary. He commented that SJWD had two reports as part of preparation for merger discussions completed in 2015 and they were not comprehensive. SJWD Board disagrees that additional analysis is not necessary. It's clearly necessary and the next phase.
<!-- Page 10 -->
- Second, General Manager Helliker addressed item #2 of the resolution that it would benefit all SJWD customers to immediately stop spending additional resources. He stated that to make any kind of determination about what the pros and cons are, a business case analysis is necessary. The SJWD Board has decided that to get that information, a business case analysis is needed. SJWD Board represent all customers and the business case analysis was their choice. He stated that we disagree with the second item in the resolution.
- Third, SJWD General Manager Helliker addressed the statement in the resolution that the merger between SJWD and SSWD would result in a loss of control. He stated that every individual Board Member represents the interests of all the voters in the community services district. No matter where they are elected, they are representing all customers in the SJWD. That’s another inaccurate statement that there is any loss of control.
- Fourth, SJWD General Manager Helliker addressed the statement in the resolution that existing agreements do not protect water rights water. He stated that these agreements will not change unless there is mutual agreement between FOWD and SJWD or whatever the water district will be with the merger. So, protections are in these agreements which give FOWD and the wholesale water agencies the first call on all water supply. Not just water rights water, all water supply. That first call will not change. Again, the item is not correct.
- Fifth, SJWD General Manager Helliker addressed the statement in the resolution that potential benefits of a merger are not worth the long-term impacts of sharing water with SSWD. He stated that SJWD shares water with SSWD now and that it benefits FOWD. Every time SJWD transfers water to SSWD, first SJWD has to meet FOWD needs and second, SJWD needs to get FOWD statement that SJWD has met FOWD needs. Any revenue SJWD generates by transfers to SSWD or to any, come back to SJWD and they offset FOWD costs. That’s built into the water supply agreement with FOWD and SJWD can’t do anything differently.
- Sixth, SJWD General Manager Helliker addressed the statement in the resolution that the potential benefits of a merger can be obtained through collaborative operations and agreements. He asked how do we know that? How does FOWD know that? SJWD has not done a business case analysis and has not looked at what the benefits or costs may be. At this point, not sure how FOWD can conclude that is the case, that the benefits can be obtained through collaborative operations and agreements rather than a merger.
- Lastly, General Manager Helliker stated that to Director McRae’s comment, he has asked CHWD if they could give him any resolution that they have adopted that matches this (FOWD resolution) to comport with what FOWD is asserting and they don’t have one. So, at this point this last statement (in FOWD resolution) is not accurate. The CHWD Board of Directors has not made any statement about this. They have not stated they support this resolution. That statement in and of itself is false. Recommending that FOWD not adopt the resolution because many parts of it are not correct.
- General Manager Gray responded to SJWD General Manager Helliker’s comments that in general, it is somewhat disrespectful to stand up in front of our Board and say they are wrong in stating how they feel about something. He stated that SJWD

<!-- Page 12 -->
- SJWD Board Member Tobin stated that ACWA is the acronym for Association of California Water Agencies. The association represents over 470 public water agencies in the state of California and SJWD Board Member Tobin provided an overview.
- SJWD General Manager Helliker commented that the question of what would be the structure of a new organization is undecided at this point. There are a couple of options with one of the proposed being reorganization and the one in the study recommended that San Juan annex SSWD once SSWD is dissolved. These options are part of the business case analysis to look at best alternatives. The SJWD Board believes they need that analysis to be able to determine whether or not there are benefits that would be worth considering. There are many steps even after LAFCO receives the resolutions for the merger from SJWD and SSWD.
- Director Tobin stated that she is on the Advisory Committee of LAFCO and there are many ways of doing this. To throw any item at the wall to see if it sticks is not really a good option.
- General Manager Gray stated that the current proposed merger has been stated as a continuation of the original process (2015). The primary driver for the merger was water supply reliability and currently, the merger is being called a continuation, but he was told directly that water supply reliability has nothing to do with the current needs. How can SJWD continue the process that has been proposed process? If water supply reliability is a key objective of the proposed merger, in the words of SJWD staff, FOWD and CHWD get no benefit from that.
- SJWD General Manager Helliker responded that he would send the scope of work to FOWD. Water supply and reliability is one of the topics covered as well as all other aspects of SJWD operations. It’s a complete analysis of both organizations. In 2013, 2014 and 2015 we were in one of the worst droughts on record and there was a focus on water supply reliability, but that’s just one component of the current analysis.
- Director McRae stated that one big concern is this opens a pandoras box and there are so many unknowns. We don’t know how it will turn out. Bottom line is FOWD has no protection for water, voting strength and water finances. The new merged entity could possibly come up with creative ways to pay off debt and currently, FOWD is debt free. He is really worried about taking on someone else’s debt and not willing to roll the dice that it turns out good. Director Sarkovich stated that he was opposed to the merger in 2015 and is opposed today. In his book, nothing has changed.
Director Sarkovich moved to approve the FOWD Resolution No. 24-03 as amended.
Director McRae seconded the motion.
Motion carried with the following votes: Dolby – aye, Marx – aye, McRae – aye, Petersen – aye, and Sarkovich – aye.

2. Discussion and possible action on the approval of an updated FOWD Salary Schedule
- General Manager Gray provided an overview of the proposed salary schedule. He noted there are three new positions listed and provided an overview of their duties. He stated that having these positions listed does not mean they will all be filled.
<!-- Page 13 -->
This is an adjustment to the salary schedule, potentially filling these positions and diversifying the workforce without adding any extra employees. Position descriptions for the Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer will be developed by FOWD staff.
- General Manager Gray addressed questions from the Board and the public.

Director Sarkovich moved to approve the updated FOWD Salary Schedule as presented.  
President Petersen seconded the motion.  
Motion carried with the following votes: Dolby – aye, Marx – aye, McRae – aye, Petersen – aye, and Sarkovich – aye.

3. Discussion on FOWD Water Supply for the month of October 2024
- Technical Services Manager Siebensohn provided a summary of the water supply report.
- General Manager Gray addressed questions from the Board. He stated that FOWD developed and invested in groundwater so we could have redundancy in case of an emergency. It was also developed so FOWD could have the ability to adjust the water supply cost. Once it was developed, SJWD changed its rate structure and FOWD does not have incentives to pump groundwater. FOWD is not looking for SJWD to lose money but to work with FOWD for mutual benefit.
- Director Sarkovich stated that FOWD is adding more groundwater assets (wells).
- SJWD Board Member Tobin stated that she voted against the merger with SSWD during their last Board meeting because no one on the Board had seen the contract. She stated that something important needs to be read. She also stated that we need to work collaboratively on the business of water and ratepayers.

4. Discussion and possible action on additional funding for 2024 expenses
- General Manager presented staff’s recommendation for the Board to authorize the transfer of $69,800 from the contingency fund to cover 2024 expenses.

Director Sarkovich moved to authorize the transfer of $69,800 from the contingency fund to cover 2024 expenses as presented.  
Director McRae seconded the motion.  
Motion carried with the following votes: Dolby – aye, Marx – aye, McRae – aye, Petersen – aye, and Sarkovich – aye.

VII. UPCOMING EVENTS

1. November 20, 2024 / SJWD Regular Board Meeting / SJWD Office
- General Manager Gray encouraged people to attend this meeting and stated it can also be attended remotely.
<!-- Page 14 -->
- SJWD Board Member Tobin suggested that FOWD Board request SJWD to add "FOWD Resolution No. 24-03" to the agenda, so it could be discussed during the meeting. Otherwise, her request to include it will be dismissed by the SJWD Board.  
- SJWD Board Member Tobin mentioned SJWD's discussion about destroying records after thirty days (30), instead of two years as mandated by state laws. She stated that to her, this is an attempt to hide things. With the recent election, the dynamics of SJWD Board has started to shift. SJWD Board Member Tobin feels that she has a target on her back because she daylighted many issues, but this is business, it's not personal.

• Director Sarkovich stated that FOWD should make customers aware that FOWD has the lowest rates and no debt.  
• General Manager Gray stated FOWD does not brag about ourselves.  
• SJWD Board Member Tobin stated making this information public knowledge highlights FOWD’s functionality – it’s a fact.  
• An unknown visitor inquired about the water agreement and its expiration.  
• General Manager Gray stated that the wholesale water agreement with SJWD expires in 2045. When the contract expires, the water rights might go away. FOWD would need to do something to enhance it.

- SJWD Board Member Tobin stated that the water agreement has to do with water reliability. Folsom Lake, CHWD, Orange Vale and FOWD makeup the wholesale water agencies; it’s part of the family of the San Juan wholesale district. Folsom Lake is the first responder. Folsom Lake affects everybody, it affects the family and everything that happens in the region. SJWD does not run Folsom Lake. The water rights are worth fighting for. She summarized the 2015 drought.
- General Manager Gray stated that when the drought took place in 2015, FOWD had enough water to provide its customers with average-day water, even when there was no surface water. This water came from FOWD’s investment in groundwater wells. FOWD has had the opportunity to share this groundwater with the family.
- President Petersen noted that Folsom Lake holds 972,000 acre-feet of water when it’s full. The groundwater basins in the Sacramento area have enough evacuated storage space because of over pumping that we can fill the groundwater, and this will hold over a million acre-feet of water. There’s a lot of potential for groundwater storage to improve our overall water supply reliability. He believes there is a bright future for water supply.

# AGENDA ITEM III.4
## REGULAR Board Meeting December 16, 2024

To: Board of Directors  
From: Chi Ha-Ly  
Date: December 11, 2024  
Subject: Accept and File Financial Expense Report for the month of November 2024  

### Recommendation:
None at this time. Monthly financial expenses presented for informational purposes.

### Discussion:
Attached is the financial report for the month of November 2024.

Please note that the monthly financial report is on a cash basis; therefore, a budgeted line item could be 100% expended as of November 2024.

As of November 2024, the District has 14.93% of remaining adjusted budget.

This report provides a quick snapshot of the operating expenses incurred by the District and does not include items that are capitalized (i.e. costs of construction jobs, fixed assets). The capital projects are reported separately under the “Capital Projects Status Report.”

### Policy Implications:
None as a result of recommended action.

### Fiscal Impact:
None as a result of recommended action.

**Background:**  
FOWD Policy No. 2050 covers the duties of president and vice president.

- A copy of FOWD Policy No. 2050 is attached.

California Codes Government Water Code Sections 21386 - 21387 relate to the election of a public agency Board president and vice president.

- **21387.** When the president of the board is absent or unable to act at any meeting of the board and no vice president has been elected, the majority of the board may elect a president pro tempore from its members, who shall have the power to perform all the duties of the president of the board until he is replaced or until the president of the board returns to the performance of his duties.

# AGENDA ITEM VI.4
**REGULAR Board Meeting on December 16, 2024**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tom R. Gray  
**Date:** November 20, 2024  
**Subject:** Discussion and possible action on the 2025 Salary Ranges for all Board approved positions  

## Recommendation:
Approve the proposed FOWD 2025 Salary Ranges for all Board approved positions.

## Discussion:
1. It is required that the FOWD Board of Directors approve salary ranges for all FOWD staff positions at a public meeting.

2. FOWD Policy Number 4070 reads: “A zero to four percent Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) will be provided to all employees in January. The amount of the COLA each year shall be guided using the month of October Consumer Price Index (CPI) as published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for the previous 12 months, as a reference.”

3. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ October 2024 CPI was 2.6 percent.

4. The proposed FOWD 2025 Salary Ranges for all Board approved positions include a 2.6 percent increase in accordance with FOWD Policy Number 4070.

5. If approved, all current FOWD employees will receive a 2.6 percent annual base salary increase starting on the first pay period of 2025.

6. Position titles were updated in accordance with 2025 operational needs.

7. General Manager salary range was updated to have the maximum equal to the local 2023 water agency General Manager average.

## Policy Implications:
None.

## Fiscal Impact:
A 0.4 percent savings in the salaries and benefits budget in accordance with the approved 2025 annual budget. The 2025 Board approved annual budget includes a 3 percent COLA and the staff recommendation is a 2.6 percent COLA.

# AGENDA ITEM VI.6
**REGULAR Board Meeting on December 16, 2024**

To: Board of Directors  
From: Tom R. Gray  
Date: December 11, 2024  
Subject: Update and discussion on FOWD’s Annual Financial Risk Assessment  

**Recommendation:**  
No recommended staff action – information only item.

**Discussion:**  
Based on the American Institute of Certified Public Accountant (AICPA) guidelines, it was recommended that FOWD Board and staff meet at least once a year to identify potential risk areas and make sure those risks are mitigated.

The following areas are those staff has identified as potential risks and have been mitigated through policies and procedures established by FOWD.

1. **Fraud Risk Assessment and Monitoring (Cash/Inventory/Other Assets)**  
   a. FOWD has established policies and procedures including segregation of duties, check and balances to mitigate risks of misappropriation.  
   b. FOWD has monthly spot counts and year-end counts of inventory.  
   c. Financial Reporting - FOWD Board adopts budgets and are monitoring them monthly through the monthly financial reports. The financial statements are being audited annually by an independent auditor. The CAFR is sent to GFOA for review to obtain constructive feedback and ensure that FOWD is transparent in its financial report.

2. **Information Technology**  
   a. FOWD Network directories and software applications are protected by security rights where applicable. Firewalls are put in place to ensure FOWD’s data is secured. The FOWD is restricting employees’ internet access based on business needs. Employees are being trained and monitored about opening appropriate emails.

3. **Reorganization/New Employees**

4. Changes in Operations  
   a. All changes in operations are reviewed and approved by the FOWD’s management team to ensure proper controls are in place.

5. Staffing  
   a. The FOWD is actively recruiting for the Assistant General Manager position. FOWD continues to address staff retention.

6. Safety  
   a. FOWD puts employees and customers safety as a top priority. The FOWD developed and implemented an Injury and Illness Prevention Program. Trainings are held routinely to ensure employees are informed.

7. Vulnerability Assessment  
   a. FOWD developed an Emergency Response Plan that addresses the vulnerabilities at the FOWD. Access to this information is limited to the Board of Directors and management due to its confidentiality.

8. Project Funding  
   a. The FOWD has infrastructure improvement projects (i.e. transmission mains, corporate yard and wells) for the next coming years. FOWD Board has adopted water rate increases for 2023, 2024 and 2025 (10%, 10% and 5% respectively) to fund some of these projects. FOWD will continue to look at funding for these projects in 2025 as current revenues are not sufficient to fund all these projects.

None as a result of recommended action.

**Fiscal Impact:**  
None as a result of recommended action.

![Fair Oaks Water District Investment Policy](https://example.com/image.png)

**Policy Number:** 5070  
**Policy Title:** Investment of District Funds  

1. As authorized by resolution(s) of the Board of Directors, the General Manager of the District or other persons designated by the Board, shall invest within the limitations of the California Government Code and this Investment Policy; idle funds not immediately needed by the District for the purpose of earning interest income.

2. The District’s general policy is to invest idle funds in the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) of the State of California. However, the District may invest in other instruments from time-to-time, subject to the following goals, objectives, and policies.

3. **Goal 1, Rank #1, Portfolio Safety and Diversification:** District funds will be managed to insure the safety of the portfolio by investing in high quality securities and by maintaining a mix of securities that will provide reasonable assurance that no single investment or class of investments will have a disproportionate impact on the total portfolio.

   3.1. **Objective:** In addition to the safety provided by investing in high quality securities, the safety of the portfolio is enhanced three ways by maintaining a prudent mix (i.e., diversity) of investments:
   
   3.1.1. Spreading investments over different investment types minimizes the impact any one industry/investment class can have on the portfolio;  
   3.1.2. Spreading investments over multiple credits/issuers within an investment type minimizes the credit exposure of the portfolio to any single firm/institution; and  
   3.1.3. Spreading investments over various maturity periods minimizes the risk of portfolio depreciation due to a rise in interest rates.  

   3.2. **Policy:** The District’s portfolio shall contain a sufficient number and diversity of high quality marketable securities so that a reasonable portion of the portfolio can be readily converted to cash without causing a material change in the value of the portfolio.

4. **Goal 2, Rank #2, Liquidity:** The pool will be managed to ensure that normal cash needs, as well as scheduled extraordinary cash needs can be met. Further, adequate liquidity shall be maintained to ensure the unforeseen cash needs, whether ordinary or extraordinary.

   4.1. **Objective:** The District will maintain a cash-flow-generated portfolio balance, sufficient to cover a one-month operating period. In addition, investments will be made based on a four month forecasted cash flow.  

   4.2. **Policy:** First priority is given to maintaining specific calendar liquidity, as dictated by the most recent cash forecast. Second priority is the maintenance of Treasury Bill positions adequate to meet unscheduled needs and domiciled in the San Francisco Depository to facilitate cash needs. Final consideration would be given to other investments deemed appropriate to portfolio maintenance, enhancement, or restructuring.  

**Date Adopted:** April 7, 1997, **Revision Date:** December 11, 2017  
**Page 81 of 104**
<!-- Page 82 -->
5. Goal 3, Rank #3, Rate of Return: District investments and deposits shall be made in such a way as to realize the maximum return consistent with safe and prudent treasury management.

5.1. Objective: The rate of return will be maintained on a consistent level representative of current market yield direction. Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) will be used as a benchmark.

5.2. Policy: Sales gains/losses will not be incurred to the point of significantly altering the final quarterly apportionment rate. Significant sales gains will be offset for restructuring purposes to maintain consistent current return, as well as maximizing future portfolio performance. Significant sales losses shall be incurred only by consent of the Board, or when sufficient profits negate the alteration of the apportionment rate. Range bonds and inverse yielding securities are examples of the types of investments, which are precluded by the above stated objective.

6. Reporting and Conformance: This policy shall be reviewed and updated annually by the Board of Directors. The General Manager or his designee shall prepare a report no later than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, listing all investments and activities of the District, in accordance with State Law.

A graph of total consumption to date versus projected budget target is found in Exhibit A.

A graph of groundwater and surface water use in 2024 to date is found in Exhibit B.

Both the FO-40 and CTP wholesale connections remained open to provide surface water supply to the District.

The average daily flow from wholesale connections for the month of November 2024 was recorded at 3,819 GPM (5.50 million gallons per day).

The maximum day water demand was reached on November 7, 2024, and was recorded at approximately 7.97 million gallons (MG) with the wholesale connections providing 7.07 MG and FOWD groundwater wells providing 0.90 MG. The minimum day water demand was recorded on November 25, 2024, at 4.44 MG. The average day demand was calculated at 6.10 MG.

The 10-year total average water use for the month of November is 528.72 AC-FT and November 2013 total water demand was recorded at 802.35 AC-FT. The November 2024 total water demand of 560.01 AC-FT.
