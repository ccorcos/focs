FOWD attempts to run our operation with the efficiency of a successful private company, not a typical public agency.

The November 2024 FOWD Board Election basically boiled down to a vote to keep the FOWD in the Fair Oaks Village or move the FOWD.

**FOWD ratepayers overwhelmingly voted to keep FOWD operations in the same location that we have been at for over 100 years.**
