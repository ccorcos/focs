- projected to increase $143,000 or 5% and other cost are estimated to increase $50,000.
- Director Sarkovich stated that the rate structure has remained the same since 2012 and he emphasized that if the rates are stable then no one will complain.
- General Manager Gray stated that over the last 10 years FOWD has had two rate adjustments totaling 13%. In the last 10 years approximately 40 cents of every dollar from customer water sales revenue has been invested back into the District’s infrastructure. In the last 10 years employee count has been reduced from 40 down to 30, due to advancements in technology and increase in efficiency. In the last 10 years the debt has been reduced to zero. In the last 15 years FOWD has received $9 million from other sources. In 2019 the projected net income is $2.1 million.
- Director Page inquired if that was estimated after the operating expenses.
- General Manager Gray responded that the $2.1 million is after operating expenses.
- President Marx inquired if the net income could go to infrastructure or reserve.
- General Manager Gray replied that the Board could determine to use the net income for infrastructure, keep in reserves, or invest.
- General Manager Gray recommended that FOWD drill a well test hole at the Skyway tank site rather than re-designing Fair Oaks Park Well in 2019.
- The Board agreed to include the tank site test hole in the 2019 budget and not redesign the Fair Oaks Park Well.
- Director Sarkovich stated that he would like to have two wells that are fully functional plus a third well at the tank site to increase groundwater supply of water.
- The Board asked that staff bring back a list of potential well sites.
