# 2025 Budget and Financial Plan

**Budget Policy**  
Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) Policy Number 5000 calls for the District to develop an annual budget. FOWD Policy Number 5000 further states that the proposed annual budget be reviewed and amended at a Special Board Meeting held in October and adopted as amended at the November Regular Meeting of the FOWD Board of Directors.

**Budget Overview:**  
The 2025 Budget and Financial Plan is a comprehensive plan for effectively funding the mission of the Fair Oaks Water District in accordance with specific Board direction. The intent of the document is to provide an executive summary of the detailed proposed budget – providing all with an accurate picture of the total available resources, spending and program priorities, and an accounting of cash flows. The non-GAAP format of portions of the proposed budget accomplishes these objectives more clearly than would strict adherence to traditional accounting principles.

The annual budget process involves a detailed look at the District's strategic objectives, standards of service policies, and their relationships over a Board directed forecast period. The budget process ensures that trends, which affect revenues and expenses, are identified, and reconciled as early as possible.

Another important goal of the annual budget process is to inform our customers about the District's financial and operational activities. In addition, the annual budget should be a planning tool that allows customers to quickly see financial trends of the FOWD.

At first glance, the District's budget can seem complex because of the substantial number of line items and programs; however, the majority of the budget concerns itself with general revenues and expenses, compared to project related revenue and expenses. While most budgetary decisions are made on a unit-by-unit basis, it is helpful to start with a summary of the Board’s direction to staff relative to the 2025 Budget and Financial Plan. The Board provided staff with the following general guidelines for the preparation of this 2025 Budget and Financial Plan:

1. Adjust rates in accordance with the Board adopted three-year rate plan.
   (a) The Board adopted rate adjustments for 2023, 2024 and 2025 on November 21, 2022 after completing a proposition 218 public outreach process.
   (b) After implementing Board approved rate adjustments of 10% in 2023 and 10% in 2024, FOWD water rates remain the lowest in the Sacramento Region and 57% of the Sacramento Region average.
   (c) The Board adopted rate adjustment for 2025 is 5%.

2. No new debt.

**October 21, 2024**

3. No new capital projects besides those that the Board has approved and deemed necessary.

4. Focus on completing current capital projects that are currently “work in progress.”

5. Meet policy targets for financial reserves.

6. Use a 90% surface water and 10% groundwater water supply target.
   - (a) Newly adopted SJWD wholesale rates for the purchase of surface water provide a financial disincentive for the FOWD to serve groundwater to FOWD customers – FOWD essentially must pay for surface water even if it does not take delivery of surface water.

7. Include a 4% COLA in calculations.
   - (a) FOWD staff lowered the proposed COLA to 3%.

8. Prepare a budget that includes the Board’s commitment to developing groundwater supply.

### Reserve Analysis:
FOWD policy number 5050 addresses District reserve funds.

### Budget Control:
The approved 2025 budget will be entered in the District's accounting system, which will provide online access for up-to-date financial information.

The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the General Manager, establishes operating budgets and policy programs. The operational budget is then managed and controlled by District management.

Operating budgets are controlled at the operating level by department management with overview by the General Manager. While line-item expenditures are in some cases shown in the budget worksheets, the intent of this information is to provide internal budget monitoring controls for staff and are not intended to be explicit appropriations by the Board of Directors. The Board may transfer appropriations from reserves to individual projects during the fiscal year if the need arises. This bottom-line approach to budget management is intended to prioritize overall District spending, while making senior staff accountable for internal operations and expenditures.

Project budgets are adopted for project funds. These budgets may span a number of years; however, our current accounting system does not allow multiple year project budgeting. Multiple year projects will be budgeted on a year-by-year basis. For each project, subsequent Board approval is required for approving bids and contracts, and for project cost increases over budget authorization.

Debt service budgets are established when the Board authorizes the debt issue. In 2025, the proposed budget has no debt.

The statistical sections of the budget are prepared on a cash basis and include expenditures for capital outlay and the principal and interest portions of debt service, while non-cash expenditures such as depreciation and bad debt write off are excluded.

**Financial Planning:**

The purpose of the District's financial planning is to demonstrate fiscal solvency, to provide early warning of adverse trends, and to improve financial planning and policy making for the allocation of budget resources. The financial plan utilizes detailed assumptions, such as population, new connections, infrastructure age, land area, parcel area, and current local economic trends. The financial plan's projections may or may not occur as predicted, depending upon changes in the economy, future service level changes, and regulatory mandates. During the operating year, FOWD staff will update the budget model based on actual experience, the latest available information and Board direction based on the changed conditions.

## General Financial State of FOWD Entering 2025

- **Annual Revenue**: ± $10.1M  
- **Annual Total Operating Expenses**: ± $8.7M  
- **Existing Debt**: zero

### II. PUBLIC COMMENT

<!-- Page 35 -->

### III. CONSENT CALENDAR
The following consent calendar items were considered and acted upon as follows:
1. Approval of Minutes  
   a. Regular Board Meeting of August 19, 2024

- General Manager Gray pointed out that the approval of Minutes is part of the Consent Calendar. He highlighted that although the last meeting consisted of few attendees, most of them agreed that a Customer Advisory Committee was not necessary, given that transparency already exists at FOWD.

Director McRae seconded the motion.  
Motion carried with the following votes: Marx – aye, McRae – aye, Petersen – aye, and Sarkovich – aye.

### IV. PRESENTATIONS AND CORRESPONDENCE
1. Letter dated September 11, 2024 to all candidates running for the FOWD Board of Directors in the November 2024 General Election, California Fair Political Practices Commission, and others  
   - General Manager Gray provided an overview of this letter. He clarified he does not take any role in the election process. His duty is to ensure that accurate information is available to all candidates and ratepayers. He does not support current Board Members or candidates; he simply would like to make sure that the truth about the
<!-- Page 36 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+not+available)

**District is available to all. There were previous public comments made stating that General Manager Gray was not following the law, he asked to be informed if someone believes this to be true. This letter was sent to every candidate, including the people running and incumbents.**

- Director McRae stated that politicking and an attempt to create a negative persona about FOWD makes the General Manager look bad. He applauds General Manager Gray for being “Switzerland,” finding the middle ground and when an untruth is found, expose it for what it is. There are a lot of untruths being said because a certain person is trying to be creative for a political campaign.

**V. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: OLD BUSINESS**

1. **Update and discussion on the New York Water Main Project Phase I**
   - Information only.
   - General Manager Gray provided an overview. Based on field conditions, it was determined that minor modifications were needed, and a revised design was created. The final design has been submitted to the Sacramento County Department of Transportation for their review and approval.
   - General Manager Gray pointed out that Phase I of the project was Board approved in the 2024 Budget.
   - Director Sarkovich shared that his neighbor lives nearby and asked him what type of water pipes are being installed.
   - General Manager Gray responded FOWD is using the Ductile Iron Pipes.
   - Director Sarkovich inquired if these are the standard pipes FOWD normally uses.
   - General Manager Gray stated that it depends on the location of the work being done. It was determined that the Ductile Iron Pipes would give the highest opportunity for lack of failure over multiple years.
   - Director McRae inquired if there are any concerns given the extension of the project schedule (i.e. weather).
   - General Manager Gray responded there are no concerns at this time. Hopefully with good effort, the work can be completed earlier.
   - Director McRae inquired if the pot holing revealed there was a utility that needed to be avoided.
   - General Manager Gray responded yes and provided an explanation.

2. **Update and discussion on the proposed merger of the SJWD and SSWD**
   - Information only.
   - General Manager Gray provided an overview to the attendees and mentioned their next meeting will take place on October 3, 2024 at Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD). The Pre-1914 water is the most valuable and reliable water in the state of California. He explained that if this merger happens, FOWD’s 33,000 acre feet of water will get diluted in half and we are concerned about that on behalf of our ratepayers.
   - An unknown visitor inquired what kind of say they have on the merger.
   - President Petersen stated that we can state our opinion, attend their meetings, and voice our concerns.

![Page 37 of 183](attachment://image.png)

- General Manager Gray shared that in 2015, San Juan Water District (SJWD) started a merger process. Today, it is happening again. FOWD and Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD) coauthored and submitted fifteen pages of questions and concerns that SJWD has yet to answer.
- Director McRae stated he was very vocal about the 2015 merger attempt. He stated that he asks SJWD to put it to the public to vote on it themselves. It never made it to that point. SSWD needs surface water supply. In a good year, SJWD has excess water but not every year is a good year. If you live in Fair Oaks, your retail water district is FOWD and in a larger family of water districts where the wholesale water supplier is SJWD. FOWD customers get to vote for both SJWD and FOWD Boards. SSWD has a larger population than FOWD; they can out drink us and out vote us. If there is a merger between the two organizations, SSWD could take control of FOWD’s water supply. He is also concerned about SSWD’s excessive debt.
- An unknown visitor asked what is in it for SJWD.
- President Petersen stated that SJWD was formed by Orange Vale Water Company (OVWD), FOWD and CHWD. It was decided that it would be more efficient if there was an agency that treats surface water for all of those communities. SJWD decided to build a huge treatment plant, much bigger than what was needed. They incurred a lot of debt in the process and additional operating expenses for such a large plant. SJWD is very motivated to increase revenue generation through water sales.
- Director Marx commented that another factor is that SJWD also does not have access to groundwater. SSWD has groundwater and if Folsom Lake goes dry, SJWD is stuck.
- General Manager Gray stated that FOWD has high quality groundwater and surface water is the best of the best. If the merger happens, and Granite Bay grows, SJWD could serve surface water to Granite Bay and send groundwater to FOWD from SSWD, which is not as good as current FOWD water. That is not a good deal.

3. Update and discussion on FOWD Administration Building Parking Signs
- General Manager Gray provided an update and shared the new language on the parking signs. Due to the parking shortage in the Village, FOWD is trying to be a good neighbor and updated the parking signs, as requested by the Board.
- Director Sarkovich complimented staff for the gesture. He stated that we are still good neighbors and still providing parking.
- President Petersen appreciated the prompt action from staff.
- General Manager Gray stated that he wished some of the people that asked for this were present so we could show them and celebrate it.
- An unknown visitor inquired about the idea of FOWD renting the parking spaces to restaurants in the Village.
- General Manager Gray responded that as a public entity and pay for service water district, FOWD cannot collect revenue from anything but water. New developments have been created but no additional parking was taken into consideration. Part of the plan without putting rate payers into liability, is to open up the space and share it as best as possible.
<!-- Page 38 -->
- Director Sarkovich stated that this was FOWD’s plan all along. The Corporate Yard will look similar to the Administration Building and the plan is to share the parking space after business hours. This was the plan from day one. FOWD is adding to the parking and enhancing the Fair Oaks Village.
- An unknown visitor stated some restaurants may be opened past midnight and inquired if that would be an issue.
- General Manager Gray stated that FOWD does not want to invite trouble that may happen from midnight to morning.
- Director Sarkovich stated FOWD does not want any overnighters in the parking lot. He does not believe anyone from the District will be patrolling at 1:00 am.
- General Manager Gray stated that if there are any issues, FOWD will revoke the signs. FOWD’s mission is to serve water, not to provide parking. FOWD does not want to put ratepayers at risk and incur liability.
- An unknown visitor inquired about the number of spaces FOWD will be providing.
- General Manager Gray and Director Sarkovich described FOWD parking. FOWD takes on a liability when it opens up the parking to the public that has nothing to do with its mission. FOWD is trying to be a good neighbor and compromise with those in the community who need additional parking.
- Director McRae summarized the “Move The Yard Campaign,” and addressed the posted recall signs. He believes they want to purchase the property for high density housing. It would change the character of the Village. He provided a brief summary of the California Surplus Land Act and what it entails.
- An unknown visitor inquired about the greater impact on parking issues if the Corporate Yard becomes affordable housing.
- Director McRae provided his view on what the high-density housing could look like in the Village.
- An unknown visitor inquired if the Board candidates running for the 2024 election is public information.
- Director McRae stated that the information is included in the Board Packet.
- General Manager Gray stated that Sacramento County Elections has a list of all the candidates running for public office in Sacramento County.
- The unknown visitor replied she would like the current Board to stay.
- An unknown visitor stated that in the Board Packet and on agenda, the letter that General Manager Gray wrote, they (Board candidates running for the 2024 election) received letter, their names are on it. We were wondering the same thing, who are these people? How interested are they? They are not here.
- An unknown visitor stated that they are too busy putting up signs.

4. Update on the “Request for Qualifications” to select a new Special District Financial Auditor – prior Auditor termed out in accordance with District policy
- General Manager Gray provided an overview and update. Three auditing firms submitted their responses and are pending FOWD review.
<!-- Page 39 -->
VI. DISCUSSION AND ACTION ITEMS: NEW BUSINESS  
1. Discussion on FOWD Water Supply for the month of August 2024  
   - Technical Services Manager Siebenson provided a summary of the water supply report.  
   - General Manager Gray explained the Board’s reasoning to opt for a water supply mix, consisting of 90% surface water and 10% groundwater. The Board directed staff to continue with current water supply mix for financial reasons.  
   - Director Sarkovich provided a brief summary of the conjunctive use.  
   - President Petersen expressed how hopeful he is to work with SJWD conjunctively.  
   - Director Sarkovich mentioned that Director McRae is a candidate for the SJWD Board.  
   - General Manager Gray mentioned there are three candidates running for the SJWD Board Election for one open seat, representing the Fair Oaks community.  
   - Director McRae clarified he will not be able to serve both districts, due to conflict of interest.  
   - President Petersen commented that none of the wholesale customers, composed of FOWD, CHWD and Orange Vale Water Company, are in favor of the merger.  

2. Discussion and possible action on the Transmission Main Phase I Design Request for Qualifications  
   - General Manager Gray presented staff recommendation to the Board to combine scheduled transmission main replacement phases into one project for long-term cost savings and to expedite retirement of the existing transmission main.  
   - General Manager Gray also introduced staff recommendation for the Board to approve the “Request for Qualifications” and direct FOWD staff to distribute to consulting firms.  
   - General Manager Gray provided an overview, explained the qualifications process, and addressed questions from the Board. Completion date for design services in the RFQ is January 31, 2025. The target date for construction to be completed is May 31, 2025.  
   - An unknown visitor agreed with General Manager Gray on the qualifications process and structure.  
   - The Board discussed the qualifications process, the selection criteria for design proposals and the fiscal impact of combining the projects.  
   - The Board compromised on the design proposals selection criteria; staff will be responsible to review bids based on qualifications and will be responsible for cost negotiations.  
   - General Manager Gray addressed questions from the public regarding the transmission main leak.  

Director McRae moved to:  
   a. approve combining two scheduled transmission main replacement phases into one project;  
   b. approve the amended “Request for Qualifications,” which allows a subcommittee, consisting of President Petersen and Director Sarkovich, to participate in the review panel alongside staff; and

Re: Complaint No. COM-09232024-03262; Mark Dolby, Randy Marx, Misha Sarkovich  

Dear Leon Corcos:  

This letter is in response to the sworn complaint submitted to the Enforcement Division of the Fair Political Practices Commission regarding the above-named individuals. The Commission only enforces the provisions of the Political Reform Act (the “Act”) found in Government Code section 81000, et seq. The Commission does not have authority to enforce Government Code section 54964. While the Act prohibits public agencies from sending certain mass mailings that feature an elected officer, the subject mailer does not meet the criteria under the Act to be considered an impermissible mass mailing. We will, therefore, not pursue the matter further. If you have any questions, please contact Shelby Pearce at 279-237-5972 or spearce@fppc.ca.gov.  

Sincerely,  

James M. Lindsay  
James M. Lindsay  
Chief, Enforcement Division

**Re: Brown Act Violations**  

The Sacramento County District Attorney’s Office had received a complaint alleging that Brown Act violations (Gov. Code § 54950, et seq.) had occurred before the regular board meetings conducted by the Fair Oaks Water District on July 15, and August 19, 2024. The complaint alleged that the board members, including General Manager Tom Gray, held closed-door meetings that lasted approximately thirty minutes prior to each regularly scheduled meeting, which were not listed on the agenda, in violation of Gov. Codes § 54957 and 54957.7(a) & (b). Per the complainant, it was apparent that the board members were discussing board-related items in this closed meeting, as evidenced by the minimal discussion and swift decisions made during the subsequent public meetings.  

Upon reviewing your response to these allegations, as well as the relevant agendas, meeting minutes, and board packets, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that a violation occurred. Accordingly, the Sacramento County District Attorney’s Office will take no further action on this matter.

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tom R. Gray  
**Date:** October 17, 2024  
**Subject:** Update and discussion on the proposed merger of the SJWD and SSWD  

**Recommendation:**  
No staff recommendation – information item.

**Discussion:**  
In 2011 the San Juan Water District (SJWD) and Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) approved the investigation and analysis of merging the two agencies.

In June of 2015 the two agencies agreed to stop further merger discussions.

In March and April of 2024 the SJWD Board and SSWD Board approved restarting the SJWD and SSWD Merger Project.

A joint SJWD and SSWD Board meeting was held on July 31, 2024 to discuss the SJWD and SSWD Merger Project.
- FOWD Board President Petersen sent the attached letter dated June 24, 2024 to both SJWD Board President Zamarano and SSWD Board President Thomas requesting an opportunity to discuss our concerns and questions related to a proposed merger of SJWD and SSWD.
- FOWD also sent copies of the letter to SJWD General Manager Helliker and SSWD General Manager York.
- FOWD did not receive a written response.
- The FOWD letter was not discussed at the July 31, 2024 joint meeting of SJWD and SSWD.

A joint SJWD and SSWD Board meeting was held on October 3, 2024 to discuss the SJWD and SSWD Merger Project.
- On behalf of FOWD Board President Petersen, I sent the attached letter dated October 3, 2024 to both SJWD Board President Zamarano and SSWD Board President Thomas requesting an opportunity to discuss our concerns and questions related to a proposed merger of SJWD and SSWD.
- FOWD also sent copies of the letter to SJWD General Manager Helliker and SSWD General Manager York requesting:
<!-- Page 93 -->
![Fair Oaks Water District Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Fair+Oaks+Water+District+Document)

1. They please provide a copy of the letter to each SJWD and SSWD Board member prior to any proposed action related to the SJWD and SSWD Merger Project at the October 3, 2024 meeting.

2. They please read the letter content or discuss the letter content at the appropriate time during the October 3, 2014 meeting.

- FOWD did not receive a written response.
- The FOWD letter was not discussed at the October 3, 2024 joint meeting of SJWD and SSWD.

Attached for your reference is a copy of the “SJWD and SSWD technical proposal to conduct an analysis on a potential combination of the two agencies into a single entity.”

- Staff’s review of the document indicates that response to the written questions and concerns on the SJWD and SSWD Merger Project, submitted by both the FOWD and CHWD, have not been included in document or in the $149,000 cost. In addition, a review of the records indicates that prior written questions and concerns about a potential merger between SJWD and SSWD were not even discussed as a part of the process.

**Policy Implications:**
TBD

**Fiscal Impact:**

Dear President Zamorano and President Thomas:

On June 24, 2024 Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) Board President Petersen sent you the attached letter related to the analysis of a proposed merger between the San Juan Water district (SJWD) and Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD). An important item in the June letter was a request that the SJWD and SSWD consider working through written comments and concerns submitted on behalf of our ratepayers during the prior merger discussions.

FOWD appreciated the June 25, 2024 email response from SJWD General Manager Paul Helliker stating that he and SSWD General Manager York were committed to responding to any and all comments submitted by the FOWD.

Given the above, it is requested that you ensure that responding to all written comments, submitted during the prior merger discussions that ended in 2015, is included in the approved scope of work for the new Business Case Analysis that is on tonight’s Joint Special Board Meeting agenda for possible action.

As was stated by FOWD Board President Petersen in the June letter, the FOWD hopes that the current merger analysis will include reasonable and collaborative interaction between all potentially impacted Agencies – with the FOWD looking forward to working with the SSWD and SJWD boards and assigned staff on meeting the objectives of your proposed merger.

Dear President Zamorano and President Thomas:

Based on statements made at recent meetings of the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) and San Juan Water District (SJWD) Boards of Directors, it is our understanding that the Districts are going to restart discussions of a proposed merger of the two Districts. Given the potential direct impacts of a merger on Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) ratepayers, FOWD is committed to participating in these discussions to ensure that our ratepayers are aware of the SJWD merger discussions with the SSWD and the potential effects on FOWD water rates and related interests.

Though FOWD has never taken a position on the potential merger of the SJWD and SSWD, we did submit written comments and concerns on behalf of our ratepayers during the prior merger discussions. We are happy to resubmit those comments, and look forward to the Districts’ responses and learning more about how the concerns will be addressed. We request the opportunity to work through those concerns and questions directly with us as part of your process.

The FOWD hopes that the proposed merger analysis will include reasonable and collaborative interaction between all potentially impacted Agencies. We look forward to working with the SSWD and SJWD boards and assigned staff on meeting the objectives of your proposed merger analysis.

Sacramento Suburban Water District  
Delivered electronically to hhernandez@sswd.org  

Dear Mr. York:  

In your RFP, you told us you’re looking to conduct an analysis on a potential combination of the San Juan Water District (SJWD) and the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) (the Agencies) into a single entity. This proposal is the starting point — our vision of how we can protect and enhance your organizational impacts as we achieve your immediate goals to:  

- Evaluate potential governance structures and board advisory committees to ensure customer equality and equity for both districts and achieve an overall cost benefit to the Agencies’ customers.  
- Perform a detailed assessment of each agency’s operations, infrastructure and other assets.  
- Perform detailed financial analyses of each agency’s current water rates, fees, debts, retirement funding obligations, costs, reserves, and future equities based on current capital improvement projects (CIP) plans.  
- Understand the pros and cons of consolidation alternatives and understand the compelling reasons for making any changes.  

At the conclusion of this work the Agencies want to have a complete business analysis of the potential combination of the two agencies. The basis for the elected leadership to make an informed determination on this manifestly important question, which has been discussed since at least 2019.  

For agencies like SJWD and SSWD, we know there’s not just one finish line. Transformational success means looking beyond your first goal and imagining the next one. And the one after that. And then the one nobody has even thought possible. Your Baker Tilly team will support you through every step of the journey — during your analysis for a potential combination and beyond.  

We’re prepared to redefine what service and success means for the Agencies. It’s not about ticking boxes. It’s about navigating complex landscapes and blazing new trails. The road map shared in our proposal shows how important the Agencies will be to us as clients.  

Sincerely,  
Carol Jacobs, Managing Director

**B. Include a general statement of the consultant's approach to conducting a financial and operational review of public utilities (two pages maximum).**

### Providing our approach to achieve the Agencies’ objectives
Baker Tilly has provided a significant number of financial and operational reviews for utility clients. Our organizational structure brings a variety of specialized resources to match your engagement’s diverse components. We anticipate working with the Agencies to develop any additional needs based on a macro-level of detail. We have created an efficient and effective process for these studies to achieve the Agencies’ objectives and deliverables as outlined in the Requested Scope of Work.

Our approach to financial and operational review is multi-faceted and based on best practices developed by our team over the course of dozens of projects in recent years.

### Understanding federal, state, and local regulations
Utility advisory services require knowledge of federal, state and local regulations that may impact or constrain parameters.

Within California, probably the most important regulations applicable to municipal utilities stem from Proposition 218 and, to a lesser extent, Proposition 26, statewide popular initiatives passed in the wake of Proposition 13. While there are a variety of technicalities embedded in each, the overarching public policy objective of the propositions, particularly 218, is to ensure that utility rates and fees capture only the costs associated with the proper operation of the utility, not other unrelated municipal costs. In other words, the drafters of these initiatives were concerned with municipalities seeking a “workaround” from the Proposition 13 property tax restrictions via utility rate or fee adjustments.

At the federal level, the most frequently encountered source of regulation tends to be requirements associated with legacy grant funding that may have been used for system capital improvements. Typically, these requirements relate to keeping the system and the grant-related improvements in good working order through the maintenance of rate levels consistent with that end. These types of rate maintenance requirements are also sometimes found in bond documents associated with debt financing undertaken by the Agencies.

For this engagement a good understanding of the role and responsibilities of the Sacramento County Local Agency Formation Commission (Sacramento LAFCO) will be essential. Baker Tilly has worked on many governmental reorganization projects and LAFCO sponsored municipal service review projects over the years, so we understand how county LAFCOs are organized and operate.

![B. GENERAL STATEMENT OF APPROACH](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=B.+GENERAL+STATEMENT+OF+APPROACH)

Utility regulations can take many forms and cover any number of restrictions at the local level. At the beginning of this engagement, our Baker Tilly team will work with the Agencies to understand any local regulations that may apply as well as any federal legacy or debt financing restrictions that might be in place.

**Committing to responsiveness and accessibility**  
The Agencies can expect a genuine, meaningful relationship with Baker Tilly throughout the duration of this work.

C. Describe the Firm’s experience with public sector projects of a similar nature and scope. Emphasis should be placed on projects undertaken within the past three years.

### Delivering specialized expertise to our public sector clients

Baker Tilly has served state and local government agencies since our establishment more than 90 years ago. We are one of the few advisory, tax and assurance firms with a practice dedicated entirely to serving governmental clients.

Unlike many other firms, Baker Tilly is organized by industry, not service line. What does this mean for the Agencies? It means you will be served by a carefully selected team that blends our utility-focused professionals with experienced specialists in the activities of the Agencies. The Agencies will work with a knowledgeable team that understands your specific challenges and provides innovative solutions to help you overcome them.

State and local government is a complex, unique environment shaped by fiscal, regulatory and operational considerations not found in other industries. Recognizing this complexity and eager to serve as a true valued advisor to the public, Baker Tilly formalized its dedicated public sector specialization more than 50 years ago. Today, more than 350 Baker Tilly professionals — including nearly 30 principals — focus directly on serving governments and provide hundreds of thousands of client service hours annually to organizations like the Agencies.

Nationwide, our public sector practice serves nearly 4,000 state and local governmental entities, including municipalities, counties, school districts, utilities, transit organizations, airports and special authorities. Several of these client groups are now served by dedicated specialists in distinct sub-practices.

### Public sector: Experience that matters

- **4,000 public sector clients**
- **90+ years of industry experience**
- **Serving clients nationwide**

### COMMITMENT TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Baker Tilly has been in business for more than 90 years, and public sector entities were some of our first clients.

The Agencies will benefit from our industry specialization in several specific ways:

- **Specialized training and continuing education:** SJWD and SSWD can be assured of an engagement team with the necessary skills and timely knowledge to effectively perform your engagement.

- **Industry involvement:** Members of our public sector practice are leaders in key industry organizations. Because of our work with these groups, we know about dynamic trends and consequential developments in state and local government — and are equipped with leading practices to help SSWD and SJWD best respond to them.

- **Knowledge sharing with SSWD and SJWD:** At Baker Tilly, serving governments goes beyond delivering services — we also supply our clients with crucial thought leadership in the form of webinars, workshops, articles and our regular newsletter, CommuniTIES.

- **Year-round consultation:** Throughout our relationship, we will be available for routine calls and technical questions, connecting you with recommendations and ideas to address the inevitable operational issues that arise. We can also alert you to new opportunities for us to collaborate and create value for the Agencies.

Our staff members practice their craft with the knowledge, experience, skills and integrity to deliver what you ask and meet your goals. We also teach courses for industry associations on cost-of-service and rate design principles for utility organizations. The Agencies will benefit directly from our depth of knowledge in this area.

While the merger of public agencies is fairly uncommon, our project team has been involved in several successful efforts. For example, we were involved in the successful effort to change the governance structure for the dysfunctional Sacramento Port District from a special district involving two counties and the cities of Sacramento and West Sacramento to a department within the City of West Sacramento where the port is located. In another governance change, as part of our management of the City of San Bernardino’s bankruptcy, we managed a reorganization of the City’s Fire Department into the County of San Bernardino Fire Protection District, which resulted in significant economic and service improvements. Both of these governance changes were processed successfully through county LAFCOs.

We also developed a successful merger between the Association of Bay Area Cities and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (the regional transportation agency for the Bay Area). While this merger did not have to be processed through a LAFCO it did need to receive unanimous approval from 28 separate city governments and seven counties.

**Creating a customized service plan unique to the Agencies**

The Agencies are one-of-a-kind organizations with unique risks and opportunities. We build our service plans accordingly. Tailoring our analysis for a potential combination between the Agencies to your specific needs.

Below is a discussion of our proposed scope of work, informed by our deep understanding of the local government environment and water districts in particular. We aim to help you achieve your goal of fully understanding a potential combination.

**OUR PROPOSED SCOPE OF WORK**

**Activity 1: Describe the current environment**

We will begin this project by providing general background on each Agency. This will be a rather comprehensive inventory of the work and assets of both SSWD and SJWD given the nature of this undertaking. We anticipate that this description will include but not be limited to:

- Governing statute and statutory limitations
- Governance
- Service standards
- Staffing levels by number and classification
- Organizational structure by program level
- Description of water supply and distribution and treatment
- Overall system condition and inventory
- Performance data
- Facilities
- Fleet assets
- Office assets
- Capital assets
- Capital project planned and underway
- Master plans
- Real estate and land holdings

We will also describe the current fiscal status of both agencies in detail. Our approach to the fiscal detail will be to first gather all the relevant data pertinent to the fiscal condition of each District, such as is described in the RFP. Using this information and more, basically time series information, we will then develop a basic fiscal forecast model for each District. This will allow us to eventually develop a joint long-term fiscal model for the combined District and also have visibility into the financial condition and prospects of each District on a stand-alone basis.

**Activity 2: Identify opportunities and challenges for the future**

Using the operational and financial baseline information developed in Activity 1 we will begin the work which forms the heart of this project of developing a business case analysis for the possible combination of the two agencies. This work will proceed through a combination of interviews with SSWD and SSJD staff, Sacramento LAFCO staff and the analysts of appropriate peer jurisdictions. The RFP spelled out a number of issues for which “opportunities and challenges” are to be analyzed. This is a great list, but we may need to add to it as we learn of other issue areas.

![E. APPROACH TO CONDUCTING THE STUDY](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=E.+APPROACH+TO+CONDUCTING+THE+STUDY)

**OUR PROPOSED SCOPE OF WORK**  
For now, the opportunities and challenge areas to be analyzed and the sub-issues can be summarized as follows:

1. **Governance structure**  
   a. Apportionment and equity for each agency  
   b. Structural alternatives  
   c. Phasing  
   • **Service integration**  
   a. Water resources  
   b. Operations (all facets)  
   c. Customer service  
   d. Support services  
   e. Compensation and benefits  
   f. Integration challenges and opportunities  
   g. Costs and potential cost savings  

2. **Facilities integration**  
   a. Building and grounds opportunities and challenges  
   b. Consolidation and surplus potential  
   c. Costs and potential cost savings  

3. **Financial obligations and thresholds**  
   a. Rates  
   b. Liabilities  
   c. Pensions and OPEB  
   d. Reserves  
   e. Financing options related to LTD  

4. **Staffing**  
   a. Rationalization of staffing and units in new organization  
   b. Compensation and benefits  
   c. Impacts to policies and practices  
   d. Long-term staffing efficiencies and implementation options  

5. **Identification of stakeholders**  
   a. Who are stakeholders for purposes of potential combination?  
   b. How could disadvantaged communities be impacted and communicated with?  
   c. Plan for structured communications with stakeholders (employees, customers, developers and others identified)  

6. **Regional participation**  
   a. How might combination afford greater regional leverage?  
   b. What steps should be taken at the regional, state and federal levels?  

Our analysis of these issues will be detailed and include reference to peer jurisdictions which will be identified with input from both SSWD and SJWD. In our experience, much can be learned about the future state of a combined SSWD and SJWD from “mapping” similar peer jurisdictions that will have similar attributes to the combined new agency. However, care must be exercised so the comparisons are accurate. Water districts vary across a great range of variables.

**Activity 3: Meetings and deliverables**  
- Baker Tilly will meet with the Agencies’ leaders in a workshop session to present the Final Report.  
- We will present our recommendations to the Agencies and provide expert insights to assist and facilitate their decision-making on our recommendations, with a specific focus on developing a path for implementation.  
- We will provide the Agencies with a copy of the Final Report in PDF format. This report will describe the process and methodology used in the study. We will also provide a PowerPoint presentation covering the most significant results of the study.

**Performing the Agencies’ scope of work with our talent**

**We have all the resources you need**

Planning your scope of work began with one of our most important considerations: the most effective way to enhance and protect impact for the Agencies. A part of that process was considering whether collaborating with subcontractors would add additional value for you.

With a vast depth of resources and experience to perform everything you outlined in your RFP, our path forward is clear: The best way to deliver value to you is by not subcontracting any portion of the Agencies’ scope of work.

**G. Estimated hours for each position**  
G. Provide a table showing the estimated hours for each position/role shown on the organization chart, as well as the individuals' availability for the Project. The staffing plan shall also include a table with the level of effort by task and subtask for each proposed staff member. Hours for sub-consultants may be shown as an aggregate total. The hours shown shall be consistent with the hours presented in the fee table that shall be submitted as a separate document.

### Detailing estimated staff hours on the engagement  
We’ve assembled the ideal team and plan to serve you. One question remains: How much time will each team member devote to your engagement? While each member’s hours may vary, factors like personnel, new regulations or records — this estimate outlines the time we expect to spend on the engagement.

Estimates of the time requirements for the Agencies’ analysis by staff level and segment of the engagement are as follows.

| Project phase | Managing Director | Director | Manager | Consultant/ Advisor | Additional services |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Activity 1    | 19                | 5        | 61      | 25                  | 10                  |
| Activity 2    | 33                | 20       | 93      | 62                  |                     |
| Activity 3    | 19                | 8        | 58      | 22                  | 10                  |
| **445 total hours** | **71**       | **33**   | **212** | **109**            | **20**             |

### Meeting every milestone with a results-driven work plan  
Road maps matter. They keep us on track and focused on your goals. This is why they are built into our project management approach in the form of a detailed work plan with key milestones, client sign-offs and deliverables for each project phase.

Here’s how we get there:  
- **Kickoff:** In this meeting before the initial on-site visit, we’ll work with the project steering committee to get your input on goals, timeline and deliverables.  
- **Approval:** Both Agencies and Baker Tilly’s engagement manager will approve the final plan.  
- **Progress summaries:** We’ll outline in writing all work accomplished during the initial and subsequent reporting periods.  
- **Communication:** The Agencies will get updates throughout the engagement, detailing progress on specific activities and deliverables. Each activity and deliverable will reflect its status and percentage of completion.  
- **Changes:** Our team members will share any significant changes in our agreed-upon work plans with the Agencies.

### Meeting or beating the Agencies’ deadlines

**Timing is everything**

They say time is money, and we agree. Every moment holds opportunity and we make the most of each moment together — adding value, supporting your goals and always delivering your services on time or ahead of schedule.

The chart below represents our customized approach to deliver business case analysis for a potential combination between SJWD and SSWD services to the Agencies on time. And it’s just our starting point. We’ll collaborate closely with you to finalize a client service plan that meets all your needs — especially your timing.

### ANTICIPATED PROJECT TIMELINE IN MONTHS*

| Project phase | Oct | Nov | Dec | Jan | Feb |
|---------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Activity 1    | ████| ████|     |     |     |
| Activity 2    |     | ████| ████|     |     |
| Activity 3    |     |     | ████| ████|     |

**OUR COMMITMENT TO SJWD AND SSWD**  
Working closely with you and your team, we will co-develop a timeline to deliver on time or ahead of schedule.

*This timeline assumes a reasonable review timeframe of 10 days to two weeks to receive feedback from the Agencies on draft reporting.

### Staying on schedule while exploring every opportunity

To stay on track, every expedition needs a well-planned course map with milestones to track timing and progress. That’s what we build to meet your deadlines, provide the highest quality business case analysis for a potential combination between SJWD and SSWD and give you a seamless experience.

Your time — and your timeline — matter to us. As we begin our work, we’ll collaborate with you on a timeline and a client service plan. This gives us a communication and monitoring tool that both of our teams can use, with touchpoints showing our progress and keeping us focused and on track. SJWD and SSWD will finalize and approve our customized service plan.

**Scheduling for success**

A timeline is nothing without the best people with the time and knowledge to devote to meeting your goals. Our scheduling and planning strategies help our teams manage their time commitments, prioritizing the Agencies’ needs with a responsive, accessible, and consistent team.

- **Dedicated teams with clearly defined roles and responsibilities**  
  We structure our responsive team to quickly escalate any issues, be available when you need us and meet your needs without overburdening individual team members.

- **Staff scheduling tools and resources to deliver high-quality service**  
  Our team members enter their availability into ProStaff. Resource management coordinators use weekly reports to make sure team members’ commitments do not exceed their capacity to deliver high-quality service.

- **Flexible staffing ratios and a high level of principal and manager resources**  
  We offer flexible staffing ratios depending on project needs. We balance workloads for team members through advanced planning and integrate additional subject-matter specialists and support staff when needed.

**MEETING YOUR DEADLINES WITH AN ORGANIZED SCHEDULING PROCESS**  
Building the ideal team to meet and exceed the Agencies’ goals is just the beginning. Our scheduling tools and processes keep these team members available and on track to achieve your objectives cost-effectively.

**Project summary**  
Baker Tilly completed (September 2022) an evaluation of a potential contract for fire service delivery between the City of Fullerton and the Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA). Management Partners was retained by the City to complete an independent third-party review of the service arrangement, contract terms and economics of the proposed draft contract proposed by the OCFA. We completed an extensive analysis of all aspects of the proposed contract, including service levels, transition costs, personnel transition considerations, pension liabilities, facility and equipment transfers and other factors that must be taken into account when making a decision with long-term implications such as this. In order to understand the long-term economics, we developed a costing model to compare the long-term costs of maintaining a sustainable independent city fire department and contracting with the OCFA. This model allowed for various assumptions regarding levels of cost increases over basic cost increases for both the basic OCFA contract and core city cost elements such as labor, supplies, equipment and facilities. Using the model and associated analysis we evaluated the economies of scale achievable via contracting and the various pros and cons of independent direct operations and contracted services. Our conclusion was that OCFA contracted services would be somewhat more expensive, while several non-economic factors argued in favor of the contract approach. The City is still considering a final decision.

**Project summary:**  
Springsted, Incorporated (now Baker Tilly Municipal Advisors, LLC (BTMA)) was retained to assist the City in the acquisition of the privately owned water system serving the entire community through eminent domain. Our work included developing an RFP for the selection of a qualified engineering consultant to review the condition of the water utility and to develop a cost estimate for needed improvements. BTMA led the development of a multi-year pro-forma of the financial performance of the water utility under City ownership and operation. Given the litigation, our primary information sources were state public facilities commission filings of the private financial statements of the company and its parent. This required us to segregate operating costs the City would not incur such as the main office allocation made to the parent company of Mountain Water, income taxes, internal debt payments, and other costs. BTMA also added costs the water utility would incur under City ownership such as payments to the general fund for support services. These projections were central to defining the City’s revenue bonding capacity for acquisition and future capital investment. They helped form the debt framework which had to be in place prior to formal acquisition, and were of primary importance to the City receiving an “A” S&P rating before the City acquired the system.

BTMA’s financial projections were challenged by Mountain Water Company during the eminent domain process. We successfully presented them under testimony in court where the City prevailed. BTMA’s financial projections were an instrumental part of the City’s success by proving the City could operate the water utility at a lesser cost than Mountain Water. The City’s actual experience after its first full year of operations was in line with the proforma. This process and its ultimate $138M debt program received The Bond Buyer’s 2017 ‘Deal of the Year – Small Issuer Category’.

regarding whether the agencies should pursue such action. We believe a seamless service model provided the appropriate framework to consider whether to consolidate operations aligned because such a model improves economies of scale, decreases costs and eliminates duplication of internal services and functions. Following the development of a comprehensive set of criteria and analysis, we recommended that the districts pursue consolidation.

<!-- Page 125 -->
![Cost proposal](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Cost+proposal)

**Cost proposal**

When we say value, we mean achieving your objectives and imagining new ones. We mean sharing public sector industry insights, gaining efficiencies and directing our best resources to SJWD and SSWD.

**Sharing our transparent fee estimate**

The Agencies’ fee estimate is based on what we’ve learned is important to you. We’ll go beyond what’s expected to deliver a return on your investment. Our fees allow for thorough and insightful advice from experienced professionals without unnecessary add-ons or startup charges.

We envision devoting approximately 445 hours of our team’s time to complete this engagement. The total cost of Activities 1 through 3, discussed in our separate proposal, is $149,900, which includes all fees and expenses.

**Detailing our assumptions**

Our estimate is based on the below assumptions. Should any of these change during the engagement, we will immediately contact the Agencies and prepare a change order detailing the new requirements and any corresponding budget impact.

- Adequate support, preparedness and cooperation from the Agencies’ management
- Organized books and records
- Fees based on current advisory standards
- No significant changes in scope

**Delivering services above the standard — at standard hourly rates**

When you need us, we step in to help, even outside the scope of our engagement. If the service you need is out of scope, we’ll let you know and get your approval. Whenever possible, we’ll give you an estimate in advance, outlining the time and expense we believe we’ll need to achieve your objectives.

**STANDARD HOURLY RATES**

# AGENDA ITEM VI.3
## REGULAR Board Meeting on October 21, 2024

To: Board of Directors  
From: Tom R. Gray  
Date: October 16, 2024  
Subject: Discussion and possible action on the selection of an Engineering Consultant for the Transmission Main Phases I & II Design  

### Recommendation:
Direct the General Manager to negotiate a fair and reasonable agreement with Peterson Brustad, Inc. (PBI) to provide professional services for Phases I and II Design of FOWD’s Transmission Main Replacement Project.

### Discussion:
During the September 16, 2024 Board Meeting, approval was granted to post and distribute a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for design and construction support services for Phases I and II of the Transmission Main Replacement Project. The RFQ was subsequently posted on September 17, 2024 with a response due date of October 10, 2024. Five consulting firms responded to the solicitation. All firms met minimum qualifications; these included Peterson Brustad, Inc., MC Engineering, Domenichelli & Associates, Dugan Management & Engineering, and HydroScience Engineers.

### Analysis of Proposals
As specified in the RFQ, proposals were evaluated based on project team qualifications and experience, project approach, ability to meet schedule, project references, quality of the response, and overall cost.

1. **Peterson Brustad, Inc. (PBI)**  
   PBI prepared an Alternative Analysis Report in 2021 to assist the District with developing a long-term plan for the replacement of its south transmission main. This report included a preliminary design evaluation and construction cost estimate, allowing PBI to gain a good understanding of the project. PBI submitted a strong proposal that illustrates their extensive experience designing pipelines and the qualifications of senior project staff. This proposal also demonstrates an ability to meet the accelerated schedule of the project. PBI also offered the most competitive cost for service of all respondents.

![FAIR OAKS WATER DISTRICT](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

2. **MC Engineering (MCE)**  
MCE submitted a good proposal that outlines the firm’s experience in pipeline design and construction management. The project team is highly qualified with many years of combined experience in the industry. In their proposal, MCE took the liberty of identifying a preliminary alignment and potential utility conflicts for the main replacement. The firm’s proximity to the project site also presents a distinct advantage. MCE offered a competitive cost for service but did not include any optional items in their proposal and left concerns that the accelerated project schedule may not be able to be met.

3. **Domenichelli & Associates (D&A)**  
D&A submitted a competitive proposal that highlights their capabilities in a wide range of water resources engineering services including pipeline design. The project team is well qualified and has relevant project experience. D&A noted that they have experience working on compressed schedules to meet project deadlines, as is the case for this project. The cost for service provided by D&A was close to the median price submitted by all firms. It is clear that D&A understands the scope of work but their project approach was not as detailed as other respondents.

4. **Dugan Management & Engineering (DME)**  
DME submitted a strong proposal illustrating their experience in pipeline design and construction management. The proposal was thorough and detailed, and DME provided a good project approach. They had already performed several steps towards preliminary design of the project such as utility identification. DME is confident in their ability to meet the accelerated schedule given past experience on similar projects. Although the project team is smaller than other respondents, DME has expressed they have the resources available to meet the District’s needs. The cost for service submitted by DME was above the median pricing for all firms.

5. **HydroScience Engineers**  
HydroScience submitted a competitive proposal that showcases their focus on pipeline design projects. The project team is highly qualified and has relevant experience on projects of similar scope. Communication and project management appear to be key components of the project approach for HydroScience. FOWD does have concerns that the firm may not be able to meet the compressed schedule for this project based on the information submitted in their proposal. The cost for service from HydroScience was highest out of all respondents.

**Selection of Consultant**

It is recommended to negotiate an agreement with PBI following an evaluation of all proposals received. FOWD believes that PBI is uniquely positioned to provide quality services at the best value and deliver the project on-schedule.

**Items of Note:**

Professional services are unique by their nature; therefore, they are not subject to competitive bidding. When procuring specialized services, the District is principally dependent upon the skill, integrity, judgement, and ability of the service provider rather than the dollar cost of the direct labor and material. Pursuant to Section 37103 of the California Government Code, the FOWD may contract with any specially trained and experienced person, firm, or corporation for special services and advice in financial, economic, accounting, engineering, legal, or administrative matters. It may pay such compensation to these experts as it deems proper. When contracting for architectural, landscape architectural, engineering, environmental, land surveying, and construction project management services, requirements of Sections 4525 through 4529.5 of the California Government Code must be met.

FOWD Policy 5110 Section 5.13.1. Requests for proposal or qualification may be used in lieu of the bid process when selection is based on qualification, quality, experience, design, past performance, or work approach.

California Government Code Section 37103. The legislative body may contract with any specially trained and experienced person, firm, or corporation for special services and advice in financial, economic, accounting, engineering, legal, or administrative matters. It may pay such compensation to these experts as it deems proper.

**Policy Implications:**

None.

**Fiscal Impact:**

$105,000 is included in FOWD’s 2024 Board Approved Budget for the design of Phase I of the Transmission Main Replacement Project. $197,000 will be placed in the proposed 2025 Annual Budget for the design of Phase II. It is assumed that design for both phases will be combined as recommended, and that design will begin in 2024 and be completed in 2025.

<!-- Page 134 -->
# FAIR OAKS WATER DISTRICT

## AGENDA ITEM VII.1
### REGULAR Board Meeting October 21, 2024

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Siebenhsohn  
**Date:** October 11, 2024  
**Subject:** Discussion on FOWD Water Supply for the month of September 2024  

### Recommendation:
None.

### Discussion:
According to the Accuweather.com website, the recorded average daily temperature in September 2024 was 73.5° F, which is 1.0 degree above the historic average of 72.5° F for September. Precipitation for September 2024 was recorded at 0.00” according to the Department of Water Resources Chicago rain station located in Fair Oaks.

The wholesale connections provided 1,086.45 AC-FT (90.06%) of surface water and FOWD groundwater wells produced 119.90 AC-FT (9.94%) to meet the total water demand of 1,206.35 AC-FT.

A graph of total consumption to date versus projected budget target is found in Exhibit A.

Both the FO-40 and CTP wholesale connections remained open to provide surface water supply to the District.

According to the data provided by SJWD, the recorded volumes from wholesale connections are:

| Connection | Forward Flow, AC-FT | Reverse Flow, AC-FT | Total, AC-FT |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------|

To: Board of Directors  
From: Tom R. Gray, General Manager  
Date: October 15, 2024  
Subject: Discussion and possible action on FOWD Resolution No. 24-02: “A Resolution of the Board of Directors of the Fair Oaks Water District Approving the Categorical Exemption for Construction of the Replacement of Groundwater Well at the Northridge Well Site”

**Recommendation:**  
Approve Resolution No. 24-02 and authorize General Manager to sign the Categorical Exemption for the proposed replacement of the Northridge Well.

**Discussion:**  
The Northridge Well No. 9 has come to the end of its useful life and needs replacement. The proposed replacement well will be constructed adjacent to the existing site, on the west side, in an FOWD easement and will serve the same purpose and general capacity as the existing well. There is no significant environmental impact as a result of the proposed project as it is generally a replacement in kind. Therefore, it has been determined that for a California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review a Class 2, replacement or reconstruction, Categorical Exemption may be filed. An analysis by Environmental Planning Partners, Inc. to support this finding is attached.

**Policy Implications:**  
None as a result of recommended action.

**Fiscal Impact:**  
None as a result of recommended action.

# CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION AND SUPPLEMENTAL CEQA ANALYSIS

## 1. INTRODUCTION
The Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD), as Lead Agency, proposes to replace an existing water supply well with a new well in the unincorporated community of Fair Oaks in Sacramento County. This report serves as the technical documentation of an environmental analysis performed by Environmental Planning Partners Inc. for the Northridge Replacement Well #9 (project). The intent of the analysis is to document whether the project is eligible for a Class 2 Categorical Exemption (CE) in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines Sections 15300 and 15302. The report provides an introduction, project description, and an evaluation of the project’s consistency with CEQA requirements for a Class 2 exemption. The report concludes that the project is eligible for a Class 2 CE.

**LOCATION**  
The existing Northridge Well #9 is located within a 1,500 square foot facility in the community of Fair Oaks in Sacramento County. The existing facility is sited at 8251 Kaula Drive (on the north side of the roadway) near the intersection of the roadway with Hinsey Way, identified as Sacramento County Assessor’s Parcel Number (APN) 249-0232-005. Water Well #9 and its supporting equipment are established at the southeast corner of a 9.94-acre parcel, identified as APN 249-0232-006. (See Figures 1 and 2.)  

The proposed replacement well project would be constructed within an additional 1,500 square foot (0.03-acre) site located immediately west of the existing Well #9 facility. The overall project area is located in Section 6, Township 9 North, Range 7 East at 38°39' 34.357"N, 121°15' 18.20"W. (See Figures 3 and 4.) The elevation of the project sites are approximately 220 feet above mean sea level (msl).  

Additionally, a 200 foot by 50 foot (10,128 square feet) construction easement would be located to the west of the replacement site (see Figure 5). After completion of the replacement well project, the area of the construction easement would be restored to its existing condition.  

**EXISTING SITE CONDITIONS**  
The existing Well #9 facility consists of a graded and paved area developed with the existing water supply well, electrical panel, chemical storage building, access driveway, fencing, and storm drainage facilities. The east, west, and north sides of the existing parcel are planted with ornamental foliage. (See Figure 6.) The existing pumping unit for Well #9 has a design capacity of 1,100 gallons per minute (gpm) and is equipped with a 150-horsepower submersible well pump. However, the existing well’s capacity has been decreasing over time. This existing well was reverse mud-rotary drilled in 1991 with a 14-inch steel casing installed to a depth of 550 feet.  

The replacement well site consists of a 30 foot by 50 foot (1,500 square foot) area located immediately adjacent to, and west of, the existing well site. The replacement well site was obtained by the [FOWD] in January 2023 in the form of a utility easement over property owned by the San Juan Unified School District. At the time of preparation of this environmental document, the replacement well site is composed of an irrigated and mowed area in an otherwise unused portion of the Northridge Elementary School site. A baseball backstop is located approximately 20 feet north of the easement boundary. (See Figures 3 and 4.) Other than removal of 50 linear feet of a recently constructed chain link fence along the southerly property line, no developed school facilities would be subject to interference caused by well construction activities.  

The location of the proposed construction easement is composed of an irrigated and mowed area within an otherwise unused portion of the Northridge Elementary School site. Potable water irrigation heads and 200 linear feet of recently constructed chain link fence along the southerly property line will be removed. Sprinkler heads within the new well site will be permanently relocated. No other developed school facilities would be subject to interference caused by construction activities.

# Surrounding Land Uses and Setting
The proposed project site is situated in an area of low-density residential housing to the south, east, and west. The developed facilities of the Northridge Elementary School are located approximately 425 feet west/northwest of the replacement well site. The nearest residence is located approximately 100 feet to the northeast of the proposed replacement well. (This would be an increase of 50 feet over current conditions.)

## OBJECTIVES
The proposed project consists of the construction and operation of a new municipal water supply well and well pump within the service area of the FOWD. The FOWD’s goal is to provide a more reliable water supply system by replacing an existing, but failing, water supply well at the Northridge well site. Having a more reliable water supply system will allow FOWD to better serve their customers, especially during drought periods.

The proposed Northridge Well is intended to provide the FOWD directly, and the region indirectly, with additional water resources for typical municipal and industrial uses, or other purposes as determined by the FOWD to:
- Meet the December 31, 2025 grant deadline to have the project completed and accepted as a water supply source in the FOWD’s Water Supply Permit.
- Increase water supply reliability for FOWD customers during periods of drought and low availability of surface water supply.
- Maximize production capacity without compromising water quality from the new well under normal operating conditions.
- Meet all applicable US EPA and the State Division of Drinking Water potable water quality standards for groundwater wells.
- Maximize specific yield and reduce operation and maintenance cost of the new well under normal operating conditions.
- Utilize the best available technology in construction of the potable groundwater well.
- When deemed reasonable, utilize available existing infrastructure to minimize construction cost.
- Comply with all necessary State and County regulations for drilling of the new well and abandonment of the existing well.

## PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS
The proposed project would replace an existing water well and supporting facilities with a new well and support facilities (see Figure 6). The capacity of the replacement well is expected to be 1500 gallons per minute (gpm), which would be similar to the capacity of the existing well. Replacement facilities constructed within the western area of the project site include the new well, well head piping, sodium hypo-chlorite room, motor control center and well control panels, meter vault, and drainage piping.

The existing well in the eastern area of the site area would be abandoned in accordance with the well abandonment standards and requirements of Sacramento County and the State Division of Drinking Water. All existing above-ground appurtenances would be removed to clear the way for the new well.

**PROJECT CONSTRUCTION**

**Construction Phase 1 - Well Construction and Testing**

It is anticipated that the replacement well would be drilled and constructed to a depth of 500 feet, the depth of the existing Northridge Well #9. Other existing FOWD water supply wells drilled and developed within the service area zone of the District have typically been drilled and developed to ± 500 to 600 feet below ground surface (bgs).

Before drilling operations begin, a noise abatement soundwall would be placed surrounding the well site. The soundwall would remain in place until all well drilling, development, and testing operations are complete.

Well construction would begin by drilling a 48-inch diameter borehole to a depth of approximately 75 feet. A 36-inch diameter steel blank conductor casing would be installed, and the annulus¹ would be sealed with cement grout. A 14-inch diameter (minimum) pilot borehole would be drilled initially to a depth of approximately 290 feet below land surface, which is approximately the depth to groundwater in the existing well. Borehole geophysical logs would be acquired and the pilot hole reamed to a diameter of 34 inches. A 30-inch diameter blank steel casing (the “intermediate casing string”) would be installed and the annulus sealed to the land surface with cement grout. The annular seals surrounding the conductor casing and intermediate casing would be installed in accordance with State and County regulations. Below the intermediate casing, the pilot hole would be advanced to the design depth of 500 feet. The final well design will be based on the samples of formation materials collected from the borehole, borehole geophysical logging and the isolation zone sampling conducted at depths between 290 and 500 feet.

The borehole below the intermediate casing would be then reamed, with a diameter of 28 inches, down to the design depth. The well casing would then be installed. The casing assembly would consist of an 18-inch diameter blank Type 304L stainless steel well casing, with louvered perforations opposite water bearing strata identified within the borehole. A filter envelope installed around the well screens would serve to retain any unconsolidated aquifer materials (sand and gravel) and promote sand-free water production from the aquifer system.

Post-drilling efforts would include swabbing and airlift development using the drill rig, followed by developmental pumping using the test pump. Upon completion of well development, the well would be subjected to a battery of well-performance and aquifer-stress tests. The tests would be used to: assess well efficiency and specific capacity over a range of pumping rates; identify aquifer hydraulic characteristics that influence long-term well performance; and, provide the basis for the

¹ An annulus is the region between two concentric circles, e.g., the space between a 48-inch borehole and a 36-inch conductor casing.

selection of production pumping equipment. Well drilling and construction activities are expected to take approximately 10 to 14 days. Testing may add an additional 5 days.

Water for the well drilling and construction operations would be obtained from an existing fire hydrant located adjacent to the project site on Kaula Drive. During development, pump testing of the well, and during routine pump maintenance, all project discharge waters would be disposed of in accordance with the National Pollution Discharge System Elimination System (NPDES) permit obtained for the Northridge Well and discharge permits obtained from the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District and Sacramento Area Sewer District. Waste discharges would be controlled to cause the least impact to the site and vicinity as discussed below and in compliance with the discharge permits obtained for the Northridge Replacement Well #9 project. During well development, water containing solids, including sand and silts, would be elutriated in an on-site settling basin or tanks before being discharged to the sanitary sewer. Turbidity and total solids would be monitored and only “clean water” would be discharged to the sanitary sewer system in compliance with NPDES discharge requirements. Clean water produced during well testing would be discharged to the existing storm drain facilities using a stormwater drainage pump to waste piping and a drain box located within the project site. After well development and testing have been completed, solids contained within the settling basin would be collected for off-site disposal, and the settling basin would be backfilled, compacted, and reclaimed for further site uses.

**Construction Phase 2 – Well Equipping**

The second phase of the project would commence upon completion of the wells as described above. The replacement well would be equipped with an electric submersible pump and motor. Pump to waste piping and an onsite drain box with air gap will be constructed to convey pump to waste flows to the existing storm improvements in Kaula Drive. Well water produced to serve the District’s customers would be disinfected, metered and discharged to existing water distribution piping in Kaula Drive. An electrical service, including underground primary and secondary conduits and conductors from the existing on-site transformer pad to the new motor control center, would be installed to provide power for the pump. Well site improvements will include a new cast-in-place or precast perimeter wall and access gates. Intermittent construction activity during this phase could occur over a period estimated at 30 to 40 weeks.

**ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENTS**

Based on the FOWD’s experience with similar projects and regulatory requirements, FOWD has included the following environmental commitments on the project plans and all construction documents. These commitments will be implemented in the design, construction, and operation of the proposed well project.

**Air Quality**

Construction of the Northridge Replacement Well #9 will be subject to SMAQMD rules in effect at the time of construction. FOWD will implement, or require its contractors to implement, all of the following measures required by SMAQMD: 

To elutriate is to separate lighter and heavier particles in a mixture such as stormwater.

![Basic Construction Limitation Control Practices (Guide Updated July 2019)](attachment://image.png)

1. Water all exposed surfaces two times daily. Exposed surfaces include, but are not limited to soil piles, graded areas, unpaved parking areas, staging areas, and access roads.
2. Cover or maintain at least two feet of free board space on haul trucks transporting soil, sand, or other loose material on the site. Any haul trucks that would be traveling along freeways or major roadways should be covered.
3. Use wet power vacuum street sweepers to remove any visible trackout mud or dirt onto adjacent public roads at least once a day. Use of dry power sweeping is prohibited.
4. Limit vehicle speeds on unpaved roads to 15 miles per hour (mph).
5. All roadways, driveways, sidewalks, parking lots to be paved should be completed as soon as possible. In addition, building pads should be laid as soon as possible after grading unless seeding or soil binders are used.
6. Minimize idling time either by shutting equipment off when not in use or reducing the time of idling to 5 minutes {California Code of Regulations, Title 13, sections 2449(d)(3) and 2485}. Provide clear signage that posts this requirement for workers at the entrances to the site.
7. Provide current certificate(s) of compliance for CARB’s In-Use Off-Road Diesel-Fueled Fleets Regulation {California Code of Regulations, Title 13, sections 2449 and 2449.1}. For more information contact CARB at 877-593-6777, doors@arb.ca.gov, or www.arb.ca.gov/doors/compliance_cert1.html.
8. Maintain all construction equipment in proper working condition according to manufacturer’s specifications. The equipment must be checked by a certified mechanic and determined to be running in proper condition before it is operated.

**Cultural Resources**

Prior to initiation of construction on the project site, FOWD will require that any construction or improvement plans contain a notation requiring that if any archaeological, cultural, historical resources, artifacts or other features are discovered during the course of construction anywhere on the project site, work shall be suspended in that location until a qualified professional archaeologist assesses the significance of the discovery and provides consultation with FOWD staff. Appropriate mitigation for curation or protection of the resources, as recommended by the archaeologist, will be implemented upon approval by FOWD. Further grading or site work within the area of discovery will not be allowed until the preceding steps have been taken.

In addition, pursuant to §5097.98 of the California Public Resources Code, and Section 7050.5 of the State Health and Safety Code, in the event of the discovery of any human remains, all work will stop and the County Coroner will be notified immediately. If the remains are determined to be Native American, guidelines of the Native American Heritage Commission will be adhered to in the treatment and disposition of the remains.

**Hydrology and Water Quality**

**Construction Water Quality**

Construction of the Well Replacement Project is exempt from complying with construction stormwater management and well testing requirements due to the size and nature of the project. However, the FOWD has adopted an environmental commitment to ensure that all construction activities shall implement stormwater pollution prevention Best Management Practices (BMP).
<!-- Page 160 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

designed to reduce potential impacts to water quality during construction of the project and in accordance with the guidelines of the Sacramento Stormwater Management Program as follows:

1. Comply with the requirements of the State Water Resources Control Board’s “General Permit for Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction Activity”,
2. Protect adjacent properties and storm drainage facilities from the discharge of sediment or other contaminants from the construction site,
3. Schedule as much project work as possible during the dry season,
4. Protect storm drain inlets,
5. Use other Best Management Practices as necessary, including applying rainy season erosion controls, managing stockpiles, disposing of well development water properly, and correctly managing and disposing of construction wastes,
6. Maintain all Best Management Practices, and
7. Stabilize the site after construction is complete, including revegetating landscaped areas disturbed by construction.

**Noise**  
To reduce the effects of construction noise on affected residents, the FOWD will implement the following measures:

1. Except for drilling and constructing the well, all work necessary to implement the project will be performed between the hours of 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday.
2. Before drilling operations begin, a noise abatement soundwall (typically 20 feet high) will be placed surrounding the well site to reduce noise impacts during drilling and construction operations. The soundwall will remain in place until all well drilling, development, and testing operations are complete.
3. All equipment will be equipped with appropriate muffler devices to reduce the noise impacts of the drilling operations.
4. The FOWD may provide alternate nighttime accommodations to adjacent residents if needed to mitigate noise impacts during drilling.

**BACKGROUND INFORMATION – ENVIRONMENTAL TOPIC AREAS**  
**Air Quality**  
During typical construction projects, the majority of particulate matter emissions (i.e., PM10 and PM2.5) are generated in the form of fugitive dust during ground disturbance activities, most of which are generated during the grading phase. PM emissions are also generated in the form of equipment exhaust and re-entrained road dust from vehicle travel on paved and unpaved surfaces.

The Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD or District) uses PM emission screening level to assist agencies such as the FOWD in determining if PM emissions from constructing a project in Sacramento County will exceed the District’s construction significance.

3 Because the project disturbance area totals less than one acre, the FOWD would be exempt from Submitting a Notice of Intent to the State Water Resources Control Board to comply with the General Permit for Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction Activity due to the small size of the project. Nonetheless, the FOWD has voluntarily agreed to comply with the substantive requirements of the General Permit.

thresholds for PM10 and PM2.5. Construction of a project that does not exceed the screening level, meets all the screening parameters, and implements the SMAQMD’s Basic Construction Emission Control Practices would be considered to have a less-than-significant impact on air quality. (SMAQMD 2020) (Guide section updated April 2019)

In the case of the proposed Northridge Replacement Well #9, the project meets the SMAQMD screening parameters. However, based on FOWD’s review of the proposed project, environmental commitments related to air quality will appear on the project construction plans for the purpose of minimizing potential effects. In order to meet SMAQMD requirements, FOWD will implement all of the District’s Basic Construction Emission Control Practices as set forth above for the proposed project.

**Biological Resources**

During project planning, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s California Natural Diversity Database was queried to determine the likelihood of occurrence for special-status species or sensitive and regulated habitats on the project site. Results showed no potential for presence of special-status species nor regulated habitats on the site. The nearest occurrence to the project site, at approximately 0.3 mile to the southwest, is for an andrenid bee (Andrena subapdata). This bee species does not have any formal listing status under the California Endangered Species Act. This species is associated with grassland habitats; however, because of routine weed control and landscape maintenance, no grasslands are present on the project site. No habitat for this bee exists on the project site.

A query of the United States Fish and Wildlife’s (USFWS) Information for Planning and Consultation database resulted in the identification of 1 reptile, 1 amphibian, 2 insects, and 2 crustaceans identified as proposed threatened, candidate, threatened, or endangered. Four of the six species identified are associated with water bodies (stream, lake, marshes) or vernal pools. No aquatic habitat or vernal pools occur in the project site or in areas that would be affected by project construction activities. Suitable habitat is not present on the site for monarch butterfly and Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle (VELB). VELB requires blue elderberry shrubs (Sambucus nigra ssp. caerulea), and no elderberry shrubs are present on the project site.

No critical habitats were identified by the USFWS in the project vicinity, and the National Wetland Inventory indicated that there are no known wetlands on the project site.

**Cultural and Tribal Resources**

A record search for the project site was conducted by the North Central Information Center (NCIC) in June 2024 to assess potential historical and prehistoric resources on the project site. The investigation included background research that disclosed that there are no previously recorded archaeological or historic resources within the project area, nor within ¼ mile of the project site. The NCIC determined the potential for locating archaeological and/or historic cultural resources within the proposed project area to be low. (NCIC 2024)

A record search of the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC) Sacred Lands File was conducted in June 2024. Results indicated that no sacred sites nor tribal cultural resources were identified on the project site or in the vicinity of the project. Section 21080.3.1 (b) of the California Public Resources Code states that:

“… the lead agency shall begin consultation with a California Native American tribe that is traditionally and culturally affiliated with the geographic area of the proposed project if: (1) the California Native American tribe requested to the lead agency, in writing, to be informed by the lead agency through formal notification of proposed project in the geographic area that is traditionally and culturally affiliated with the tribe…”

1 The FOWD has received no written requests to be notified of projects in which the FOWD is the Lead Agency under CEQA (Chetcuti, pers comm, 2024). Accordingly, the FOWD has no further responsibility in regard to consultation under Section 21080.3.1.

1 There are no known cultural or tribal cultural resources on the project site, and the replacement well and associated facilities will be constructed on an existing site that has been leveled and graded. Based on the cultural and tribal cultural resources investigations and the low likelihood that such resources would occur on the project site, the FOWD has developed the environmental commitment set forth above that will be included on the project construction plans. Implementation of the commitment will protect unknown cultural and tribal cultural resources through the implementation of appropriate protocols in the event of any inadvertent discovery during construction.

**Hazardous Materials**

A records search of the Envirostor database of the Department of Toxic Substances Control was conducted to determine the presence of any hazardous material sites on or in the vicinity of the proposed project. In addition to tracking federal, State, and local cleanup sites and facilities, Envirostor also provides data for hazardous sites tracked by the California State Water Resource Control Board’s GeoTracker system. The Envirostor records search showed that there are no hazardous sites listed on or in the vicinity of the proposed Northridge Well project (DTSC 2024). The nearest site, a Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Cleanup Site, is located approximately 0.5 mile to the northwest of the project site. 1 The status of that site, Former Unocal Station #5134, is “Completed – Case Closed” (Geotracker 2024).

**Hydrology and Water Quality**

Temporary increases in the erosion of exposed soils during construction of the facility could result in minor on- or off-site water quality impacts, particularly if rainfall events occur during an active construction phase. Additionally, chemicals used in construction (fuels, lubricants, paints, coatings) could be released to the environment if spilled. However, the FOWD has identified a number of requirements and stormwater management practices that would be instituted during the construction. The FOWD will implement the construction environmental commitments set forth above.

During development, pump testing of the well, and during routine pump maintenance, all project discharge waters would be disposed of in accordance with the National Pollution Discharge System Elimination System (NPDES) permit obtained for the Northridge Well and discharge permits obtained from the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District and Sacramento Area Sewer District. Waste discharges would be controlled to cause the least impact to the site and vicinity as discussed below and in compliance with the discharge permits obtained for the Northridge Replacement Well #9 project. During well development, water containing solids, including sand.
<!-- Page 163 -->
![Page 163 of 183](https://example.com/image-url)

and silts, would be elutriated in an on-site settling basin or tanks before being discharged to the sanitary sewer. Turbidity and total solids would be monitored and only “clean water” would be discharged to the sanitary sewer system in compliance with NPDES discharge requirements. Clean water produced during well testing would be discharged to the existing storm drain facilities using a stormwater drainage pump to waste piping and a drain box located within the project site. After well development and testing have been completed, solids contained within the settling basin would be collected for off-site disposal, and the settling basin would be backfilled, compacted, and reclaimed.

**Noise**

Construction would temporarily increase noise levels in the vicinity of construction activities intermittently over the construction periods that encompass both the well drilling and equipping phases of the project. Construction activities would be considered an intermittent noise impact throughout the construction of the project, and would vary in their effects on nearby residents depending on the presence of intervening barriers or other insulating materials. All work would be performed between the hours of 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday. No weekend or holiday work is planned.

The only exception to the designated work hours would be made for the purpose of drilling the well. For this operation, continuous work (up to 24 hours per day) would be necessary in order to protect the integrity of the well structure. It is expected that this phase of work would take three to six days to complete. Temporary sound walls up to 20 feet in height, and appropriate muffler devices would be used to mitigate the noise impacts of the drilling operation on the surrounding residential area.

In order to regulate noise, Sacramento County has established both General Plan and Noise Ordinance standards for noise levels from activities, including construction. Construction noise levels may be higher than Chapter 6.68.070 of the Sacramento County Code would normally allow (50-55 dBA). However, General Plan policy NO-8 and Chapter 6.68.090 (e) of the County Code provide the following exemption from Chapter 6.68.070 for construction activities, such as those necessary to implement all phases of work for the proposed Northridge Well project. In addition to limiting construction activities to specified days and times, the exemption provides that:

… when an unforseen or unavoidable condition occurs during a construction project and the nature of the project necessitates that work in process be continued until a specific phase is completed, the contractor or owner shall be allowed to continue work after 8:00 p.m. and to operate machinery and equipment necessary until completion of the specific work in progress can be brought to conclusion under conditions which will not jeopardize inspection acceptance or create undue financial hardships for the contractor or owner.

This continuous work exemption would apply to the drilling of the proposed well. Although the construction project is exempt from local noise regulations, to avoid potential adverse effects due to noise, environmental commitments will be set forth on the project construction plans and be implemented during the construction period. FOWD will implement the noise commitments outlined above.

## APPLICABILITY OF THE CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION

Approval of the well replacement project would replace an existing structure and operations, and would not involve an expansion of the existing use at the project site - there would be no significant increase in capacity for water treatment or use. The capacity of the new well would be similar to that of the existing well. Further, as discussed below, none of the CE exceptions apply. Therefore, the proposed project meets the applicability requirements for a Class 2 CE pursuant to Sections 15300 and 15302 of the State CEQA Guidelines.

## EXCEPTIONS TO APPLICABILITY OF THE CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION

The State CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2(a) through (f) list exceptions to the applicability of a Categorical Exemption. The discussion below explains why each exception is inapplicable to the proposed project.

### 15300.2(a): Location

Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located – a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply in all instances, except where the project may impact an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

The FOWD does not propose to adopt a Class 3, 4, 5, 6, or 11 CE, and these classes of CEs are not applicable to the proposed project. Further, as set forth in the background discussion as set forth above, there are no environmental resources of hazardous or critical concern in the project area or on the project site that are designated or mapped, such as critical habitat for listed threatened or endangered species. The project site is located in a residential area, and there are no critical environmental resources, such as wetlands or wildlife, on the site.

Therefore, since there are no critical environmental resources on or near the project site, and no contamination has been recorded on or near the project site, this exception to a CE does not apply to the Northridge Replacement Well #9 project.

### 15300.2(b) Cumulative Impact

All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

Cumulative impacts are defined in the State CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2(b) as “successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time.” In the case of the Northridge Replacement Well #9 project, the only successive project of the same type in the same place, over time would be the proposed project that would replace the existing well. However, construction of the proposed new well would reduce existing environmental effects related to the quality of water produced by the existing well and remedy the existing well’s deteriorated condition. The new well would have substantially the same purpose and a similar capacity to the well replaced, and there may be no substantial overall increase in the capacity of the well. Further, certain construction components would be compliant with local regulations for construction water quality and noise intended to be protective of the environment. Therefore the overall impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time would not be significant. This exception would not apply to the proposed project.

![Notice of Exemption](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Notice+of+Exemption)

15300.2(c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

The proposed project involves the replacement of an existing well; it would not have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances. The circumstances of the proposed project are not considered unusual because the project site is the location of a currently operating well. The replacement well will be located within an existing disturbed area of the Northridge Elementary School campus, and the replacement well may not significantly result in an increase of well capacity. Also, while the project is in an area of, potentially unknown cultural and tribal cultural resources, and could result in construction phase impacts to air quality, water quality, and noise, the FOWD has identified environmental commitments to protect such resources. Therefore, there would be no significant impacts to natural resources or habitats, cultural resources, air resources, water quality, or noise with replacement of the well. Therefore, the proposed project would not have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances. This exception would not apply to the proposed project.

15300.2(d) Scenic Highways. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified EIR.

There are no state or locally designated scenic highways in the vicinity of the proposed project. (Caltrans 2024). Therefore, this exception would not apply to the proposed project.

15300.2(e) Hazardous Waste Sites. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

The project site is not included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code (DTSC 2024). Therefore, this exception would not apply to the proposed project.

15300.2(f) Historical Resources. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

The project site was the subject of Historic Resources and Tribal Cultural Resources inquiries to the North Central Information Center (NCIC) and the Native American Heritage Commission (NAHC). Neither information source identified any known historically or culturally significant structures or resources on the project site or in its vicinity. Therefore, the proposed project would not cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource. This exception would not apply to the proposed project.
