# 2025 Year End Cash

Since the FOWD plans on spending $5,287,700 more than 2025 estimated revenues, is the FOWD operating at a deficit?

The key word here is planned. This is called “pay-as-you-go” – which means that you collect the money to fund a planned project rather than paying the increased cost of financing the project. In the utility industry “pay-as-you-go” is an acknowledged BEST PRACTICE.

- ✓ Zero Existing Debt
- ✓ Zero Debt Payment
- ✓ Cash Reserve of $4,844,600
- ✓ 86% of Water Sales Revenue Invested Into Capital Projects in 2025
