### AGENDA ITEMS

I. **Call to Order**  
President Marx called the meeting to order at 5:35 p.m.

II. **Public Comment**  
- None.

III. **Discussion and Possible Action**

a. **Update and discussion on FOWD’s website**  
   i. Director Page referenced Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and CA Government Code 11135 which requires website accessibility to people with disabilities and stated his desire to make things clear and simple on the FOWD website.  
   ii. General Manager Gray noted that FOWD is not required to comply with the Section 508 requirements, but would like to have the FOWD website easy to access, especially for the blind, the deaf and others with disabilities.

iii. General Manager Gray estimates a $3,000-$5,000 cost, based on a web design quote, for the Michael Baker Company to update the FOWD website for Section 508 compliance. He noted that the website and data had recently been corrupted due to intrusion and requires additional work.

iv. Director Sarkovich asked if any similar water agencies are working on such accessibility concerns.

v. General Manager Gray stated FOWD has no known reference sites for similar entities trying to meet the accessibility requirements.

vi. Director Page wants CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tools and template features from a reputable web hosting and design provider rather than hard-coded service to support the website. This would include disaster recovery capabilities from the vendor.

vii. Director Page stated good examples are SMUD and CalPERS websites.

viii. Director Page contacted LiveImpact which sells website capabilities to nonprofits and can replace inhouse or consultant staff. LiveImpact provided an estimate of costs for services not including Section 508 compliance updates. Director Page stated this sort of project does not require a Request for Proposal or Competitive Bidding.

ix. Director Page suggested conducting a requirement analysis of FOWD and likes the idea that LiveImpact is working with nonprofits, which means it may be cheaper to purchase. Noted costs quoted were: $10,000 for setup, plus $1,000 per year for hosting, plus $800 per month for maintenance.

x. General Manager Gray would like to look at investigating a new website solution and suggested this as an agenda item for a Regular Board Meeting. General Manager Gray stated he would like Board discussion and direction for next steps with the possibility of a sole source website project. General Manager Gray, noting the lack of similar agency websites, said he is wary of bearing the brunt of expenses for cutting edge compliance with Section 508 for the FOWD website.

b. Update and discussion on the outreach for Division I vacancy
i. None.

c. Discussion and possible action on water quality outreach program
i. Director Page wants to use public outreach to address water quality. Citing his own personal research, Director Page said it was hard to understand how much chlorine is used in FOWD water.

ii. General Manager Gray noted that chlorine residual testing is routine, and notifications are received if chlorine levels are too high or too low. In response to a question, General Manager Gray noted FOWD does not have hard water, but that the water quality issue in Antelope is hard water and groundwater from the central basin.

iii. Director Page would like to be transparent and let the public know FOWD adds chlorine to their water. He would like this to be done in a way that is easier to read than the compliance report. Director Page would like FOWD to be part of providing options to help customers remove chlorine if they so desire.

iv. Board President Marx stated he would like to post facts online and not incite unnecessary fear or concerns about FOWD water.

v. Director Sarkovich suggested coordinating with plumbers to offer fixed price solutions for value-added service that removes chlorine at the faucet.

vi. General Manager Gray noted fearmonger advertisements for water filters.

vii. FOWD Operations Manager Nisenboym noted there is no scientific basis for chlorine removal offering additional benefits to water quality and stated FOWD meets water quality standards.

viii. General Manager Gray does not want to compromise FOWD by going on customers’ property to be involved with private filtering systems. General Manager Gray raised concern about the ongoing support needed for any recommendations of the Board for FOWD to address private filtration options.

ix. Director Page stated he wants to help customers by providing information and support for optimal water.

x. Board President Marx is comfortable posting information on water quality, but not comfortable with any type of official referrals to third party businesses. He says FOWD should note on the website that chlorine is utilized and the FOWD relies on federal, EPA, and state information for published information.

xi. General Manager Gray noted FOWD publishes state and federal water quality information which is constantly being evaluated and revised. General Manager Gray stated FOWD does not have the ability to regularly vet online postings, studies, or articles and publish those on the FOWD website also.

xii. General Manager Gray stated surface water in general is higher quality than groundwater. A higher chlorine residual means safer water for a longer period and there is a range within which FOWD remains. General Manager Gray offered to review the latest draft Consumer Confidence Report to make sure it includes a reference that groundwater has chlorine added.

xiii. Director Sarkovich observed there was no Board consensus for referring filtration system options.

xiv. Director Page would prefer to test and recommend the best water filter options but agreed there is no consensus for any further public outreach on privately purchased water filters.

**General Manager Gray stated rules and regulations on water quality are the most strict for public water. He offered to increase public outreach if needed and noted FOWD knows how to do this, it just costs money.**

**Other**
- Board President Marx noted Phil Wright in West Sacramento could not be reached and may have retired.
- General Manager Gray noted two FOWD District operators recently left for more money.

**IV. Public Comment**
- None.
