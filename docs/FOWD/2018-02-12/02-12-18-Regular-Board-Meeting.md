IV. Presentation & Correspondence  
1. Presentation by Regional Water Authority on the ongoing Lobbying Subscription Program  
   - RWA Advocacy Program Manager Adam Robin presented information on the RWA Advocacy Program and the statewide legislative and regulatory issues addressed in 2017, noting the Program funds the Fernandez lobbyist contract. Annual subscription dues are based on retail connections served with 13 of the 21 RWA agencies as members of the Lobbyist Subscription Program, including SJWD Wholesale.  
   - RWA Advocacy Program Manager Robin stated in 2017, 2,800 legislative measures were tracked, 164 were analyzed and 40 were presented to the program members and 16 bills were identified as critical and the organization adopted a position to engage (oppose, support or seek amendments) on these 16 bills. The program also sponsored two bills which did not advance but increased RWA presence to continue working in 2018 with a statewide coalition and present language to authors of the AB 1668 and SB 606 bill proposals currently under consideration.  
   - General Manager Gray asked what specifically is of benefit to FOWD from this effort, noting FOWD wells were not allowed to be used during drought.  
   - RWA Advocacy Program Manager Robin stated two-thirds of water users and voting legislature are south of the Tehachapi’s, so it is important to incorporate the story of the Sacramento region as part of the RWA efforts. Additional water related

- Bills under legislative review were presented as well as positions being advanced with the State Water Board.
  
- General Manager Gray stated the FOWD Board cannot afford time to sit down at the Capitol and the RWA program gives FOWD the opportunity to have a voice on state water issues and participate at minimal cost.

- Director Sarkovich stated concern for the cost of a retainer for Lobbyist Fernandez and the $9,000 cost to FOWD as a smaller participant in the RWA Program as the Advocacy Program Manager is a part of the RWA.

- General Manager Gray stated he and Board President Marx endorsed the funding and hiring of the Advocacy Program Manager as a position within the RWA Program as it was cheaper than contracting it out and provided more control.

- Director Sarkovich requested item V.1. be moved forward for discussion.

- The Board moved item V.1. “Discussion and possible action on continued participation in the Regional Water Authority Lobbying Subscription Program” as the next item for discussion before the consent calendar.

V. Discussion and Action Items: Old Business

1. Discussion and possible action on continued participation in the Regional Water Authority Lobbying Subscription Program
   - General Manager Gray noted recommendation from staff for the payment for 2018 for the RWA Lobbying Subscription Program.
   
   - Director Underwood moved to approve the payment of $9,000 to RWA for the Lobbying Subscription Program in 2018.
   
   - Vice President McRae seconded the motion.
   
   - Director Sarkovich asked what did FOWD get for the 2017 subscription.
   
   - RWA Advocacy Program Manager Robin noted active lobbying such as AB 1668 and SB 606 that would have negatively impacted Sacramento water agencies.
   
   - Director Sarkovich stated his belief that lobbying is adding to the corruption of politics and would prefer to just pay into RWA and not separately into a lobbying program. He asked why all RWA agencies are not part of the program.
   
   - RWA Advocacy Program Manager Robin stated the Program is adding members, from original 7 to current 13, and may fold into RWA at some point.
   
   - Director Underwood is in support of having a Lobbyist as a necessary evil.
   
   - Director Page stated the Lobbyist helps inform Board decision makers and helps advocate for FOWD interests and it is worth being represented so as not to hurt FOWD customers.
   
   - Vice President McRae noted it is an unfortunate necessity to have a lobbyist and that RWA efforts have been rewarding to FOWD and he supports the 2018 payment.

The wholesale connections provided 205.66 AF (60%) and groundwater wells produced 137.18 AF (40%) of the total water demand.

   - General Manager Gray directed staff to draft something in the staff report and bring policy consideration forward in the next month as well as information for closed session on the aquifer.

2. Discussion and possible action on the upcoming FOWD Division 1 Board Vacancy
   - General Manager Gray recommended that when Director Underwood’s Board position becomes vacant the Board continue with only four members until the 2018 November general election.

   - Director Underwood noted he is still active until March 13, 2018.
   - Director Page seconded the motion.
<!-- Page 5 -->
- General Manager Gray stated FOWD posts the position on the FOWD website, in the Messenger, and at the Library. Recruiting is not done unless directed by the Board.
- Director Page stated that he is concerned about the participation in the last election and would like FOWD to use new tools for outreach such as Facebook and social media.
- General Manager Gray stated it is a decision not to work on social media as FOWD does not have the resources to keep information from becoming stale.
- Director Sarkovich suggested a bill insert to advertise upcoming open positions.
- Board President Marx noted a bill insert with a map of the divisions might be an idea.
- Vice President McRae noted as of April the next special election date would coincide with the general election.
