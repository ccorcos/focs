   - Visitor Babcock replied they were through RWA.

2. Discussion on the 2024 FOWD Proposed Annual Budget Schedule  
   - President McRae provided some feedback and comments regarding the 2024 budget schedule. He stated that San Juan is planning on changing their wholesale rate structure—fixed cost will be increased to 88%. Although this new rate has not been approved, he requested that staff take this into consideration when preparing the 2024 Proposed Budget.  
   - President McRae stated that he presented a protest letter, jointly signed by Citrus Heights, to SJWD’s Board and explained the concerns. With this fixed cost arrangement, FOWD would pay more for an acre foot of water than Granite Bay. This affects groundwater producers the most. It will take several months for SJWD to apply this proposed rate structure.  
   - President McRae stated that FOWD has many funded projects that are running behind, leaving money on the books, but not a lot of action left on the projects. He proposed not loading the 2024 budget with new projects to focus on completing the existing projects.
