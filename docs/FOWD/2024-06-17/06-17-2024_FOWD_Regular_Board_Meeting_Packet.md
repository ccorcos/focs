- Approximately 11,250 SF of road surface require restoration and overlay.
- Approximately 145 feet of curb, gutter, and sidewalk require replacement.
- To date, no reported property damage claims from customers.

### Current Main Break Conditions:
- The damaged 27-inch water transmission main has been repaired, pressurized, and is scheduled to be placed back into service the week of June 17, 2024.
- The repair excavation site has been backfilled in accordance with Sacramento County requirements.
- Pershing Avenue is safely open to two-way traffic.
- FOWD paving contractor is scheduled to begin permanent surface restoration on June 17, 2024.

### Water Quality:
- FOWD staff have flushed the water system in the area of the main break in preparation of placing the repaired water main back into service.

**Date:** June 11, 2024  
**Subject:** Update and discussion New York Well Project  

### Recommendation:
None – information item.

### Discussion:
The FOWD Board of Directors approved the drilling and equipping of a new water production well at the existing New York Well site in 2020.

Phase I of the project, the construction of the new well at the site, was completed in June of 2021. The pumping capacity of the new well is estimated at 2,300 gpm.

Due to long lead times required to obtain critical water production equipment, the FOWD Board of Directors approved the prepurchase of a pump and motor for the new well in October of 2023. The FOWD has not received this equipment to date and the current estimated delivery date is October 2024.

Phase II of the project consists of the equipping of the well. The well equipping plans and specifications are 95% complete. On June 7, 2024 FOWD staff met with the consultant and provided final comments on the plans.

It is estimated that Phase II of the project will be posted for bids in the first week of August 2024.

### Policy Implications:
None.

### Fiscal Impact:
Funding for Phase II of the project was included in the FOWD Board approved 2024 Budget.

**REGULAR Board Meeting on June 17, 2024**

To: Board of Directors  
From: Tom R. Gray  
Date: June 13, 2024  
Subject: Discussion and possible action on reconciling the main replacement agreement between the FOWD and FORPD  

**Recommendation:**  
Authorize the General Manager to finalize negotiations to split the outstanding project cost balance of $106,706 equally between the Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) and Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District (FORPD) or seek to nullify the executed agreement and bill the FORPD for 100% of the project cost.

**Discussion:**  
In July of 2021, the FORPD Board of Directors and FOWD Board of Directors reached a conceptual agreement to relocate public water facilities that will be impacted by planned improvements to the Village Park area.

In accordance with direction from the FOWD Board, FOWD staff worked with FORPD staff to develop a formal agreement to complete the required public water improvements. The FOWD Board approved a capital improvement expense not to exceed $260,000 – with $158,000 included in the 2022 budget and $102,000 funded from FOWD cash reserves.

In exchange for this investment on behalf of the FORPD, the FOWD was to receive a future water well site that was detailed in the agreement.

For reasons that benefited both the FORPD and FOWD, the project scope expanded resulting in an additional cost of $106,706 to complete the public water infrastructure installed with the FORPD project.

FORPD staff have rejected FOWD’s request for the final payment of $106,706.

To continue successful collaboration on behalf of the community of Fair Oaks, FOWD staff is recommending that the FOWD Board approve splitting the outstanding $106,706 cost between the two agencies and close the project.

A copy of the final agreement is attached reference.

**Policy Implications:**  
None.

**Fiscal Impact:**  
An unbudgeted transfer of $53,353 from FOWD cash reserves to complete the project.

THIS AGREEMENT is entered into between Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District, a local government agency (“Park District”), and Fair Oaks Water District, a local government agency (“Water District”). This Agreement will become effective on the date that it is signed by the last party to sign as indicated by the date associated with that party’s signature below. The parties agree as follows:

1. Recitals. The parties enter into this Agreement with reference to the following background recitals:

1.1. Park District owns the Village Park and Plaza Park in the Fair Oaks Village, located in Sacramento County, CA - including the Community Clubhouse located north of the intersection of California Avenue and Temescal Street. Park District plans to redevelop and improve the parks and rehabilitate the clubhouse. The work will include parking, walkway, and landscaping improvements (the “Improvements”) in the area between the clubhouse, California Avenue, and Temescal Street.

(A) Village Park and Plaza Park are both located in the Fair Oaks Water District service area.

1.2. Park District owns Phoenix Park at 9050 Sunset Avenue in Sacramento County.

(A) Phoenix Park is located in the Fair Oaks Water District service area.

1.3. County of Sacramento (“County”) owns a county road right-of-way, including an associated public utility easement (“PUE”), located in front of the south side of the Village Park Clubhouse as shown on the attached Exhibit A. The existing right-of-way and PUE interfere with Park District’s planned Improvements. The Park District is therefore working with the County to abandon and vacate the road right-of-way and PUE in order to accommodate the installation of their proposed improvements.

1.4. Water District owns and operates a water infrastructure within the existing PUE as shown on Exhibit B. As a condition of the County abandoning and vacating the right-of-way, the Water District will need to relocate its existing public water infrastructure out of the PUE and into the County road right-of-way for California Avenue and Temescal Street.

1.5. Water District is willing to relocate its existing public water facilities in accordance with Exhibit B (at its cost) and abandon its interests in the PUE in exchange for Park District granting to the Water District (without cost) a water well site easement subject to the terms of this Agreement.

2. Water District Pipeline Relocation and PUE Abandonment

2.1. Water District, at its sole cost and expense, shall abandon in place, in accordance with current County of Sacramento Standards, all existing public water infrastructure.

located within the PUE as shown on Exhibit B. Water District shall make every reasonable effort to complete this work by April 30, 2022.

2.2. Water District, at its sole cost and expense, will install new water infrastructure in accordance with the Water Improvements Plans as shown on Exhibit B and limited to the cost included in the Engineers Estimate as shown on Exhibit C plus a twenty-five percent contingency. Any cost for this work in excess of this cap will be paid by the Park District. Water District shall make every reasonable effort to complete this work by April 30, 2022.

(A) Water District shall backfill and compact all areas of Water District work in accordance with County of Sacramento standards – but will not be responsible for any paving, flatwork, or restoration of such.

2.3. Upon completion of the water pipeline relocation work, the Water District shall be deemed to have abandoned and vacated all of its rights and interests in the PUE. The Water District shall promptly inform County in writing that it has abandoned its rights and interests in the PUE. Water District shall cooperate with County and Park District as appropriate to facilitate the right-of-way and PUE vacation.

3. Water Well Easement

3.1. Park District shall grant and convey an easement in Phoenix Park to Water District for the installation, operation, and maintenance of a water well (including pump and wellhead treatment equipment) and an associated underground pipeline to connect the well to the existing Water District water distribution system. The well site shall not exceed 175 feet by 175 feet (or the equivalent square footage if not square). The exact easement location within the park shall be determined later in coordination between the parties and it shall be subject to the approval of the governing boards of both Water District and Park District. Park District shall not unreasonably refuse to approve the easement location.

(A) Prior to accepting a proposed well site, the Water District shall drill a test hole to determine the estimated water quality and quantity that the proposed site may yield. If a proposed site is determined by the Water District unacceptable for further investment, the Water District shall return the site to its existing condition prior to the drilling.

(B) Test hole drilling shall be limited to two locations at Phoenix Park. If both proposed locations at Phoenix Park are determined to be unacceptable for further investment by the Water District, the Park District shall convey the following to the Water District:

EASEMENT AGREEMENT  

THIS AGREEMENT, dated as of __________, 20__, is entered into by and between Fair Oaks Recreation and Park District, a local government agency ("Park District"), and Fair Oaks Water District, a local government agency ("Water District"), who agree as follows:

1. Recitals. This Agreement is made with reference to the following background recitals:

1.1. Park District is the fee owner of that certain parcel of land comprised of approximately ______ acres (known as Phoenix Park) located in the County of Sacramento, State of California, which is more particularly shown on the attached Exhibit A ("Phoenix Park").

1.2. Park District and Water District have entered into the Water Pipeline Relocation and Well Site Conveyance Agreement dated __________, 2021 (the "Agreement"). The Agreement provides for Park District to convey a certain easement in Phoenix Park to Water District in exchange for Water District’s agreement to relocate a certain water pipeline and abandon its interests in a public utility easement.

1.3. Water District desires to acquire an easement in Phoenix Park for the future installation and operation of a water well (including pump and wellhead treatment equipment) and an associated pipeline to connect the well to the existing water distribution system.

1.4. Water District has relocated the water pipeline and abandoned its interests in the public utility easement in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Park District and Water District have agreed upon the location of the easement and they have cooperated on the preparation of an easement plat and description (which are incorporated as Exhibits B and C). Park District therefore is ready to convey an easement to Water District (as contemplated by the Agreement) for the installation and operation of a water well, underground water pipeline, and related facilities, together with access to and from the facilities, on and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

3.3. Indemnification. Water District shall indemnify, protect, defend, and hold harmless Park District from and against any and all liabilities, liens, demands, suites, losses, damages, causes of action, injuries, claims, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney fees and costs) (collectively, “Claims”) arising from or caused by Water District's entry upon Phoenix Park or the exercise of Water District’s rights under this Agreement; provided, that the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to any loss or damage caused by the sole negligence, active negligence, or willful misconduct of Park District or to any preexisting conditions uncovered by Water District.

4. Park District Obligations. Park District shall not at any time (a) grant to any third party any easement over, under, upon, across or through the Easement Area that would interfere with Water District’s use of the Easement, (b) undertake or permit any activities that would preclude use of the Easement Area by Water District, or (c) disturb any well, pipeline, valve, fitting, facility, or appurtenance that Water District may construct or install within the Easement Area. Park District shall not construct any building, fence, or structure, conduct any excavation, grading, drilling, tree planting, or other ground-surface alteration, or install any other pipelines or underground utilities on or within the Easement Area without the prior written consent of Water District, which consent will not be withheld unreasonably.

5. General Provisions

5.1. Duration. This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in perpetuity or until Water District records a written notice of abandonment.

5.2. Successors. This Agreement and the Easement shall run with the Phoenix Park real property and shall benefit and burden Park District and its successors in interest and Water District and its assigns and successors in interest.

This Agreement supersedes all prior oral or written negotiations, representations, Agreements, or other documents that may be related to the subject matter of this Agreement, except those other documents that may be expressly referenced in this Agreement.

5.4. Construction and Interpretation. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement has been arrived at through negotiation, and that each party has had a full and fair opportunity to revise the terms of this Agreement. Consequently, the normal rule of construction that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party will not apply in construing or interpreting this Agreement.

5.5. Further Assurances. The parties, in order to carry out and give full effect to this Agreement, each shall use all reasonable efforts to provide such information, execute and deliver such further instruments and documents, and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by the other party, so long as not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement and not involving the assumption of obligations or liabilities different from, in excess of, or in addition to those expressly provided for in this Agreement.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x995.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** May 22, 2024  
**Subject:** Potential Combination with SSWD  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Discussion and Possible Action  

**BACKGROUND**  
Discussions between the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) and San Juan have been occurring since 2011. In 2014-15, two reports were prepared by consultants, evaluating three options (Phase 1 Report) and the best approach for combination, including Board structure (Phase 2A Report). At a joint Board meeting in 2015, the San Juan Board of Directors voted to move forward with the business case analysis (Phase 2B report), which would lead to a resolution to the Local Agency Formation Commission, but the SSWD Board voted not to proceed.

In 2018, San Juan communicated with SSWD, to inquire about restarting discussions concerning combination. The two organizations set up a 2x2 ad hoc board committee, which met during 2018 and 2019. During 2019, San Juan and SSWD agreed to expand the discussion of potential combination to other interested agencies, and conducted a “collaboration/integration” project with five other neighboring water agencies, to evaluate different alternatives that ranged from status quo operations to merger among the agencies. That project was completed in 2021. Subsequently, SSWD and the Carmichael Water District jointly conducted deliberations concerning the combination of their two organizations, but those were terminated by the Carmichael WD Board of Directors in March of this year.

SSWD has sent us a letter inquiring about our interest in conducting further discussions with them about potential combination of SSWD and San Juan (attached). Staff recommends that the Board agree to such further discussions and request that a joint meeting of the two Boards of Directors be convened in the near future to define the scope and schedule of such discussions.

Re: Status of Combination Discussions  

Dear Paul:  

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Sacramento Suburban Water District, I am writing to inquire about the combination discussions that occurred between San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District that dates back to 2015.  

At Sacramento Suburban Water District’s April 22, 2024, Special Board Meeting, the Board of Directors directed staff to contact San Juan Water District to determine if there is interest in pursuing additional combination discussions with our agency.  

The Sacramento Suburban Water District Board of Directors would appreciate you presenting this topic to your Board of Directors at a future Board meeting. Please let me know the outcome of the subject request.  

Sincerely,  

Dan York  
General Manager

![Agenda Item: 10](https://via.placeholder.com/768x998.png?text=Agenda+Item:+10)

**Date:** April 22, 2024  
**Subject:** San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District Potential to Re-Initiate Combination Discussion  
**Staff Contact:** Dan York, General Manager  

**Recommended Board Action:**  
Direct staff as appropriate on the potential to re-initiate combination discussions between Sacramento Suburban Water District and San Juan Water District.  

**Background:**  
In 2011, Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) and San Juan Water District (SJWD) mutually agreed to investigate combination discussions to potentially combine the two agencies. A consultant was retained to conduct a Phase 1 analysis. In April 2014, the consultant presented the final report of the Phase 1 analysis to the Joint Boards of Directors (Joint Boards). Based on the findings of Phase 1, the consultant recommended to the Joint Boards that combining the two Districts was preferable for providing increased water reliability benefits to customers of both Districts, and that a Phase 2 analysis of combining the two Districts be performed. The individual Boards of both Districts accepted the consultant recommendation and directed staff to move forward with developing a Scope of Work for a Phase 2 Study, Further Analysis of Consolidating SSWD and SJWD.

Both Boards further directed the Phase 2 study be broken into two phases - 2A and 2B. Phase 2A would focus on key high-level issues that Board members needed to evaluate in order to make a decision of whether or not to proceed with a Phase 2B analysis. Phase 2B would focus on other important issues or incomplete or addressed information needed to be prepared before applying to Local Agency Formation Commission for combining the two agencies should the Boards decide to do so. In addition, the Boards directed that Phase 2A address major concerns of SJWD’s wholesale customer agencies, including water supply reliability, as well as identify other potential benefits or impacts of a combination. Full customer outreach was not anticipated as a component of the Phase 2A scope, instead a limited effort to obtain customer concerns by way of sampling 600 customers via a telephone survey was conducted. If the Boards decide to proceed to Phase 2B, a full outreach to all customers was intended to be included in the scope.

However, at the June 25, 2015, SSWD / SJWD Joint Board meeting, the SSWD Directors voted 3-2 to discontinue combination efforts with SJWD, with SJWD Directors voting 5-0 to continue combination efforts.  

In March 2018, the District received correspondence from the SJWD General Manager, on behalf of the Board of Directors of SJWD, inquiring about the status of the merger discussions previously conducted by SSWD and SJWD. The subject effort ended up being directed to a regional collaboration study.  

**Discussion:**  
In July 2021, the SSWD and Carmichael Water District (CWD) initiated combination discussions to potentially combine the two agencies. In March 2024, the CWD Board of Directors voted to discontinue combination discussions with SSWD.  

Staff have recently been contacted by SJWD with interest in re-initiating combination discussions between the two agencies.  

The District commits to ongoing enhancements in efficiency, reliability, and customer service, the District remains open to exploring future partnership opportunities with our neighboring water providers and other entities, prioritizing the best interests of our customers. The District also commits to conducting partnerships with neighboring water providers, up to and including combining with those water providers for long-term efficiencies, potential reduction in future costs, and enhance water supply reliability.  

Staff is now seeking direction from the Board on potential combination discussions with SJWD. Options include at least one of the following:  

1. Direct staff to report to SJWD that SSWD is interested in pursuing additional combination discussions at this time.  
2. Direct staff to report to SJWD that SSWD is not interested in reinitiating combination discussions at this time.  

**Fiscal Impact:**  
Unknown at this time. Funds were not allocated for the subject topic in the CY2024 Budget.  

**Strategic Plan Alignment:**  
Water Supply – 1.B. Provide for the long-term water supply needs of the customers through prudent planning that will ensure capacity to serve system demands.  

Customer Service – 3.D. Provide effective customer and community relations by communicating, educating, and providing information on District operations, drinking water issues, resource sustainability and environmental stewardship.

Mr. Neil W. Schild, President

Sacramento, 95821  

Dear President Costa and President Schild:

Based on actions taken at the June 25, 2015 joint meeting of the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) and San Juan Water District (SJWD) Boards of Directors, it is our understanding that the Districts are not going to continue analysis of the proposed merger of the two Districts at this time. The Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) believes that many of the intended outcomes of the proposed merger can be accomplished through reasonable agreements and collaborative operations between multiple local Agencies. We look forward to working closely with the SSWD and SJWD boards and assigned staff on the implementation of reasonable operations and agreements that help meet the original objectives of the proposed merger.

FOWD has prudently planned, funded and implemented sufficient groundwater infrastructure to address currently represented risks to surface supply reliability; but we clearly understand that our District does not operate in a vacuum and that regional water supply reliability must be addressed.

On behalf of the entire FOWD Board and staff, we look forward to being a part of positive regional water supply solutions during these dynamic times and into the future.

Sincerely,

Michael McRae

# AGENDA ITEM VI.1
**REGULAR Board Meeting June 17, 2024**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Siebensohn  
**Date:** June 10, 2024  
**Subject:** Discussion on FOWD Water Supply for the month of May 2024  

## Recommendation:
None.

## Discussion:
According to the Accuweather.com website, the recorded average daily temperature in May 2024 was 66.0° F, which is 0.5 degrees above the historic average of 65.5° F for May. Precipitation for May 2024 was recorded at 0.95” according to the Department of Water Resources Chicago rain station located in Fair Oaks.

The wholesale connections provided 832.29 AC-FT (91.18%) of surface water and FOWD groundwater wells produced 80.53 AC-FT (8.82%) to meet the total water demand of 912.82 AC-FT.

A graph of total consumption to date versus projected budget target is found in Exhibit A.

Both the FO-40 and CTP wholesale connections remained open to provide surface water supply to the District.

According to the data provided by SJWD, the recorded volumes from wholesale connections are:

| Connection | Forward Flow, AC-FT | Reverse Flow, AC-FT | Total, AC-FT |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| CTP Connection | 458.17 | 0.00 | 458.17 |
| FO-40 (39°) | 374.12 | 0.00 | 374.12 |
| **TOTAL FROM SJWD** | **832.29** | **0.00** | **832.29** |

The average daily flow from wholesale connections for the month of May 2024 was recorded at 6,013 GPM.

The maximum day water demand was reached on May 31, 2024, and was recorded at approximately 11.75 million gallons (MG) with the wholesale connections providing 11.05 MG and FOWD groundwater wells providing 0.70 MG. The minimum day water demand was recorded on May 5, 2024, at 6.12 MG. The average day demand was calculated at 9.58 MG.

The 10-year total average water use for the month of May is 917.16 AC-FT and May 2013 total water demand was recorded at 1,340.13 AC-FT. The May 2024 total water demand of 912.82 AC-FT represents a decrease of 0.47% from the May 10-year average, a 31.89% decrease from May 2013 consumption, and a 4.66% increase from 2023 consumption.
<!-- Page 102 -->
![Fair Oaks Water District Report](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Fair+Oaks+Water+District+Report)

During the month of May 2024, all wells performed in accordance with the approved operations plan.

The Skyway Tank and Booster Station operated within normal parameters and in accordance with the seasonal operational schedule.

The production breakdown per groundwater source for the month of May 2024 was:
