### Recommendation:

### Discussion:
At the May 20, 2024, regular meeting of the Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) Board of Directors, the FOWD Board directed staff to proceed with the posting of a bid package for the construction of Phase I of the New York Main Replacement Project. This phase of the project includes the replacement of 1,810 feet of “at risk” steel water main from north of Lemon Street to Orange Avenue.

At the June 12, 2024 regular meeting of the FOWD Board of Directors, the FOWD Board approved entering into an agreement with Flowline Contractors, Inc. (Flowline) to complete the project. Flowline was the lowest responsive bidder of the five bids received.

Based on a preconstruction meeting and field investigations with both FOWD and Flowline staff, a Notice to Proceed with the project was issued on August 5, 2024.

The attached project notification documents were distributed in the local area to alert residents directly impacted by the project and provide contact information should they have any questions or concerns.

### Policy Implications:
None.

### Fiscal Impact:
None.

**FAIR OAKS WATER DISTRICT**  
**NEW YORK AVENUE WATER MAIN REPLACEMENT**

**Background**  
Flowline Contractors, working for the Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD), will be installing a new water main on New York Avenue from just north of Lemon Street to Orange Avenue. Construction may cause unavoidable short-term inconvenience to residents in the immediate vicinity.

**What to Expect**  
Construction activity will begin in early August with the contractor investigating the project area, followed by heavy equipment and materials appearing at the site outlined in red on the map. Work will generally occur within 7am-4pm weekdays. Construction is estimated to take approximately 12 weeks, but may be extended due to weather or unforeseen conditions.

At times, the contractor may need to close through traffic for the safety of the public and their staff. Residents will be allowed access through closed streets, but delays may be expected.

The FOWD will attempt to provide a minimum of 48-hour notice to anyone that will have an interruption in their water service.

We appreciate your understanding as we make these improvements.  
**Thank You!**

We understand that construction activities are disruptive to daily routine. We will strive to minimize the inconvenience and expedite construction. Please contact us if you have any questions or concerns during this Project. We are here to help. **(916) 967-5723**

Mr. Manuel Zamorano, President  
Board of Directors  
San Juan Water District  
9935 Auburn-Folsom Road  
Granite Bay, CA 95746  

Mr. Kevin Thomas, President  
Board of Directors  
Sacramento Suburban Water District  
3701 Marconi Avenue #100  
Sacramento, 95821  

Dear President Zamorano and President Thomas:

Based on statements made at recent meetings of the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) and San Juan Water District (SJWD) Boards of Directors, it is our understanding that the Districts are going to restart discussions of a proposed merger of the two Districts. Given the potential direct impacts of a merger on Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) ratepayers, FOWD is committed to participating in these discussions to ensure that our ratepayers are aware of the SJWD merger discussions with the SSWD and the potential effects on FOWD water rates and related interests.

Though FOWD has never taken a position on the potential merger of the SJWD and SSWD, we did submit written comments and concerns on behalf of our ratepayers during the prior merger discussions. We are happy to resubmit those comments, and look forward to the Districts’ responses and learning more about how the concerns will be addressed. We request the opportunity to work through those concerns and questions directly with us as part of your process.

The FOWD hopes that the proposed merger analysis will include reasonable and collaborative interaction between all potentially impacted Agencies. We look forward to working with the SSWD and SJWD boards and assigned staff on meeting the objectives of your proposed merger analysis.

**Originally Distributed to FOWD Customers on June 17, 2015**

### Important Information for Fair Oaks Water District Customers

**"Merger of Local Water Districts Proposed"**

The San Juan Water District is researching a possible merger with the Sacramento Suburban Water District. The plan to merge may be proposed to local regulators very soon. The San Juan Water District was founded by the Fair Oaks Water District, Citrus Heights Water District and Orange Vale Water Company to manage, operate and maintain surface water for the customers of a specifically defined area. The San Juan Water District currently has a defined service area that includes the customers of the Fair Oaks Water District, Citrus Heights Water District, Orange Vale Water Company, along with Granite Bay and limited areas within the City of Folsom. The planned merger would effectively double the current area served by the San Juan Water District using surface water facilities paid for by existing customers. Given this fact, the Board of Directors of the Fair Oaks Water District believes that it is very important that you are made aware of the planned merger, have access to information on the planned merger and understand how you may express your ratepayer’s position on the proposed merger.

- Information on the proposed merger has been made available at [www.sjwd.org](http://www.sjwd.org)
- While concerned, the FOWD Board of Directors has not yet taken a position to support or oppose the merger, awaiting response to requests for additional details
- Comment letters on the proposed merger can be sent to: Fair Oaks Water District at 10326 Fair Oaks Boulevard, Fair Oaks, CA 95628 – Attention SJWD & SSWD Member (a copy of all letters will be filed and the original forwarded to the official merger committee)

### Merger Discussion Issues for Fair Oaks Water District Customers

- Availability of Water Supply
- Cost of Water Supply
- Water Rights
- Elected Representation
- Over $100,000,000 of debt

If you have any questions for your Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) staff regarding the proposed merger of the San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District, please contact the FOWD office at 916-967-5723. **Please Note that your Fair Oaks Water District currently has no debt and has invested over 35% of every ratepayer dollar back into water system improvements for the past ten years!**

   SJWD Director Rich inquired how much water was transferred between SSWD and SJWD on an average year.  
   San Juan Water District (SJWD) General Manager Paul Helliker (SJWD GM Helliker) explained that the annual contracts started around 2019 which started around 6,000 acre feet, and that in 2023 it was 4,000 acre feet.  
   SSWD GM York expressed that on average there has been between 8,000 and 12,000 acre feet of PCWA water that is treated and wheeled from SJWD through the CTP and ATP.  
   SSWD Director Wichert requested to receive a copy of the PowerPoint Presentation.  
   William Eubanks (Mr. Eubanks) inquired about the SSWD South Service Area noting that he felt that it was not getting the attention it needed, as he believed the new wells were only being constructed in the North Service Area.

2. **Consultant Services and Communications Plan**  
   SJWD GM Helliker introduced the staff report and presented the PowerPoint Presentation, noting staff was requesting to put together a request for proposals (RFP) for a consultant to work on a Business Case Analysis.  
   SSWD Director Wichert expressed that he did not support using the Raftelis report as a model to use going forward.  
   SSWD GM York explained that the Raftelis report was only placed as an attachment in the report as an example, not to be used as a model.  
   SSWD Director Wichert moved for both agencies to embark on a process whereby the Boards would develop a table of contents and scope of work for a study to be conducted by a consultant, using the RFP, by using the table of contents and outline.  
   SJWD GM Helliker pointed out the components in the PowerPoint presentation that staff was recommending to be analyzed, such as operations, finance, rates and debt.  
   SSWD Director Wichert stated that he was most interested in the Boards approving the table of contents and outline.  
   SSWD GM York offered a suggestion for the motion, that staff provide a draft for the Boards to review and amend, if necessary. He additionally suggested that a consultant

interview each Director and additionally follow up with the interviews to ensure that their concerns are being addressed.

SSWD Director Wichert amended the motion to include GM York’s suggestion.

The motion died for a lack of a second.

Mr. Eubanks stated that he believed the customers in the South Service Area of SSWD would gain no benefit from a combination of SSWD and SJWD.

Jose Henriquez, Executive Officer for the Local Agency Formation Commission, recommended that in a consolidation situation where a district could dissolve, he recommended to protect the pre-1914 water rights, and additionally for SJWD with their dual status which would additionally be protected.

SJWD GM Helliker reiterated that staff was recommending the Board provide direction to move ahead with a Business Case Analysis, and to issue an RFP, including a scope of work and all of the elements. He additionally pointed out that staff was recommending to utilize each agencies’ communication consultants by expanding their scope to include communication for the current combination discussions.

SJWD Director Costa moved to allow the General Managers to work together to develop an RFP and include any input from their respective Boards. He added that another Joint Board meeting was not needed to draft the RFP; SJWD Director Zamorano seconded the motion.

SSWD Chair Thomas moved to allow the General Managers to come together to develop an RFP and include any input from their respective Boards. He added that another Joint Board meeting was not needed to draft the RFP.

SSWD Legal Counsel Josh Horowitz expressed that each Director could express individually to their General Manager what their suggestions would be for the RFP, but that another Joint Board meeting should be held to finalize and approve the RFP in public.

SJWD Director Costa withdrew his motion.

SSWD Chair Thomas withdrew his motion.

SSWD Director Boatwright moved for the General Managers to work together to develop an RFP and allow each Director to express individually to their General Manager what their suggestions would be for the RFP, and that the draft document be discussed and approved at a future Joint Board meeting. SSWD Director Jones seconded.

SJWD Director Costa moved for the General Managers to come together to develop an RFP and allow each Director to express individually to their General Manager what

their suggestions would be for the RFP, and that the draft document be discussed and approved at a future Joint Board meeting. SJWD Director Tobin seconded.

SSWD Director Wichert expressed he wanted to be sure that economics was included in the study. He additionally requested to provide an amendment to the motion, that the communications teams not begin working on outreach efforts until the Boards had an opportunity to gather more information in the study.

SSWD Director Boatwright pointed out that the amendment did not apply to the motion, as the motion was only addressing the business case analysis and not anything on communications. He expressed that he was however, in favor of what SSWD Director Wichert suggested on public outreach, though noting that he would be ok with general information being distributed.

SSWD Director Wichert requested an amendment to the motion to make it clear that the study will include a rate study. He further suggested to sole source Mark Hildebrand for that rate study.

SSWD Director Boatwright expressed that he felt SSWD Director Wichert’s requested amendment to the motion should be an item for discussion among the Joint Boards, and recommended it be a subsequent motion following the current motion, but not included in the current motion.

The motion from the SSWD passed by 3/1 vote.

AYES: Boatwright, Jones, and Thomas.  
ABSTAINED:

**Date:**  
July 31, 2024  

**Subject:**  
Request for Proposals for Business Case Analysis  

**Staff Contact:**  
Dan York, SSWD General Manager  
Paul Helliker, SJWD General Manager  

**Recommended Board Action:**  
Approve the Request for Proposal to conduct a Business Case Analysis.  

**Discussion:**  
At the June 25, 2024 Joint Board meeting, both Boards of Directors of Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) and San Juan Water District (SJWD) directed the General Managers to develop a Request For Proposal (RFP) for a Business Case Analysis (Analysis), and present it to the respective Boards at the July 31, 2025 Joint Board meeting for approval. That proposed draft RFP is attached to this staff report.

This RFP contains three tasks for two scenarios: a description of the existing characteristics, operations and assets of the two organizations; an analysis of the pros and cons of continuing to operate as independent organizations compared to combining into one organization; and the meetings and deliverables for the project. Some of this Analysis was conducted as part of the Collaboration/Integration Project during 2019-21, and much of the data and other information on which this Analysis will be based is available in various plans and reports that have been prepared by the Districts (master plans, asset management plans, financial management plans, etc.). The goal of this project is not to replicate these plans and reports, but to synthesize and analyze the information and define the benefits and challenges of either combining organizations or continuing with the status quo.

The RFP includes references to certain meetings and outreach activities. There will also be scopes of work for the communications consultants to conduct more extensive activities in these categories.

**DRAFT**  
**REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL**  
**CONSULTANT SERVICES FOR**  
**A BUSINESS CASE ANALYSIS FOR A POTENTIAL COMBINATION**  
**BETWEEN**  
**SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT AND**  
**SACRAMENTO SUBURBAN WATER DISTRICT**  

**A. INTRODUCTION:**  

San Juan Water District (SJWD) and Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) are issuing this Request for Proposals (RFP) to select a qualified firm to conduct an analysis on a potential combination of the two agencies into a single entity.  

**Study Objective**  

SJWD and SSWD (Agencies) desire to become more efficient and to minimize cost to their customers and optimize the use of their water supplies, personnel, equipment, infrastructure and other resources, as well as improve their ability to influence state and federal policies. The Agencies desire to evaluate whether or not they can better achieve these objectives by combining SJWD and SSWD into a single organization, comparing that scenario to no change to existing operations. As part of the Study for the potential combination activities, the selected consultant should 1) evaluate potential governance structures and board advisory committees to ensure customer equality and equity for both districts and achieve an overall cost benefit to the Agencies’ customers, 2) perform a detailed assessment of each agency’s operations, infrastructure and other assets and 3) perform detailed financial analyses of each agency’s current water rates, fees, debts, retirement funding obligations, costs, and reserves, and future equities based on current capital improvement projects (CIP) plans. Also as part of the Study, the Agencies desire to understand the pros and cons of these alternatives, and to understand the compelling reasons for making any changes.  

**Background**  

In 2019, SJWD and SSWD were part of a regional effort to identify opportunities to improve collaboration and potentially merge operations into one combined district. In June 2021, the regional effort was finalized.  

On June 25, 2024, a Joint Board meeting was held between SJWD and SSWD. Direction was given to the General Managers to develop a RFP for the purpose of analyzing the pros and cons of a potential combination of the two agencies.  

**Project Management**  

SSWD will be responsible for administration of the project and will be the primary contact for the consultant. The project will be overseen by the General Managers of SJWD and SSWD.

17. **Waiver; Remedies.** A party’s failure to insist upon the strict performance of any provision of this Agreement by the other party (“breaching party”), irrespective of the length of time for which such failure continues, shall not constitute a waiver of the non-breaching party’s right to demand strict compliance in the future. A waiver shall not be effective or binding unless made in writing by the non-breaching party, and may not be implied from any omissions by the non-breaching party. A written waiver shall not constitute a continuing waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or a different provision of this Agreement.

All of the remedies permitted or available under this Agreement, or at law or in equity, shall be cumulative and alternative, and the invocation of any such right or remedy shall not constitute a waiver or election of remedies with respect to any other available right of remedy.

![Attachment B](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Sacramento+Suburban+Water+District+Conflict+of+Interest+Code)

**Sacramento Suburban Water District**  
**Conflict of Interest Code**  
**Adopted:** February 20, 2002  
**Revised:** September 21, 2020  

The Political Reform Act (Government Code Section 81000, et seq.) requires state and local government agencies to adopt and promulgate conflict of interest codes. The Fair Political Practices Commission has adopted a regulation, Section 18730 of Title 2 of the California Code of Regulations, which contains the terms of a standard conflict of interest code. This regulation can be incorporated by reference into any agency’s code without publication in full within the code. After public notice and hearing, Section 18730 may be amended by the Fair Political Practices Commission to conform to amendments in the Political Reform Act. Therefore, the terms of that regulation, Title 2, section 18730 of the California Code of Regulations and any amendments to it duly adopted by the Fair Political Practices Commission from time to time are hereby incorporated by reference in full into this code and will be applied in accordance with the provisions existing on the date that any issue arising under this code adopted by the Sacramento Suburban Water District Board of Directors must be addressed. This cover page, the referenced and incorporated FPPC regulation, and the Appendix, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein, designating positions and establishing disclosure categories, shall constitute the conflict of interest code of the Sacramento Suburban Water District.

Recognizing that different employees have different levels of authority and responsibility, the Appendix to this Conflict of Interest Code establishes three categories of disclosure under which employees are designated based on the scope of their decision-making authority. Employees with no significant decision-making responsibility are classified as exempt, and are not required to file reports under this Code.

Non-exempt District employees and officers listed in the attached Appendix are designated as persons who are deemed to make, or participate in the making of, decisions that may have a material effect on a financial interest. Consultants are also subject to the disclosure requirements of this Conflict of Interest Code if they are in a position to make decisions, or influence decisions, that could have an effect on their financial interest.

# SACRAMENTO SUBURBAN WATER DISTRICT  
## CONFLICT OF INTEREST CODE  

### APPENDIX OF DESIGNATED POSITIONS AND DISCLOSURE CATEGORIES  

**Designated Positions.** The officers and employees listed below are designated as persons who are deemed to make, or participate in the making of, decisions that may have a material effect on a financial interest. Persons holding designated positions listed below will disclose interests and investments in accordance with the corresponding disclosure categories as defined below.

| Designated Position            | Disclosure Categories |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Assistant General Manager      | 1                     |
| District Legal Counsel         | 1                     |
| Engineering Manager            | 1                     |
| Operations Manager             | 2                     |
| Information Technology Manager  | 2                     |
| Customer Services Manager      | 3                     |
| Consultants                    | 1¹                    |

**Officials Who Manage Public Investments.** Officials who manage public investments are deemed to be “statutory filers” within the meaning of Government Code Section 87200 and California Code of Regulations, Title 2, section 18720 because they must file statements of economic interest (FPPC Form 700) pursuant to the state Political Reform Act instead of the District’s Conflict of Interest Code. The District’s statutory filers are: Members of the Board of Directors, General Manager/Board Secretary and Director of Finance and Administration/Board Treasurer. As a result, such persons are not designated in this code and are listed here for information only. An individual holding one of the above-listed positions may contact the Fair Political Practices Commission (“FPPC”) for assistance or written advice regarding their filing obligations if they believe that their position has been categorized incorrectly. The FPPC makes the final determination whether or not a position is covered by Government Code Section 87200.

¹ Unless the General Manager determines in writing that narrower disclosure is permitted in accordance with the standards provided on page 2 of this Appendix under the heading “Consultants.”  

{00128758.1}  
Page 87 of 162  
<!-- Page 88 -->
# Disclosure Categories

The District’s disclosure categories are defined as follows:

**Category 1 - Full Disclosure:** All persons in this disclosure category will disclose all interests in real property within two miles of the District’s boundaries, as well as all investments, business positions in business entities and sources of income, including receipt of gifts, loans and travel payments, from all sources.

**Category 2 - Employees with Significant Contracting and Policy Authority But Without Authority Over Acquisition of Interests in Real Property:** All persons in this disclosure category will disclose all investments, business positions in business entities and sources of income, including receipt of gifts, loans and travel payments, in or from all sources that provide goods, equipment or services, including training or consulting services, of the type utilized by the District.

**Category 3 - Employees with Specific Contracting or Policy Authority or Who Participate in Making Specific Contracts or Policies:** All positions in this category will disclose all investments, business positions in business entities and sources of income, including the receipt of gifts, loans and travel payments, in or from all sources that provide services and supplies of the type utilized by the department or programs administered or managed by the designated position.

## Consultants

“Consultant” means an individual who, pursuant to a contract with the District, either: (A) Makes a governmental decision whether to: (1) approve a rate, rule, or regulation; (2) adopt or enforce a law; (3) issue, deny, suspend, or revoke any permit, license, application, certificate, approval, order, or similar authorization or entitlement; (4) authorize the District to enter into, modify, or renew a contract provided it is the type of contract that requires District approval; (5) grant District approval to a contract that requires District approval and to which the District is a party, or to the specifications for such a contract; (6) grant District approval to a plan, design, report, study, or similar item; or (7) adopt or grant District approval of policies, standards, or guidelines for the District, or for any subdivision thereof; or (B) Serves in a staff capacity with the District and in that capacity participates in making a governmental decision as defined in California Code of Regulations, Title 2, Section 18702.2 or performs the same or substantially all the same duties for the District that would otherwise be performed by an individual holding a position specified in the District’s conflict of interest code under Government Code Section 87302. (See 2 CCR 18701(a)(2).) 

A consultant serves in a staff capacity only if he or she has an on-going relationship with the District. A consultant who works on one project or a limited range of projects for the District is not deemed a consultant subject to the reporting requirements of this code unless the project or projects extend over a substantial period of time, generally more than one year. (See Smith Advice Letter, FPPC No. I-99-316; Travis Advice Letter, FPPC No. A-96-053; Randolph Advice Letter, FPPC No. A-95-045.) 

{00182785.1}  
3
<!-- Page 89 -->
“Consultants” are included in the list of designated positions and must disclose interests and investments in accordance with the broadest disclosure category in the District’s conflict of interest code, subject to the following limitation: The General Manager may determine in writing that a particular consultant, although a “consultant” and “designated position,” nevertheless is hired or retained to perform a range of duties that is limited in scope and therefore is not required to comply with any or some of the disclosure requirements described in this section. The General Manager’s written determination will include a description of the consultant’s duties, and, based on that description, a statement of the extent of disclosure requirements. The written determination is a public record and will be retained for public inspection in the same manner and location as the District’s conflict of interest code as required by Government Code Section 81008.

**New Position Added or New Consultant Hired Without Code Revision.** If the District creates a new position that requires disclosure under this code without simultaneously amending the code, the employee appointed to fill such a position will file a Form 700 Assuming Office Statement and thereafter file annual Form 700 Disclosure of Economic Interest Statements using the broadest disclosure category until the District amends the code to designate the position and, if warranted, to authorize more narrow disclosure for the position. Alternatively, the General Manager may designate for any such position or consultant narrower disclosure obligations using a FPPC Form 804 (New Hire) or Form 805 (New Consultant) as appropriate. (See 2 CCR 18734.)

**Filing of Form 700 Statements of Economic Interest.** Persons holding designated positions shall complete and file Form 700 statements of economic interests with the Sacramento County Clerk of the Board’s Office via the County’s electronic filing system. The Clerk of the Board will act as the District’s Code filing officer and retain all Forms 700 filed and will, upon request, make filed statements of economic interests available for public inspection and reproduction (at a cost of no more than $0.10 per page) in accordance with Government Code Section 81008.

# AGENDA ITEM V.3

**REGULAR Board Meeting August 19, 2024**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tom R. Gray  
**Date:** August 15, 2024  
**Subject:** Discussion and possible action on a request to form a FOWD Customer Advisory Committee  

**Recommendation:**  
Provide direction to FOWD staff relative to the formation of a FOWD Customer Advisory Committee.  

**Discussion:**  
The FOWD Board of Directors was requested to form a FOWD Customer Advisory Committee due to an alleged lack of financial transparency and accountability at the FOWD.  

**FOWD facts relative to financial transparency and accountability:**

1. FOWD rates are currently the lowest in the Sacramento Region and are only 57% of the Sacramento Region average water rate.  
   a. After implementing Board approved rate adjustments of 10% in 2023 and 10% in 2024, FOWD water rates remain the lowest in the Sacramento Region and 57% of the Sacramento Region average.  

2. FOWD completes a proposition 218 public outreach process for all rate adjustments.  
   a. The Board adopted rate adjustments for 2023, 2024 and 2025 on November 21, 2022 after completing a proposition 218 public outreach process.  

3. FOWD completes an annual financial audit by an independent outside auditor and provides all results to customers at a public meeting and on the FOWD website.  

4. FOWD provides a monthly report itemizing every credit card purchase and every check issued at public meetings and on the FOWD website.  

5. FOWD provides a monthly report itemizing every payment issued to Board Members at public meetings and on the FOWD website.  

6. FOWD provides a monthly report itemizing budget item spending to date at public meetings and on the FOWD website.  

7. FOWD provides a monthly report on all FOWD investments and “cash on hand” at public meetings and on the FOWD website.  
<!-- Page 92 -->
![Fair Oaks Water District Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Fair+Oaks+Water+District+Document)

8. FOWD expenses over $25,000 are discussed and approved by the Board at monthly public meetings.

9. Every FOWD Board meeting provides an opportunity for public comment at the beginning and end of each public meeting – with the FOWD Board allowing public input on each agenda items during the Board meeting.

10. FOWD has been awarded for financial transparency every year that the current management team and Board have served the community of Fair Oaks.

11. All large capital improvement projects are openly discussed at public Board meetings prior to approval.

12. In addition to completing a public annual budget process and developing an annual budget that is publicly approved by the Board and posted on the FOWD website – the FOWD completes an Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR).
   a. The completion of a ACFR is not required by any regulation or law. Public agencies that provide an ACFR do so to provide a higher level of financial transparency and accountability to their customers.

13. In addition to having professional licenses and certifications in engineering and water operations, the FOWD team also has the following related to financial transparency and accountability:
   a. Certified Special District Manager
   b. Certified Public Accountant
   c. Senior Certified Human Resources Professional
   d. Master’s in Business Administration

14. The FOWD mission is comprised of three major components: provide high quality water, provide a reliable water supply, and provide water at the lowest reasonable cost.
   a. The FOWD delivers some of the highest quality water in the State of California.
   b. FOWD water supply reliability is one best in the State of California.
   c. FOWD water rates are the lowest in the Sacramento Region.

Staff has attached limited back up information related to FOWD transparency and accountability – while encouraging the Board and FOWD customers to seek the truth about the Fair Oaks Water District by visiting our website for detailed specific information.

“FOWD has a history of only asking customers for rate increases when we must have them.”

**NEED FOR INCREASED REVENUE**  
Recently the FOWD Board of Directors decided that continuing to meet the mission of the FOWD will require increased revenue from our valued customers. The cost of purchasing water, complying with laws and regulations governing drinking water safety and reliability, and responsibly replacing aging system infrastructure are increasing and cannot be paid without increasing rates. The three major drivers exerting upward pressure on water rates charged to the FOWD customers are: capital investment needs of approximately $37M over the next five years, inflation, and wholesale surface water rate increases charged by the San Juan Water District. Please note the following:

- The FOWD INCREASED RATES 13% from 2006 to 2021.
- Consumer Price Index Inflation INCREASED 49% from 2006 to 2021.
- Cost of Surface Water Purchased from SJWD INCREASED 323% from 2006 to 2021.
- An acre foot of water purchased by the FOWD from the SJWD cost $95.05 in 2006.
- An acre foot of water purchased by the FOWD from the SJWD cost $307.08 in 2021.

‘The new District facilities should evoke a sense of civic pride and serve as a community cornerstone.’

**FOWD’s New Administrative and Customer Service Center To Compliment Fair Oaks Village Charm**

The Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) recently completed a series of public meetings, receiving input and suggestions from Fair Oaks community members regarding the architectural design “look and feel” of FOWD’s new Administration and Customer Service Center (ACSC), as well as the proposed FOWD Corporation Yard update plan.

At the first meeting, District representatives asked the public probing questions regarding the Fair Oaks community, the role of a “Civic” building, and their opinions of an “appropriate architectural expression” for a public building in Fair Oaks. Using the input received at the first meeting, three design concepts were developed. These three design concepts were presented at the second public meeting hosted by the Fair Oaks Water District. After recording all ideas, suggestions and concerns, and viewing three different building concepts and architectural renderings, the participating community members selected one conceptual design scheme they felt best represented the Fair Oaks community and complimented the Fair Oaks Village.

![Spring 2007 FOWD Press Release on FOWD Fair Oaks Village Enhancements](https://example.com/image-url)

Now that the public has provided input on a new building design concept, the FOWD design team and Board are now pleased to be moving forward with the development of the new FOWD ACSC (to be located at the former “Racy’s Garden Décor and Furniture Center,” at 10330 Fair Oaks Boulevard in Old Fair Oaks Village), and the FOWD Corporation Yard (on the site that is presently the FOWD administration office complex). A graphic rendering of the selected building design concept, developed by the architectural firm of Murray & Downs, may be seen on this at the FOWD website.

Upon completion, the new FOWD ACSC will allow the FOWD to provide ratepayers with upgraded services, and ultimately better traffic flow and parking.

The FOWD was already in the planning stages of constructing a new facility when the Racy property became for sale. The FOWD Board chose to purchase the property when it was determined by both the FOWD management, and the new building architects, to be ultimately less expensive and less impactful on FOWD’s customers and employees to simply build on the vacant property across the street, while continuing operations at the present facilities.

Debra L. Smith, Senior Project Architect for the firm of Murray & Downs, made the following statements after review of the available information. “We determined that the cost of building at the Racy site will be less than the replacement of facilities on the existing site. Having this site across the street will allow the District to build a new administrative center, while remaining in the existing facilities without incurring interim facility costs…The site will allow the District greater flexibility in the time schedule to develop their existing property and will allow their existing property to better serve the vehicular traffic for operations.”

“It’s our hope that the new Fair Oaks Water District Administration offices will eventually act as gateway or welcome point as the community and visitors enter Old Fair Oaks,” commented Tom Gray, General Manager of the Fair Oaks Water District. “We now look forward to constructing new facilities at the site across the street, while continuing our day-to-day operations at our current site, allowing us to save thousands of rate-payer dollars in the process. When construction is finally completed, the District will have wonderful new administration and customer services facilities on one side of the street, and storage, vehicle and service operations on the other side of the street. It will be better for our customers and add a valuable new asset to the community – everyone wins.”

# Fair Oaks Water District
## Corporation Yard Redevelopment Project
### Public Outreach Document
#### July 2021

---

**Background:**

Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) is planning to renovate its corporation yard located at 10317 Fair Oaks Boulevard in order to increase the quality of public service, accommodate internal needs and improve our presence in the Fair Oaks Village.

FOWD purchased the current site in 1979 from the Diamond International Company, which previously used the facility as a lumberyard. The site’s main building is a heavy timber structure reportedly built in the 1920s or 30s.

Over the more than 40-plus years that FOWD has owned the site, the District has renovated the main building and property a number of times to accommodate current regulations and to repair damage from rain and flooding. Still, there continues to be major problems with the existing structure and site.

---

**Problems with the existing structure and site include the following:**

- There are drainage and flooding problems. The current site slopes towards the main building with the existing drainage infrastructure being inadequate during heavy rain periods - causing water to frequently drain into the building.

- Animals routinely reside in the buildings and on the site - resulting in frequent flea infestations that impact FOWD staff.

- Existing restrooms do not comply with current ADA (Americans with Disability Act)/Title 24 accessibility codes - counters and doorways throughout the building are not ADA accessible.

- Preliminary structural investigations indicate the building does not meet current building codes, including seismic or wind loading requirements.
- Public parking and signage is limited and confusing: the one small lot for public parking contains only one handicapped stall and unmarked spaces for up to five cars.
- The existing office space is inadequately ventilated, worn and poorly lit.
- The existing site cannot be maintained in a manner that makes it an asset to the Fair Oaks Village.
- The ceiling in the main building is not sealed - allowing external dust to settle into the interior office spaces, computers and air space.

**Renovation and Site Redevelopment:**

In 2007, the Fair Oaks Water District completed a series of meetings to provide the Fair Oaks Community an opportunity to give input on the look and feel of the new Fair Oaks Water District Administration Center and Corporation Yard. At each of these public meetings District representatives asked the public questions and listened to input. The objective of each of the meetings was to document the public’s ideas and concerns, and to provide answers to specific questions.

At the first meetings, District representatives asked the public for input on two questions: What is Fair Oaks? What is Civic? Using the public’s answers to the two questions, and all the other input received at the first meetings, three design concepts were developed. These three design concepts were presented at the next public meetings hosted by the FOWD. All attending these meetings were asked which conceptual design option best represented an appropriate architectural expression for a public building in Fair Oaks. Based on the comments received, the public selected the Spanish eclectic design concept that resulted in the construction of the current FOWD administrative building.

During the extensive public outreach completed in 2007, it was understood that the conceptual design scheme selected would also be used for the redevelopment of the FOWD site located at 10317 Fair Oaks Boulevard - with the community clearly expressing that the Spanish eclectic design concept best represented the community of Fair Oaks and the Fair Oaks Village.

The proposed design for the redevelopment of the FOWD corporation yard is based on the above and input at many public Board meetings throughout 2019 and 2020.

![Benefits to the Fair Oaks Village](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Benefits+to+the+Fair+Oaks+Village)

**Benefits to the Fair Oaks Village:**

While the primary intended outcome of the FOWD Corporation Yard Project is to meet the mission of the FOWD, completion of the project will bring many benefits to the Fair Oaks Village.

- Cleaner look to a Fair Oaks Village anchor property.
- Public sidewalk improvements on a main access to the Fair Oaks Village.
- Up to 10 parking spaces available to the public during non-work hours.
- Up to 20 parking spaces available to the public during weekend special events.

**Key Points Learned from Public Meetings:**

**What is Fair Oaks?**

The Fair Oaks Village has a sense of place, comprised of an eclectic blend of commercial, residential, and civic buildings surrounding a central gathering space that includes the park, community clubhouse, and the theater.

**What is Civic?**

Civic buildings in Fair Oaks should represent the best of the community: proud, friendly, and understated. Such a building should stand out while complimenting the existing village architectural fabric. The public decided that the "tutor" style was a late comer to Fair Oaks and too residential to demonstrate a civic face for a public building. The Spanish eclectic, mission, and contemporary styles evident in the Village are more suitable for a public venue.

**What is an appropriate architectural expression for a public building in Fair Oaks?**

The public selected a Spanish eclectic design concept as the preferred style for a new FOWD Administration Building and for a future Corporation Yard Redevelopment Project. The public felt it was dynamic, complimentary to the village architectural fabric, and provided a civic feel without being overstated. This option also tied into the existing architectural expression of the buildings that make up the village center, including the theater building and the community clubhouse. The proposed concept has a modest presence and an old town look which the public felt was important.

# AGENDA ITEM VI.1
**REGULAR Board Meeting August 19, 2024**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Siebensohn  
**Date:** August 6, 2024  
**Subject:** Discussion on FOWD Water Supply for the month of July 2024  

## Recommendation:

## Discussion:
According to the Accuweather.com website, the recorded average daily temperature in July 2024 was 82.0° F, which is 6.5 degrees above the historic average of 75.5° F for July. Precipitation for July 2024 was recorded at 0.00” according to the Department of Water Resources Chicago rain station located in Fair Oaks.

The wholesale connections provided 1,359.83 AC-FT (91.83%) of surface water and FOWD groundwater wells produced 120.91 AC-FT (8.17%) to meet the total water demand of 1,480.74 AC-FT.

A graph of total consumption to date versus projected budget target is found in Exhibit A.

A graph of groundwater and surface water use in 2024 to date is found in Exhibit B.

Both the FO-40 and CTP wholesale connections remained open to provide surface water supply to the District.

According to the data provided by SJWD, the recorded volumes from wholesale connections are:

| Connection | Forward Flow, AC-FT | Reverse Flow, AC-FT | Total, AC-FT |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| CTP Connection | 840.45 | 0.00 | 840.45 |
| FO-40 (39°) | 519.38 | 0.00 | 519.38 |
| **TOTAL FROM SJWD** | **1,359.83** | **0.00** | **1,359.83** |

The average daily flow from wholesale connections for the month of July 2024 was recorded at 9,918 GPM.

The maximum day water demand was reached on July 4, 2024, and was recorded at approximately 16.36 million gallons (MG) with the wholesale connections providing 14.95 MG and FOWD groundwater wells providing 1.41 MG. The minimum day water demand was recorded on July 29, 2024, at 14.31 MG. The average day demand was calculated at 15.52 MG.

The 10-year total average water use for the month of July is 1,378.69 AC-FT and July 2013 total water demand was recorded at 1,741.64 AC-FT. The July 2024 total water demand of 1,480.74 AC-FT represents an increase of 7.40% from the July 10-year average, a 14.98% decrease from July 2013 consumption, and a 10.76% increase from 2023 consumption.

# REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS

## FAIR OAKS WATER DISTRICT  
### SPECIAL DISTRICT FINANCIAL AUDITOR

The Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) is seeking statements of qualifications from certified public accounting firms to provide financial audit services. The following is an overview of the FOWD and a general overview of the financial audit services that the District is seeking to retain.

### 1.0 Fair Oaks Water District

The District was organized on March 26, 1917 as the Fair Oaks Irrigation District under the provisions of Division 11 of the California Water Code. The District's original water supply was untreated surface water purchased from the North Fork Ditch Company. After completion of Folsom Dam on the American River in 1954, the North Fork Ditch Company's water rights were transferred to the newly created San Juan Suburban Water District. In 1979 the District formally changed its name to Fair Oaks Water District, even though it is legally still an irrigation District.

#### Goods Produced and Services Provided

The District currently purchases surface water from the San Juan Water District as treated water and delivers this water to approximately 14,000 residential and commercial service connections through 180 miles of pipe. The balance of the District’s water is supplied by six groundwater wells. A three-million-gallon storage tank and a booster station provide peaking capacity during the system high demand. The District serves a population of approximately 40,000 on approximately 6,000 acres in the northeastern section of Sacramento County.

#### Organizational Structure

A publicly elected five-member Board of Directors serves four-year staggered terms and governs the District. Each Director represents a specific geographic division within the District boundaries but is elected at large. Currently, the District has 32 Board approved regular full-time employee positions.

Today, Fair Oaks Water District stands as a committed and involved member of the community. The District is led by five Board Members, including Mark Dolby, Randy Marx, Michael McRae, Chris Petersen and Misha Sarkovich.

#### Customer Commitment

The FOWD is dedicated to providing excellent customer service, representing our community’s interest and serving as a role model for integrity, dependability, enthusiasm and professionalism.

The District is seeking to retain a professional firm to provide financial audit services.

For continuity purposes, the District is interested in working with one primary person assigned from the CPA firm.

The audit shall be performed in accordance with the generally accepted accounting standards as set forth by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the standards for financial audits set forth in the most current edition of the U.S. General Accounting Office’s (GAO), Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and the Minimum Audit Requirements and Reporting Guidelines for California Special Districts, issued by the State Controller’s Division of Local Government Fiscal Affairs pursuant to Government Code Section 26909 and others as applicable.

The selected auditor will be requested to express an opinion on the fair representation of the District’s general-purpose financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

It is the District’s policy that the audit of the District’s financial records shall be performed by a certified public accountant. The District has a “not to exceed” five-year rotation of audit firms with an interim rotation of senior auditor. The District intends to enter into an agreement for

II. The selected auditor shall present the results of the audit to the Board of Directors in a Regular or Special Board Meeting.

III. The auditor shall provide a Management Letter to the District’s General Manager, communicating any reportable conditions found during the audit.

The auditor shall also provide a separate Management Letter communicating any financial items noted during the audit.

# AGENDA ITEM VI.3
## REGULAR Board Meeting August 19, 2024

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tom R. Gray  
**Date:** August 13, 2024  
**Subject:** Discussion on Board direction for the development of a 2025 FOWD Annual Budget  

### Recommendation:
Provide general direction to FOWD staff to be used in the development of an annual budget for the 2025 calendar year.

### Summary of staff understanding of current Board direction:
- Adjust rates in accordance with the Board adopted three-year rate plan  
  - The Board adopted rate adjustments for 2023, 2024 and 2025 on November 21, 2022 after completing a proposition 218 public outreach process.  
  - After implementing Board approved rate adjustments of 10% in 2023 and 10% in 2024, FOWD water rates remain the lowest in the Sacramento Region and 57% of the Sacramento Region average.  
  - The Board adopted rate adjustment for 2025 is 5%.  

- No new debt  
- No new capital projects besides those that the Board has approved and deemed necessary  
- Focus on completing current capital projects that are currently “work in progress”  
- Meet policy targets for financial reserves  
- Use a 90% surface water and 10% groundwater water supply target  
  - Newly adopted SJWD wholesale rates for the purchase of surface water provide a financial disincentive for the FOWD to serve groundwater to FOWD customers – FOWD essentially must pay for surface water even if we do not take delivery of surface water.  
- Include a 4% COLA in calculations  

### Policy Implications:
To Be Determined  

### Fiscal Impact:

# SACRAMENTO GROUNDWATER AUTHORITY  
## POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MANUAL  

**Policy Type:** Human Resources  
**Policy Title:** Employee Compensation Policy  
**Policy Number:** 100.3  
**Date Adopted:** February 14, 2019  
**Date Amended:** December 14, 2023  
**Next Review Date:** August 8, 2024  

---

## EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION POLICY  

It is the intent of the Sacramento Groundwater Authority (Authority) to provide employee compensation (pay and benefits) that is fair and equitable and that is comparable, based upon an employee's experience, skills and performance consistent with established job descriptions, and with that of similar water and public entities regionally. As a small, professional, management-focused organization, it is the intent of the Authority to provide employee compensation at or above the labor market for the industry and the geographic area. The compensation practices of the Authority will be competitive within the industry and geographical area to attract the most qualified candidates and to minimize turnover of its employees.  

The Executive Director will have the authority to set and change employee base rate of pay in accordance with the intent of this Policy and within the budgetary guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. As part of the annual budget review process, the Executive Director will be responsible for preparing and presenting a labor budget to the Board of Directors in accordance with this Policy. The Board of Directors will consider, amend as required, and approve the annual labor budget for the Authority. Once the labor budget has been approved, the Executive Director may determine in his or her discretion how to apply any approved increase to each employee's existing base rate of pay. Changes to employee benefits will generally require Board action to approve changes to the Employee Handbook and other policies.  

The specific terms of this Policy apply to staff only, except as specified in Section IV, below. All aspects of the Executive Director's compensation are subject to Board approval of an employment contract.  

### I. Pay Ranges  

It is the Authority's Policy to provide a program for advancement of its employees within the pay range of their position using a merit-based system based on objective regular goal setting and performance evaluations. Employees will typically advance within their pay.

Page 1 of 4  
Page 142 of 162  
<!-- Page 143 -->
![Page 2 of 4](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+2+of+4)

range annually, subject to the discretion of the Executive Director, based on evaluation of the employee’s performance and growth in responsibility and/or expertise in performing the work of the position. The Executive Director may move an employee to a higher-level classification or provide a merit-based salary increase, predicated upon performance, experience and documented needs of the organization.

All classification pay ranges shall typically be established with a 20% range between the minimum and maximum of the range. Except as provided below, steps will be established within each range to provide guidelines for use in annual budgeting. For executive-level positions (currently the Executive Director, Managers of Technical Services, Strategic Affairs, and Government Relations), there will be no steps established within the positions’ ranges.

All rank-and-file and executive-level positions shall be eligible for a merit-based salary increase up to no more than 12% per year (equivalent of three steps), as movement through their salary range provided all merit-based salary increases can be covered by the approved budget for the current year. Any increase above 12% for rank-and-file positions must be recommended by the Executive Director and then be ratified by the Board of Directors for exemplary performance or in recognition of unusual circumstances. Any increase above 12% along the salary range for executive-level positions, including the Executive Director, shall be ratified by the Board of Directors for exemplary performance or in recognition of unusual circumstances. In all cases, a written report supporting the request for Board approval of an increase above 12% shall describe the nature of the exemplary performance or unusual circumstances.

The Executive Director shall recommend pay ranges for all employment classifications with the Authority, with the exception of the Executive Director position. All changes to the pay scales are subject to review and approval by the Board of Directors.

Any salary increases provided as movement through an employee’s approved pay range shall be effective on the first day of the first pay period after the increase was approved.

II. Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)

The Executive Director will consider the United States Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Western Small Cities (population under 2.5 million) for the 12 months ending in November of each year in developing the proposed budget for the Authority¹. If the Board approves a budget that includes funding for a cost of living adjustment (COLA), the Executive Director will have the discretion to apply a COLA to all staff salaries, regardless of position within a salary range in the fiscal year for which the budget is adopted.

---

Page 2 of 4
<!-- Page 144 -->
CPI will be applied annually in January at an effective date as determined by the Board of Directors in conjunction with the beginning of a payroll period.

Effective July 1, 2024, the Authority will consider CPI data from the 12 months ending in March, with any approved COLA increase becoming effective the first day of the first pay period beginning in July.

III. Compensation Survey  
The Board of Directors will generally direct staff to conduct a compensation survey at least every five years to ensure that the total compensation offered by the Authority (base rate of pay and benefits) is consistent with this Policy; provided, however that a compensation survey may be commissioned at any time if directed by the Board of Directors or if recommended by the Executive Director and approved by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may also use its discretion to waive or vary the five-year commitment.

Before initiating the survey, staff will brief the Board of Directors and solicit feedback on the scope of the compensation survey, including comparable agencies/organizations to be surveyed and data elements to be collected prior to commencing the survey. Survey organizations should be selected to provide a representative sampling of 1) local water agencies, 2) water-related associations located in the Sacramento region, 3) regional planning organizations within the Sacramento region, and 4) regional membership organizations in the region.

The Executive Director will use the results of the survey to propose modifications to base rate of pay and/or benefits necessary to achieve the intent of this policy. Proposed pay ranges should include consideration of such things as 1) the mean, median and 62.5th percentile of the compensation data, 2) the comparability of surveyed classifications to SGA job classifications, and 3) SGA experience recruiting and retaining staff in each classification.

IV. Executive Director Compensation  
The Board of Directors will establish an Executive Director pay range. The pay range shall be established with the same 20% range between the minimum and maximum of the range as is applied to other staff pay ranges under Section I. There will be no steps established within the range. The Board of Directors shall update the Executive Director pay range annually by the amount of any COLA applied to all staff salaries under Section II.

The Board of Directors shall determine Executive Director compensation within the established Executive Director pay range and such compensation will be subject to approval of an employment contract by the Board of Directors, with a maximum change of up to 12% annually, consistent with the maximum salary movement of all executive-level positions as described in Section 1. Any annual increase above 12% for the Executive Director must be approved by the Board of Directors for exemplary performance or unusual.

circumstances. The Board of Directors may direct staff to conduct a survey of executive compensation to guide negotiation of the Executive Director employment contract. The conduct, timing, and scope of such a survey will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors.
