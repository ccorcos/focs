Fourth of July: While the daytime hours were suspiciously slow for fire related call volume, the evening hours proved to be busy with a number of working structure fires, as well as many small grass fires. It is no overstatement to herald our “Land, Sea, and Air” capabilities that provided an excellent response. Our field crews did an excellent job with aggressive attacks, prudent use of resources, and admirable resilience moving from one incident to another. The Command Staff worked alongside our Field Commanders aiding them in the many fires that were fought during the evening and early morning hours. Our CRRD personnel were out in full force over both July 3rd and 4th monitoring the three major Public Fireworks shows at Northridge CC, Del Paso CC and Hagan Park. There were no issues of consequence at any of the shows thanks to good planning and our Inspector’s oversight. CRRD confiscated at least two very large caches (truckloads) of illegal fireworks with citations given.  
   c. Several of our Executive Staff (and BC House) welcomed recruits to the Metro Medic Program (MMP) 23-1 Academy on July 10.

D. Yesterday we had 2 good working fires in the District, one was in Battalion 9 / kitchen fire in a Duplex. A father and son discovered the fire and called 911. The Son went to the front door and saw a victim inside crawling on the floor. The Son kicked in the front door, and with the assistance of his father, placed the victim in a wheel chair and extricated him from the building. Victim was transported with burn injuries but is expected to survive. PIO working with BC9 on getting all the information to acknowledge the Father and Son for their heroic efforts. B5 / Antelope Area had a 2nd alarm fire with a fire starting between two / 2 story homes. The fire became well established in both homes including the attics. Multiple hose lines, vertical vent, and search performed in both structures. BC5 Aldrich ran the fire with 3 divisions utilizing a CMD channel and 2 tac channels. Crews worked tails off in high outside and interior temps. Many members became overheated and we focused on getting them cooled down and rotating fresh crews in for overhaul.

E. I would like to thank the Board of Directors for supporting Tablet Command for our BC’s and Chief Officers. Tablet Command is an Accountability and Tracking Tool that can be used to track decision points made by Command and lets incoming Chief Officers see where units are and what are their assignments.

F. Shout out to PIO Parker Wilbourn and his Staff on their great work pushing out information to the public, social media, News Networks etc. showcasing Metro Fire and informing our Citizens of events happening in our District.
