**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** October 10th, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Contract Approval: Scott’s PPE Recon for Care and Maintenance of Personal Protective Equipment  

**TOPIC**  
Staff requests Board approval for the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) to enter into a piggyback agreement for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) inspection, cleaning, repair, and alteration services with Scotts PPE Recon Inc.  

**BACKGROUND**  
Under Cal/OSHA Title 8 regulations, "Structural and proximity firefighting protective ensembles shall be selected, inspected, and maintained by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1851, Standard on Selection, Care, and Maintenance of Protective Ensembles for Structural Fire Fighting and Proximity Fire Fighting". The District has over 15,000 pieces of structural and wildland PPE that require special care and maintenance per NFPA standards and Cal/OSHA regulations and as outlined in the District's PPE Manual.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The District has an ongoing need to provide NFPA 1851 compliant care and maintenance of firefighter PPE. All garments are required to have two advanced cleanings and one advanced inspection performed each year. Currently, the District is able to perform its own cleaning and preliminary gear inspections at the District’s Care and Maintenance Center, saving the District approximately over half a million dollars.  

To ensure required advanced inspection and repair services are performed when required, the District’s Wellness, Health & Safety Division recommends entering into a new contract with Scott's PPE Recon Inc. (Scotts PPE). Scotts PPE has been the District’s independent service provider for PPE inspection, cleaning, repair, and alteration services for over 10 years. Currently, the advanced inspections and advanced repairs provided by Scotts PPE include, but are not limited to, moisture barrier testing, warranty repairs, outer shell repairs and modification, and trim testing and replacement. Scotts PPE has passed the “How Clean is Clean” NFPA 1851 cleaning verification test performed by Intertek. Additionally, Scotts PPE is able to handle the District's large volume of service requests, has a history of returning gear in a timely fashion, and provides excellent customer service.  

**Serving Sacramento and Placer Counties**  
P13
<!-- Page 14 -->
![Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+2)

The District's prior contract with Scotts PPE has expired. Per the District's Purchasing and Contracting Policy, purchases may be allowed without competitive bidding when a service is obtainable from suppliers which have a current contract with another governmental agency for the same item or service. On September 20, 2024, the City of San Jose awarded a contract to Scotts PPE entitled Purchase Order Number: OP 65685 for turnout gear inspection, cleaning, repair, and alteration services on behalf of the City of San Jose Fire Department pursuant to a competitive solicitation process. The City of San Jose's contract with Scotts PPE is in effect from September 20, 2024 through September 19, 2025 with the option to extend for six additional one-year terms. The City of San Jose's competitive solicitation process is in-line with the District's process and the City of San Jose has authorized the piggybacking of their original contract by the District.

**FISCAL IMPACT**

$250,000 is currently approved and budgeted for PPE care and maintenance in the 24/25 fiscal year. In order to maintain Cal/OSHA compliance and as more PPE is added to accommodate the Metro Medic Program and Emergency Medical Services (EMS), this number will likely increase.

**RECOMMENDATION**

Staff Recommends that the Board authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to execute a piggyback agreement with Scotts PPE Recon Inc. for the provision of turnout gear inspection, cleaning, repair, and alteration services.
