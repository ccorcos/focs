**OPERATIONS REPORT (Deputy Chief Adam Mitchell)**

On behalf of DC Adam Mitchell, AC Greene provided the Operations Report.

Recruit Academy 23-1 Graduated last Friday night with 12 Probationary Firefighters starting on the line this week. One of the B-Shift Firefighters had their first "fire" within an hour of the start of their first shift. It is always great to see support of the Director’s at the graduation ceremony, which is refreshing, to all to celebrate our newest member’s commitment to the District and citizens they will be serving.

Wildland season officially started this past Monday with a full grass fire response for suppression units. Due to the wet winter and delayed curing/drying of local grass crops, we have staggered start dates for Air Operations and Dozer Operations. Air Operations will go into service for the season starting this Memorial Day weekend and our Dozer Operations will go into service on June 1.

This week Metro Fire hosted a 3-day Auto-X class that is taught by approximately 10 of our members. This class has several of our members attending as students, joining Firefighters from all over Northern California. This is a grassroots class started several years ago by our members, and can be best described as auto extrication on steroids, teaching and evaluating complicated rescue techniques in challenging scenarios. Our PIO has great pictures on Metro Fire's social media which best represents the excellent curriculum presented.

**DATE:** June 22, 2023  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Adoption of Ordinance 2023-01 Fee Adjustment for Medical Aid and Ambulance Transport Services  

**TOPIC**  
Adoption of Ordinance 2023-01, amending Ordinance 2017-01 adopted by the Board of Directors on August 10, 2017, and updating the District's medical aid and ambulance transport user fees. The effective date of the increase would be July 24, 2023, or as soon possible thereafter.

**BACKGROUND**  
The Fire Protection District Law (Health & Safety Code §13800, et seq.) is the source of statutory authority for the District. Section 13916(a) provides that the District Board may charge a fee to cover the cost of any service which the district but limits the amount of the fee to the costs reasonably borne by the district in providing the service.

The District has established user fees to defray the costs of ambulance, medical aid, and rescue responses and other related services provided by the District. The fees were last reviewed in 2017 and have been adjusted annually by the change in the Medical Care Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Given increases in the cost of labor, medical supplies, and ambulances since 2017, staff felt it was appropriate to undertake a more thorough review of the cost of providing EMS related services to ensure that the fees being charged for such services are properly aligned with current costs. Recently, more public medical transport providers have converted to a single ambulance transport “base rate,” as opposed to separate rates for Advanced Life Support (ALS) and Basic Life Support (BLS) transports.

**DISCUSSION**  
A review of current EMS system costs and revenues demonstrates that the District is recovering roughly 34 percent of the cost of providing EMS services, with the balance covered by District property taxes and other general operating revenues. Using proposed FY 2023/24 budget amounts, the growth in EMS related expenses further outpace the growth in EMS revenue, with cost recovery declining to 32 percent of EMS system costs.

As a general rule, fees should be reviewed and adjusted roughly every five years or whenever there are significant changes impacting revenues or expenses. The last comprehensive review of EMS charges occurred in 2017, and since that time there.

**Serving Sacramento and Placer Counties**  
P11
<!-- Page 12 -->
![Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x985.png?text=Page+2)

have been number of significant changes impacting the cost of pre-hospital emergency medical services provided by the District.

With these considerations in mind, staff initiated an EMS fee study and review of billing practices, with the following goals:

- Decrease reliance on property taxes and other general operating revenues to fund EMS system expenses by ensuring EMS cost recovery is at least keeping pace with EMS costs;
- Establish a methodology to support an increase in EMS fees;
- Identify opportunities to streamline and lower costs associated with EMS service billing.

The results of the study support an increase in EMS fees/cost recovery. Furthermore, a review of the billing practices used by other major public transport providers, and discussions with the District’s current billing service provider, suggest that changing to a single base rate for an ambulance transport would result in reduced billing charges.

The current and recommended fees are shown in the following table:

| Fee Description                          | July 1, 2023* | Recommended |
|------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| First Responder Fee                      | $447           | $500        |
| Treat/No Transport Fee                   | $447           | -           |
| Assessment at Scene                      | -              | $500        |
| Emergency Ambulance Transport Base Rate  | $2,325         | -           |
| ALS Bundle Base Rate                     | $2,114         | -           |
| Mileage                                  | $41            | $50        |
| Oxygen                                   | $171           | $178        |
| Night Charge                             | $152           | $158        |
| Cardiac Monitor                          | $133           | $138        |

*Reflects annual CPI increase over prior year: 3.9 percent effective July 1, 2023

The recommended fees were developed using updated costs from the 2023/24 preliminary budget. ATTACHMENT A contains the cost analysis used to develop the Emergency Ambulance Transport Base Rate and ATTACHMENT B contains the cost analysis used to develop the First Responder Fee (involving transport) and Assessment at Scene (no transport). The recommended charges for Oxygen, Night Charge and Cardiac Monitor charges are based on the current rate plus a Medical Care CPI adjustment. ATTACHMENT C provides a comparison of other regional public agency EMS providers.

Most of the increased revenue from the fee adjustments would come from emergency ambulance transports. As noted in the following table, over 95 percent of transport revenues come from some form of medical insurance (private pay, Medicare, and MediCal), with private payers representing less than 5 percent of payments. Overall, 95 percent of EMS fee revenue is derived from transports, and 5 percent from assessments at scene.

| Private Pay                   | 4.60%                     | 38.00%                        |
| Medicare/Workers Comp/VA      | 49.50%                    | 5.00%                         |
| MediCal                       | 31.50%                    | 37.00%                        |
| **Total**                     | **100.00%**              | **100.00%**                  |

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The recommended fee adjustments are estimated to generate an additional $4 million of EMS service cost recovery during FY 2023/24 and maintain EMS cost recovery at approximately 34 percent. Not approving the fee adjustments would result in an increased use of property taxes and other general operating revenues to fund EMS system costs and reduce funding available for other emergency services provided by the District.

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends adoption of Ordinance 2023-01, an Ordinance of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District Amending Its Medical Aid and Ambulance Transport User Fees.

**DAN HAVERTY**  
Interim Fire Chief  

**DATE:** June 22, 2023  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Hazardous Materials Response Agreement – County of Sacramento  

**BACKGROUND**  
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) currently provides hazardous materials (HazMat) response throughout Sacramento County pursuant to an agreement dated October 2, 2019 between the District and the County of Sacramento (County). The agreement outlines the scope of services to be provided by the District and the associated compensation for such services. The term of the original agreement was to end June 30, 2021, but was extended to June 30, 2023 by way of two subsequent contract amendments.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The County desires to continue contracting with the District for the provision of HazMat response. Under the terms of the existing contract, the District's compensation is based on fees the County collects from the following benefiting agencies: County of Sacramento, Sacramento Area Sewer District, Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District, and the cities of Citrus Heights, Elk Grove, Folsom, and Rancho Cordova. In an effort to better recover the District's cost to provide the service, staff has been working with the County on revising the fee methodology. Since a revision of this kind will require the approval of all benefiting agencies and more time is needed to obtain such approval, staff has negotiated the attached one-year interim agreement with the County to bridge the gap while we continue good faith negotiations on a revised fee methodology for an intended multi-year contract. The terms of the attached agreement are materially similar to the existing agreement, and include a 10% increase in compensation.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The District's compensation will continue to be 33.34% of the amount collected by the County from the benefiting agencies under the proposed interim agreement. Total compensation for FY2023/24 is estimated at $224,540 and has been included in the approved Preliminary Budget.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to execute and administer the attached Agreement between the County of Sacramento and Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District for Hazardous Materials Response Teams.

**RESOLUTION NO. 2023-XXX**  

**AUTHORIZING THE FIRE CHIEF OR HIS DESIGNEE TO EXECUTE AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO AND SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN FIRE DISTRICT FOR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS RESPONSE TEAMS**  

WHEREAS, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) provides fire protection, emergency medical services and hazardous material response to a population of over 745,000 throughout a 359 square mile area; and  

WHEREAS, the District is currently under contract with the County of Sacramento (County) to provide Hazardous Materials response teams for the timely response and proper management of incidents involving the intentional or unintentional release of hazardous materials; and  

WHEREAS, the term of the existing contract ends June 30, 2023; and  

WHEREAS, the District and the County have negotiated a one-year agreement intended to be implemented July 1, 2023 to avoid disruption of service while good faith negotiations continue on a revised fee methodology for an intended multi-year agreement.  

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, a public entity established under the laws of the State of California, does hereby:  

1. Authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to execute the Agreement Between the County of Sacramento and Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District for Hazardous Materials Response Teams.  

PASSED, APPROVED AND ADOPTED this 22nd day of June 2023.

This AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of the ___ day of ___ 2023, by and between the COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, a political subdivision of the State of California (hereinafter referred to as "COUNTY") and the SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN FIRE DISTRICT, a California Special District (hereinafter referred to as "METRO").

**RECITALS**

WHEREAS, the timely response to and proper management of incidents involving the intentional or unintentional release of hazardous materials are critical to the protection of human health and the environment; and

WHEREAS, the proper management and control of responses to emergency incidents involving hazardous materials requires highly specialized training, equipment, supplies, communications and other resources in order to provide adequate protection for the health and safety of the public and emergency response personnel; and

WHEREAS, METRO has hazardous materials response teams (hereinafter referred to as "HAZ-MAT TEAMS"), with specialized apparatus, equipment, and capabilities; and

WHEREAS, the cost of establishing and maintaining a hazardous materials response team capability is so expensive and occurrence of emergency response incidents requiring the specialized expertise of a hazardous materials response team has increased so significantly that COUNTY has determined that it would be more economical, feasible, and appropriate to utilize the services of HAZ-MAT TEAMS available from METRO rather than to develop and maintain duplicate response teams in various locations in the unincorporated area of Sacramento County; and

WHEREAS, METRO has offered, subject to consideration, to provide the services of its HAZ-MAT TEAMS to Cosumnes CSD Fire Department, City of Folsom Fire Department, River Delta Fire Department.

**DATE:** June 22, 2023  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Special Fire Tax – Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta Area  

**TOPIC**  
Board action is required in order to authorize Sacramento County to collect the District's Special Fire Tax in the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta area for fiscal year 2023/24.  

**BACKGROUND**  
Under provisions of the California Constitution, the residents of the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta area approved in November 2000, by more than a two-to-one margin, a special tax to help pay for the fire protection, prevention and training services in their community. The Special Fire Tax, initiated to replace the Fire Suppression Assessment Fee in place in the area since 1986, was capped at a maximum of $100 per parcel.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The County Assessor cannot levy nor collect the District's Special Fire Tax in the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta area without formal annual authorization from the District. To have the Special Fire Tax placed on the tax rolls, the Board must adopt a resolution authorizing the County Assessor to make the levy.  

The District has contracted with local agency financial consulting company NBS to assist with the administration of the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta Special Fire Tax, and they have estimated that the tax will generate $344,600 in revenues for fiscal year 2023/24.

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Absent formal authorization from the District's Board, the County Assessor cannot levy the Special Fire Tax in the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta area. Failure to assess the fee will result in a loss of revenues of approximately $344,600 to fund fire protection services in that area.

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends adoption of the resolution authorizing the County Assessor to incorporate the $100 per parcel Special Fire Tax for the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta area with the 2023/24 Sacramento County property tax levy.

**DATE:** June 22, 2023  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** FY2022/23 Grant Fund Budget Reallocation for Mobile Integrated Health (MIH)  

**SUMMARY**  
The FY2022/23 Midyear Budget for the Grant Fund included an operating budget for the Mobile Integrated Health (MIH) program, which split up the operating budget between labor and services/supplies. Actual expenditures incurred through May 2023 requires reallocation between these two categories to allow payment of the remaining bills for that period.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Through the end of May, more MIH program expenditures were incurred in the services and supplies line item than anticipated. Specifically, a portion of the contracted services for the medical director were not anticipated and not included in the Midyear Budget for the Grant Fund. An additional $15,000 will be needed in the services and supplies line to fund that expense. There are savings in labor budget that may be used to pay for these additional expenses. Board approval is needed to reallocate the budget from labor expense to services and supplies.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
There is no net fiscal impact. This will be a reallocation of funds budgeted at Midyear between labor and services and supplies within the Grant Fund.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends adoption of the resolution implementing changes to the Midyear Budget to reallocate funds within the Grant Fund.

**DATE:** June 23, 2023  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Station 50 Dormitory Remodel - RFB 23-05 Award Notification & Project Update  

**BACKGROUND**  
Due to the changing culture of Metro Fire and in an effort to achieve the District's goal of providing adequate privacy to all firefighters, there is an urgent need for added privacy in the dormitory area at Metro Fire Station 50. Currently Station 50 has an open dormitory area with lockers and 21 fold-down Murphy beds. The dormitory remodel project (Project) will provide much needed privacy for the firefighters who work at this station, as the current dormitory room arrangement provides minimal privacy. The Project will provide each firefighter with their own "dorm room," providing them with privacy and personal space for changing and sleeping. 12 individual "dorm rooms" will be created to accommodate every firefighter on shift.

**DISCUSSION**  
Request for Bid (RFB) 23-03 Station 50 Dormitory Remodel was issued on April 21, 2023. A mandatory pre-bid conference and job walk was conducted on May 2, 2023 and was attended by representatives from 17 different companies. A public bid opening was conducted on May 17, 2023, and seven bids were received. All About Building, Inc. was identified as the lowest responsible and responsive bidder. References for All About Building, Inc. were provided to and followed up on by the Facilities Division. All references for All About Building Inc. came back positively. As a result, RFB 23-05 was awarded to All About Building, Inc.

The scope of the work that will be performed by All About Building Inc. includes, but is not limited to, the removal and disposal of existing lockers and murphy beds, framing of new walls, hanging drywall, and painting. Due to the installation of new walls, modifications to the existing automatic fire sprinkler system will need to be performed to ensure adequate fire sprinkler coverage. Fire sprinkler system modifications will be performed by Mr. Sprinkler Fire Protection, as they currently provide regular maintenance services to all District locations equipped with sprinkler fire-suppression systems, including Station 50. Additionally, the existing carpet will be removed and luxury vinyl tile (LVT) will be installed. Three Rivers Flooring, subcontractor of DFS Flooring, will be handling the removal of existing flooring and the installation of LVT and rubber base.

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The costs associated with the Project include the following:

| Description                             | Amount       |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------|
| Scope covered under RFB 23-05          | $78,000.00   |
| Fire Suppression System Modifications   | $4,915.00    |
| Flooring Removal and Installation       | $37,200.00   |
| Lockers                                 | $38,132.73   |
| Bed Frames                              | $687.24      |
| **Total**                               | **$168,934.97** |

These costs have already been included in the FY2022-2023 Final Budget.

**DATE:** June 22, 2023  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**FROM:** Barbie Law, Assistant Chief-Fire Marshal  
**SUBJECT:** Receive a Presentation on Fee Schedule for Operational Permits, Plan Review, New Construction Inspections, General Fire and Life Safety Inspections, and Other Miscellaneous Services  

**TOPIC**  
Consider increasing the fees associated with operational permits, plan review, new construction inspections, general fire and life safety inspections, and other miscellaneous services as outlined in Ordinance No. 2016-061 which was adopted by the Board of Directors effective July 01, 2016. The purpose of the increase is to reduce the current subsidy of general District revenues required to provide these services. The effective date of the increase would be September 01, 2023.

**BACKGROUND**  
California cities, counties, and special districts may impose user and regulatory fees for services and activities they provide through provisions set forth in the State Constitution, Article XIII C § 1. Under this legal framework, a fee may not exceed the reasonable cost of providing the service or performing the activity. For a fee to qualify as such, it must relate to a service or activity performed at the request of an individual or entity upon which the fee is imposed, or their actions specifically cause the local government agency to perform the additional activities. In this instance, the service or underlying action causing the local agency to perform the service is either discretionary and/or is subject to regulation.

Pursuant to Health & Safety Code Sections 13146.2(b), 13217(b), 13862, 13869, 13871, 13874, 17951 and California Government Code Section 6103.7, the District is authorized to adopt user and regulatory fees to defray and/or recover the cost of providing specified services directly to an individual or business. As such, these fees are intended to reflect the internal costs incurred by the District to perform the service or regulatory action. Collection of user fees reduces the burden on general District revenues (primarily property taxes) to fund such regulatory services, thus providing the ability to stretch other resources further for the benefit of the public at-large.

California Health & Safety Code Section 13145 specifies that the State Fire Marshal, the chief of any city, county, or city and county fire department or district providing fire protection services shall enforce in their respective areas building standards relating to fire and panic safety adopted by the State Fire Marshal and published in

**Notes:**
1. Fee applies for additional or incomplete submittals beyond first submittal and one re-check included in initial plan review fee.
2. A minor plan is deemed appropriate on a case by case basis, for minor scopes of work as determined by the Fire Marshal.
3. Fee structure is set so that "scaled per sq. ft." project fees should be implemented as follows: per project fee from previous threshold + (remaining sq. ft. x per sq. ft. cost multiplier).

# 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

NBS performed a User Fee Study Update (Study) for the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District Community Risk Reduction Division (District and/or CRRD). The purpose of this report is to present the findings and recommendations of the various fee analyses performed as part of the Study and provide the District with the information needed to update and establish user and regulatory fees for service. Throughout the process, the Study afforded much effort to ensure that not only are the fees and charges reasonable and equitable, but that they also meet industry standards and uphold the statutory requirements of the State of California.

California cities, counties, and special districts may impose user and regulatory fees for services and activities they provide through provisions set forth in the State Constitution, Article XIII C § 1. Under this legal framework, a fee may not exceed the reasonable cost of providing the service or performing the activity. For a fee to qualify as such, it must relate to a service or activity performed at the request of an individual or entity upon which the fee is imposed, or their actions specifically cause the local government agency to perform additional activities. In this instance, the service or underlying action causing the local agency to perform the service is either discretionary and/or is subject to regulation. As a discretionary service or regulatory activity, the user fees and regulatory fees considered in this Study fall outside of the definition and statutory requirement to impose general taxes, special taxes, and fees as a result of property ownership.

The District’s main reason for conducting this Study was twofold: (1) first, to ensure that existing fees do not exceed the costs of service, and (2) second, to provide an opportunity for the Board of Directors to realign fee amounts with localized cost recovery policies.

## 1.1 Findings

This Study examined user and regulatory fees managed by the District’s Community Risk Reduction Division. The Study identified an estimated $5.7 million in eligible costs for recovery from fees for service compared to approximately $2.6 million the District is currently collecting each year from fees. The following table provides a summary of the Study’s results:

### Table 1. Report Summary

| Fee Category                          | Annual Estimated Revenues at Current Fee | Annual Estimated Revenues at Full Cost Recovery | Annual Cost Recovery Surplus / Deficit | Existing Cost Recovery Percentage |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Permits to Operate and Occupancy Inspections | $ 809,217                                 | $ 1,863,637                                    | $ (1,054,420)                          | 43%                               |
| Development Plan Review and Inspection | $ 1,743,621                               | $ 3,849,292                                    | $ (2,105,672)                          | 45%                               |
| Miscellaneous                          | $ 12,433                                  | $ 15,109                                       | $ (2,776)                              | 82%                               |
| **Total**                              | **$ 2,565,271**                           | **$ 5,728,139**                                | **$ (3,162,868)**                      | **45%**                           |

As shown in Table 1 above, the District is recovering approximately 45% of the costs associated with providing fee-related services. Should the Board adopt fees at 100% of the full cost recovery amounts determined by this Study, an additional $3.2 million in costs could be recovered.

<!-- Page 85 -->
However, Section 2.2.3 later explains, there may be other local policy considerations that support adopting fees at less than the calculated full cost recovery amount. Since this element of the Study is subjective, NBS provided the maximum potential of fee amounts at 100% full cost recovery for the District to consider. Once the Board of Directors has reviewed and evaluated the results of the Study, the District can set fees at appropriate cost recovery levels according to local policy goals and considerations.

### 1.2 Report Format
This report documents the analytical methods and data sources used in the Study, presents findings regarding current levels of cost recovery achieved from user and regulatory fees, discusses recommended fee amounts, and provides a comparative survey of fees to neighboring agencies for similar services. The report is organized into the following sections:

- **Section 2** - Outlines the general framework, approach, and methodology of the Fee Study.
- **Section 3** - Discusses the results of the cost of service analysis performed for CRRD. The analysis includes: (1) fully burdened hourly rate(s); (2) calculation of the costs of providing service; and, (3) the cost recovery performance of each fee category.
- **Section 4** - Presents the conclusions of the analysis provided in the preceding sections.
- **Appendices to this report** - Include additional details of the analysis performed and a comparison of the fees imposed by neighboring agencies for similar services.

![2. INTRODUCTION AND FUNDAMENTALS](https://via.placeholder.com/982x768.png?text=2.+INTRODUCTION+AND+FUNDAMENTALS)

**2.1 Scope of Study**  
The following is a summary of the fees evaluated during the Study:  
- Permits to Operate / Occupancy Inspections  
- Development Plan Review and Inspection  
- Miscellaneous  

The fees examined in this report specifically exclude development impact fees, utility rates, and any special tax assessments which fall under a different set of statutory and procedural requirements from the body of user and regulatory fees analyzed in this Study. The Study also excludes facility and equipment rental rates, as well as most fines and penalties imposed by the District for violations of its requirements or codes.¹  

**2.2 Methods of Analysis**  
Three phases of analysis were completed for the District:  

**Cost of Service Analysis**  
**Fee Establishment**  
**Cost Recovery Evaluation**  

**2.2.1 COST OF SERVICE ANALYSIS**  
This cost of service analysis is a quantitative effort that compiles the full cost of providing governmental services and activities. There are two primary types of costs considered: direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are those that specifically relate to an activity or service, including the real-time provision of the service. Indirect costs are those that support the provision of services in general but cannot be directly or easily assigned to a singular activity or service.  

Components of the full cost of service include direct labor costs, indirect labor costs, specific direct non-labor costs where applicable, allocated non-labor costs, and allocated organization-wide overhead. Definitions of these cost components are as follows:  

- **Direct Labor costs** = Salary, wages and benefits expenses for District personnel specifically involved in the provision of services and activities to the public.  

- **Indirect labor costs** = Personnel expenses supporting the provision of services and activities. This can include line supervision and division management, administrative support within a division, and staff involved in technical activities related to the direct services provided to the public.  

¹ According to the California Constitution Article XIII C § 1 (e) (4) and (5), the District is not limited to the costs of service when charging for entrance to or use of government property, or when imposing fines and penalties.

![Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District User Fee Study Update](https://www.sacmetrofire.ca.gov)  

- Specific direct non-labor costs – When applicable, discrete expenses incurred by the District due to a specific service or activity performed, such as contractor costs, third-party charges, and very specific materials used in the service or activity.

- Allocated non-labor costs – Expenses other than labor involved in the provision of services. In most cases, these costs are allocated across all services provided by the Division, rather than directly assigned to fee categories.

- Allocated indirect organization-wide overhead – These are expenses, both labor and non-labor, related to agency-wide support services. Support services include general administrative services such as Director’s Chief’s, Finance, Human Resources, etc. The amount of costs attributable to CRRD were sourced from a separate overhead Cost Allocation Plan, created by NBS.

All cost components in this Study use annual (or annualized) figures, representing a twelve-month cycle of expenses incurred by the Division in the provision of all services and activities District-wide.

Nearly all the fees reviewed in this Study require specific actions on the part of District staff to provide the service or conduct the activity. Since labor is the primary underlying factor in these activities, the Study expresses the full cost of service as a fully burdened cost per labor hour. NBS calculated a composite, fully burdened, hourly rate for CRRD. This rate serves as the basis for further quantifying the average full cost of providing individual services and activities. Determining the fully burdened labor rate requires two data sets: (1) the full costs of service, and (2) the number of staff hours available to perform those services. NBS derived the hours available based on the complete list of all CRRD employees and/or available service hours of its contracted professionals (where applicable).

The District supplied NBS with the total number of paid labor hours for each employee involved in the delivery of services included in this Study. These available hours represent the amount of productive time available to provide both fee-recoverable and non-fee recoverable services and activities. Available labor hours divided into the annual full costs of service equal the composite, fully burdened, labor rate. Some agencies may also use the resulting rates for purposes other than setting fees, such as calculating the full cost of general services or structuring a cost recovery agreement with another agency or third party.

NBS also assisted the District in estimating the staff time for the services and activities listed in the District’s fee schedule. Time tracking records can prove useful in identifying time spent providing general categories of service, however, the District does not systematically track the service time of activities for all individual fee-level services provided. Therefore, NBS also relied on interviews and questionnaires to develop the necessary data sets of estimated labor time. In many cases, the District provided estimates of the average amount of time (in minutes and hours) it took to complete a typical service or activity considered on a per-occurrence basis.

## 2.2.2 FEE ESTABLISHMENT

The fee establishment process includes a range of considerations, including the following:

- **Addition to and deletion of fees** – The Study provided the District with the opportunity to propose additions and deletions to their current fee schedules, as well as re-name, reorganize, and clarify which fees were to be imposed. Many of these fee revisions allowed for better adherence to current practices, as well as the improvement in the calculation, application, and collection of the fees owed by an individual. Some additions to the fee schedule were simply the identification of existing services or activities performed by District staff for which no fee is currently charged.

- **Revision to the structure of fees** – In most cases, the focus was to re-align the fee amount to match the costs of service and leave the current structure of fees unchanged. However, in several cases, fee categories and fee names had to be simplified or re-structured to increase the likelihood of full cost recovery or to enhance the fairness of how the fee is applied to the various types of fee payers.

- **Documentation of the tools used to calculate special cost recovery** – The District’s fee schedule should include the list of fully burdened rates developed by the Study. Documenting these rates in the fee schedule provides an opportunity for the Board of Directors to approve rates for cost recovery under a “time and materials” approach. It also provides clear publication of those rates so that fee payers can readily reference the basis of any fee amounts. The fee schedule should provide language that supports special forms of cost recovery for activities and services not included in the adopted master fee schedule. In these rare instances, published rates are used to estimate a flat fee or bill on an hourly basis.

## 2.2.3 COST RECOVERY EVALUATION

The NBS fee model compares the existing fee for each service or activity to the average total cost of service quantified through this analysis. Here are the possible outcomes of the fee analysis:

- **Cost recovery rate of 0%** – This signifies that there is currently no current recovery of costs from fee revenues (or insufficient information available for evaluation).
- **Cost recovery rate of 100%** – This means that the fee currently recovers the full cost of service.
- **Cost recovery rate between 0% and 100%** – This indicates partial recovery of the full cost of service through fees.
- **Cost recovery rate greater than 100%** – This means that the fee exceeds the full cost of service. User fees and regulatory fees should not exceed the full cost of service.

In all cases, the cost recovery rate achieved by a fee should not be greater than 100%. In most cases, imposing a fee above this threshold could change the definition of the charge from a cost of service-based fee to a tax which has other procedural requirements, such as ballot protest or voter approval.

The next step in the process is for the Board to adopt a “target” level of cost recovery for each fee, established at either 100% or any amount less than the calculated full cost of service. Targets and recommendations reflect discretion on the part of the agency based on a variety of factors, such as

- Comparative surveys do not provide information about cost recovery policies or procedures inherent in each comparison agency.
- A "market-based" decision to price services below the full cost of service calculation is the same as deciding to subsidize that service.
- Comparative agencies may or may not base their fee amounts on the estimated and reasonable cost of providing services. NBS did not perform the same level of analysis of the comparative agencies' fees.
- The results of comparative fee surveys are often non-conclusive for many fee categories. Comparison agencies typically use varied terminology for the provision of similar services.

NBS made every reasonable attempt to source each comparison agency's fee schedule from their respective websites and compile a comparison of fee categories and amounts for the most readily comparable fee items that match the District's existing fee structure.

## 2.2.5 DATA SOURCES

The following data sources were used to support the cost of service analysis and fee establishment phases of this Study:
- The District’s Adopted mid-year Budget for Fiscal Year 2022-23
- A complete list of all District personnel, salary/wage rates, regular hours, paid benefits, and paid leave amounts provided by the Finance Department
- Prevailing fee schedules
- Annual workload data provided by CRRD

The District's adopted budget serves as an important source of information that affects the cost of service results. NBS did not audit or validate the District’s financial documents and budget practices, nor was the cost information adjusted to reflect different levels of service or any specific, targeted performance benchmarks. This Study accepts the District’s budget as a legislatively adopted directive describing the most appropriate and reasonable level of District spending. NBS consultants accept the Board of Directors’ deliberative process and the District’s budget plan and further assert that through this legislative process, the District has yielded a reasonable and valid expenditure plan to use in setting cost-based fees.

# 3. COMMUNITY RISK REDUCTION DIVISION

The Community Risk Reduction Division (formerly Fire Prevention Bureau) is responsible for protecting the public through coordinated efforts in fire prevention, code enforcement, fire protection engineering, and fire and life safety education and fire investigation. Fire Inspectors responsible for code enforcement inspect existing buildings and properties for fire code violations, assist fire suppression personnel, respond to complaints, and review and approve licensed care facilities. Fire Inspectors are responsible for fire protection engineering review plans for all construction projects and fire protection systems and conduct the testing and inspections for those projects. CRRD also manages the weed abatement program, and reviews, approves and inspects special events, carnivals, fairs and fireworks displays.

## 3.1 Cost of Service Analysis

NBS developed a composite, fully burdened, hourly rate for each major functional activity of CRRD as shown in Table 2 below:

### Table 2. Fully Burdened Hourly Rate

| Cost Element                | Fire Investigation | Weed Abatement | Code Complaint Response/Enf | Inspections & Permit Services | Total      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| Labor                       | $783,889           | $54,338        | $322,152                    | $2,058,496                    | $3,218,875 |
| Recurring Non-Labor        | 22,403             | 1,916          | 32,359                      | 152,718                       | 209,396    |

| **Division Total**          | **$1,688,981**     | **$132,959**   | **$828,265**                | **$5,189,470**                | **$7,839,663** |

**Fully Burdened Hourly Rate**  
Reference: Direct Hours Only  
$ 833  $ 226  $ 327  $ 304  

**Overtime Rate**  
$ 333  

Section 2.2, Methods of Analysis, further describes the types of expenditures and allocated costs considered in the development of the rate. All subsequent cost of service calculations at the individual fee level assume a fully burdened hourly rate of $233 for Fire Investigation activities, $226 for Weed Abatement, $327 for Code Complaint Response/Enforcement, $304 for Inspection & Permit service activities during regular business hours, and $333 for Inspection & Permit services after business hours.

It should be noted that this Study also recognizes costs associated with services that are not generally recoverable in user or regulatory fees for service. As shown in Table 2, the total cost of CRRD is $7.8 million for all activities and services provided. However, only approximately $5.2 million of costs are eligible for recovery in the user and regulatory fees studied. The Division provides some services which are, for the most part, supported by general funds of the District such as Arson Investigation, and Weed Abatement. Similar to routine emergency response and suppression activities, these services should not be expected to achieve 100% cost recovery through user or regulatory fees for service.

# 3.2 Fee Establishment

The following broadly describes the services provided by the Division under each section of the proposed fee structure.

- **Sections A. Permits to Operate, B. Occupancy Inspections** – CRRD issues one-time operational permits and inspects commercial and multifamily occupancies on a periodic basis, as required by local and/or State laws. Fees are structured by type of permit or service required, as well as occupancy or project type and size.
  
- **Section C. Development Plan Review and Inspection** – The scope of this study determined the full cost of providing plan review and field inspection services related to construction of new buildings/structures, as well as improvements to existing buildings/structures. Additionally, CRRD also regulates installation and improvement to fire sprinkler and fire alarm systems, underground fire service, fire pump testing and water tank installation.

- **Section D. Miscellaneous** – Includes the production of incident and investigation reports, copies, hourly rates for services required in excess of standard or performance of duties after hours, and other fee items not covered under previous categories listed.

### 3.3 Cost Recovery Evaluation

Appendix A presents the results of the detailed cost recovery analysis of fees for the District’s Community Risk Reduction Division. In the Appendix, the “Cost of Service per Activity” column establishes the maximum adoptable fee amount for the corresponding service identified in the “Fee Description” list.

Currently, CRRD is recovering approximately 45% of the total cost of providing services from fees. As Table 3 shows, the District collects approximately $2.6 million per year in revenue at the current fee amounts. At full cost recovery and the same demand level for these services, the District would recover approximately $5.7 million.

| Fee Category                             | Annual Estimated Revenues at Current Fee | Annual Estimated Revenues at Full Recovery | Annual Cost Recovery Surplus / Deficit | Existing Cost Recovery Percentage |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Permits to Operate and Occupancy Inspections | $809,217                                 | $1,863,637                                | $(1,054,420)                          | 43%                               |

NBS provided a full cost of service evaluation and the framework for considering fees, while the Board will adopt the appropriate cost recovery levels at or below full cost amounts.

### 3.4 Comparison Survey
As discussed in Section 2.2.4, Comparative Fee Survey, NBS compared the Division’s current list of fees to those of 5 comparative agencies. While the results of comparative fee surveys are often non-conclusive for many categories, NBS made every reasonable attempt to source each comparison agency’s fee schedule.

![4. CONCLUSION](https://via.placeholder.com/768x981.png?text=4.+CONCLUSION)

Based on the outcomes of the Cost of Service Analysis, Fee Establishment, and Cost Recovery Evaluation presented in this Study, the proposed Master Fee Schedule has been prepared by the District for implementation and included in the District’s Staff Report.

As discussed throughout this report, the intent of the proposed fee schedule is to improve the District’s recovery of costs incurred to provide individual services, as well as adjust fees where the fees charged exceed the average costs incurred. Predicting the amount to which any adopted fee increases will affect District revenues is difficult to quantify. For the near-term, the District should not count on increased revenues to meet any specific expenditure plan. Experience with the revised fee amounts should be gained first before revenue projections are revised. However, unless there is some significant, long-term change in activity levels at the District, proposed fee amendments should enhance the District’s cost recovery performance over time, providing it the ability to stretch other resources further for the benefit of the public at-large.

The District’s Master Fee Schedule should become a living document, but handled with care:
- A fundamental purpose of the fee schedule is to provide clarity and transparency to the public and to staff regarding fees imposed by the District. Once adopted by the Board of Directors, the fee schedule is the final word on the amount and method in which fees should be charged and supersedes all previous fee schedules. If it is discovered that the master document is missing certain fees, those fees will eventually need to be added to the master fee schedule and should not exist outside the consolidated, master framework.
- The District should consider adjusting these user fees and regulatory fees on an annual basis to keep pace with cost inflation. For all fees and charges, for example, the District could use a Consumer Price Index adjustment that is applied to the new fee schedule. Conducting a comprehensive user fee Study is not an annual requirement, and only becomes worthwhile over time as shifts in organization, local practices, legislative values, or legal requirements result in significant change.

As a final note, it is worth mentioning the path that fees, in general, have taken in the State of California. In recent years, there is more public demand for the precise and equitable accounting of the basis for governmental fees and a greater say in when and how they are charged. It is likely that into the future, user and regulatory fees will require an even greater level of analysis and supporting data to meet the public’s growing expectations. An agency’s ability to meet these new pressures will depend on the level of technology they invest in their current systems. Continuous improvement and refinement of time tracking abilities will greatly enhance the District’s ability to set fees for service and identify unfunded activities in years to come.

**Notes:**
1. Permits include an initial inspection and an average fee. Failure to comply with the inspection requirements may result in additional inspection fees per section 8, item 2 and 3 of the fee schedule.
2. Cost recovery includes those fees for permits that are not assessed based on the actual cost of the service, thus resulting in the highest amount charged, ultimately resulting in additional permits in a fiscal year.
3. Fees are assessed based on the current system. Receipt of a full budget for a single event.

**DAN HAVERTY**  
Interim Fire Chief  

**DATE:** June 22, 2023  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Resolution and MIH Contract with Sacramento County  

**TOPIC**  
The Sacramento County Department of Public Health (SCPDH) was awarded grant funding by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for the strengthening of the public health workforce and infrastructure. In March 2023, the SCPDH solicited letters of interest from local organizations to provide the assistance needed to meet that goal. Being in a prime position to deliver the necessary services via the Mobile Integrated Health (MIH) program, Metro Fire applied and was successfully selected to execute a contract with Sacramento County.

**DISCUSSION**  
On May 23, 2023, the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved moving forward with a contract for services. The contract outlines an available budget of $535,031 to accomplish the required tasks within the timeframe of June 1, 2023 through November 30, 2023. This contract will allow Metro Fire’s MIH program to continue its mission and expand operationally, providing better care to the District's community members. In addition to expanded services, it will also allow more time for continuous funding contracts to be established.

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
All expenditures under this contract will be accounted for in the General Fund and will be billed to and reimbursed by the County of Sacramento for a total of $535,031. The contract will span two (2) fiscal years. Approximately $89,197 will be incurred in June 2023, which will be covered by an amendment to the FY2022/23 Midyear Budget. The remaining $445,834 will be incurred from July through November 2023, and included in the FY2023/24 Final Budget.

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board of Directors adopt the Resolution and authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to enter into a contract for the services requested by Sacramento County.

XXIX. TERMINATION  
A. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the other party. Notice shall be deemed served on the date of mailing.

In no event, however, shall COUNTY pay CONTRACTOR an amount which exceeds a pro rata portion of the Agreement total based on the portion of the Agreement item that has elapsed on the effective date of the termination.

E. CONTRACTOR shall not incur any expenses under this Agreement after notice of termination and shall cancel any outstanding expense obligations to a third party that CONTRACTOR can legally cancel.

However, if the presiding officer of an independent special district is unable to participate in a meeting or election of the independent special district selection committee, the legislative body of the district may appoint one of its members as an alternate to participate in the selection committee in the presiding officer's place. Those districts shall include districts located wholly within the county and those containing territory within the county representing 50 percent or more of the assessed value of taxable property of the district, as shown on the last equalized county assessment roll. Each member of the committee shall be entitled to one vote for each independent special district of which he or she is the presiding officer or his or her alternate as designated by the governing body. Members representing a majority of the eligible districts shall constitute a quorum.  
(b) The executive officer shall call and give written notice of all meetings of the members of the selection committee. A meeting shall be called and held under one of the following circumstances:

(c) The selection committee shall appoint two regular members and one alternate member to the commission. The members so appointed shall be elected or appointed members of the legislative body of an independent special district residing within the county but shall not be members of the legislative body of a city or county. If one of the regular district members is absent from a commission meeting or disqualifies himself or herself from participating in a meeting, the alternate district member may serve and vote in place of the regular district member for that meeting. Service on the commission by a regular district member shall not disqualify, or be cause for disqualification of, the member from acting on proposals affecting the special district on whose legislative body the member serves. The special district selection committee may, at the time it appoints a member or alternate, provide that the member or alternate is disqualified from voting on proposals affecting the district on whose legislative body the member serves.

(2) At the end of the nominating period, if only one candidate is nominated for a vacant seat, that candidate shall be deemed appointed. This paragraph shall be operative only if the written notice of the meeting provided pursuant to subdivision (b) discloses that, if nominations are received for only one candidate by the end of the nominating period, the candidate shall be deemed appointed and the meeting may be cancelled.  
(d) If the office of a regular district member becomes vacant, the alternate member may serve and vote in place of the former regular district member until the appointment and qualification of a regular district member to fill the vacancy.  
(e) A majority of the independent special district selection committee may determine to conduct the committee's business by mail, including holding all elections by mailed ballot, pursuant to subdivision (f).  
(f) If the independent special district selection committee has determined to conduct the committee's business by mail or if the executive officer determines that a meeting of the special district selection committee is not feasible, the executive officer shall conduct the business of the committee by mail.
