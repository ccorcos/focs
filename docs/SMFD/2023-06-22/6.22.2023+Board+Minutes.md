4. Miscellaneous  
   a. Reframing Organizations: Three sessions are being held in June covering the Symbolic Frame. Thank you to CFO O'Toole for co-presenting this section.  
   b. June 9 the following two events took place:  
      i. The Congressional Briefing and Tour of the Zinfandel Training with Congressman Ami Bera. Thank you President Clark, and Directors Jones and Webber for your presence. We also were happy to include Sheriff Jim Cooper and his staff and Pat Ellis representing PG&E.

**OPERATIONS REPORT (Deputy Chief Adam Mitchell)**  
1. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT BURNS

acres were treated in collaboration with Sacramento County Parks, Center for Natural Lands Management and the Metro Fire Community Wildfire Preparedness Plan. The burns were intended to restore the role of fire into the land scape, treat for noxious and invasive plants while reducing the threat of wildfire to the community of Mather, and resulted in great a great training experience for our members. Thanks to all involved!

2. CONGRESSMAN BERA VISIT  
A. On Friday, June 9th numerous staff facilitated a visit from Congressman Bera and his staff at the Zinfandel Training Center to discuss the history, current use, and future plans. Thanks to the Directors that attended the event. Specifically, The Congressman is moving forward with supporting a federal ask to develop the EVOC portion of the Training Center project. Special thanks to Kyle MacDonald, Erin Castleberry, AC Mike Lozano, and BC Brian Gonsalves for their portions of the presentation and coordination of the visit. We also welcomed Sheriff Jim Cooper, SSD Captain of training Matt Tamayo, and Pat Ellis from PG&E to show the support of our regional partners in the project. Although not able to make it that day, I appreciate the support from Citrus Heights Police Chief Alex Turcotte for the project as well. The presentation was well received, and we will continue to work with the Congressman and his staff moving forward.

3. CAPITAL ASSET INVENTORY PROCESS  
A. Recently, the District Finance Staff completed the capital asset inventory, and Operations received an email titled "Capital Asset Inventory, a big thank you!" from Marie Jones: "With the addition of another finance team (3 teams instead of 2), meeting with the Ops team, and getting the word out prior to us coming, this was by far the smoothest and quickest inventory we had, and I can say that as I've led every capital asset inventory the District has ever done. Normally we use about two weeks to complete all counts, and this year we completed it in just 3½ days!" This efficiency would not have been possible without the coordination, and I wanted to thank Marie, Dave and the whole Finance Team for their work and early communication that allowed us to set a new record in getting this complete! Great example of teamwork!

4. SERVICE DELIVERY UPDATE  
A. Happy to report that we held a joint planning meeting this week on Tuesday, June 20th and continue to make progress towards implementation of the FDM to MMP incremental transition plan. Currently, the target date for deployment of phase 1, four FDMs to MMPs is Sunday, September 3rd. Thanks to all involved in keeping this project moving forward to support service delivery to the community and our members.
