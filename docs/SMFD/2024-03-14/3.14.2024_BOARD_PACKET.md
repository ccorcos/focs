**DATE:** March 14, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** FY2023/24 Capital Improvement Plan – Second Amendment  

**TOPIC**  
Request to approve an amendment to the FY2023/24 Capital Improvement Plan.  

**BACKGROUND**  
On September 14, 2023, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District's (District) Board of Directors adopted Resolution 2023-048 to adopt the FY2023/24 Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) which authorized the implementation or continuation of twenty-three (23) capital projects. On October 12, 2023, a first amendment to the FY2023/24 CIP was approved by the Board under Resolution 2023-066.  

**DISCUSSION**  
As part of the District's mid-year budgeting process, six (6) projects approved in the FY2023/24 CIP have been updated to reflect actual costs. Changes include increases in actual costs of Ambulances and Type V Engines; reductions in vehicle communications costs for Ambulances, Type I Engines, and Squad Vehicles; and increases to the Zinfandel Phase 3 Buildout project offset by proceeds from the sale of real property.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The net impact of the changes described above was a reduction of $33,499 in CIP project costs. All applicable changes are reflected in the proposed FY2023/24 Mid-Year Budget.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board adopt the attached resolution to amend the FY2023/24 Capital Improvement Plan.

FY 2023/24 Midyear Budget Adjustments  

---

**OVERVIEW**  

The Midyear Budget is part of the District’s recurring financial review process to update spending plans with actual expenditures and revenues, evaluate program commitments, and implement budget adjustments. The recommended Fiscal Year (FY) 2023/24 Midyear Budget adjustments are based on actual spending and revenues through December 31, 2023, with projections for the remainder of the fiscal year.

At the midpoint of the District’s fiscal year, District revenues and expenditures have closely followed the annual budget approved by the Board of Directors on September 14, 2023. Changes of significance are described in this report and the following budget tables.

The FY 2023/24 Midyear Budget includes total spending of $356.8 million, an increase of $5.4 million, or 1.5 percent over the FY 2023/24 Final Budget expenditures of $351.4 million.

Within the General Fund, revenues of $272.2 million and net transfers of $15.6 million are expected to exceed General Fund expenditures of $287.2 million by $565,000. Services and supplies spending is expected to decline by $1.1 million—the first cost decline in seven years.

In the Labor Budget, workers compensation costs and constant staffing callbacks (when suppression staff are called back to work overtime during unanticipated absences) have again increased above the Final Budget figure, by $2.7 million and $5.8 million, respectively. Expenses associated with wages, and medical costs are expected to fall below Final Budget estimates. Coupled with a new $1 million set-aside for a pension trust, the entire Labor Budget will grow by $2.0 million General Fund.

The FY 2023/24 Midyear Budget reflects modest change in General Fund revenue relative to the Final Budget, with property taxes increasing by $490,000 and EMS revenues by $500,000.

Proposed midyear adjustments to District’s budget are described in the next section.

# DISCUSSION

## General Fund Expenditures

Midyear Budget adjustments to General Fund expenditures result in a $1.8 million cost increase over the Final Budget figure (0.6 percent), for a total expenditure budget of $287.2 million.

### Labor

Adjustments to the labor expense budget result in an increase of $2.0 million (0.8 percent above the Final Budget), for a total labor budget of $242.2 million, and include the following:

- Increased callback overtime costs (“constant staffing”) of $5.8 million. The excess reflects the continuing trend of unplanned absences, and slower-than-anticipated expansion of the firefighter staffing pool.
- Workers’ compensation cost increases of $2.7 million relative to the Final Budget, reflecting continued higher-than-budgeted expense.
- A set-aside of $1 million to establish a pension cost trust fund, similar to the California Employers’ Retirement Benefit Trust used for Other Post Employment Benefit costs, wherein the District would invest recurring sums in a managed market account, and draw down sums as needed for unanticipated pension costs.
- Wage-related savings of $5.4 million due mainly to unfilled positions.

### Services and Supplies

The Midyear Budget for General Fund services and supplies includes a $1.1 million decline (-2.5 percent) relative to the Final Budget, for a total of $41.4 million. The decline is attributable to spending below anticipated levels and the reclassification of certain software expenses from services and supplies cost to a licensing expense.

## General Fund Revenues and Net Transfers

FY 2023/24 General Fund revenues and net transfers are projected to exceed expenditures in the same fiscal year by $565,000, with total budgeted revenues and net transfers reaching $287.8 million. Significant midyear adjustments to revenues include:

- **Medic Cost Recovery.** The Midyear Budget includes a $500,000 increase in medic revenues based on year-to-date activity, for a revised total of $47.4 million, up from $46.9 million included in the Final Budget.
- **Property Taxes.** Estimates for the District’s largest revenue source, property taxes, were updated and reflect a modest increase of approximately $400,000.

<!-- Page 40 -->
- Net Interfund Transfers. Transfers from and to the General Fund are forecasted to decrease by $4.5 million in the Midyear Budget. This is mainly attributable to lower collections in the Intergovernmental Transfer Fund: the Voluntary Rate Range Program and the Public Provider Ground Emergency Medical Transport (PPGEMT) program.

**General Fund Reserve**

After the proposed Midyear adjustments, the General Fund reserve balance is projected to increase to $39.2 million on June 30, 2024, equivalent to a 13.4 percent General Fund reserve.

**Capital Facilities Fund**

The Midyear Budget includes a $700,000 decrease to a planned transfer from the General Fund to Capital Facilities Fund, reflecting lower-than-anticipated expenditures from that fund. The projected fund balance for the Capital Facilities Fund is $851,000.

**Special Projects Fund**

The Midyear Budget reflects full expenditure of the $13 million appropriated in the State of California Budget Act of 2022/23 for building a new District training facility on Zinfandel Drive in Rancho Cordova. As the Zinfandel Training Facility project develops, it is anticipated that additional sums will be added to the Special Projects Fund to support project completion.

**Other Funds**

Midyear Budget updates for the Leased Properties, Grants, Development Impact Fees, Intergovernmental Transfer, and Special Project Fund descriptions are included in the attachments. All funds reflect a positive balance.
