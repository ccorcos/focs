# REPORTS

1. **PRESIDENT’S REPORT**—(President Saylors) No report

2. **FIRE CHIEF’S REPORT**—(Chief Harms)  
   Chief Harms shared since we last met the SAFER Grant deployments have gone into service, a special thank you to the Service Delivery Team and the three Deputy Chiefs who ensured everything was in place to make this happen.  
   
   **Meetings**  
   8/4, SRP 22-2 graduation was held: 10 recruits with 5 paramedics and 5 EMTs  

   **Event**  
   8/12, Sacramento CEO SOAK Event for ALS – 11:00am at DOCO  
   Our dear friend and former board member was diagnosed with ALS a few years ago. Chief Harms has been looking for ways to get involved and support ALS-focused programs, and was recently asked to participate in an upcoming CEO Soak event hosted by the ALS Association Greater Sacramento Chapter, nationally, this event has raised more than $1,000,000 and has assisted in providing families with ALS-cost services and local and national advocacy and research.  

**OPERATIONS’ REPORT**  
Deputy Chief Mitchell shared statistics since the last Board Meeting with 3,840 total incidents since July 28, 2022; an average of 274 calls per day. Of those 2,472 (64.4%) were EMS related incidents, and 133 were fire incidents.  

On August 16th, Battalion Chief Gonsalves, along with KHS, will present a case review at the SCEMSA Stroke Care Committee meeting. This incident occurred on February 27, 2022 with a 43 year old female patient who was found down in her vehicle. She was driving home and on the phone with her brother, who noticed she was no longer making sense during their conversation. He had her pull over, and used the Find My iPhone feature to figure out her location.  

Continuum of care between Dispatch, EMS, and the hospital will be emphasized. KHS was extremely happy with our care provided and the early stroke alert activation, which is credited to the patient’s positive outcome. It was 32 minutes from time of call at Dispatch to the back door of the hospital, with a 4 minute response, and just a 6 minute scene time. The crew involved in this incident was T50 and M50 B-shift. TR50-Captain Manfredi, Engineer Zumwalt, FF/PM Haas, FF/PM Arso; M50- FF/PM Gallisdorfer and FF/PM Getreu as the Primary Paramedic all did a great job.  

**Next**, on Friday, August 5th an auto wrecking yard fire occurred in Battalion 5 on W. 6th Street. This incident involved a number of companies, Law Enforcement, Sac OES, and SMUD broken up into three divisions to bring it under control. CERT deployed 5 members to the incident to support rehab. Crews stayed on scene overnight to complete mop-up, and the cause is under investigation.

Lastly, there was an apartment fire on Data Drive on Sunday, August 7th in the early morning hours. Eight units of a twenty unit building were impacted by fire, smoke, and water damage. SMUD and PG&E were able to restore utilities to the 12 non-impacted units allowing the residents to remain. We had 1 member that sustained burn injuries and was treated and released.

3. SMFD – FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL 522 REPORT  
Firefighter Mike Gildone, on behalf of Vice President Local 522 Matt Cole, congratulated Engineer Kevin Henson on retiring, and wished him the best.

Local 522 recently met for a staffing/labor management collaboration, it was a productive meeting, and they continue to appreciate the efforts of AC Jenkins who represents management. A union representative participated in the Deputy Fire Marshal interview process earlier this week. Labor is working to put together a promotional review group, recently had a meeting with this group. Lastly, the negotiations group met earlier today, they are prepared for the negotiations meeting with management next week.

FF Gildone also spoke to the success of the Service Delivery Team. Since deployment took place one week ago he has had the opportunity to speak with the new positions and heard very good things and how helpful it has been to the deployment model. For example, Squad has responded to 58 calls in seven days, which is an average of eight calls per day.

**DATE:** August 25, 2022  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Purchase Approval – Six (6) Ambulance Remounts  

**TOPIC**  
Staff seeks Board approval to have six (6) 2016 Sprinter/Leader Ambulances, units 24444, 24457, 24460, 24461 and 24463, remounted onto new 2023 Sprinter chassis by Leader Industries.

**SUMMARY**  
In order to maintain all original functionality and reliability, this purchase will be sole source, performed by the original manufacturer of the ambulance. Additionally, The Purchasing Division has reviewed the Exception to Competitive Bidding documents and determined they are consistent with Metro Fire purchasing policies and procedures.

**DISCUSSION**  
Due to the increased mileage EMS transports are placing on our Ambulance fleet, we are reaching their replacement mileage in three years, rather than the expected six years. In an effort to reduce the cost of maintaining a working Ambulance fleet, Staff recommends replacing the worn out chassis of six existing vehicles and remounting the original box portion onto a new vehicle. This process will result in a vehicle that has been updated and nearly new, with a cost savings of $106,000.00 per unit.

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The total cost for the remounting of the six (6) Ambulances is $1,009,388.76. The funds for this purchase are included in the FY 2022/23 Final Budget.

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff respectfully recommends the Board approve the remounting of these six (6) Ambulances Leader Industries.

**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Hazardous Materials Response Agreement with Amador County  

**TOPIC**  
Hazardous Materials Response Agreement between Metro Fire and Amador County.

**DISCUSSION**  
Under the contract, Metro Fire will continue to provide the services of our HazMat team to hazardous materials incidents on a case-by-case basis. Metro Fire will maintain proficiencies of the HazMat Team.

The term of the agreement was for one year from the date of the full execution with an option for two (2) one-year extensions. There has been a lapse in the contract and Amador County is requesting reinstate the contract and to exercise both years of the extension at this time.

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Metro Fire will provide emergency hazardous materials response with billing based on a time and materials fee system. The fee for service is consistent with applicable local agreements held within Sacramento County for similar services.

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board of Directors approve the reinstatement of the agreement for services with Amador County and authorize the Fire Chief to approve the amendment for two (2) one-year extensions.

BY AND BETWEEN  
AMADOR COUNTY AND

This MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (hereinafter “MOU”), entered into on July 13th, 2021, is made by and between the County of Amador (hereinafter “County”) and the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (hereinafter “Metro Fire”). This MOU establishes the response criteria for the use of the Metro Fire Type 1 Hazardous Materials Response Team (hereinafter “HMRT”).

## RECITALS

1. Metro Fire has assembled a Type 1 Hazardous Materials Response Team (HMRT) which is housed under Metro Fire’s Special Operations.

2.

3. The County and Metro Fire have the opportunity to enter into an MOU for the County’s use of Metro Fire’s HMRT to assist with responding to hazardous materials incidences.

4. The Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) is the recognized system for managing a multi-jurisdictional response for hazardous material incidents. In the field, the Incident Command System (ICS), a component of SEMS, is used for managing a hazardous materials incident involving multiple jurisdictions.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and conditions herein made, it is agreed as follows:

**SCOPE OF SERVICES**

1. The Metro Fire HMRT’s services are limited to hazard categorization, site safety planning, containment, site mitigation, and other on-scene management activities designed to limit the spread and environmental contamination of hazardous substances releases.

2. The HMRT shall respond, when available, to requests for assistance made by the County through the 911 dispatch system, through either the Amador County Sheriff’s Office Dispatch or the Cal Fire Communications Center in El Dorado County. Such requests for assistance shall be authorized by the on-scene incident commander (IC) and shall include the following information:

   - Contact information for the Incident Commander
   - Name of person to whom the team is to report to
   - Nature of the incident

4. The County is responsible for providing to Metro Fire the State Office of Emergency Services (OES) incident control number. The Amador County Sheriff’s Office of Emergency Services, representative of Amador County Environmental Health, the Incident Commander, or facility initiating the incident, depending on the specific case, will make the notification to the State.

**TODD HARMS**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** August 25, 2022  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Adoption of a Reimbursement Resolution – Tax-Exempt Debt  

**TOPIC**  
Staff recommends adoption of the attached reimbursement resolution to reimburse the District for funds that have been or may be expended prior to issuing tax-exempt debt. The recommended action is in anticipation of the District entering into a capital lease transaction to fund the purchase of budgeted capital expenditures.  

**DISCUSSION**  
In order to legally reimburse expenditures made prior to the issuance of tax-exempt debt, a reimbursement resolution must be in place pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.150-2. Adoption of a reimbursement resolution does not bind the District to issuing future debt. Instead, a reimbursement resolution allows the District to use its own funds for capital expenditures and later repay itself from the financing proceeds.  

Purchases made after the reimbursement resolution adoption and those made no more than 60 days prior to adoption are eligible for reimbursement. Staff anticipates the recommendation to finance not more than $6,500,000 of capital purchases in accordance with the Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and the FY2022-23 Final Budget. The capital purchases include medics, engines, copter conversion, and other vehicles and equipment.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Adoption of the resolution will allow reimbursement of qualified District expenditures up to $6,500,000. Purchases that are projected to be delivered in FY 2022-23 have been included in the District’s FY 2022/23 Final Budget.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends adoption of the attached reimbursement resolution.

**RESOLUTION NO. 2022-___**

A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN FIRE DISTRICT DECLARING THE OFFICIAL INTENT OF THE DISTRICT TO REIMBURSE ITSELF FOR CERTAIN CAPITAL AND OTHER EXPENDITURES FROM THE PROCEEDS OF PROPOSED INDEBTEDNESS

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, as follows:
