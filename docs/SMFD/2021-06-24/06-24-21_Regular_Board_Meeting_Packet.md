**DATE:** June 24, 2021  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Special Fire Tax – Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta Area  

**TOPIC**  
Board action is required in order to authorize Sacramento County to collect the District's Special Fire Tax in the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta area for fiscal year 2021/22.  

**BACKGROUND**  
Under the provisions of the California Constitution and by more than a two-to one margin, the residents of the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta area approved in November 2000 a Special Tax to help pay for the fire protection, prevention and training services in their community. The Special Tax, initiated to replace the Fire Suppression Assessment Fee that had been in place in the area since 1986, was capped at a maximum of $100 per parcel.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The County Assessor cannot levy nor collect our Special Fire Tax in the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta area without formal annual authorization from the District. To have our Special Fire Tax placed on the tax rolls, the Board must adopt a resolution authorizing the County Assessor to make the levy.  

The District has contracted with NBS to assist with the administration of the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta Special Tax, and they have estimated that the tax will generate $338,500 in revenues for fiscal year 2021/22.  

P19
<!-- Page 20 -->
![Board of Directors](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Board+of+Directors+June+24%2C+2021+Page+2)

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Absent formal authorization from the District's Board, the County Assessor cannot levy our Special Fire Tax in the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta area. Failure to assess the fee will result to a loss of revenues of approximately $338,500.

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends adoption of the resolution authorizing the County Assessor to incorporate the $100 per parcel Special Fire Tax for the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta area with the 2021/22 Sacramento County property tax levy.

I am writing to express my desire to continue serving you on the California Special Districts Association (CSDA) Board of Directors. I have had the honor of serving on the Board for the past eleven years and have held various leadership positions including President. My passion is advocacy and I am grateful to be able to serve as the Chair of the Legislative committee for the past few years. During my time on the board we have grown in every aspect. We now represent over 2000 special districts of all sizes and types and enjoy a retention rate of over 90%. Our educational opportunities and conferences have more than doubled and our advocacy team has grown from 1 person to a powerhouse team that rivals the League of Cities and the California State Association of Counties. We are now helping to lead a national coalition representing special districts to gain recognition and access to funding at the federal level. We have deployed regional representatives to better connect with you and your district.

For those I have not had the opportunity to meet yet, I am currently in my 4th term serving on the El Dorado Hills Community Services District Board of Directors. I am passionate about local government and advocating for all the great work we do providing the essential services that make the lives of our communities better. I began a carrier in government working for the State in a legislative unit. I was able to take my knowledge and skills to the private sector working for an internal engineering firm while obtaining my Master’s degree in Public Policy and Administration. For the past 6 years I have worked for two cities in the Sacramento area as a Government Relations Representative specializing in water, wastewater, stormwater, contracting, governance and more.

I would be honored to receive your vote to continue the great work CSDA is doing to help all Special Districts.

With over 20 years in Special District leadership, I am proud of my accomplishments & ability to facilitate positive changes, that ensure viability for a long time to come. I have constantly strived to increase my knowledge, especially through CSDA leadership training and programs. I actually took the lead at our Recreation District to accomplish the Distinguished District Award.

As a board member, I commit to keeping an open mind, and working to build consensus, and further doing all I can to promote and ensure implementation of the CSDA goals and direction. I am a strong lobbyist and look forward to working with districts across the state to accomplish our common goals and ability to stay fiscally and otherwise strong. I will always be open and receptive to input, and more than willing to go out of my way to meet and or discuss concerns with any members. I believe in Special Districts and feel they are key to maintaining the concept of local autonomy. I also feel that as a cohesive co-op we can accomplish so much more than a bunch of independent agencies.

Thank you for your support, if you have any questions do not hesitate to reach out!

As always...

**Candidate Statement**

I have been a member of CSDA for 15 years. The assets I would bring to the CSDA Board of Directors if appointed, include having strong interpersonal communication and relationship building skills. I will work well with other Board members to set and achieve realistic goals that benefit the CSDA membership. I am an active listener, in that, I believe you can learn a lot more by listening than by speaking. I have a good sense of humor and enjoy working with high functioning teams. I am also a maximizer. I use this strength to take something good to something superb. I want to hear what the CSDA members want and need and plan to address those wants and needs to best serve as a Board Member representing the Sierra Network.

I enjoy building relationships with others which is the foundation of any successful organization. I am a good coach and mentor and enjoy developing people. I will use my leadership strengths to address any issues of concern to make the CSDA organization and membership stronger.

Thank you for your consideration,

**TODD HARMS**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** June 24, 2021  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**FROM:** Ken Campo, Interim Chief Financial Officer  
**SUBJECT:** Refinancing of 2011 Lease Revenue Bonds  

**TOPIC**  
Board action is required in order to initiate a refinancing of the currently outstanding 2011 Lease Revenue Bonds ("2011 LRB’s").  

**BACKGROUND**  
In December of 2011, the District issued Lease Revenue Bonds in the amount of $12,960,000 ("2011 LRB’s"). The 2011 LRB’s financed various district improvements, including the acquisition of a headquarters building and equipment. The remaining principal balance of the 2011 LRB’s is $8,375,000 with a final maturity of May 15, 2041. The 2011 LRB’s are callable in whole or in part on any date on or after May 15, 2022 at par.  

**DISCUSSION**  

**FINANCING STRUCTURE**  
Though the 2011 LRB’s are not callable until next year, the District does have an opportunity to take advantage of today’s historically low interest rates and refinance the 2011 LRB’s this year. The proposed financing structure would be to obtain a 7-month forward rate lock from an institutional investor (bank/lender). The refinancing would be done as a direct placement and structured as Refunding Certificates of Participation. This allows the District to set the interest rate now and close the transaction in 2022 shortly before the call date. This structure preserves the same tax-exempt status as the 2011 LRB’s and therefore a lower interest rate, and locks in the rate to avoid changes in the market.  

P31
<!-- Page 32 -->
![Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+2)

**TRANSACTION PROCESS**  
A direct placement has a shorter timeline, fewer costs than a publicly offered bond issue and does not have a reserve requirement. To ensure the District is provided with the best rate in the market, Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. ("Placement Agent") will draft a solicitation package or Lender Request for Proposal ("Lender RFP") to distribute to institutional investors. This process creates a competitive bidding environment and yields the most aggressive interest rates and favorable terms in the market. The Placement Agent evaluates all of the proposals received by investors and provides recommendations to the District on the best selection. Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. is a leading global full-service brokerage and investment bank with roots that trace back to 1881.

Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, will serve as bond counsel ("Bond Counsel") to the District. Bond Counsel is responsible for drafting the legal documents and undertaking the necessary tax due diligence in order to provide the required unqualified tax opinion for the financing at closing. Jones Hall is a nationally recognized bond counsel firm.

**PRELIMINARY FINANCING RESULTS**  
Below is a summary of the preliminary financing results per Oppenheimer's initial market outreach. Because the refinancing is expected to free the District's current reserve fund (estimated at $677,400), we would be able to shorten the final maturity of this transaction by one year, to May 15, 2040.

| Term                       | 2022 Refunding Lease |
|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Par Amount                 | $8,029,000           |
| Total Estimated Costs of Issuance | $125,843       |
| Interest Rate              | 2.94%                |
| Current Average FY Debt Service | $674,455         |
| New Average FY Debt Service | $559,492            |
| Annual FY Savings          | $114,963             |
| Current Total Debt Service  | $13,280,416         |
| New Total Service          | $10,421,905         |
| Estimated Total Savings     | $2,181,091          |
| Estimated Net Present Value Savings | $1,702,374 / 21.20% |

Please note that these financing results are estimated and based on an indicative interest rate in the current market; actual results will not be known until completion of the bidding process.

**HIRING THE FINANCING TEAM**  
It is necessary for the District to engage professional services to put the transaction together and execute the refinancing. The following professional firms are needed to initiate the transaction and assemble the remaining participants of the financing team: (a) Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, as Bond Counsel; and (b) Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., as Placement Agent.
<!-- Page 33 -->
![Page 3](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+3)

**NEXT STEPS**  
The next steps should the Board elect to proceed are as follows:

- Tuesday, 6/29: Distribute Lender RFP to lenders  
- Tuesday, 7/13: Lender proposals due  
- Thursday, 7/22: Board Meeting to approve financing documents  
- Tuesday, 8/10: Pre-Close  
- February 2022: Final close and refunding of 2011 LRBs  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
As noted above, final savings from the refinancing of the 2011 LRB’s will not be known until the bid process is complete, but estimated savings are approximately $115,000 per year over the term of the bonds, with estimated total savings of $2.2 million. The net present value savings of $1.7 million equates to a 20% of the current, remaining principal amount of the 2011 LRB’s.

WHEREAS, the 2011 Bonds are subject to redemption, and the lease payment obligations of the District under the 2011 Sublease, are subject to redemption and prepayment commencing May 15, 2022; and  

WHEREAS, in order to provide for the refinancing of the 2011 Bonds and the obligations of the District under the 2011 Sublease for the purpose of realizing debt service savings to the District, the Board of Directors wishes at this time to authorize and direct District staff to initiate proceedings for such refinancing and to engage the necessary professional services therefor;

**Date:** June 24, 2021  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Todd Harms, Fire Chief, and Greg Casentini, Deputy Chief  
**Subject:** Withdrawal by Metro Fire from the California Fire and Rescue Training Authority, JPA (CFRTA)  

**TOPIC**  
Staff proposes that the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) issue a written Notice of Withdrawal from the CFRTA Joint Powers Authority, effective at the end of the 2021-2022 fiscal year.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The CFRTA is a Joint Powers Authority (JPA) created on December 1, 1997 between the American River Fire District, the City of Sacramento, the Sacramento County Fire Protection District, and the California Office of Emergency Services. The purpose of the JPA was to acquire, construct, operate and maintain facilities for the purpose of providing Fire, Rescue, EMS and Haz-Mat training.  

The original JPA agreement was amended on two occasions, the last occurring on January 1, 2001. The latest amendment changed the name of the JPA to its current title and included Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District as a designated member to reflect the merger/succession with the American River Fire Protection District and the Sacramento County Fire Protection District.  

On March 26, 2021, Cal-OES served a written Notice of Withdrawal from the JPA. Under the terms of the JPA agreement, any Notice of Withdrawal must be served in writing with one-year notice at the end of the fiscal year. The end of the fiscal year is June 30, 2021.  

If any other member also issues a Notice of Withdrawal within the same time period, the withdrawal constitutes a dissolution of the authority as of the end of the fiscal year. With the withdrawal of Cal-OES effective June 30, 2022, Metro Fire needs to decide whether to continue to fund and operate the JPA with the City of Sacramento as a two-member organization, or whether to issue a Notice of Withdrawal which will trigger the dissolution of the JPA.  

**Serving Sacramento and Placer Counties**  
P45
<!-- Page 46 -->
![Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+2)

Staff recommends that the Board authorize the Fire Chief to issue a Notice of Withdrawal prior to the end of the current fiscal year, to be effective June 30, 2022. If approved, the JPA agreement provides for a dissolution of the JPA, with the assets and the liabilities returned in proportion to the contribution of each member agency. In the event of withdrawal by only one member, property and assets are returned to the withdrawing agency, subject to limitations for commingled property or contributions which have been used for acquiring property or assets which have been consumed for facility operations. The JPA has currently agreed to retain independent counsel to evaluate the assets to determine distribution. Metro Fire anticipates, upon withdrawal, that the attorney will conduct an audit of the assets and liabilities of the JPA pursuant to the dissolution provisions of the JPA agreement and California law.

Staff recommends that the Board authorize withdrawal, and ultimate dissolution of the JPA. With the withdrawal of Cal-OES, which holds 40% interest in the JPA, along with Metro Fire’s 40% interest and the City of Sacramento’s 20%, there would likely be increased costs and liability to Metro Fire, and the City of Sacramento, to continue to operate the JPA. Moreover, in proceeding with dissolution, the JPA agreement requires that each member receive a return of its proportionate share of assets, and existing and future liabilities.

**RECOMMENDATION**

Staff recommends that the Board authorize the Fire Chief to issue a Notice of Withdrawal of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District from the California Fire and Rescue Training Authority JPA.
