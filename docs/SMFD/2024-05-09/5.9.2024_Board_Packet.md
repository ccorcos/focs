**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** May 9, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Revision to Positions and Authorization Document for Temporary Position  

**TOPIC**  
Board of Directors approval is requested to modify the Positions and Authorization Document (PAD) to permit an overlapping Grants Specialist position assignment for training a new hire before the incumbent retires.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The current incumbent in the Grants Specialist position will retire on July 1, 2024, after which time the successor would assume that role. However, in recognition of the specialized and intensive on-the-job training required of this position, staff requests to employ the successor six weeks prior to the separation of the incumbent. A training plan will be used to facilitate the transfer of essential knowledge and skills from the incumbent to the successor.  

In order to allow for the requested overlap in employment, Board authorization of a PAD revision is required to add the position on a temporary basis.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The fiscal impact of authorizing the temporary position, including salary and benefits, is estimated to not exceed $20,373, for six weeks. This cost will be absorbed by other anticipated savings in payroll expenses in the approved FY 2023/24 Midyear Budget.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends that the Board authorize the temporary change in the PAD as reflected in the attached document for the addition of one Grant Specialist position for the period of six weeks (estimated May 15 to June 30, 2024).

**DATE:** May 9, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** General District Election – November 5, 2024  

**TOPIC**  
Calling for a General District Election for five Board of Directors expired terms and requesting consolidation with the Statewide General Election.  

**DISCUSSION**  
A General District Election must be held on November 5, 2024 for the purpose of electing members to the Board of Directors for four-year terms. District Board Members are elected by division, with the following seats up for election on November 5, 2024:  

- Division 2: Director Grant Goold  
- Division 4: Director Ted Wood  
- Division 5: Director Jennifer Sheetz  
- Division 6: Director D'Elman Clark  
- Division 8: Director Gay Jones  

Pursuant to Elections Code §10403 the Board must adopt a resolution calling for the General District Election and requesting consolidation with Sacramento County. The enclosed resolution establishes the same election process utilized in previous elections:  
1) consolidation of the General District Election with the Statewide General Election in Sacramento County; 2) if a candidate desires to have a Candidate Statement of no more than 200 words included in the Voter Pamphlet, the candidate will pay the cost of publication to the Voter Registration and Elections office at the time the candidate files nomination papers; 3) in the event of a tie vote, the election for that office will be determined by lot by the Governing Board of the District; and 4) the District will reimburse Sacramento County for actual costs incurred for providing election services.  

Candidates are required to obtain candidate papers from the Registrar of Voters in the county they reside in and are registered to vote in during the declaration of candidacy period which starts on Monday, July 15, 2024 and ends on Friday, August 9, 2024 at 5:00 p.m. Candidates will also be required to file campaign statements with the Registrar of Voters once they declare their intent to run for office.

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Consolidating the General District Election with the Statewide General Election on November 5, 2024 will eliminate the need for a special election and significantly reduce the District's election costs.
