# INTERIM EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

## RETIRED ANNUITANT

THIS AGREEMENT is entered into this ___ day of January 2023, by and between the SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN FIRE DISTRICT, a fire protection district authorized and existing under the laws of the State of California (hereinafter "DISTRICT"), and DANIEL HAVERTY, an individual (hereinafter "FIRE CHIEF" or "EMPLOYEE”).

The DISTRICT is seeking to recruit a permanent employee to act as a Fire Chief due to the resignation of the DISTRICT’S Fire Chief, whose resignation is effective December 31, 2022.

The DISTRICT has engaged in a recruitment process to replace the outgoing Fire Chief, which did not result in the selection of a permanent Fire Chief.

While the DISTRICT continues with its recruitment and selection process for a permanent Fire Chief, it desires to select an Interim Fire Chief, and DANIEL HAVERTY, being duly qualified to act as a FIRE CHIEF, has agreed to act in that position on an interim basis.

THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

1. **EMPLOYMENT**

   A. Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, HAVERTY will serve as the FIRE CHIEF of the DISTRICT on an interim basis. HAVERTY is currently retired and receiving retirement benefits as a member of CalPERS. HAVERTY’s employment is “at will” as that term is defined under California law. HAVERTY agrees to supervise the DISTRICT in compliance with Board of Director policies and legislative mandates, and to perform those job duties and responsibilities as more particularly set forth in the DISTRICT’S Job Description for FIRE CHIEF.

   B. This AGREEMENT shall remain in full force until the position is filled or terminated by the DISTRICT. During the term of this AGREEMENT the DISTRICT will continue to engage in the recruitment and selection process for a permanent FIRE CHIEF.

   C. The DISTRICT intends and the parties agree that HAVERTY will be limited to 960 hours for each fiscal year, consistent with California law as set forth in Government Code Section 21221(h).

2. COMPENSATION  
A. The compensation for HAVERTY as INTERIM FIRE CHIEF will be One Hundred and Fifty-Three dollars and ninety-eight cents ($153.98) per hour. This hourly rate is calculated based upon the publicly posted salary rate for the Fire Chief as of January 1, 2023, at $26,684.85, and is consistent with the California Public Retirement Law (CalPERS) legal requirement for compensation for retired annuitants as set forth in Government Code Section 21221(h).  

B. HAVERTY will be limited to 960 hours for each fiscal year. HAVERTY will track and report hours worked for each pay period and report those hours to Human Resources Division of the DISTRICT. The DISTRICT will report to CalPERS all hours worked by HAVERTY for each pay period. In no event will HAVERTY exceed the legal limit for allowable hours.  

C. The DISTRICT acknowledges and the parties agree that the recruitment and selection process for a permanent FIRE CHIEF will be completed within the 2023/2024 fiscal year, and prior to HAVERTY reaching the 960 allowable hours.  

3. BENEFITS  
A. HAVERTY will not receive or be entitled to any benefits or incentives, compensation in lieu of benefits, or any other form of compensation provided to permanent employees of the DISTRICT, or those benefits of a PERMANENT FIRE CHIEF, including but not limited to raises in base pay, vacation pay, holiday leave, bereavement leave, sick leave, or health or retirement benefits or severance pay.  

4. BINDING AGREEMENT  
This Agreement shall be binding on the heirs, successors and assigns of the parties.  

5. ENTIRE AGREEMENT  
This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties. No promise, representation, warranty or covenant not included in this Agreement has been or is relied upon by either party to this Agreement.  

6. AMENDMENT OF AGREEMENT  
This Agreement may be amended in writing by mutual agreement of the parties.

8. SEVERABILITY  
Should any paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, clause, phrase or word included in this Agreement be found invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the balance of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

9. RIGHT TO COUNSEL  
The parties acknowledge that they have been or have had a right to be represented by counsel of their own choice; that they have executed this Agreement with the consent and upon the advice of their own counsel, if such advice has been sought; and they have fully read and fully understood and voluntarily accepted the terms of this Agreement.
