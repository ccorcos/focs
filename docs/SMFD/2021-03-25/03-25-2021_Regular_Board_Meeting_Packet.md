**SUBJECT:** Revision of Board Policy  
Policy 01.010.02 Purchasing and Contracting  

**TOPIC**  
Adopt the proposed changes to the current 01.010.02 Board Policy regarding Purchasing and Contracting.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Attached is the Purchasing and Contracting Policy that was reviewed and approved by the Board in June of 2014. This policy was reviewed by the Purchasing Division and updated to include language required by the Code of Federal Regulations Title 2, Part 200 (2 CFR 200): Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards. 2 CFR 200 outlines the requirements for non-federal entities who receive federal grant awards. While the District was already in compliance with the requirement to have a written procurement policy, the policy needed to be updated to include specific language regarding procurements using federal grant funding, in accordance with 2 CFR 200 requirements.  

The revised policy was reviewed and approved by the Policy Committee at the March 11, 2021 Policy Committee Meeting.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Recommend the Board of Directors approve the revision to the Purchasing and Contracting Policy.
