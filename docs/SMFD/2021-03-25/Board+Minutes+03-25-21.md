# OPERATIONS REPORT

Deputy Chief Mitchell reports out for the Operations Division beginning with a training update. Tomorrow will complete the third presentation of our PDP series in the new “Ted Talk” format, and the feedback continues to be overwhelmingly positive.

He is happy to report there is only one member off work awaiting COVID-19 testing results, and there are no members off work with positive results. Total COVID-19 positives since beginning remains at 112 members. Our last COVID Emergency Operations Group regional call was this past Monday and has been suspended until a need is identified to reinstate it. We have hosted this call involving all of our cooperators successfully for the last year to increase communication and consistency across the region. Thanks to BC Fiorica who has been hosting it recently, and to AC Jenkins who hosted before him.

As for statistics since the last Board meeting, there have been 3,753 total calls, this is a slight increase from the last report. The busiest engine was E53, and busiest Medic was M224.

Lastly, DC Mitchell provided an update on the Engineer Rutherford Memorial. The Incident Management Team (IMT) has been working in unified command with Local 522 and has established these objectives: family support, member support, and planning the memorial. Today’s operation included transporting Engineer Rutherford from the Coroner’s Office in Placer to the Mortuary his family selected. We are in close contact with the Rutherford family and have members with them daily, and the support has been very much appreciated. Thank you to all of the members at Metro Fire who have stepped up to help in many different ways, and to those other agencies who have reached out and offered condolences and assistance. We will continue with the honor watch 24 hours a day until he is laid to rest.
