**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** January 11, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Prequalified Short-List – Design-Build Entities  

**TOPIC**  
Request to approve the establishment of a prequalified short-list of design-build entities as part of the District's design-build best value procurement process for the Zinfandel Phase 3 Buildout.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District's (District) Board of Directors has adopted Resolution 2023-065 which determined that it was in the best interest of the District to use the design-build construction delivery method for the Zinfandel Phase 3 Buildout project (Project) and authorized the use of a two-step best value procurement process to solicit potential design-build entities.  

**DISCUSSION**  
On October 13, 2023, the District issued Request for Qualifications (RFQ) 23-07 for the purpose of establishing a prequalified short-list of design-build entities who will be invited to submit proposals in response to a planned Request for Proposals (RFP) to be issued for the completion of the Project using a design-build project delivery. The District received a total of six submittals in response to the RFQ from the following design-build entities:  

- Bobo Construction, Inc.  
- Creekside Commercial Builders, Inc.  
- Diede Construction, Inc.  
- Gilbane Building Company  
- Roebbelen Contracting, Inc.  
- Swinerton Builders  

One submittal was deemed non-responsive after the evaluation panel determined that the submittal did not conform with the submittal requirements outlined in the RFQ. The remaining five submittals were evaluated and scored by the evaluation panel based on the two-part evaluation process outlined in the RFQ.  

In accordance with best practices for best value design-build procurement, staff recommends the establishment of a prequalified short-list that includes the following three highest scoring design-build entities: Diede Construction, Inc., Roebbelen Contracting, Inc., and Swinerton Builders.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
There is no fiscal impact for establishing the prequalified short-list of design-build entities.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board adopt a resolution to establish a prequalified short-list of the three highest scoring design-build entities for the Zinfandel Phase 3 Buildout project.
