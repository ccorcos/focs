**DATE:** May 23, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Annual Adjustment for Medical Aid and Ambulance Transport User Fee  

**TOPIC**  
Ordinance #2023-01 (the Ordinance), which was adopted by the Board of Directors on June 22, 2023, provides for an annual increase in the District's Medical Aid and Ambulance Transport User Fees. The effective date of the increase would be July 1, 2024.  

**BACKGROUND**  
In order to keep pace with annual cost inflation, the Ordinance specifies that the fees identified in Exhibit “A” of the Ordinance shall be adjusted annually, beginning July 1, 2024, and each July 1 thereafter. The amount of change shall be based on the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) Series Title Medical Care in the U.S. City Average, All Urban Consumers, Not Seasonally Adjusted, as published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (the Medical CPI) for the twelve (12) month period ending December 31 of the preceding calendar year. The Ordinance also states that approval by the Board of Directors shall be by resolution, adopted at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board prior to the enactment of the increase.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Based on the percentage change in the annual Medical CPI for calendar year 2023 compared to calendar year 2022, the percentage fee adjustment change effective July 1, 2024 will be 0.45%. The current and recommended fees are shown in the table on the next page.

Fire Chief  

**DATE:** May 23, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Contract For Community Risk Reduction Division Cost Recovery Services  

**TOPIC**  
Staff proposes that the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) adopt the Resolution and enter into a new contract for Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD) cost recovery with Wittman Enterprises, LLC (Wittman), effective June 08, 2024. The contract term is for three (3) years ending on June 30, 2027 which is the original contract’s expiration date, as explained in discussion below.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The District provides services to individuals and businesses including operational permits, plan review, new construction inspections, general fire and life safety inspections, and other miscellaneous services. Pursuant to Health & Safety Code Sections 13146.2(b), 13217(b), 13862, 13869, 13871, 13874, 17951 and California Government Code Section 6103.7, the District is authorized to adopt user and regulatory fees to defray and/or recover the cost of providing specified services directly to an individual or business. Collection of user fees reduces the burden on general District revenues (primarily property taxes) to fund such regulatory services, thus providing the ability to stretch other resources further for the benefit of the public at-large.  

Ordinance 2023-02 revised the fee schedule for CRRD and was approved and adopted by the Board of Directors on July 27, 2024 with an effective date of September 01, 2024.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The District has conducted two solicitations for CRRD cost recovery services since 2013, RFQ 13-06 CRRD Cost Recovery Services and RFP 20-11 CRRD Inspection Billing Services. Wittman was awarded both contracts, with extensions approved for both agreements based on performance. The District’s current contract with Wittman will expire on June 08, 2024. Wittman has met their service level agreements over the past decade and the District recommends a new contract with Wittman for CRRD cost recovery services.  

Per the District’s Purchasing and Contracting Policy, purchases may be allowed without competitive bidding when a service is obtainable from suppliers which have in force a current contract with another governmental agency for the same item or service. In March of 2022, the City of Santa Monica (City) issued RFP 315: Third Party Billing Services/Fire Department, which was awarded to Wittman. The City’s original contract with Wittman is in effect from April 10, 2023 through June 30, 2027. The City’s competitive solicitation process is in-line with the District’s process, and therefore this  

**Serving Sacramento and Placer Counties**  
P24
<!-- Page 25 -->
![Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/988x768.png?text=Page+2)

procurement is eligible for an exception to bidding. Additionally, staff has negotiated a lower fee with Wittman.

**FISCAL IMPACT**

The new contract would lower the fee on net collected charges from 7% to 6%, representing a 15% revenue concession. There are no other additional costs up front or otherwise to be borne by the District. CRRD budgeted $72,000 for the contract in FY24/25, and the estimated contract cost over three years is $216,000 which will be accounted for in future budget cycles based on estimated volume of services.

**RECOMMENDATION**

Staff recommends that the Board of Directors approve the resolution authorizing the Fire Chief or designee to execute a professional services agreement with Wittman Enterprises, LLC for the provision of CRRD cost recovery effective June 08, 2024.

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/987x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
of this Agreement. This Agreement may be modified only by written agreement signed by City and Wittman, and approved as to form by the City Attorney.  
8. Insurance. Prior to commencing work, Wittman must procure, maintain and pay for insurance against claims for injuries to persons or damage to property that may arise from or in connection with the performance of the Services by Wittman or Wittman’s agents, representatives, subcontractors, or employees for the duration of this Agreement. Wittman must obtain insurance that, at a minimum, meets the requirements for insurance set forth in Exhibit C, Insurance Requirements and Verifications.

9.1 Wittman agrees to defend, indemnify, protect, and hold harmless the City, its agents, officers, boards and commissions, and employees (collectively, “City”) from and against any and all liability, claims, demands, damages, or costs, including but not limited to attorney’s fees, or payments for injury to any person or property (collectively, “Losses”) caused by the act, errors, and/or omissions of Wittman, or Wittman’s employees, agents, and subcontractors.

Insurance is to be placed with insurers authorized to conduct business in California with a current A.M. Best rating of no less than A:VII, unless otherwise acceptable to the City of Santa Monica.

1. If the Professional Liability policy provides “claims made” coverage:  
   a. The Retroactive Date must be shown and must be before the date of this Agreement or the start of work.  
   b. The insurance must be maintained, and evidence of insurance must be provided for at least 5 years after completion of work.

**Verification of Coverage**  
Wittman shall furnish the City of Santa Monica with original certificates and mandatory endorsements (or copies of the applicable policy language effecting coverage provided by this clause). All certificates and endorsements are to be received and approved by the City of Santa Monica before work commences. However, failure to obtain required documents prior to the work beginning shall not waive the Wittman’s obligation to provide them. The City of Santa Monica reserves the right to require complete, certified copies of all required insurance policies, including the endorsements required herein, at any time.

**Failure to Maintain Insurance Coverage**  
If Wittman, for any reason, fails to maintain insurance coverage which is required pursuant to this Agreement, the same shall be deemed a material breach of contract. The City of Santa Monica, at its sole option, may terminate this Agreement and obtain damages from the Wittman resulting from said breach. Alternatively, the City of Santa Monica may purchase such coverage (but has no special obligation to do so), and without further notice to the Wittman, the City may deduct from sums due to the Wittman any premium costs advanced by the City for such insurance.

**Subcontractors**  
Wittman shall require and verify that all subcontractors maintain insurance meeting all the requirements stated herein. All exceptions must be approved in writing by the Risk Manager.

![Letter from our CEO](https://via.placeholder.com/768x988.png?text=Letter+from+our+CEO)

**Letter from our CEO**

April 14, 2022

Thank you for this opportunity to introduce our qualifications and our team to you and to provide the City of Santa Monica our RFP response for Third Party Billing Services. Since 1991 Wittman Enterprises, LLC has provided our clients complete ambulance and fire billing services in compliance with current local, state, and federal laws and statutes. We follow and exceed currently accepted standards for accurate, consistent, and best EMS/Fire billing practices while maximizing revenue recovery, honoring your collection philosophy, and treating each of your patients, citizens, customers, and visitors as our own. We serve 130 EMS/Fire clients (110 in California, 23 in Los Angeles County) and are the largest California-based billing company with the client base, patient database, and experience with California departments (and multiple California payers) for the most effective EMS billing and cost recovery possible.

As the most qualified and experienced EMS biller in California, we want to assure the City of Santa Monica that our ultimate focus is on, and has always been based on, the best patient and client service, billing results (accurate and legal billing and most legal, reimbursable revenue), and transparency (Client Portal, Reporting, Month-end-Reporting, KPIs, etc.). We use all the resources necessary to provide the best in customer service and collect for our clients: (on average) 10-20% more in net revenue than our competitors.

Wittman has substantial experience with California City/Fire Department ambulance billing program startups like yours at Santa Monica. We coordinate all new program requirements to successfully bill and collect from Medicare, Medi-Cal, VA, Private Insurance, patients, and all other eligible payers. Startup partnerships over the years include Anaheim, West Covina, CSA 17 (Del Mar, Del Mar Heights, Solana Beach, Encinitas, Rancho Santa Fe, etc.), Costa Mesa, Fullerton, Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage, El Dorado County, Sacramento Metro, and Fountain Valley.

I could not be prouder of the tremendous working relationship we have enjoyed with our EMS/Fire Partners over the last 30 years. We have worked together on multiple changes in our industry: on the GEMT and GEMT/QAF rollout and implementations; on ICD-10 conversions; on the new PPGIT (AB 1705) program; and on the most recent CARES Act programs and submissions. Thank you for allowing me to introduce our qualifications and commitment to the City and to your EMS/Fire team. We look forward to beginning our Partnership with you during this exciting program rollout.

My best,  
Corinne Wittman-Wong, CEO

![ePCR Import Data Scrubber](https://via.placeholder.com/768x987.png?text=ePCR+Import+Data+Scrubber)

**ePCR Import Data Scrubber**

Using our proprietary pre-billing program, we automatically scrub every ePCR ticket that is sent to us. Through that process we are often able to fill in missing demographics information such as address, insurance coverage and social security information, missing phone numbers, name spelling, changes of address, and mileage checker. Some of the tools we incorporate into our scrubbing program include:

- **Melissa Data** (address verification to ensure accuracy of patient addresses)
- **TransUnion** (checks all incidents that do not come with insurance/SSN information. Searches for SSN, address, phone, DOB, double checks spelling of name, etc.)
- **Ability Health** (for incidents that have a SSN, system searches for insurance coverage information)
- **Google Maps** (Mileage checker)
- **NCOALink** (checks for patients who may have moved and changed their address with USPS. Any discovered changes are automatically updated to the file before it enters our system)
- **Internal Matrix App** (proprietary program written to analyze imported data and standardizing data sets to make sure it imports properly into our billing system)
- **Internal Validation App** (proprietary program written to validate data via logic hooks prior to importing into our billing system)

![Records Confirmed and Screened for Completeness](https://via.placeholder.com/768x988.png?text=Records+Confirmed+and+Screened+for+Completeness)

**Records Confirmed and Screened for Completeness**  
All PCRs received by our Billing Team are thoroughly reviewed for treatments and treatment codes, medical condition (ICD-10) codes, medical necessity, appropriateness of charges for services based on services rendered, and overall completeness. Coding with the appropriate payer, patient condition, and charges normally occur within 48 to 72 hours of receipt. PCRs with incomplete information may be referred back to the transporting agency for the missing information, if and when hospital face sheets are not available. Patient accounts with private insurance, Medicare, and Medi-Cal information are billed immediately. If insurance information is not available on the initial call report, additional research is conducted to locate any available insurance. When no insurance can be identified, the patient’s account is then set up for private billing.

**Locating and Verifying Insurance**  
All insurance and third party payer information provided is verified online or by phone. By identifying the correct payer for a patient’s claim before it is ever billed, we consistently keep our percentage of incorrect billings very low. In the event that the incorrect insurance is billed, our customer service representatives contact the patient or receiving hospitals for the correct insurance information. Denials are simply not acceptable.

**Follow-Up Protocols**  
As mentioned above, our comprehensive collection services include working with your receiving hospitals to obtain patient demographics to ensure the highest level of collection possible. We also gather additional information via secured email, VPN, fax, and phone calls to the financial offices of hospitals or skilled nursing facilities. Wittman Enterprises engages a variety of other processes and resources in the course of following up on accounts with inadequate billing information including:  
- Use of Zip Code/Street Directories for obtaining missing/incomplete addresses in addition to our own proprietary address checker program and MelissaData.com  
- Use of Accurint.com for tracing mail returns  
- Contacting the EMS Division to locate missing information from Run Reports  
- Contacting the patient or family members for billing or insurance information  
- Personal contact with the patient or patient’s family via phone or email  
- Mailing inquiry forms to the patient  

**Assignment Authorization**  
Based on our extensive EMS billing experience, we have found that the most efficient billing and collection programs are a direct result of a strong partnership between Wittman Enterprises and our client. That concept is particularly important when discussing patient signature authorizations. Agencies are not permitted to file claims to Medicare without the signature of the patient, designated guardian, or witnessed declaration that the patient is not able to sign. Recognizing that there are times when obtaining these signatures is simply not feasible; Wittman has developed a solid process in partnership with you, to address missing and invalid signatures. This process includes both education and direct patient contact to obtain required forms. Patient signature authorizations can significantly impact revenue if not diligently pursued in a timely manner.

P73
<!-- Page 74 -->
![Patient Database](https://via.placeholder.com/768x987.png?text=Patient+Database)

**Patient Database**  
For 30 years we have compiled an extensive Patient Database containing thousands of patient records and demographic information and historical data. Our California database has been growing since 1991 when we began our partnership with our original 8 Southern California clients (we now have 110 public EMS clients in California). Our Los Angeles County and Southern California database has been growing ever since. This comprehensive Patient Database allows us to cross-reference accounts and streamline the billing process in a more efficient and thorough manner. We do this under the strictest HIPAA compliance regulations to ensure proper patient confidentiality.

**Identification of Payment Sources**  
When insurance information is incorrect or incomplete, our Customer Service Representatives work with hospitals and the patient to obtain current and accurate information. After initial patient contact is made, insurance eligibility is verified with the patient still on the phone. This prevents billing delays and allows customer service representatives to inform patients if there are any problems with the insurance information provided.

Wittman electronically bills all Medicare, Medi-Cal, qualified primary and secondary insurance sources, workers compensation, health maintenance organizations, third party liability, benefit programs, and self-insurance programs. Those who do not accept electronic claims are billed via generated paper statements mailed directly to them.

For auto accident-related accounts, we determine from the patient whether they have med-pay through their automobile insurance, we are billing a third party insurer, or if they have retained the services of an attorney. Depending on the patient’s response, we will either bill the patient’s med-pay or private health insurance, bill the responsible party or we will work with the patient’s attorney to set up a lien against their personal injury case. All appropriate follow-up on accounts occurs regularly by specialized personnel in our Patient Service Department.

Wittman Enterprises, LLC has also worked on several large insurance bankruptcies. These bankruptcies have affected the revenue of our clients. Through our efforts, we have been able to obtain for our clients up to 80% of unsecured debt owed by several of these insurance companies. Most of our competitors opt to forego this process as it can take years to settle these cases. It takes many hours of correspondence and re-billing to the bankruptcy courts to net our clients payments that otherwise would have been written off.

![Medicare Billing](https://via.placeholder.com/988x768.png?text=Medicare+Billing)

**Medicare Billing**  
For incidents where no Medicare insurance information was noted by the paramedic, Wittman Enterprises requests insurance information and an authorization signature from the patient. Once a patient responds to our request(s) for Medicare insurance information, and/or if our electronic scrubber identifies patient Medicare insurance information, we complete the following steps:

**Step 1:**  
Our billing team determines the level of service on every PCR we receive, then adds any applicable charges, and evaluates the incident for medical necessity per Medicare guidelines.

**Step 2:**  
Our billing team electronically confirms Medicare eligibility and updates all newly-provided information to our billing system. We always check eligibility when the patient is over the age of 65 and we have been provided a Social Security Number or Medicare ID. We will also check for eligibility information on the PCR or hospital face sheet when the patient has been identified as a Medicare recipient.

**Step 3:**  
Patient signature is added to their account once we have received it from them or if it is provided with the initial incident report.

**Step 4:**  
All available transport information is either uploaded automatically to the billing system or the biller manually enters/verifies transport information from the PCR.

**Medicare Required**  
- Bed Confined Before?  
- Bed Confined After?  
- Bed Confined During?  
- Chair Confined During?  
- Medically Necessary?  
- Patient moved by Stretcher?  
- Transported To or From?  

**Step 5:**  
The primary payor is updated in our billing system and Medicare is billed electronically.

![Medi-Cal Billing](https://via.placeholder.com/768x987.png?text=Medi-Cal+Billing)

**Medi-Cal Billing**  
The detailed steps for billing Medi-Cal are mostly the same as those for billing Medicare as previously detailed. There is an additional step that is taken in addition to the Medicare Standard Operating Procedure:  
- As with Medi-Cal, we check eligibility whenever we are provided the patient’s Social Security Number or Medi-Cal ID. Our billers determine the level of service and add any applicable charges. Once we have received eligibility we clarify whether it is a straight Medi-Cal Plan, or a Medi-Cal HMO plan, and update the payor in our billing system to submit the claim to the proper Medi-Cal payor.

**Private Insurance Billing**  
After a patient responds to our request(s) for insurance information, and/or if our electronic scrubber identifies patient private insurance information, we complete the following steps:

**Step 1:**  
The patient writes their insurance information on the correspondence they are returning or; the patient sends a copy of their insurance card.  
- Billing team updates all newly-provided information in our billing system  
- Billing team electronically confirms eligibility of insurance  
- Billing team calls insurances when necessary to verify patient eligibility  

**Step 2:**  
If the patient is confirmed eligible we add the payor to the patient’s account along with their coverage and insurance identification information.

**P76**
<!-- Page 77 -->
![Step 3](https://via.placeholder.com/768x987.png?text=Step+3)  
**Step 3:**  
The billing department notates the account and changes the primary payor from self-pay to insurance.  

**Change Primary Payor**  
- Payor: Bill Patient  
- Schedule: Culver City Billing Pt  
- Event: No Bill Sent  

**Change Primary Payor**  
- Payor: Medicare Colorado  
- Schedule: Mcare Out Of State Electronic  
- Event: No Bill Sent  

**Step 4:**  
After double-checking the primary payor, billing team submits bill via keystroke to the correct paying insurance (electronically for those companies providing that method of claim submission, or through the mail for all others).  

**Denied or Disallowed Claims**  
Wittman Enterprises pursues every claim and follows through with every denial so that all legitimate revenue is collected on behalf of our clients. Denials are not accepted; in fact, as a policy we appeal all claims where the denial has appeal rights and we determine that an appeal is warranted. Additionally, Wittman demands payment with the appropriate interest from non-compliant insurance companies.  

**Medicare Denials**  
Medicare may deny claims for any number of reasons such as a patient without Part B coverage on the date of service, incorrect patient information on the claim, Medicare is a secondary payer, the patient has a Medicare Advantage plan, and many others. Wittman Enterprises actively appeals and processes all denials, making sure our clients get their maximum legal reimbursements. Our thorough process starts with reviewing the denial code and includes:  
- Identifying the course of action based on the denial code  
- Further researching Medicare Eligibility  
- Verifying payer primacy between patient insurance and Medicare coverage  
- Locating Medicare Advantage plan coverage  
- Reviewing modifiers and codes for accuracy  
- Checking EOBs for reported non-covered services or for no Part B coverage  
- Billing secondary payers such as insurance and Medi-Cal as necessary  
- Correcting information requested on denial and resubmission to Medicare, supplemental insurance, Medi-Cal, and the patient to reflect all necessary changes  
- Scheduling a call-back date to follow up on resubmission  
- Notating the account so that it reflects up-to-the-minute status of every claim  

**City of Santa Monica: Request for Proposals: Third Party Billing Services/Fire Department | P77**
<!-- Page 78 -->
![Medi-Cal Denials](https://via.placeholder.com/988x768.png?text=Medi-Cal+Denials)

Medi-Cal Denials  
Not all Medi-Cal denials are provided to us in the same way. Most are received in traditional Explanation of Benefit (EOB) format where codes are given and definitions for the codes are provided on the EOB. Others are returned in letter format only without codes or any clear reason for the denial. Our procedures for processing Medi-Cal denials include:

- Reviewing EOB/letter to verify if a payment was issued, and to identify the explanation for the listed code. This primary step is key for determining the type of denial received and what course of action to take for ultimate payment.
- Further investigating patient’s Medi-Cal eligibility and modify claim data if necessary.
- Identifying hierarchy of payers. Assuming Medi-Cal is the primary; add appropriate denial code along with any other necessary changes.
- Resubmitting claim to Medi-Cal.
- Scheduling a call-back date to follow up on resubmission.
- Notating the account so that it reflects up-to-the-minute status of every claim.

Insurance Denials  
Health Plans and Medical Groups issue denials when all or parts of a claim are not paid. There are several types of denials. Some are issued correctly according to the patient’s insurance policy and/or billing guidelines while others are incorrect due to an error by the health plan when processing the claim. Our standard operating procedures include:

- Verifying whether the denial is based on "Not a Covered Benefit," "Not Eligible," "Unable to identify as a Member" or, "Primary Insurance Paid more than Allowed," for example.
- If there is another billable insurance on file, sending a claim to that insurance, attaching the denial received.
- If there is no other billable insurance on file, contacting the patient to inform them of the denial and request any other insurance information.
- When corrected information is received from the patient, updating the payer information and send a claim and a copy of the PCR to that insurance with the denial received attached.
- When there is no viable insurance policy to bill, no Member or Resident program, converting the claim to private pay and billing directly to the patient.

We have a significant number of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) covering numerous scenarios for processing denials for Medicare, Medi-Cal, and Private Insurance. Our SOPs are also available to you for review if you would like a more exhaustive explanation of our various methods.

![Hospital Patient Records Systems](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

# Hospital Patient Records Systems
Creating a mutually beneficial partnership with your destination hospitals is a key part of our transition schedule when we begin our work with you. Initial contact is usually started even before the contract has been finalized. Initially, most hospitals elect to exchange data through a fax solution where Wittman submits an information request on a regular basis. Once the information is retrieved, the face sheets are faxed back to Wittman for further processing. This is an effective short-term solution; however, we then work with HIPAA compliance and IT teams at each hospital to attempt to establish a more efficient mode of information transfer. Typically, faxed requests take a minimum of two working days before we might expect to receive the requested information from the hospital.

As part of our work with the City of Santa Monica and as part of this proposal, we will work with your top receiving hospitals to implement a more effective, streamlined process. Expediting the initial set-up is important and we will work with hospital Health Information Management (HIM) personnel to set up the most efficient option: direct VPN access or scheduled FTP “data dumps.” Both methods ensure regular exchange of information and the retrieval of hospital face sheets in the most expedient way allowed.

# Self-Pay Accounts
Surveys from the American Collectors Association indicate that patients are more motivated to make payment from a telephone call than repeated collection notices. However, by combining telephone calls and collection notices, an agency can further increase this effectiveness. We have found this to be true through the personal attention given to our clients and their patients.

Our first call to a private account occurs immediately after data entry of the incident into the system and automated and/or manual searches for previous accounts for the same patient have been completed.

This verification call allows us to determine if the patient has insurance or any special circumstances that will make it difficult to pay the bill in a reasonable amount of time.

The early establishment of contact with the patient is beneficial in establishing a working relationship with the patient on an individual level.

![Patient Payment Options](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Patient+Payment+Options)

**Patient Payment Options**  
Wittman Enterprises effects positive collections for the City's financial requirements while providing compassionate service to your patients—doing everything possible to attain reimbursement for your claims. With that goal, we try to provide as many payment options as possible so that patients have choices of how best to make payments to their accounts. Whether they mail their check payment or credit card billing information, provide their credit card information over the phone, set up a limited installment payment plan, or prefer to access our Credit Card Payment Portal, we make it as simple as possible for patients to submit their payments.

**Credit Card Portal**  
Based on your preferences, we provide credit card payment options for your patients who wish to have bill payments processed this way. Patients are informed through our correspondence and our customer service staff how they can make credit card payments to their accounts. Limited Wittman staff is authorized to accept credit card information over the phone and our automated Credit Card Portal allows patients to securely pay their bills using our online reporting module. Additionally, our IT team can provide seamless links so that patients may also connect to the Credit Card Portal through the City of Santa Monica website.

![Installment Payments](https://example.com/image.png)

**Installment Payments**  
For patients unable to pay their full balance owed, Wittman follows your policies in regards to self-pay accounts. This could include minimum payments accepted and the duration of the private pay contract. Based on our experience, we have found that limiting payback duration to one year usually provides the best results for our clients. Patients have the option of making their monthly payments by check or credit card. They may also set up an AutoPay agreement with a signed authorization where payment is automatically withdrawn from their credit card each month.

**Collection Practices**  
On average, we send less than 12% of all accounts billed for additional collection efforts. Wittman will provide current reports identifying any non-collectable accounts to be released to your collection agency. As part of our process, we work with your agency and provide necessary documentation regarding each account. However, before an account is even considered for referral to collections, the following exhaustive procedures will have been performed:

- Patients will have been cross-referenced by name, social security number, incident pickup or residence address, and date(s) of service through a variety of resources including our extensive patient database.
- The entire regular invoicing cycle will have been completed.
- We will have conducted all appropriate follow-up calls and letters.
- We have identified all available alternate patient contacts.
- We will have completed our skip-tracing processes to locate correct address and telephone information with tools such as Accurint.com, The Haines Directory, MelissaData.com, etc.
- Receiving hospitals will have been contacted for most accurate and current patient demographic information.
- A second verification of Medicare, Medi-Cal, and Private Insurance eligibility is performed.

**Hardships, Discounts, and Reductions**  
In the course of providing our services, Wittman follows the City's policies. For example, you may waive the ambulance fee if it is found that a patient does not have the financial resources to pay. We notify your department in the case of any situation requiring modification of account balances, pay schedule, referral to collections, or account write off. No adjustment is ever made without prior authorization from you. All adjustments are clearly documented and identified in our regular reporting and documentation. We customize policies at your direction regarding discounts and reductions to meet the City's requirements. Some of these may include hardships, attorney requests, City employees, or small balance write-offs. In all cases, no discounting decisions or write-offs are made without your advanced approval.

![Final Review: Delinquent Accounts](https://via.placeholder.com/768x987.png?text=Final+Review:+Delinquent+Accounts)

**Final Review: Delinquent Accounts**  
Once an account has gone through the billing cycle, an account representative will review the account one final time before placing on collection review. At that point a customer service lead will perform one last review of the entire account to ensure all SOPs were followed throughout the billing cycle. If all efforts have been made and process followed correctly, a write-off report will be submitted to the client contact and, if approved, electronically submitted to the City's contracted collection agency.

**Processing Funds**  
Many of our EMS billing partners prefer and we recommend the Live Cash method of processing payments. Payments are sent directly to us, processed and posted to the account, and deposited into the City's bank account. Due to our meticulous auditing, balancing, and reconciliation processes your monthly reports will balance with your bank statements to the penny. Great care is taken from the opening of correspondence and payment envelopes by a specific group of staff (minimum double custody treatment and handling protocols). Patient accounts are updated and verified for accuracy before any checks are prepared for deposit. In all cases, double-custody procedures are followed so that payments are always within at least two cash receipt staff hands. Finally, we limit processing of payments and remote deposit logins to a maximum of two people to control deposits completely.

Payments made by check are scanned and deposited remotely to your bank account (or directly at the bank by designated personnel if remote banking is not a service your bank provides). Cash payments are handled directly by the president of the company. For Electronic Funds Transfers ("EFT") required by federal insurance providers such as Medicare, we post Electronic Remittance Advices ("ERA") to protect account amounts immediately upon receipt. Since requirements vary from agency to agency regarding payments and funds received, Wittman Enterprises works closely with the City of Santa Monica to optimize this function during the life of our work together.

Deposits are made Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays of each week, with deposit slip reconciliations emailed to clients usually the same day, but no later than the day after each deposit to the City's bank account. Monthly closes (and subsequent monthly reporting) occur at a predetermined time agreed up by our clients (whether from a hard close or a soft close, to reflect as many payments as possible prior to closing). All month-end procedures are customized to meet the City's accounting needs. We invoice our clients for our fees (percentage of the month's net collected dollar amount) monthly after the month-end close has been completed.

# Fire Prevention Billing Approach/Methodology

## Fire Inspection Billing Work Cycle
All processes for our billing partners are customizable and can be modified at any time. We work through the following steps for most of our clients' Fire Inspection programs:

- Fire Inspection Reports and Log are received via email from the Santa Monica Fire Department/Fire Prevention Division.
- Wittman's Support Services Team verifies that the Inspection Reports and Log match, then place Fire Inspections into our automated DocuWare system workflow for our Billing Team to process.
- Billing Team manually enters each FIN into our ZOLL billing system.
- Biller reviews each Inspection Report for accurate/complete billing information.
- If required information is missing or needs clarification, the Inspection is placed on a Supervisor Hold for them to review and/or follow-up with Fire staff.
- Once Inspection bill is complete, the biller reviews the charges and accuracy of the bill and then sends out the first bill to each business.
- Initial invoices are processed and sent directly from our office to each inspected business.
- Subsequent invoice(s) are uploaded daily to the secure FTP site of InfoSend, our mail house partner.
- Files are reviewed and approved by Wittman staff prior to authorizing InfoSend to send additional invoice(s) out.
- Errors or exceptions that require additional research are removed from the outgoing batch and put on a supervisor review for further processing.
- Any anomalies are corrected in-house and then re-placed in the next InfoSend mailing batch.

## False Alarm Billing Work Cycle
Our Fire Department clients generally email False Alarm files (usually an Excel spreadsheet), and PDFs of trip report(s), directly to Wittman's Electronic Billing Team.

- Files are processed the same day or the next day by our Electronic Billing Team.
- False Alarm files are reviewed by the Electronic Billing Team to verify:
  a. Number of False Alarms received for billing
  b. That we have received all appropriate documentation in each column and row
  c. If any information is missing
  d. That any incidents listed as DO NOT BILL are accurately listed or that they should be deleted from that False Alarm batch's spreadsheet.
- Once all required information is confirmed with Santa Monica, we import the file into our Billing System.
- A Trip Import Count is run to verify that the total number of imported incidents match the total number of False Alarms on the batch spreadsheet.
- Confirmation email is sent to Santa Monica Fire staff to verify that the batch has been reviewed and the total number of False Alarms confirmed.

![Electronic Access to Records](https://via.placeholder.com/768x986.png?text=Electronic+Access+to+Records)

**Client Portal and Electronic Dashboard**  
Wittman Enterprises offers secured Internet access to our billing system via our Client Portal, 24 hours a day. No additional software is required for the City of Santa Monica to access the information through our secured server. It is accessed with a secured login that is password protected. Information accessed from the Portal is in real time, allowing authorized City and Fire personnel to view each claim wherever it is in the billing and collection process.

Access to the Client Portal is granted only to pre-authorized City and Fire personnel with permission to view such information and is strictly limited to the City of Santa Monica’s information. All patients may be referenced by name, date of service, incident, and run number. Your staff can print invoices for patients and run reports for their own use. Additionally, the City’s specialized reports can be made available through this site. Our billing software system is Microsoft Windows-based which enables data export by authorized staff for easy manipulation (Excel, PDF, Crystal, etc.). It also allows for a clear and traceable audit trail for initial client verification, billing notification, and phone contact. Moreover, our software automatically updates each individual account detailing date, change, or billing function. All history and noted entries become a permanent record and all charges are maintained for a complete payment history. Finally, the Portal provides an “electronic dashboard,” accessible 24 hours a day that provides a one-screen synopsis of the current state of the EMS billing operation, based on the preferences selected by each Client Portal authorized user.

# Secure Email
We provide the City access to our Secure Email Program from Axway. It provides multiple tiers of security that can be used individually or in combination to block threats at the DMZ and within the enterprise network, and secure inbound and outbound email traffic at the content and network levels. MailGate SC simplifies management of one comprehensive secure email solution for inbound, outbound and encryption, providing secure file delivery without impacting your current environment.

## File Transfer Protocol (FTP) Access
The City has access to our FTP site. We receive email notification anytime reports or other information are uploaded to the site. There is no file size limitation for client uploads.

### B. Cashing Procedure
Wittman Enterprises does not charge an additional processing fee for our regular deposit and posting services. Payments made by check are scanned and deposited remotely to the City's bank account (or directly at the bank by designated personnel, if remote banking is not a service your bank provides). For Electronic Funds Transfers ("EFT") required by federal and state insurance providers, and some private insurance providers, we post Electronic Remittance Advices ("ERA") to patient accounts immediately upon receipt. In all cases, City funds are deposited directly into the City's designated bank account. Wittman Enterprises has deposit rights only for City-authorized accounts and all revenues are deposited into City bank accounts.

## Processing Payments
- On behalf of City of Santa Monica we receive payments via check or credit card payment, which can be submitted via U.S. Mail address on the customer invoice, or online at www.webillems.com/Billing.
- Our Cash Receipts Team verifies payments of either False Alarm or Fire Inspection and runs a separate tally of each.
- The account is pulled up in the Billing System and the business name is verified to ensure payment is applied to the correct account.
- Payments are posted to accounts in batches and balances are generally paid in full. Any remaining balance is billed to the business owner until the balance is paid in full.
- Following posting, payments are listed on separate deposit slips for deposit: False Alarm and Fire Inspection to verify that batch totals match the posted amounts.
- Separate deposits are made for Fire Inspections and False Alarm, and deposit confirmation is emailed to designated Fire/City Financial staff.
- Credit Card payments are processed through Authorize.net.

![Customer Service](https://via.placeholder.com/768x979.png?text=C.+Customer+Service)

**We Value Customer Service**  
As an extension of your EMS/Fire program, Wittman Enterprises provides you with direct phone numbers and real access to all management staff, starting with our CEO. Additionally, specialized Wittman staff are assigned to your team so that you will always have direct access to the person on our team who can most help with whatever situation may arise. Our Client Liaison team is also available to help identify key resources you may need to get the results you want in a timely manner.

**EMS/Fire Partner Satisfaction**  
The City of Santa Monica will count on Wittman to conduct diligent, regular, and uninterrupted billing and collection services in a professional businesslike manner. Our personal approach and higher levels of service greatly exceed industry standards. Your expectations and overall satisfaction are attained through ongoing and regular training, continuous improvement, and our comprehensive auditing program. Our comprehensive and ongoing training program allows us to continuously improve the business activities that we conduct on behalf of the City and ensure that you continue to receive the maximum legal reimbursement available. The secret to our clients' successful reimbursement is ultimately the personal attention we apply to each of their accounts. Simply put, it is the dedication to our process that combines the best in technology with the commitment of people to perform the hard work necessary to pursue elusive insurance Payers, successfully appeal Medicare and insurance denials, and work effectively through difficult reimbursement issues such as Medi-Cal cutbacks. The significant efforts we undertake as a commitment to our EMS/Fire partners allow us to meet and exceed client expectations (and requirements as set forth in your RFP) and achieve high client/customer satisfaction. We stand behind the work we conduct on behalf of our clients and work closely with each of them to make sure they are completely satisfied with our performance.

**Performance**  
With a proven commitment to customer and patient service Wittman Enterprises conducts your business as if your patients were our own. This starts with valuing customer service with everything we have done as a Company since 1991 (living up to our Dedicated Response Time Commitment; providing ongoing and comprehensive Staff Training; availability of our Bilingual Staff; meeting regularly with our partners quarterly, etc.).

We also strive to provide up-to-the-minute looks directly into our billing system and multiple ways to view records, reports, and other valuable information through our Client Portal. For ePCR interfacing and ultimate billing accuracy we work closely with most ePCR/RMS vendors like Digital EMS and First Due to ensure the quality of data we receive on your behalf for the billing process.

Finally, from all of these important areas we constantly monitor the quality of our work on your program through a series of KPIs customized to ensure the success you should expect. We are transparent to the point that our EMS and Fire partners have as much access to data and trends as they need to evaluate the success of our team at meeting your goals.

![Dedicated Response Time Commitment](https://via.placeholder.com/768x984.png?text=Dedicated+Response+Time+Commitment)

**Dedicated Response Time Commitment**  
Wittman Enterprises' goal is that each client and patient reach a live person when they call into our business office located in Rancho Cordova. If our EMS and Fire partners or their patients/customers do not reach a live person during regular business hours, they will be provided the option to leave a voicemail and offered instructions on submitting an email inquiry. Wittman personnel will respond the same day during normal operating or within 24 business hours when that is not possible.

**Live Operator Assistance**  
Patient Service Representatives are responsible for the follow-up on private insurance, private pay, and balance-billed accounts. They are responsible for over 10,000 calls weekly to and from patients while processing patient insurance information and working through any patient concerns, needs, or disputes. Customer Service Representatives are available uninterrupted Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM PST (with no lunch shut-down) to serve your patient needs. Our toll-free number has multiple lines available for patients, clients, insurance companies, attorneys, and third parties to call for information or to discuss account status. Our system accepts voice mail messages and routes calls to appropriate person and/or voicemail box 24 hours per day. Our phone system was recently upgraded, and our Verizon router replaced and system updated ensuring the most effective solution and intuitive routing of calls for both the City and your patients.

**Alternative Language Capabilities**  
Wittman Enterprises employs several Spanish, Chinese, and Vietnamese-speaking Customer Service Representatives in management and non-management positions. Such valuable resources provide your patients with the highest quality of service possible. On rare occasions, if a patient speaks a language we are not staffed to service, we utilize Language Line Services to assist those customers effectively. Currently, Wittman employs 16 bilingual staff members that are available to assist with calls.

**Customer Complaint Resolution**  
As part of the billing and collection services we provide, we make contacts with patients under the name of the billing company for the City of Santa Monica. We are not a collection agency and do not contact patients once their accounts have been deemed as non-collectible and reported to the City as such.

## Monthly Reporting Requirements
Our month-end correspondence with you includes Cash Receipt Reports that reconcile all deposits, receivables, billings, patient accounts, adjustments, dishonest checks, and refunds. All other processes and functions at Wittman Enterprises, LLC are ongoing. Financial and performance reports are detailed and easy to read. On-Demand (ad hoc) reports are our specialty and are provided at a moment's notice at no additional charge. These reports provide detailed accounting for account adjustments of any type and track revenue by period. Our reports are Accurate and Easy to Read. Robust and Individualized. Accessible.

- **A/R Aging Report**: This report can be either a detail or summary report based on trip date (date of service), patient, or payer. It can be customized to track a specific payer or payers and date ranges and lists how many ambulance claims are still outstanding for any given time period.
  
- **Ticket Survey Report**: Detail or Summary can be run by date of service, payer or patient or combination thereof. Ticket Surveys are used to provide the number of accounts input into the system in a given month and under the payer mix category.

- **Year-to-Date Revenue Report**: This report provides a snapshot of the last twelve months at any time. It offers totals in all categories including Medicare and Medi-Cal write-downs, monthly amount of delinquent accounts and refund amounts. It is a very effective performance analysis tool in monitoring our performance as it reflects our ongoing collection rate, both gross and net, for a twelve-month period.
  
- **Management Summary Report**: The report is run by fiscal year. It provides an accounting by financial class of total trips and dollars billed each month, with a cumulative year-to-date tracking.

![Billing Structure](https://via.placeholder.com/984x768.png?text=Billing+Structure)

E. Billing Structure

Our billing structure for clients varies considerably, depending on the scope(s) of work, volume of work, demographics of department areas, and several other items based on the type of program each client operates. We customize our work around the needs of each individual client and our billing structures reflect many of those variations. Please see Section 8.0 ("Pricing") (p. 101) for our detailed proposal based on the information from your RFP and any subsequent Q&A, your City Fee Schedule, and our vast experience in the Los Angeles County area. Following are some of the billing structure options that we consider as we evaluate your programs.

**EMS Billing and Collections Only**
- **Option 1:** percent of net collected dollars – we are not paid until our clients are paid
- **Option 2:** flat fee per processed incident, often including annual CPI adjustments to reflect changes in inflation, employment costs, postage costs, etc.

**Fire Prevention Billing and Collections Only**
- **Option 1:** flat fee per processed incident, often including annual CPI adjustments to reflect changes in inflation, employment costs, postage costs, etc.
- **Option 2:** percent of net collected dollars – we are not paid until our clients are paid. This option is usually offered only in circumstances where the client has a Fire Prevention billing program and an EMS billing program; however, this is negotiable depending on each department's individual programs.

**Patient Surveys**
- **Option 1:** a small percentage is added to our EMS Billing and Collections proposal to cover associated postage and automation costs.
- **Option 2:** a per-processed survey cost is listed as a charge on client monthly statements. This charge is not marked up and is simply a pass-through charge for printing, postage, etc.

![F. Cost Recovery](https://via.placeholder.com/983x768.png?text=F.+Cost+Recovery)

**Workload Accomplishment**  
Our EMS billing and collection success is tied directly to the ratio of PCRs to the number of quality people assigned to your project. We believe that people are the key to our success. Wittman innovates by fully embracing automated and technological advances while wholly recognizing that our quality service is reliant upon our talented people providing you the best level of service. Our approach provides the lowest claims-per-employee-ratio, generally resulting in 10-20% higher collection rates than our competitors.

Wittman Enterprises works from our single location in the Sacramento, California area at 11093 Sun Center Drive, Rancho Cordova, California. All departments are dedicated to the personal attention of our clients and their patients' needs. Our staff is divided into teams to efficiently address workflow processes and are further divided based upon your location. Wittman maintains our industry-leading lowest claims-per-staff-ratio (generally 30% lower than our competitors) based on upholding the standard of practice our clients expect. Through training, forecasting, hiring, and expansion of our EMS partner base, we constantly maintain that staffing ratio of approximately 4,000 claims per staff (compared to approximately 8,000-12,000 or more claims per staff for most of our competitors).

For complete project coordination, Wittman’s Client Liaison team is the conduit from you to our operations. We look forward to meeting with City/Fire personnel to discuss the goals of our business partnership, the services we provide, and any other topics required for the quality performance of EMS/Fire cost recovery on behalf of the City of Santa Monica. Judy Yang (Client Liaison) will be your main point of contact. Please remember too that Russ Harms (Director of Business Development), Corinne Wittman-Wong (CEO), and Walter Imboden (President/CFO) are always available to you and your team.

![Emergency Medical Services](https://www.wittmanenterprises.com)

**Emergency Medical Services**

**Average Collection Rates: Overview (Proprietary and Confidential)**  
Wittman Enterprises has multiple EMS billing clients with multiple different payer mixes varying significantly by city/region/state. Combining them into an overall collection percentage is at best inaccurate and in reality, an unreliable way to gauge collection performance. Consider that gross collection rates may be higher in Eastern States when compared to Southern States, Florida higher to California. Many out-of-state competitors may have some higher gross collection rates because their clients' rates are significantly lower than departments in California (in fact closer to Medicare and Medi-Cal rates). Industry averages for collection rates will be inconsistent considerably because of the variance in contributing factors such as call volume, patient demographics, payer mix, etc. In fact, neighboring departments often have widely different collection rates simply due to differences in payer mix. However, for illustration purposes only, as a group, our Los Angeles County clients average approximately 37% for gross collection percentage and 79% for net collection percentage (net percentage being the more accurate/useful way of evaluating collection percentage). In most ways, the section: “Santa Monica-Area Clients: Average Collected per Transport” (p. 100), shows a more reliable method of evaluating EMS program performance.

**Average Collection Rates: Detail (Proprietary and Confidential)**  
It is important to note that collection rates vary widely between departments due to many factors including patient demographics, payer mix, department fee schedules, other municipality and department policies, and payer allowables. Even so, Wittman Enterprises usually outperforms our competitors by 10-20% in net collections for EMS Partners.

- Out-of-State clients may often show higher gross collection rates because their lower fee schedules more closely align with Medicare, Medi-Cal, and other contracted payers. Consider the following out-of-state client examples from actual Wittman clients.

| Avg. Gross Collection % | Avg. Net Collection % |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Client #1 (redacted)    | 66%                   | 93%                   |
| Client #2 (redacted)    | 57%                   | 85%                   |

- As such, comparing out-of-state collection percentages with California department collection percentages is not really a comprehensive (or accurate) comparison.

- Consider the following survey of varying collection percentages for some of our San Diego County-area departments. Due to the confidential nature of the information, client names have been redacted. We are happy to share an expanded list, if required, under separate cover.

| Avg. Gross Collection % | Avg. Net Collection % |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Client #1               | 30%                   | 78%                   |
| Client #2               | 36%                   | 71%                   |

Fire Recovery Services  
Historically, we perform in the range of 92% to 99% in collection rates for Fire Inspection billing, False Alarm billing, and other services such as Weed Abatement billing. This varies of course by fire department, payer demographics, scope, and the thoroughness of documentation provided to our team for billing purposes. Our benchmark results are evaluated against our largest Fire Prevention Recovery client, Sac Metro CRRD, who averages between 95% and 99% billing collection performance.

G. Information and City Involvement

Wittman Enterprises: Your Complete Billing Department  
Wittman Enterprises provides complete ambulance and fire billing services and conducts effectively a comprehensive range of services associated with your individual billing program(s).

Santa Monica Staff and Provider Scope of Work  
Wittman Enterprises enjoys our regular contact with City and Fire staff for direction on specific accounts, balance adjustments, QA/QI, and other procedures requiring your authorization. Occasionally, when we have exhausted our resources and need help completing missing information, clarifying unclear or incomplete narratives, we may request assistance from our regular City/Fire contacts that are often able to acquire the information from their own resources. However, as your billing partner, Wittman generally does not require additional tasks from City/Fire staff as it is our job to support your billing and reimbursement program.

We are a full-service billing agency that conducts effectively the full range of tasks associated with your ambulance billing. As part of creating and maintaining the most efficient and effective billing system partnership between the provider (City of Santa Monica) and Wittman Enterprises, the following are the basic provider responsibilities generally accepted as current standards of best practice. All programs are customized to meet and exceed the needs of our clients - following as many standards of best practice as practically possible.

- Submit necessary transport information, including pay source information and patient condition, to Wittman Enterprises for billing purposes.
- Forward to Wittman all necessary information relating to patient transport services, payments and patient eligibility.
- Provide clarifications when questions arise regarding documentation.

Request for Changes to Santa Monica-Provisioned Data  
We do not normally anticipate requesting any changes in data collection by the City/EMS Departments, provided we receive the City’s PCRs with appropriate and complete documentation, meeting industry, Medicare, Medi-Cal, HIPAA, and other billing standards and requirements. Over the course of our partnership together we will work with your team closely, developing and maintaining a collaborative process to obtain any missing data needed for proper billing if needed.

**ePCR Interface**  
Wittman provides extensive mapping of information with most ePCR systems to ensure they correctly correspond to our ZOLL billing system. There are no requirements or added cost for an electronic interface with Wittman Enterprises, LLC. We have successful mapping experience with multiple ePCR systems as recognized in the chart below. We encourage you to contact our other clients to discuss not only the seamless ePCR interface; but also to discuss our high levels of service as an EMS/Fire billing company.

**ePCR Uploading Overview**  
We work with each individual client to determine the most effective way to transfer the care reports from their ePCR programs to our ZOLL billing system. The process generally requires minimal input from individual EMS organizations. Currently our system interfaces with 17 clients using Digital EMS.

Our Electronic Billing Team reconciles the NEMSIS file with the batch listed on the ePCR system to detect any inconsistencies. Files are then uploaded to our billing system workflows and processed. We utilize ZOLL's RescueNet billing software and our IT team has worked extensively with ZOLL to ensure that all aspects of our processes operate efficiently with any ePCR system currently in operation. The time-tested process allows seamless integration with the Digital EMS platform or any ePCR program used by the City. Wittman has successfully interfaced with numerous ePCR products for our clients and they are mapped into our ZOLL RescueNet billing program for complete integration and data transfer/delivery.

Request for Proposal  
Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Billing and Collections  

On August 1, 2016, Digital EMS Solutions' ePCR software, the Medic Clipboard, went into operation with the City of Santa Monica Fire Department, and now has over 600,000 medical records uploaded into the system. As part of our services, an integration with Wittman Enterprises was developed to process EMS services that would be reimbursable to the City.  

Today, after working together for nearly six years, this is a nearly seamless process, and yet still provides the capability to be fully audited to ensure there is no lost revenue to the City.  

We could not have done this without the effective partnership of Wittman as they were instrumental in helping us to develop our billing services software from the ground up. Their professionalism, responsiveness, and efficiency have been stellar. They readily share their knowledge of issues affecting billing services such as impending legislation, insurance reimbursement, and compliance management, enabling us to continue to improve the patient care documentation process.  

There has been and continues to be unprecedented changes in the healthcare system that will affect reimbursement of EMS services. In our relationship with Wittman, we feel we have a valued partner who has proven to be effective in handling these challenges.

![Santa Monica Proposed Implementation Schedule](https://via.placeholder.com/768x987.png?text=Santa+Monica+Proposed+Implementation+Schedule)

**Implementation Timeline**

Wittman Enterprises is prepared and qualified to effectively meet all elements described within the Ambulance Billing Services RFP detailed in the Scope of Services sections in accordance with all applicable local, state and federal laws and within the policies of the City of Santa Monica.

If we are fortunate enough to earn your EMS partnership, your transition plan will be customized to meet and exceed your needs and expectations as our experience has shown that no two transitions are the same. Our transition process is built around five key steps that will be facilitated by your Client Liaison, Judy Vang, and the entire Wittman Project Management Team. It is designed to systematically address all required deliverables for a timely and orderly transition: from Medicare, Medi-Cal, and insurance transfer requirements, to the interfacing of all software systems—all leading to the successful go-live date estimated in the timeline and schedule created with you. As your past and future EMS billing and collections partner, Wittman works closely with you during the operational implementation process ensuring a smooth transition. Regular meetings throughout the transition period focus on the items and tasks necessary for our transition partnership. Ongoing communications include conference calls and regular correspondence ensuring we meet required deadlines from your customized schedule so that your EMS program deadlines are met.

As a result of our business model, you will find that many of our processes are customizable to the needs of the City and Fire Department. Through our 30 years of experience, we have learned that each EMS organization functions differently and has unique expectations and needs. We have elected to not advise you how you must change to meet our needs; instead we have chosen to embrace that uniqueness and develop your billing program to meet your requirements and expectations.

**Transition Timeline Estimate**

Our billing system is easily customized and we are able to complete set procedures within 48 hours of award of contract. Wittman Enterprises has significant experience in working out old work from numerous billing systems. We are capable of taking on this task immediately upon award and execution of a contract. Billing private insurance and private pay claims starts immediately and we vigorously attempt to collect on all aging account receivables turned over to us. As part of our regular processes we maintain complete account receivables, payment collection, and balance records on each patient. The countdown to "flipping on the billing switch" is completed in the few milestone steps shown below.

![RFP Requirements (RFP Section 2.4)](https://via.placeholder.com/983x768)

**RFP Requirements (RFP Section 2.4)**

1. Provide all tested and working software, tested, and working hardware, and technical support associated with the billing, receivables process, and debt collections to support up to 9,000 collections for Emergency Medical Services and up to 8,000 Fire Prevention Inspections annually. The billing for medical services shall include, but not be limited to, billing for transport, supplies, fees, and responses to medical facilities. The billing for Prevention related services shall include but not limited to fire inspections, annual fire permits and plans review services. The software and hardware shall ensure complete and uninterrupted back-up with a data recovery system, should a disaster or other unforeseen interruption occur. All software and hardware costs shall be borne by the proposer.

**Acknowledged and Agreed to.**

**Billing Software**

Since 2003 we have utilized ZOLL's RescueNet billing software, and our IT team has worked extensively with ZOLL to ensure that all aspects of our processes operate efficiently with most RMS systems currently in operation (like Digital EMS Solutions, First Due, MobileEyes, etc.).

**Data Recovery Plan**

Our Data Recovery Plan allows Wittman to continue conducting our clients' business until recovery from an unforeseen disaster or emergency is accomplished. It identifies how we would stay in touch with our clients and with each other, continuing to do our work. The plan 1) documents key personnel and backups, 2) identifies those who can telecommute, 3) documents critical equipment and appropriate off-site backups, 4) identifies critical documents, and 5) identifies contingency equipment options and locations.

Utilizing Veritas Backup Exec software, our electronic computing and storage capabilities are backed up redundantly by a Dell Power Vault 124T with 24 terabytes of storage capacity. Wittman's network consists of a redundant Raid Ten Array Network Attached Storage, running on two Dell R720 Dual Processor eight core servers on Windows 2012 Server in an active/passive cluster mode. Wittman uses Rescue Net Billing by ZOLL Data Systems. In the event of a catastrophic event, the software is readily available for us to replace. As an added precaution, all backup and system programs are kept offline. To minimize any potential down time Wittman contracts with Dell Computers for a maximum 4-hour service response time on all of our billing servers. In case of an interruption in Santa Monica's (or Wittman's) ability to transmit or receive ePCRs electronically we maintain the ability to receive information through our secured FTP site. Our Ipswitch Secure FTP server is the industry-leader in FTP security. Highlights of this system include:

- Security: Encrypted transfer over SSH/SFTP, SSL/FTPS, and HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- Powerful management administrative control and enforcement
- Automation: Server events can generate alerts and launch workflows
- Compliance: Exceeds stringent security and privacy requirements for secure file transfer
- Ad hoc and schedule interaction: Supports impromptu as well as predefined transfers by people, systems, and processes

- An $800,000 line of credit is available to us for the purchase of necessary equipment, software, and supplies. Regular reviews of the plan and other emergency plans are conducted to ensure current and workable solutions.

For all accounts that are provided to Wittman via the Digital EMS or any other ePCR system, all customer contacts including notices, mailing, itemizations, and other clearly identified steps will be the sole responsibility of us as part of our services to you.

**Key Personnel**

**Organization**  
Our staff is divided among four departments: Customer Service (60); Cash Receipts (20); Support Services/Electronic Billing (10); Data Entry (40). All departments are dedicated to the personal attention of our clients and their patients' needs. Our staff is divided into teams to efficiently address workflow processes and are further divided based on your location. The teams assigned to the City of Santa Monica project are the same teams that service the cities and departments of our Los Angeles, California-Area. The Southern California “pod” has a Pod leader and a team of three to five who scrutinize all individual submitted runs and initiate the billing process. The pod begins their work after our Electronic Claims Department imports ePCR files and our system automatically scrubs the data before it goes to our Billing Department. This personal attention makes the difference between collecting the “easy” money and pursuing difficult payment situations for maximum legal reimbursement.

![Maintaining our Dynamic Workforce](https://via.placeholder.com/768x987.png?text=Maintaining+our+Dynamic+Workforce)

### Maintaining our Dynamic Workforce
As we discuss in “Workload Accomplishment” (page 10), Wittman Enterprises maintains the lowest claims-per-employee ratio in the industry. Our competitors work with nearly 30% less staff than we do per claim (effectively assigning 30% more work to each of their employees) and collect less for their billing clients. By maintaining our 4,000 to 5,000 claims-per-staff-ratio, we are able to take on significant new growth without necessarily hiring any staff. Should that ratio approach and/or exceed our standard range, we hire and train staff proactively to ensure we are never operating outside of our expected customer satisfaction standards and collected revenue expectations.

### Staff Availability
All Wittman staff is available in our single Sacramento-Area office during our normal business hours.

**Quality Assurance**

**Auditing**  
In addition to continuous training and quality control protocols, we perform audits continuously with seven independent auditors and a supervisor located in our office. They perform various audits including pre-billed claims, submitted claims, denied claims, etc. Wittman’s internal auditing program scrutinizes all of our work to ensure records are not missing, minimum content criteria is preset, fee schedules are accurate and applied correctly, billing codes are appropriate and itemized charges are captured. Our auditing team reviews thoroughly a minimum 10% of the work that each employee completes during the week. Auditors randomly select accounts for audit based on production reports from the previous week. Our meticulous efforts are designed to ensure compliance (whether we are billing Medicare, Medi-Cal, private insurance, or patients) focusing on every step from initial billing, account follow up, and the posting of payments. Additionally, we audit charges, credits, level of service, schedules, payers, customer service quality and thoroughness, and provide key feedback to customer service representatives and management staff. Each Wittman Enterprises department is evaluated from their own specific auditing form in regards to job functions and their effectiveness at meeting quality, compliance and productivity standards. If any anomalies are identified through our auditing efforts, we devote the necessary resources to pinpoint areas for improvement and revise protocols, retrain staff, and test solutions to avoid future refrains. Finally, all new hire staff are continually audited until their audits regularly reach a consistent 95% success rate. Positive audit results are linked directly to our strong procedures and processes, training, and form our rigorous internal auditing program.

In our 30 years in business Wittman Enterprises, LLC has never received a negative external audit. We keep accurate and up-to-date records of all bills, payments, and correspondence related to billing functions to ensure a positive outcome to any audit and encourage the City, Fire Department, and its authorized agents to inspect and audit all data and records relating to our performance under the contract. Wittman Enterprises is always at your disposal during any audit procedure, ensuring immediate compliance with request for information.

**Wittman Enterprises Training Program: New Hires**  
Our comprehensive and ongoing training program allows us to continuously improve the way we conduct our clients’ business and get you your maximum legal reimbursement available. Initial Training Employees begin with a minimum of four weeks training on general concepts required of their position including: our computerized billing system, office and position procedures, ambulance billing rules and regulations, identifying key payers, medical billing best practices, HIPAA, industry standards, customer service, billing Medicare, Medi-Cal, and private insurance. Trainees are not advanced in the training program until they have shown competence in all required areas. If they are unable to show the required competence our clients expect from us, employees are provided extra training opportunities and/or dismissed if necessary.

**Secondary Training**  
The next phase of training runs for at least four weeks, emphasizing the practical portion of the employee’s job and preparing them to conduct their position under direct supervision. At this point in the training the employees “shadow” senior staff as they apply what they have learned in their first four weeks of training. More specialized concepts such as “ALS” and “BLS” are introduced and mastered along with workflow management (organizing and prioritizing), ambulance coding, data entry, translating common industry abbreviations, and working with first responder companies. There is significantly more hands-on training in this section than in the initial training period.

100% Auditing and Training  
After successfully completing the first eight weeks of training, staff operates independently under direct supervision. During this time, new employees and their work product are 100% audited until the employee exceeds a minimum of 90% error-free performance consistently. Regular one-on-one meetings and training sessions are conducted as needed to assure the minimum amount of human error. After this, our auditing team routinely and randomly audits between 10% and 20% of our staff and their work on a weekly basis.

Specialist Program  
We develop our long-term and talented staff by expending considerable resources on training and continuous improvement of our employees. Experienced staff demonstrating aptitude toward specialty areas of our work are identified and placed in multiple-function-training to prepare them to work on several teams and continuously expand their knowledge and experience base.

In addition to our internal training program, Wittman Enterprises is proud to offer staff members which have been certified by the National Academy of Ambulance Coding, a nationally recognized leader in Certified Ambulance Coding Training. Wittman Enterprises employs and provides regular training for Certified Ambulance Coders (“CACs”).

![Continuous Improvement](https://via.placeholder.com/984x768.png?text=Continuous+Improvement)

**Continuous Improvement**  
We view quality assurance as our opportunity to verify that our services regularly meet and exceed our EMS partner expectations. Our internal program follows the Shewhart Cycle’s five steps: Observe, Plan, Do, Check, and Act, to ensure that our professional excellence is inherent in every part of our billing process for our clients. Monitoring KPIs, conducting multiple audits, providing ongoing staff training, and holding regular training meetings (with case studies and more formal training opportunities) helps each of our teams continuously improve the way we conduct our clients’ business.

**Key Performance Indicators**  
Tracking and examining accounts receivable, and Payment Average (revenue) are useful tools helping us judge how “quickly” and efficiently we are getting our clients their maximum and legal reimbursements. This doesn’t work as well as a snapshot in time but rather as a comparison tool from period to period. Additionally, A/R Days are monitored regularly to ensure the most consistent and effective results possible, analyzing how long it takes from the billing date to when we receive payment on your behalf. In this example, the account’s A/R Days are calculated by:

- Getting the Average Charge per Day: last 3 months charges divided by the number of days in those 3 months;

| Month     | February | March     | April     | Total Charges for 3 Months | # of Days in this 3 Month Period |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Amount    | $486,938 | $529,350  | $490,601  | $1,506,889                  | 92                                |

- Dividing the A/R Balance by the Average Daily Charge, giving us how many days of charges are outstanding.

| Average Charge per Day | A/R Balance | A/R Days |
|------------------------|-------------|----------|
| $16,379.23            | $1,022,531  | 62       |

When the work is being managed appropriately your outstanding A/R should not usually be more than three months of charges. Much of this key information will be provided in your Year-to-Date Revenue Report along with several other Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Additionally, our operations director uses department KPIs to analyze trends, performance, and to address any anomalies before they become issues.

**Billing Department**  
- Trending of Transports  
- Month-End Report Comparisons and Reconciliations  

**Cash Receipts Department**  
- Payments monitored for timeliness and unusual trends  
- Refunds Trending  

**Customer Service Department Workflow Timeliness**  
- Hospital Data Exchange  
- Private Mail  
- Missing or incorrect phone numbers  
- Mail Returns  
- Medicare Signatures

P153
<!-- Page 154 -->
![Section 5.0 - Company Qualifications](https://via.placeholder.com/768x986.png?text=Section+5.0+-+Company+Qualifications)

**Statement of Qualifications**  
Wittman Enterprises has customized service innovations to our partners in the EMS transport industry since 1991. Currently serving 22 Los Angeles County public agency clients (110 in California - 138 total), we have extensive experience and specialize in the invoicing, categorizing, recording, monitoring, supervising, and managing of ambulance billing and EMS cost recovery systems and services. We bill approximately 600,000 claims annually and collect more than $300,000,000 each year for our clients. Wittman brings over 30 years of EMS/Fire billing experience to you, and to your neighboring communities, helping each of our individual partners to reach and exceed their individual and customized program objectives: Beverly Hills, UCLA, Culver City, West Covina, La Habra Heights, Loma Linda, San Gabriel, Burbank, Glendale, Pasadena, Sierra Madre, Arcadia, San Marino, South Pasadena, Alhambra, Monterey Park, Downey, El Segundo, Hermosa Beach, La Verne, Montclair, and most recently - Torrance.

**California Strong**  
We do not believe that any California-based biller will provide as much in actual reimbursement or complete customer service as Wittman Enterprises has historically demonstrated. We have a proven record of collecting 10-20% more than our competitors. Out-of-state billing companies will not be able to arrive at these reimbursements either, due to their lack of billing and collection experience in the State of California and experience with the multitude of California payers.

**California Support: GEMT/QAF/IGT/PPGIT (AB 1705)**  
During the complicated design and implementation of the California GEMT program, Wittman Enterprises provided leadership and support for our clients throughout the process, working closely with the architects of the program (Chief Clough with Sac Metro, etc.), providing multiple training opportunities for our clients and designing reports specifically related to the information needed when applying for GEMT funds. This industry support is part of the hands-on customer service and resources we provide all of our California clients for IGT; GEMT (2011); GEMT QAF (2017); and now PPGIT (AB 1705, 2019).

**IGT: The transfer of funds from another government entity (e.g., County, City, or other State agency) to Medi-Cal.**  
- We support participating clients with their Letters of Intent for the DHCS.  
- We provide reports to help clients calculate how much money can be reimbursed to the providers (the maximum allowable for IGT).  
- We provide reports for client submissions to the program and distribution of available IGT funds in their area.

**GEMT: The supplemental Medi-Cal reimbursement program was enacted October 2, 2011.**  
- We worked with our numerous California clients and the State, providing transport numbers and calculations to them as they worked on their cost data sheets.  
- We directly supported four of the six initial program test cities/departments for GEMT (City of Rialto; County of San Bernardino; Sacramento Metro Fire; and, Cosumnes Community Service District - all Wittman clients).

<!-- Page 155 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x986.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

- After the bill passed (AB 678) and became GEMT officially, we worked closely with our California clients through the set-up process: attending State-sponsored GEMT instruction meetings; helping provide rough projections of potential GEMT income based on Medi-Cal transport information; sponsored a webinar where Chief Scott Clough answered the most frequently asked questions from our clients about the GEMT.
  
- We set up a section of our website for easy-to-find links and references associated with the GEMT program.

- We provided customized GEMT reports for participating clients as they filled out their required cost reports.

- We fielded calls with clients with questions regarding the cost reports and how to use the Wittman reports to help them complete the GEMT cost reports.

- We provided regular email, website, and phone call updates reminding clients when their reports were/are due and providing them their customized transport reports.

**GEMT QAF:** The program that allowed DHCS to establish the GEMT Quality Assurance Fee (QAF) Program to provide supplemental Medi-Cal payments to GEMT providers.

- We provided our clients with similar resources employed for GEMT setup and rollout.

- We customized their required reports to provide total GEMT transports, total GEMT revenue.

- We continue to provide regular emails, phone calls, and webinars reminding clients when their reports are due, providing them with our regular support and required transport and revenue reports.

**PPIGT:** The newest program that could replace GEMT and GEMT QAF for public agencies.

- Signed into law in 2019.

- As the program rolls out, we will provide our clients with regular updates regarding deadlines, helpful resources and weblinks, required deliverables, due dates, and reporting requirements.

Please refer to “Sample GEMT/IGT/QAF Reporting” (p. 74) for examples of specialized reporting for special government payment programs.

As a single California location leader in EMS/Fire billing, we encourage you to contact any of our references including any of our clients that may not be listed for this proposal. We know that hearing about their experiences with Wittman Enterprises will differentiate us from our competition. Wittman is eager to begin providing top-notch service to the City of Santa Monica and nurture a strong working partnership. Please contact them directly to hear about their transition/startup and performance satisfaction with Wittman Enterprises. Letters of Recommendation from some of them are found in the following pages. A recent email from the EMS Coordinator at Rialto spells out the differences in what we bring to our EMS/Fire partners: "It is a pleasure working with everyone over at Wittman. We have used the revenue you fine folks have worked very hard to get for us to save lives in this city. We have one of the highest ROSC rates in the world and it takes money to make that happen. Everyone over there should be proud of what you do."

To Whom It May Concern:

It is my honor to provide a letter of recommendation for Wittman Enterprises, LLC. In October 2018 Anaheim Fire & Rescue released a Request for Proposals (RFP) of our Emergency Medical Services cost recovery billing. As a result of the RFP, AF&R selected Wittman Enterprises.

Wittman was selected for their depth of experience with the Orange County EMS system and their knowledge of local insurance payers and California regulations. The staff at Wittman were reliable, informative and helpful as our department transitioned to the use of their staff for our EMS cost recovery billing.

In addition to working closely during the transition, Wittman has continued with a high level of support, professionalism, EMS billing knowledge and exemplary customer service as our partnership continues.

It is without hesitation that I provide my support and recommendation for Wittman Enterprises, LLC. Please feel free to contact me with any questions at (714) 765-4001.

Regards,  
Pat Russell, Fire Chief

To whom it may concern:  

Please accept this letter of recommendation on behalf of Witman Enterprises, LLC.  

The Sacramento Fire Department transitioned to Witman last year after nearly 25 years with the same biller. Witman won the bid after a competitive process and almost instantly, the level of customer service drastically improved. It was apparent that they were a true partner and extension of our agency, rather than just a basic client.  

One of the things I appreciate most in our partnership with Witman is their level of responsiveness and attention to detail. Over the last eighteen months, I have requested data and documentation for time sensitive requests. In every situation, the request met or exceeded the timeframe and the level of detail was impressive. It is this type of relationship that we were missing and now truly enjoy.  

The staff at Witman have also assisted us in improving our billing flow and process. The results have been an improved level of reimbursement with massive improvements in efficiency. This has allowed us to free up employees formerly tasked with billing duties to do other essential duties. In a time where departments are constantly tasked to do more work without additional personnel, having the ability to utilize staff in other areas was fantastic.  

Maximizing our cost recovery is essential to the continued existence of our ambulance program. I can confidently say that the staff at Witman is committed to assisting our agency with achieving this task. They met with us and dissected every step of our process and offered recommendations that have proven to be extremely wise and financially sound. The team works hard to maximize collections through excellent customer service, process review and consistency.  

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or require additional information.

Subject: RECOMMENDATION FOR WITTMAN ENTERPRISES LLC  

It is my pleasure to provide a summary of our experience with Russ Harms and the whole team at Wittman Enterprises LLC (Wittman).

In 2018 our City engaged in an RFP process for EMS Ambulance Billing Services and related technology to support efficient collection of transport revenue. This was a complex RFP which included the following major components:

- Transition of billing services from the current vendor to Wittman in less than 30 calendar days.
- 3rd party project management vendor to implement the various suite of associated technology products.
- 3rd party information technology company that would be engaged to configure, deploy and service field hardware through the life of the Contract.
- Configuration, training and implementation of a new ePCR system within six months of contract signing.
- Trial testing, selection, purchase, imaging, and deployment of 45 Panasonic Toughbook CF-20s to the field.
- Managing the equipment selection, purchase and installation through a 3rd party vendor of onboard mobile gateways to support wireless field operations in 25 fire and EMS apparatus.
- Working in partnership with the City of Berkeley IT department to select and configure a computer storage cart and network switch that would provide our external IT partner network access to monitor and service the CF-20s when they were returned to storage.

- Working in partnership with the City of Berkeley IT department to select and image 25 iPhones for fire and EMS apparatus.

Wittman was selected as the most responsible vendor and started billing operations for the City of Berkeley on January 1st, 2019. From January through June Wittman has been a steadfast and reliable partner for the design, configuration, training and deployment of the aforementioned projects.

Their professionalism, attention to detail, fiscal responsibility and selection of top notch 3rd party partners made it possible to meet all our very aggressive implementation deadlines, remain under budget and have some fun while we were moving a mile a minute!

I cannot recommend this organization more. If you should require any additional details, please call or email me anytime.

Sincerely,

**Project Understanding (Proprietary and Confidential)**  
With more than 30 years of EMS and Fire Prevention Recovery billing experience, Wittman Enterprises fully understands the City of Santa Monica/City of Santa Monica Fire Department's overall project and required approaches to their billing programs. We have substantial experience with California City/Fire Department ambulance and fire recovery billing program startups like yours at Santa Monica. We coordinate all new program requirements to successfully bill and collect from Medicare, Medi-Cal, VA, Private Insurance, patients, business owners, and all other eligible payers. Startup partnerships over the years include Anaheim, Chula Vista, Costa Mesa, CSA 17 (Del Mar, Del Mar Heights, Solana Beach, Encinitas, Rancho Santa Fe), El Dorado County, Fountain Valley, Fullerton, Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage, Sacramento Metro, Torrance, and West Covina.

Based on your program's scope and our experience with new California program transitions, we do not see any potential risks that would delay your project: Fire Prevention billing (starting 7/1/2022) and EMS Billing (starting 2/1/2023). Please see our comprehensive implementation schedule proposal detailed in the “Santa Monica Proposed Implementation Schedule” (p. 39-42).

**Cost Statement**  
Please keep in mind that we are committed to competitive fees for our clients; however, we are not typically the cheapest. As part of our business model, we have chosen to charge our clients a fair market rate that allows us to maintain a superior level of service with a staffing level that provides both exceptional collection results and unmatched customer service. Reducing fees to "beat" the competition would mean that we cannot provide the level of customer service and performance on which our company is built. Wittman Enterprises generally outperforms our competitors by 10-20% in net collections to our clients' bottom line. We will collect more for you than our competitors using our 30-year commitment to putting the right people to the task, doing the job thoroughly and doing it the right way, and at the same time providing the best in client and patient services.

**CERTIFICATION REGARDING DEBARMENT, SUSPENSION, PROPOSED DEBARMENT, AND OTHER RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS**

This certification must be completed for your proposal to be considered.

The undersigned certifies, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, that:

1) The Bidder and/or any of its Principals, contractors, subcontractors and sub recipients are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of or voluntarily excluded from participating in contracts by any Federal agency and are not presently on the System for Award Management (SAM) or being considered for the SAM or ineligible to work on contracts for violations of California Labor Code Sections 1777.1 or 1777.7;

2) “Principals,” for the purpose of this certification, means officer; directors; owners; partners; and, persons having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment, and similar position);

3) The Bidder also certifies that if awarded a contract it shall provide immediate written notice to the City of Santa Monica if, at any time, the Bidder learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances;

4) A certification that any of the items in this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Bidder’s responsibility. Failure of the Bidder to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by City of Santa Monica may render the Bidder non-responsive;

5) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by this provision. The knowledge and information of an Bidder is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings; and

6) The certification of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Bidder knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the City, the City of Santa Monica may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default and pursue any other available legal remedies.

CITY OF SANTA MONICA  
OAKS INITIATIVE NOTICE  

NOTICE TO APPLICANTS, BIDDERS, PROPOSERS  
AND OTHERS SEEKING DISCRETIONARY PERMITS, CONTRACTS,  
OR OTHER BENEFITS FROM THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA  

Santa Monica's voters adopted a City Charter amendment commonly known as the Oaks Initiative. The Oaks Initiative requires the City to provide this notice and information about the Initiative's requirements. You may obtain a full copy of the Initiative's text from the City Clerk.  

This information is required by City Charter Article XXII—Taxpayer Protection. It prohibits a public official from receiving, and a person or entity from conferring, specified personal benefits or campaign advantages from a person or entity after the official votes, or otherwise takes official action, to award a "public benefit" to that person or entity. The prohibition applies within and outside of the geographical boundaries of Santa Monica.  

All persons or entities applying for or receiving public benefits from the City of Santa Monica shall provide the names of trustees, directors, partners, and officers, and names of persons with more than a 10% equity, participation or revenue interest. An exception exists for persons serving in those capacities as volunteers, without compensation, for organizations exempt from income taxes under Section 501(c)(3), (4), or (6), of the Internal Revenue Code. However, this exception does not apply if the organization is a political committee or controls political committees. Examples of a "public benefit" include public contracts to provide goods or services worth more than $25,000 or a land use approval worth more than $25,000 over a 12-month period.  

In order to facilitate compliance with the requirements of the Oaks Initiative, the City compiles and maintains certain information. That information includes the name of any person or persons who is seeking a "public benefit." If the "public benefit" is sought by an entity, rather than an individual person, the information includes the name of every person who is: (a) trustee, (b) director, (c) partner, (d) officer, or has (e) more than a ten percent interest in the entity. Therefore, if you are seeking a "public benefit" covered by the Oaks Initiative, you must supply that information on the Oaks Initiative Disclosure Form. This information must be updated and supplied every 12 months.

Appendix 2 – Exceptions  
Other than as noted below, we have not exceptions to the Sample CSA at this time. Respectfully, we request the right to discuss any other issues or non-applicable section discussions that may arise during contract negotiations between the City's attorney and ours.

- Indemnification: We believe that all contracted parties are allowed the privilege of reasonable indemnification and feel that this section of the Sample CSA may not provide Wittman Enterprises similar projection Sections 10.1 and 10.2. For example, it is possible that we might erroneously bill a claim based on information provided to us by the City and yet be held liable for such an erroneous claim. We feel that this is a point where constructive negotiation and discussion may be a reasonable request for both parties during contract negotiations.

**Privacy And Security Compliance**  
With the recent national news that a national ambulance billing company experienced a breach of their security protocols, resulting in the unauthorized attainment and alleged disclosure of HIPAA protected personal patient information, Wittman Enterprises would like to reassure our valued EMS partners that as a matter of practice we exceed current HIPAA regulation requirements and take every possible precaution to maintain the integrity of private health information.

**HIPAA Compliance**  
Our HIPAA compliance program was designed and audited by David Nevins, former President of the California Ambulance Association, and member of the American Ambulance Association Reimbursement Committee. Additionally, we ensure compliance with local and state laws by continually educating ourselves on any changes or differences that may apply. As a matter of policy, Wittman Enterprises, LLC stays current with any program updates to Medicare and Medi-Cal. Therefore, we pledge to remain responsible and knowledgeable regarding any program updates to Medicare and Medi-Cal for the duration of the contract period. Wittman recognizes the confidential nature of the City’s patient accounts and agrees not to disclose any HIPAA-restricted, protected health information, and to maintain the integrity of transmitted health information transmitted for billing purposes. We also follow carefully the Federal Trade Commission’s rules on identity privacy, “Red Flag Rules,” which require we maintain strict controls aimed at preventing identity theft.

**HIPAA-Required Safeguards for Health Information**  
- Your billing associate “agrees to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of e-PHI that it creates, receives, maintains, or transmits on behalf of” you.
- They must “alert [you] of any security incident (as defined by HIPAA Security Rule) of which it becomes aware and the steps it has taken to mitigate any potential security compromise that may have occurred and to provide a report to [you] of any loss of data or other information system compromise as a result of an incident.”
- The Minimum Necessary rule is the basis of HIPAA. It deals with the access of Protected Health Information (PHI) and requires that an employee only have access to the amount of PHI that is needed for them to get their job done as outlined in their regular job description.

**Exceeding HIPAA Safeguard Requirements**  
Wittman Enterprises, LLC has developed a fraud and abuse compliance program to be a comprehensive statement of the responsibilities and obligations of all employees regarding submissions for reimbursement to Medicare, Medi-Cal, and other government payers for services rendered by clients of Wittman Enterprises, LLC. We have established, and regularly maintain, control standards and procedures to ensure that private information remains secure.

- **Medical Information, Collection for Direct Marketing Purposes - Civil Code section 1798.91**  
  A business may not orally or in writing request medical information directly from an individual regardless of whether the information pertains to the individual or not, and use, share, or otherwise disclose that information for direct marketing purposes, without the consent of that patient.

- **Medical Information Confidentiality - Civil Code sections 56-56.37**  
  No provider of health care, health care service plan, or contractor shall disclose medical information regarding a patient of the provider of health care or an enrollee or subscriber of a health care service plan without first obtaining authorization, except if order by a court, board commission or agency for purposes of adjudication, or by subpoena.

- **Patient Access to Health Records - Health & Safety Code section 123110**  
  It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this chapter to establish procedures for providing access to health care records or summaries of those records by patients and by those persons having responsibility for decisions respecting the health care of others. Every person having ultimate responsibility for decisions respecting his or her own health care also possesses a concomitant right of access to complete information respecting his or her condition and care provided.

**Wittman Enterprises Privacy Policies**

**Responsibility of Managers**  
It is the responsibility of each manager to ensure that activities in his/her area of responsibility are conducted in accordance with Wittman’s compliance policies.

**Employee Education**  
Wittman Enterprises provides employees rigorous, initial and regular training necessary and appropriate to ensure material compliance with applicable laws.

**Employee/Vendor Screening**  
It is our policy to make reasonable inquiry into the background of prospective employees and vendors. Determinations are made as to whether they have been (a) convicted of a criminal offense related to healthcare; or (b) listed by a federal agency as debarred, excluded or otherwise ineligible for federal program participation. Wittman Enterprises reviews the DHHS/OIG cumulative sanction report accessed on the World Wide Web at IGNet, the web site of the Federal Inspector General.

**Monitoring and Auditing**  
Wittman Enterprises, LLC has adopted an audit policy to assist in its efforts to monitor the accuracy of claims and the security of PHI. We devote such resources as are reasonably necessary to ensure that audits are (1) adequately staffed; (2) by persons with appropriate knowledge and experience to conduct the audits; (3) utilizing audit tools and protocol which are periodically updated to reflect changes in applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, we routinely audit employee desk and cubicles to ensure that PHI is being disposed of and/or stored in adherence to company policy. Cell phones and other electronic devices capable of recording or taking pictures are prohibited on the work floor.

![Physical Storage Security](https://via.placeholder.com/768x988.png?text=Physical+Storage+Security)

- Stored files are accessible to authorized clerical personnel, supervisors, and upper management only.

**Internal Use**  
Wittman’s Privacy Officer is responsible for identifying those persons or categories of persons in our workforce who need access to PHI to carry out their duties, and shall, for each such person or class:  
- Identify the category or categories of PHI to which access is needed in order for the persons or class to carry out their duties; and  
- Identify any conditions that should apply to each person’s or class’ access to PHI.  

- Approved personnel shall only have access to PHI when they are on duty. Each department is responsible for overseeing and making reasonable efforts to ensure that personnel under its supervision only obtain access to the limited type of PHI that is required to carry out their duties.  
- All requests from any department for changes in access to PHI by its personnel shall be directed to the Privacy Officer for approval.  

**Routine Disclosure to Third Parties**  
For disclosures that Wittman Enterprises makes on a routine, recurring basis, we may use protocols to limit the PHI disclosed to the Minimum Necessary to achieve the purpose of the disclosure. The Privacy Officer is responsible for ensuring that all departments and functions within the Organization identify disclosures of PHI that they make on a routine, recurring basis. The Privacy Office is responsible for assisting each applicable department to create standard protocols to be applied to reasonably ensure that routine disclosures only include the Minimum Necessary PHI. Protocols under this section must address the following:  
- The protocol must set forth the type of PHI that can be disclosed.  
- The protocol must identify the types or categories of persons to whom the PHI identified in the protocol can be disclosed.  
- The protocol must identify any applicable conditions to providing the disclosure.  

**Non-Routine Disclosure to Third Parties**  
All disclosures that are not routine and recurring must be reviewed on an individual basis in accordance with this section. The Privacy Officer, together with the compliance committee, shall be responsible for developing criteria to be applied to analyze non-routine disclosures to determine the Minimum Necessary PHI that can appropriately be disclosed. All non-routine disclosures must be forwarded to the Privacy Officer for review and approval prior to making the disclosure. The Privacy Officer shall be responsible for reviewing each such non-routine disclosure and determining the Minimum Necessary PHI that can be included in the disclosure. Finally, the PHI requested for disclosure by the following entities shall be deemed to be the Minimum Necessary for the stated purpose and do not require individual review by the Privacy Officer:  
- Disclosures to a public official in accordance with applicable law, if the public official represents that the information requested is the Minimum Necessary;  
- The information is requested by another Health Care Provider, Health Plan, or Health Care Clearinghouse;  
- The information is requested by a professional who is a member of Wittman’s workforce or is a Business Associate of Wittman Enterprises for the purpose of providing professional services to the Organization, if the professional represents that the information requested is the Minimum Necessary for the stated purpose(s); or  
- A person is requesting PHI for research purposes and he or she has complied with the Organization’s policy on research and provides documentation to that effect.

In the event a workforce member believes that a request for a disclosure involving PHI from a person or entity is not the Minimum Necessary, such workforce member must raise his or her concerns with the Privacy Officer. The Officer is responsible for evaluating such requests for disclosure and determining whether it is reasonable for Wittman Enterprises to rely on such request.

**DATE:** May 23, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** FY 2023/24 Midyear Budget Resolution Correction for General Operating Fund 212A  

**TOPIC**  
Adoption of a new resolution to replace Midyear Budget Resolution 2024-068, passed on March 14, 2024, and containing a minor clerical error.  

**BACKGROUND**  
On March 14, 2024, the Board adopted individual Midyear Budget resolutions for each of the District's Funds. One of the resolutions, Resolution 2024-068, adopted the 2023/24 Midyear Budget for the General Operating Fund 212A and contained a clerical error.  

Specifically, the resolution contained a line item for operating transfer from the Pension Obligation Bond Fund 212E to the General Operating Fund 212A, which was listed as a negative $657, indicating a decrease in funding. That amount should have been listed as a positive $657 indicating an increase in transfer in accordance with the schedules included in the Midyear Budget document. The Sacramento County accounting office has required that a new board resolution be adopted.  

| Fund  | Account Category                | Increase (Decrease) |  
|-------|----------------------------------|---------------------|  
| 212A  | Salaries & employee benefits     | $2,030,959          | $2,030,959          |

Fire Chief  

**DATE:** May 23, 2024  

**TO:** Board of Directors, Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District  

**SUBJECT:** Consider Adoption of FY2021 Fire Prevention and Safety Grant Amendment  

---

**BACKGROUND**  
On February 18, 2022, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) submitted an application for funding totaling $86,850 through the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) FY2021 AFG Fire Prevention and Safety Grant Program (FP&S) to conduct a comprehensive Home Fire and Life Safety Campaign. The goal of the proposed program is to enhance the safety of the community by reducing overall loss, injury, and death due to residential fires and fire-related hazards within the targeted communities.  

**DISCUSSION**  
On March 27, 2024, staff requested an amendment to the project's scope of work and budget to fine tune the focus of the safety campaign. The proposed program will still achieve the original goal of conducting home risk assessments to determine necessary fire and life safety mitigation measures, equipping homes with operational smoke and carbon monoxide alarms and other necessary alerting/notification devices, and deliver fire and life safety education to residents in targeted communities.  

On April 29, 2024, the District received FEMA approval for the amendment, which will increase labor costs for staff overtime, procure additional fire safety supplies, and remove costs for equipment no longer needed.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
There is no fiscal impact as the grant award amount is already in the FY2023/24 Midyear Budget. There are only changes within the budget categories.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends adoption of the attached budget adjustments.

**TO:** Board of Directors, Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District  

**SUBJECT:** Other Post-Employment Benefit (OPEB) Actuarial Valuation Report as of June 30, 2023, with Actuarially-Determined Contributions for Fiscal Years Ending June 30, 2025 and 2026  

**TOPIC**  
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) provides benefits to its retirees in the form of medical coverage and other benefits not covered by a pension plan. With that obligation, the District must file certain accounting reports and determine if benefits will be sufficiently funded and available when needed. The Other Post-Employment Benefit (OPEB) Actuarial Valuation Report as of June 30, 2023 valuation date provides that funding determination and is now ready for presentation to the Board for review and acceptance. This report is prepared biennially by the District's actuary, Macleod Watts.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The OPEB actuarial valuation is prepared for the purposes of determining contribution levels for prefunding the plan, providing information needed for California Employees' Benefit Trust (CERBT) contributions, and disclosing certain information needed for accounting reports. The report considers the obligations of the District, including explicit subsidies (District contributions towards healthcare) and implicit subsidies (contributions from active employees to subsidize current retirees' OPEB coverage).  

The OPEB Actuarial Valuation presented concludes that the District's net position, or share of assets over liabilities is expected to reach 17.8% by June 30, 2024, down from 24.5% reported on June 30, 2023. This decrease in the funded level is largely due to market performance.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
There is no direct fiscal impact of accepting the report. The contribution amount in the actuarial report will be included in the Fiscal Year 2024/25 Preliminary Budget.

Re: Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District Other Post-Employment Benefits Actuarial Valuation and GASB 75 Report for Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2024  

Dear Mr. O'Toole:

We are pleased to enclose our actuarial report providing financial information about the other post-employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District. The report’s text describes our analysis and assumptions in detail.

The primary purposes of this report are to:

1) Remeasure plan liabilities as of June 30, 2023, in accordance with GASB 75’s biennial valuation requirement,  
2) Develop Actuarially Determined Contributions levels for prefunding plan benefits,  
3) Provide information to be submitted to the California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust (CERBT) to satisfy filing requirements for the trust, and  
4) Provide information required by GASB 75 (“Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pension”) to be reported in the District’s financial statements for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.  

We applied the methodology outlined in GASB 75 to develop the discount rate to calculate the liability shown in this report, based on recent prior and upcoming planned contribution levels. We assume that trust assets will remain invested in CERBT Asset Strategy. We based the valuation on the employee data, details on plan benefits and retiree benefit payments reported to us by the District. Please review our summary of this information to ensure it is consistent with your records. Note that contributions and payroll for fiscal year 2023/24 shown in this report are estimates and should be updated once final amounts are known after the close of the year.

We appreciate the opportunity to work on this analysis and acknowledge the efforts of District staff who provided valuable time and information to enable us to prepare this report. Please let us know if we can be of further assistance.

Sincerely,

Catherine L. MacLeod, FSA, FCA, EA, MAAA

**June 30, 2023, Actuarial Valuation and GASB 75 Report for Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2024**

**A. Executive Summary**

This report presents the results of the June 30, 2023, actuarial valuation and accounting information regarding the other post-employment benefit (OPEB) program of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (the District). The purposes of this report are to: 1) summarize the results of the valuation; 2) develop Actuarially Determined Contribution (ADC) levels for prefunding plan benefits; 3) provide information required by the California Employers' Retiree Benefit Trust (CERBT); and 4) provide disclosure information as required by Statement No. 75 of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB 75) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.

Important background information regarding the valuation process can be found in Appendix 2. We recommend users of the report read this information to familiarize themselves with the process and context of actuarial valuations, including the requirements of GASB 75. The pages following this executive summary present exhibits and other information relevant for disclosures under GASB 75.

Results of the June 30, 2023, valuation may be applied to prepare the District’s GASB 75 report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. If there are any significant changes in plan members, plan benefits or eligibility and/or OPEB funding policy, however, an earlier valuation may be required or appropriate.

**OPEB Obligations of the District**

The District offers continuation of medical coverage to retiring employees. This benefit creates one or more of the following types of OPEB liabilities:

- **Explicit subsidy liabilities:** An “explicit subsidy” exists when the employer contributes directly toward the cost of retiree healthcare. In this program, the District contributes a portion of medical premiums for qualifying retirees. See Supporting Information Section 2 for details.

- **Implicit subsidy liabilities:** An “implicit subsidy” exists when premiums are developed using blended active and retiree claims experience. In this situation, premiums charged for retirees may not be sufficient to cover expected medical and life insurance claims¹ and the premiums charged for active employees are said to “implicitly subsidize” retirees. This OPEB program includes implicit subsidy liabilities for retiree coverage prior to coverage under Medicare.

- **Other subsidy liabilities:** In the CalPERS medical program, the premiums for Medicare-covered retirees are based only on retiree claims experience of the pool. Pooled plans that do not blend active and retiree premiums likely generate subsidies between employers and retirees within the pool. An actuarial practice note indicates these subsidies should be included in plan liabilities to the extent they are paid by the employer.² We generally expect these subsidies to be small and include any such liability with the implicit subsidy liability in this report.

We determine explicit subsidy liabilities using the expected direct payments promised by the plan toward retiree coverage. We determine the implicit and other subsidy liabilities as the projected difference between (a) estimated retiree medical claims costs by age and (b) premiums charged for retiree coverage. For more about Macleod Watts’ age rating methodology, see Appendix 3.

---

¹ In rare situations, premiums for retiree coverage may be high enough that they subsidize active employees' claims.

² Exceptions exist for: 1) Medicare Advantage Plans: these plans are treated as if their premiums are age-based due to the nature of the Federal subsidies paid to these plans. 2) Plans with low explicit subsidies to Medicare-covered retirees: in these plans no part of any potential pool subsidy is expected to be paid by the employer.

**Executive Summary (Continued)**

**OPEB Funding Policy**

The District’s OPEB funding policy affects the calculation of GASB 75 liabilities by impacting the discount rate used to develop the plan liability and expense.

1) When an agency finances retiree benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis, contributing only current retiree benefits, GASB 75 requires the use of a discount rate equal to a 20-year high grade municipal bond rate. The District selected the Fidelity Municipal Bond AA 20 Year Maturity Yield is 3.86% on the current measurement date (June 30, 2023).

2) When the agency pre-funds the plan, contributing 100% or more of each year’s ADC, then GASB 75 allows the long-term trust rate of return to be used to develop the OPEB liability. The expected return is 6.16%. Information about the Expected Return on Trust Assets is provided on page 11.

3) When assets are set aside in an irrevocable trust, but annual OPEB contributions are less than the Actuarially Determined Contributions, paragraphs 36-41 of GASB 75 describe the analysis to be prepared to determine the discount rate. In this analysis, we consider the most recent 5-year history of District contributions as a percentage of the ADC and upcoming future years, if projected to be lower.

As a result of this analysis, we determined the discount rate for accounting purposes to be 6.0%.

**Actuarial Assumptions**

The actuarial “demographic” assumptions (i.e., rates of retirement, death, disability or other termination of employment) used in this report were chosen, for the most part, to be the same as the actuarial demographic assumptions used for the most recent valuation of the retirement plan(s) covering District employees. Other assumptions, such as age-related healthcare claims, healthcare trend, retiree participation rates and spouse coverage, were selected based on demonstrated plan experience and/or our best estimate of expected future experience. All these assumptions, and more, impact expected future benefits. Please note that this valuation has been prepared on a closed group basis. This means that only employees and retirees present as of the valuation date are considered. We do not consider replacement employees for those we project to leave the current population of plan participants until the valuation date following their employment.

We emphasize that this actuarial valuation provides a projection of future results based on many assumptions. Actual results are likely to vary to some extent and we will continue to monitor these assumptions in future valuations. See Section 3 for a description of assumptions used in this valuation.

**Important Dates for GASB 75 in This Report**

GASB 75 allows reporting liabilities as of any fiscal year end based on: (1) a valuation date no more than 30 months plus 1 day prior to the close of the fiscal year end; and (2) a measurement date up to one year prior to the close of the fiscal year. The following dates were used for this report:

- **Fiscal Year End:** June 30, 2024  
- **Measurement Date:** June 30, 2023  
- **Measurement Period:** June 30, 2022, to June 30, 2023  
- **Valuation Date:** June 30, 2023

**Executive Summary**  
*(Concluded)*

**Updates Since the Prior Report**  
No benefit changes were reported to MacLeod Watts since the June 2021 valuation was prepared. Updated employee census and premium data was provided and with this data, we determined plan experience, the difference between actual and expected liabilities since the prior valuation. We also reviewed and updated certain assumptions used to project the OPEB liability and determined investment experience, the difference between actual and expected return on trust assets.

The Net OPEB Liability on the current measurement date is higher than that reported one year ago. Section C presents the new valuation results and provides additional information on the impact of the new assumptions and plan experience. See Recognition Period for Deferred Resources on page 12 for details on how these changes are recognized.

**Impact on Statement of Net Position and OPEB Expense for Fiscal Year Ending 2024**  
The plan’s impact on Net Position will be the sum of difference between assets and liabilities as of the measurement date plus the unrecognized net outflows and inflows of resources.

**Important Notices**  
This report is intended to be used only to present the actuarial information relating to other postemployment benefits for the District’s financial statements. The results of this report may not be appropriate for other purposes, where other assumptions, methodology and/or actuarial standards of practice may be required or more suitable. We note that various issues in this report may involve legal analysis of applicable law or regulations. The District should consult counsel on these matters; MacLeod Watts does not practice law and does not intend anything in this report to constitute legal advice. In addition, we recommend the District consult with their internal accounting staff or external auditor or accounting firm about the accounting treatment of OPEB liabilities.

**B. Valuation Process**

This valuation is based on employee census data and benefits initially submitted by the District and clarified in various related communications. A summary of the employee data is provided in Section 1 and a summary of the plan benefits is provided in Section 2. While individual employee records have been reviewed to verify that they are reasonable in various respects, the data has not been audited and we have otherwise relied on the District as to its accuracy. The valuation has been performed in accordance with the process described below using the actuarial methods and assumptions described in Section 3 and is consistent with our understanding of Actuarial Standards of Practice.

In projecting benefit values and liabilities, we first determine an expected premium or benefit stream over each current retiree’s or active employee’s future retirement. Benefits may include both direct employer payments (explicit subsidies) and any implicit subsidies arising when retiree premiums are expected to be partially subsidized by premiums paid for active employees. The projected benefit streams reflect assumed trends in the cost of those benefits and assumptions as to the expected dates when benefits will end. Assumptions regarding the probability that each employee will remain in service to receive benefits and the likelihood that employees will elect coverage for themselves and their dependents are also applied.

We then calculate the present value of these future benefit streams by discounting the value of each future expected employer payment back to the valuation date using the valuation discount rate. This present value is called the Present Value of Projected Benefits (PVPB) and represents the current value of all expected future plan payments to current retirees and current active employees. Note that this long-term projection does not anticipate entry of future employees.

| Valuation Date | Benefits earned by prior service | Benefits earned by future service |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Present Value of Projected Benefit (PVPB) | Present value as of the valuation date of all future benefits expected to be paid to current and former employees |  |
| Actuarial Accrued Liability (AAL) | Present value as of the valuation date of all benefits deemed earned by prior service of current employees and retirees. |  |
| Actuarial Value of Assets (AVA) | Value of assets set aside to pay future benefits |  |
| Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability (UAAL): | Prior service benefits requiring future funding |  |
| Amortization Payment – amount added to the annual contribution to pay down the UAAL that exists on the valuation date. |  |  |

The next step in the valuation process splits the Present Value of Projected Benefits into 1) the value of benefits already earned by prior service of current employees and retirees and 2) the value of benefits expected to be earned by future service of current employees. Actuaries employ an “attribution method” to divide the PVPB into prior service liabilities and future service liabilities. For this valuation we used the Entry Age Normal attribution method. This method is the most common method used for government funding purposes and the only attribution method allowed for financial reporting under GASB 75.

We call the value of benefits deemed earned by prior service the Actuarial Accrued Liability (AAL). Benefits deemed earned by service of active employees in a single year is called the Normal Cost of.

**Valuation Process**  
(Concluded)

Benefits. The present value of all future normal costs (PVFNC) plus the Actuarial Accrued Liability will equal the Present Value of Projected Benefits (i.e. PVPB = AAL + PVFNC).

The difference between the value of trust assets (i.e. the Market Value of Assets), or a smoothed asset value (i.e. the Actuarial Value of Assets), and the Actuarial Accrued Liability yields the Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability (UAAL). The UAAL represents, as of the valuation date, the present value of benefits already earned by past service that remain unfunded. A plan is generally considered “fully funded” when the UAAL is zero. The plan sponsor of a fully funded plan will still need to make future contributions for benefits earned by future service of actives employees. But in a fully funded plan, the plan sponsor has set aside sufficient assets to pay for benefits that have been earned by past service of current retirees and active employees if all valuation assumptions are realized.

Future contributions by the District will fund 1) the remaining part of OPEB benefits earned by past service (the Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liability) and 2) the value of benefits earned each year by service of active employees. Various strategies might be employed to pay down the UAAL such as longer or shorter amortization payments, and flat or escalating payments depending on the plan sponsor's goals and funding philosophy.

**Variation in Future Results**

Please note that projections of future benefits over such long periods (frequently 70 or more years) which are dependent on numerous assumptions regarding future economic and demographic variables are subject to substantial revision as future events unfold. While we believe that the assumptions and methods used in this valuation are reasonable for the purposes of this report, the costs to the District reflected in this report are subject to future revision, perhaps materially. Demonstrating the range of potential future plan costs was beyond the scope of our assignment except to the limited extent of providing liability information at various discount rates.

Certain actuarial terms and GASB 75 terms may be used interchangeably. Some are shown below.

**C. Valuation Results as of June 30, 2023**

This section presents the basic results of our recalculation of the OPEB liability using the updated employee data, plan provisions and asset information provided to us for the June 2023 valuation. We described the general process for projecting all future benefits to be paid to retirees and current employees in the preceding Section. Expected annual benefits have been projected on the basis of the actuarial assumptions outlined in Supporting Information, Section 3.

Lifetime medical benefits are paid for qualifying District retirees. Please see Supporting Information, Section 2 for details.

The following graph illustrates the annual other post-employment benefits projected to be paid on behalf of current retirees and current employees expected to retire from the District.

### Expected Long-term Return on Trust Assets

CalPERS last updated the projected future investment returns for CERBT Strategy 1 in March 2022. The returns were determined using a building-block method and best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return for each major asset class (expected returns, net of OPEB plan investment expense and inflation). The target allocation and best estimates of geometric real rates of return published by CalPERS for each major class are split for years 1-5 and years 6-20. We assumed that the returns for years 6 through 20 would continue in later years.

| **CERBT Strategy 1** | **Years 1-5** | **Years 6-20** |
|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Major Asset Classification** | **Target Allocation** | **General Inflation Rate Assumption** | **Expected Real Rate of Return** | **Compound Return Yrs 1-5** | **General Inflation Rate Assumption** | **Expected Real Rate of Return** | **Compound Return Years 6-20** |
| Global Equity         | 49%            | 2.40%          | 4.40%                       | 6.80%                       | 2.30%                       | 4.50%                       | 6.80%                       |

| Treasury Inflation Protected Securities | 5% | 2.40% | -1.80% | 0.60% | 2.30% | 3.30% | 3.60% |
| Commodities           | 3%             | 2.40%          | 0.80%                       | 3.20%                       | 2.30%                       | 1.20%                       | 3.50%                       |
| **Volatility**        | 12.1% weighted  |                |                             |                             | 5.1% weighted               |                             |                             |

To derive the expected future trust return specifically for the City, we first adjusted CalPERS' future return expectations to align with the 2.5% general inflation assumption used in this report. Then applying the plan specific benefit payments (as determined from the June 30, 2023, valuation), CalPERS’ bifurcated return expectations, we determined the single equivalent long-term rate of return to be 6.16%.

# Accounting Information (Continued)

## Recognition Period for Deferred Resources

Liability changes due to plan experience which differs from what was assumed in the prior measurement period and/or from assumption changes during the period are recognized over the plan’s Expected Average Remaining Service Life (“EARSL”). The EARSL of 7.30 years is the period used to recognize such changes in the OPEB Liability arising during the current measurement period.

When applicable, changes in the Fiduciary Net Position due to investment performance different from the assumed earnings rate are always recognized over 5 years.

Liability changes attributable to benefit changes occurring during the period, if any, are recognized immediately.

## Deferred Resources as of Fiscal Year End and Expected Future Recognition

**Sensitivity of Liabilities to Changes in the Discount Rate and Healthcare Cost Trend Rate**

The discount rate used for accounting purposes for the fiscal year ending 2024 is 6.0%. Actual 2024 medical premiums were known and applied in the valuation. The Healthcare Cost Trend was assumed to start at 6.5% (increase effective January 1, 2025) and grade down to 3.9% for years 2075 and later. The impact of a 1% increase or decrease in these assumptions is shown in the chart below.

**Accounting Information**  
**Detail of District Contributions to the Plan**  

District contributions to the Plan occur as benefits are paid to or on behalf of retirees and/or as contributions to the OPEB trust. Benefit payments may occur in the form of direct payments for premiums ("explicit subsidies") and/or indirect payments to retirees in the form of higher premiums for active employees ("implicit subsidies"). Note that the implicit subsidy contribution does not represent cash payments to retirees, but rather the reclassification of a portion of active healthcare expense to be recognized as a retiree healthcare cost. For details, see Appendix 2 - Important Background Information.

**Benefits and other contributions paid by the District during the measurement period are shown below.**  

**For the Measurement Period,**  
**Jul 1, 2022 thru Jun 30, 2023**

The amounts shown in the Explicit Subsidy section of the table reflect the expected payment by the District toward retiree medical premiums in each of the years shown. The amounts are shown separately, and in total, for those retired on the valuation date ("current retirees") and those expected to retire after the valuation date ("future retirees"). The explicit subsidy benefit amount shown for FYE 2024 is currently an estimate and will be replaced with the actual amount, once known.

The amounts shown in the Implicit Subsidy table reflect the expected excess of retiree medical and prescription drug claims over the premiums expected to be charged during the year for retirees' coverage. These amounts are also shown separately and in total for those currently retired on the valuation date and for those expected to retire in the future.

These projections do not include any benefits expected to be paid on behalf of current active employees prior to retirement, nor do they include any benefits for potential future employees (i.e., those who might be hired in future years).

**E. Funding Information**

The employer’s OPEB funding policy and level of contributions to an irrevocable OPEB trust directly affects the discount rate which is used to calculate the OPEB liability to be reported in the employer’s financial statements. Prefunding (setting aside funds to accumulate in an irrevocable OPEB trust) has certain advantages, one of which is the ability to (potentially) use a higher discount rate in the determination of liabilities for GASB 75 reporting purposes. Prefunding also improves the security of benefits for current and potential future recipients and contributes to intergenerational taxpayer equity by better matching the cost of the benefits to the service years in which they are “earned” and which correspond to years in which taxpayers benefit from those services.

**Paying Down the UAAL**

Once an employer decides to prefund, a decision must be made about how to pay for benefits related to accumulated prior service that have not yet been funded (the UAAL). This is most often, though not always, handled through structured amortization payments. The period and method chosen for amortizing this unfunded liability can significantly affect the Actuarially Determined Contribution (ADC) or other basis selected for funding the OPEB program.

Much like paying off a mortgage, when the AAL exceeds plan assets, choosing to pay off the UAAL means smaller payments, but the payments will be required for more years; plan investments will have less time to work toward helping reduce required contribution levels. When the plan is in a surplus position, the reverse is true, and a longer amortization period is usually preferable.

There are several ways the amortization payment can be determined. The most common methods are calculating the amortization payment as a level dollar amount or as a level percentage of payroll. The employer might also choose to apply a shorter period when the UAAL only when it is positive, i.e., when trust assets are lower than the AAL, but opt for a longer period or to exclude amortization of a negative UAAL, when assets exceed the AAL. The entire UAAL may be amortized as one single component or may be broken into multiple components reflecting the timing and source of each change, such as those arising from assumption changes, benefit changes and/or liability or investment experience.

The amortization period(s) should not exceed the number of years which would allow current trust assets plus future contributions and earnings to be sufficient to pay all future benefits and trust expenses each year. Prefunding of OPEB is optional and contributions at any level are permitted. However, if trust sufficiency is not expected, a discount rate other than the assumed trust return will likely be required for accounting purposes.

**Funding and Prefunding of the Implicit Subsidy**

An implicit subsidy liability is created when retiree medical claims are expected to exceed the premiums charged for retiree coverage. Recognition of the estimated implicit subsidy each year is handled by an accounting entry, reducing the amount paid for active employees and shifting that amount to be treated as a retiree healthcare expense/contribution (see Sample Journal Entries). The implicit subsidy is a true benefit to the retiree but can be difficult to see when medical premiums are set as a flat rate for both actives and pre-Medicare retirees.

*We use actuarial, rather than accounting, terminology to describe the components used to develop the ADCs.*

**OPEB Funding Information**  
**(Continued)**  

This might lead some employers to believe the benefit is not real or is merely an accounting construct, and thus to forgo prefunding of retiree implicit benefits.

Consider what would happen if the retiree premiums were based only on expected retiree claims experience. Almost certainly, retiree premiums would increase while premiums for active employees would go down if the active premiums no longer had to help support the higher retiree claims. **Who would pay the increases in retiree premiums?** Current plan documents and bargaining agreements would have to be consulted. Depending on circumstances, the increase in retiree premiums might remain the responsibility of the employer, pass entirely to the retirees, or some blending of the two. The answer would determine whether separate retiree-only premium rates would result in a higher or lower employer OPEB liability. In the current premium structure, with blended active and pre-Medicare retiree premiums, the employer is clearly, though indirectly, paying the implicit retiree cost.

The prefunding decision is complex. OPEB materiality, budgetary concerns, desire to use the full trust rate in developing the liability for GASB 75, and other factors must be weighed by each employer. Since prefunding OPEB benefits is not required, each employer’s OPEB prefunding strategy will depend on how they balance these competing perspectives.

**Development of the Actuarially Determined Contributions**  

The District has approved payment of ADCs based on the following two components, which are adjusted with interest to each fiscal year end:  
- The amounts attributed to service performed in the current fiscal year (the normal cost) and  
- Amortization of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) over a closed 30-year period. Amortization payments are determined on a level % of pay basis; 19 years remain for FYE 2024.

Actuarially Determined Contributions, developed as described above for the District’s fiscal years ending June 30, 2025 and 2026 are shown the exhibit on the next page. These ADCs incorporate both explicit (cash benefit) and implicit subsidy benefit liabilities. Contributions credited toward meeting the ADC will be comprised of:  
1) direct payments to insurers toward retiree premiums, to the extent not reimbursed to the District by the trust; plus  
2) each year’s implicit subsidy payment; and  
3) contributions to the OPEB trust.

ADCs determined on this basis should provide for trust sufficiency, based on the current plan provisions and census data, provided all assumptions are exactly realized and if the District contributes 100% or more of the ADC each year. When an agency commits to funding the trust at or above the ADC, the expected long-term trust return may be used as the discount rate in determining the plan liability for accounting purposes. Trust sufficiency cannot be guaranteed to a certainty, however, because of the non-trivial risk that the assumptions used to project future benefit liabilities may not be realized.

### The District’s OPEB Funding Policy
The District has stated that its current OPEB funding policy is to prefund the explicit subsidy only. Financing of the implicit subsidy liability will be on a pay-as-you-go basis, with no contributions made to the trust toward prefunding this portion of the liability.

This table develops the Funding Policy Contributions for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026. The corresponding Funding Policy Contribution for fiscal year ending 2024 was determined from the results of the June 30, 2021, valuation, included below for reference.

**June 30, 2023, Actuarial Valuation and GASB 75 Report for Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2024**

**F. Certification**

The primary purposes of this report are: (1) to provide actuarial information of the other postemployment benefits (OPEB) provided by the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (the District) in compliance with Statement 75 of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB 75); and (2) to provide Actuarially Determined Contributions for prefunding of this program in conformity with the District's OPEB funding policy. The District is not required to contribute the ADC shown in this report and we make no representation that it will, in fact, fund the OPEB trust at any particular level.

In preparing this report we relied without audit on information provided by the District. This information includes, but is not limited to, plan provisions, census data, and financial information. We performed a limited review of this data and found the information to be reasonably consistent. The accuracy of this report is dependent on this information and if any of the information we relied on is incomplete or inaccurate, then the results reported herein will be different from any report relying on more accurate information.

We consider the actuarial assumptions and methods used in this report to be individually reasonable under the requirements imposed by GASB 75 and taking into consideration reasonable expectations of plan experience. The results provide an estimate of the plan’s financial condition at one point in time. Future actuarial results may be significantly different due to a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, demographic and economic assumptions differing from future plan experience, changes in plan provisions, changes in applicable law, or changes in the value of plan benefits relative to other alternatives available to plan members.

Alternative assumptions may also be reasonable; however, demonstrating the range of potential plan results based on alternative assumptions was beyond the scope of our assignment except to the limited extent required by GASB 75 and in accordance with the District’s stated OPEB funding policy. Results for accounting purposes may be materially different than results obtained for other purposes such as plan termination, liability settlement, or underlying economic value of the promises made by the plan.

This report is prepared solely for the use and benefit of the District and may not be provided to third parties without prior written consent of MacLeod Watts. Exceptions are: The District may provide copies of this report to their professional accounting and legal advisors who are subject to a duty of confidentiality, and the District may provide this work to any party if required by law or court order. No part of this report should be used as the basis for any representations or warranties in any contract or agreement without the written consent of MacLeod Watts.

The undersigned actuaries are unaware of any relationship that might impair the objectivity of this work. Nothing within this report is intended to be a substitute for qualified legal or accounting counsel. Both actuaries are members of the American Academy of Actuaries and meet the qualification standards for rendering this opinion.

### Section 1 - Summary of Employee Data

The chart below reconciles the number of actives and retirees included in the June 30, 2021, valuation of the District plan with those included in the June 30, 2023, valuation:

| Status | Covered Actives | Waiving Actives | Service Retirees w/Benefits | Disabled Retirees w/Benefits | Surviving Spouses w/Benefits | Total |
|--------|------------------|------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Number reported as of June 30, 2021 | 627 | 28 | 548 | 133 | 66 | 1,402 |
| New employees | 86 | 23 | | | | 109 |
| Separated employees | (23) | (5) | | | | (28) |
| Rehired employees | 1 | 1 | | | | 2 |
| New retiree, elected coverage | (43) | 33 | 10 | | | 0 |
| New retiree, waiving coverage | (1) | | | | | (1) |
| Previously covered, now waiving | (3) | 3 | | | | (3) |
| Previously waiving, now covered | 12 | (12) | 1 | 1 | | 2 |
| Deceased | (34) | (1) | (12) | 4 | | (42) |
| Data corrections | (2) | 2 | 3 | 3 | | 3 |
| **Number reported as of June 30, 2023** | **656** | **38** | **543** | **133** | **74** | **1,444** |

From this reconciliation, we observe that the total plan population increased by 42 members overall, about 3.0% during the two years between valuations. The number of active members increased by 39 (6.0%) while the number of retirees and survivors receiving benefits increased by 3 (0.4%).

There were 44 new retirements reported since the June 2021 valuation was prepared. Of these, 43 elected to continue coverage and are receiving benefits; one is waiving the District’s coverage, having opted for coverage through his spouse.

### Counts by Benefit Tiers:

Employees hired during or after December 2011 are subject to a longer service requirement and vesting schedule to be eligible for full benefits. The number of retirees hired prior to this recently added requirement and those now subject to it are summarized below:

| Medical Coverage Type | Actives | Retired | Totals |
|-----------------------|---------|---------|--------|
| Misc - Hired before December 1, 2011 | 204 | 665 | 869 |
| Fire - Hired before December 1, 2011 | 22 | 83 | 105 |
| Misc - Hired on or after December 1, 2011 | 402 | 2 | 404 |
| Fire - Hired on or after December 1, 2011 | 66 | 0 | 66 |
| **Totals** | **694** | **750** | **1,444** |

**Section 2 - Summary of Retiree Benefit Provisions**

OPEB provided: The District reported that the only OPEB provided is retiree medical coverage.

**Access to coverage:** Medical coverage is currently provided through CalPERS as permitted under the Public Employees’ Medical and Hospital Care Act (PEMHCA). This coverage requires the employee to satisfy the requirements for retirement under CalPERS, which requires either: (a) attainment of age 50 (age 52, for miscellaneous employees who are new to PERS on or after January 1, 2013) with 5 years of State or public agency service or (b) an approved disability retirement.

Unless covered by a vesting resolution with at least 20 years of service for the District or an approved disability retirement, the employee must begin his or her pension benefit within 120 days of terminating employment with the District to be eligible to continue medical coverage through the District and be entitled to the employer subsidy described below. Additional eligibility provisions for long-service employees or disabled retirees covered by the PEMHCA vesting resolution are shown on the next page.

Once eligible for retiree medical coverage, if the member is not already enrolled in the medical plan, he or she may enroll within 60 days of retirement or during any future open enrollment period. Coverage may be continued at the retiree’s option for his or her lifetime. A surviving spouse and other eligible dependents may also continue coverage.

There is a small group of retirees whose medical coverage is provided through the Sacramento County Employee Retirement System (SCERS). Coverage for this group is also provided to surviving spouses.

**Benefits provided:** As a PEMHCA employer, the District is obligated to contribute toward the cost of retiree medical coverage for the retiree’s lifetime or until coverage is discontinued. The District has resolutions with CalPERS defining the level of the District’s contribution toward active and retiree medical plan premiums.

Benefits fall into one of the following 4 categories:

1. **For employees hired prior to December 1, 2011**, the current resolutions provide that:
   a. While covered by a Basic or Combination plan, the District will contribute 92% of the medical premium for the retiree and his or her dependents, but not more than 92% of the premium for the 3rd highest Basic or 3rd highest Combination plan rate in Region 1, as applicable and corresponding to the retiree’s coverage level.
   b. When the retiree and all of his or her covered dependents are covered by Medicare plans, the District will contribute 100% of the medical premium, not to exceed 100% of the 3rd highest Supplemental plan rate in Region 1 corresponding to the retiree’s coverage level.

(Continued)

2. Employees hired on or after December 1, 2011 are covered by a "special" PEMHCA vesting resolution, which provides that the District will pay the benefit described in 1. above, multiplied by the applicable vesting percentage, as determined from the chart shown below.

| PERS Service | Vested % | PERS Service | Vested % |
|--------------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Under 5      | 0%       | 13           | 65%      |
| 5            | 25%      | 14           | 70%      |
| 6            | 30%      | 15           | 75%      |
| 7            | 35%      | 16           | 80%      |
| 8            | 40%      | 17           | 85%      |
| 9            | 45%      | 18           | 90%      |
| 10           | 50%      | 19           | 95%      |
| 11           | 55%      | 20           | 100%     |
| 12           | 60%      |              |          |

- Employees who retire on disability retirement are automatically 100% vested, regardless of their years of District or PERS service.
- Employees who complete 20 or more years of service with the District are vested in this benefit even if terminating employment prior to retirement from the District.

3. Retirees who retain SCERS medical coverage receive a subsidy, increasing by 5% per year, based on the retiree’s years of service with the District. Current monthly subsidies are shown in the chart at right.

In addition, retirees who retain SCERS medical coverage are reimbursed up to $100 per month for any medical expenses paid by the retiree.

| Years of SCERS Service Credit | Fiscal Year 21/22 Amount |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Less than 10                  | $219.10                  |
| 15                            | $272.97                  |
| 20                            | $326.84                  |
| 25                            | $380.72                  |
| 25 or more                    | $438.19                  |

4. The District also reimburses the monthly Medicare Part B premiums for former American River Fire District retirees and their spouses. The standard Medicare Part B premium is $174.70 per month for 2024.

All retirees eligible for coverage under the District-sponsored medical plans (except those in 3. above) who opt out of CalPERS medical insurance will receive instead up to $300 per month toward the cost of outside coverage.

**Section 3 - Actuarial Methods and Assumptions**  
The ultimate real cost of an employee benefit plan is the value of all benefits and other expenses of the plan over its lifetime. These payments depend only on the terms of the plan and the administrative arrangements adopted. Actuarial assumptions are used to estimate the cost of these benefits; the funding method spreads the expected costs on a level basis over the life of the plan.  

**Important Dates**  
- **Valuation Date:** June 30, 2023  
- **Fiscal Year End:** June 30, 2024  
- **GASB 75 Measurement Date:** June 30, 2023 (last day of the prior fiscal year)  

**Valuation Methods**  
- **Funding Method:** Entry Age Normal Cost, level percent of pay  
- **Asset Valuation Method:** Market value of assets  
- **Participants Valued:** Only current active employees and retired participants and covered dependents are valued. No future entrants are considered in this valuation.  

**Development of Age-related Medical Premiums**  
Actual premium rates for retirees and their spouses were adjusted to an age-related basis by applying medical claim cost factors developed from the data presented in the report, “Health Care Costs – From Birth to Death”, sponsored by the Society of Actuaries. A description of the use of claims cost curves is provided in MacLeod Watt’s Age Rating Methodology in Appendix 3 to this report.  

Monthly baseline premium costs were set equal to the active single premiums shown in the chart in Section 2. Representative claims costs (age-based premiums) derived from the dataset provided by CalPERS are shown in the chart on the following page.  

The age-based premiums are applied to determine the implicit subsidy liability for retirees prior to coverage under Medicare where the claims experience of these retirees is pooled with active plan members.  

Medicare-eligible retirees are covered by plans which are rated solely on the experience of Medicare retirees with no subsidy by active employee premiums. We applied actual premium rates for Medicare Advantage plans and age-based premiums for Medicare Supplement plans, as shown on the following page.

**General Inflation Rate**  
2.5% per year  

**Salary Increase**  
3.0% per year; since benefits do not depend on salary, this is used to allocate the cost of benefits between service years.  

**Healthcare Trend**  
Medical plan premiums and claims costs by age are assumed to increase once each year. Increases over the prior year’s levels are assumed to be effective on the dates shown below:  

| Effective January 1 | Premium Increase | Effective January 1 | Premium Increase |

**Supporting Information**  
**Section 3 - Actuarial Methods and Assumptions (Continued)**

**Assumed Increases in Other District Provided Benefits**  
No increases are assumed in the $300 per month provided to retirees who opt out of coverage under District-sponsored medical plans.  
The District’s contribution toward the cost of coverage for retirees covered by SCERS is assumed to increase by 5% annually. No increases are assumed in the $100 per month reimbursement for any medical expenses paid by the retiree.

**Participant Election Assumptions**  
**Participation Rate**  
Active employees: 98% of those expected to qualify for benefits are assumed to continue their current plan election in retirement. If not currently enrolled, the employee (retiree) is assumed to elect coverage in the Kaiser Region 1 plan.

Retired participants: Existing medical plan elections are assumed to be continued until the retiree’s death.

**Spouse Coverage**  
Active employees: 80% are assumed to be married and elect coverage for their spouse in retirement. Surviving spouses are assumed to retain coverage until their death. Husbands are assumed to be 3 years older than their wives.

Retired participants: Existing elections for spouse coverage are assumed to be continued until the spouse’s death. Actual spouse ages are used, where known; if not, husbands are assumed to be 3 years older than their wives. Spouse gender is assumed to be the opposite of the employee.

**Dependent Coverage**  
Active employees: 75% are assumed to cover dependents other than a spouse under age 26 at retirement; eligibility for coverage for the youngest dependent is assumed to end at the retiree’s age 62.

Retired participants covering dependent children are assumed to end such coverage when the youngest currently covered dependent reaches age 26.

**Medicare Eligibility**  
Absent contrary data, all individuals are assumed to be eligible for Medicare Parts A and B at age 65. Retirees over age 65 not currently enrolled in Medicare who do not have a spouse under age 65 are assumed to remain ineligible.

**Software and Models Used in the Valuation**

ProVal - MacLeod Watts utilizes ProVal, a licensed actuarial valuation software product from Winklevoss Technologies (WinTech) to project future retiree benefit payments and develop the OPEB liabilities presented in this report. ProVal is widely used by the actuarial community. We review results at the plan level and for individual sample lives and find them to be reasonable and consistent with the results we expect. We are not aware of any material inconsistencies or limitations in the software that would affect this actuarial valuation.

**Age-based premiums model** - developed internally and reviewed by an external consultant at the time it was developed. See discussion on Development of Age-Related Medical Premiums and Appendix 3.

**Getzen model** - published by the Society of Actuaries; used to derive medical trend assumptions described earlier in this section.

**Changes in assumptions or methods since the prior Measurement Date**

- **Trust rate of return**  
  Decreased to 6.16% from 6.21%, reflecting updated annual benefit cashflows applied against the long term rates of return provided by CalPERS in March 2022.

- **Discount rate**  
  For accounting: Decreased to 6.0% from 6.10%, reflecting updated projected benefit cash flows, updated expected return on trust assets (see above), and analysis as described in paragraphs 36-41 of GASB 75.  
  For funding: Decreased to 6.16% from 6.21%, reflecting updated expected return on trust assets (see above).

**June 30, 2023, Actuarial Valuation and GASB 75 Report for Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2024**

**Appendix 2: Important Background Information**

**General Types of Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB)**

Post-employment benefits other than pensions (OPEB) comprise a part of compensation that employers offer for services received. The most common OPEB are medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, and/or life insurance coverage. Other OPEB may include outside group legal, long-term care, or disability benefits outside of a pension plan. OPEB does not generally include COBRA, vacation, sick leave (unless converted to defined benefit OPEB), or other direct retiree payments.

A direct employer payment toward the cost of OPEB benefits is referred to as an "explicit subsidy." In addition, if claims experience of employees and retirees are pooled when determining premiums, retiree premiums are based on a pool of members which, on average, are younger and healthier. For certain types of coverage such as medical insurance, this results in an "implicit subsidy" of retiree premiums by active employee premiums since the retiree premiums are lower than they would have been if retirees were insured separately. GASB 75 and Actuarial Standards of Practice generally require that implicit subsidy of retiree premium rates be valued as an OPEB liability.

| Expected retiree claims | Premium charged for retiree coverage | Covered by higher active premiums |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Retiree portion of premium | Agency portion of premium | Explicit subsidy | Implicit subsidy |

*This chart shows the sources of funds needed to cover expected medical claims for pre-Medicare retirees. The portion of the premium paid by the Agency does not impact the amount of the implicit subsidy.*

**Valuation Process**

The valuation was based on employee census data and benefits provided by the District. A summary of the employee data is provided in Section 1 and a summary of the benefits provided under the Plan is provided in Section 2. While individual employee records have been reviewed to verify that they are reasonable in various respects, the data has not been audited and we have otherwise relied on the District as to its accuracy. The valuation was also based on the actuarial methods and assumptions described in Section 3.

In developing the projected benefit values and liabilities, we first determine an expected premium or benefit stream over the employee’s future retirement. Benefits may include both direct employer payments (explicit subsidies) and/or an implicit subsidy, arising when retiree premiums are expected to be subsidized by active employee premiums. The projected benefit streams reflect assumed trends in the cost of those benefits and assumptions as to the expected date(s) when benefits will end. We then apply assumptions regarding:

- The probability that each individual employee will or will not continue in service to receive benefits.
- The probability of when such retirement will occur for each retiree, based on current age, service and employee type; and

**Important Background Information (Continued)**

- The likelihood that future retirees will or will not elect retiree coverage (and benefits) for themselves and/or their dependents.

We then calculate a present value of these benefits by discounting the value of each future expected benefit payment, multiplied by the assumed expectation that it will be paid, back to the valuation date using the discount rate. These benefit projections and liabilities have a very long time horizon. The final payments for currently active employees may not be made for many decades.

The resulting present value for each employee is allocated as a level percent of payroll each year over the employee’s career using the entry age normal cost method and the amounts for each individual are then summed to get the results for the entire plan. This creates a cost expected to increase each year as payroll increases. Amounts attributed to prior fiscal years form the “Total OPEB Liability”. The OPEB cost allocated for active employees in the current year is referred to as “Service Cost”.

Where contributions have been made to an irrevocable OPEB trust, the accumulated value of trust assets (“Fiduciary Net Position”) is applied to offset the “Total OPEB Liability”, resulting in the “Net OPEB Liability”. If a plan is not being funded, then the Net OPEB Liability is equal to the Total OPEB Liability.

It is important to remember that an actuarial valuation is, by its nature, a projection of one possible future outcome based on many assumptions. To the extent that actual experience is not what we assumed, future results will differ. Some possible sources of future differences may include:

- A significant change in the number of covered or eligible plan members
- A significant increase or decrease in the future premium rates
- A change in the subsidy provided by the Agency toward retiree premiums
- Longer life expectancies of retirees

**Important Background Information (Continued)**

**Requirements of GASB 75**

The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) issued GASB Statement No. 75, *Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions*. This Statement establishes standards for the measurement, recognition, and disclosure of OPEB expense and related liabilities (assets), note disclosures, and required supplementary information (RSI) in the financial reports of state and local governmental employers.

**Important Dates**

GASB 75 requires that the information used for financial reporting falls within prescribed timeframes. Actuarial valuations of the total OPEB liability are generally required at least every two years. If a valuation is not performed as of the Measurement Date, then liabilities are required to be based on roll forward procedures from a prior valuation performed no more than 30 months and 1 day prior to the most recent year-end. In addition, the net OPEB liability is required to be measured as of a date no earlier than the end of the prior fiscal year (the “Measurement Date”).

**Recognition of Plan Changes and Gains and Losses**

Under GASB 75, gains and losses related to changes in Total OPEB Liability and Fiduciary Net Position are recognized in OPEB expense systematically over time.

- **Timing of recognition**: Changes in the Total OPEB Liability relating to changes in plan benefits are recognized immediately (fully expensed) in the year in which the change occurs. Gains and losses are amortized, with the applicable period based on the type of gain or loss. The first amortized amounts are recognized in OPEB expense for the year the gain or loss occurs. The remaining amounts are categorized as deferred outflows and deferred inflows of resources related to OPEB and are to be recognized in future OPEB expense.

- **Deferred recognition periods**: These periods differ depending on the source of the gain or loss.
  - **Difference between projected and actual trust earnings**: 5 year straight-line recognition
  - **All other amounts**: Straight-line recognition over the expected average remaining service lifetime (EARSL) of all members that are provided with benefits, determined as of the beginning of the Measurement Period. In determining the EARSL, all active, retired and inactive (vested) members are counted, with the latter two groups having 0 remaining service years.

**Implicit Subsidy Plan Contributions**

An implicit subsidy occurs when expected retiree claims exceed the premiums charged for retiree coverage. When this occurs, we expect part of the premiums paid for active employees to cover a portion of retiree claims. This transfer represents the current year’s “implicit subsidy”. Because GASB 75 treats payments to an irrevocable trust or directly to the insurer as employer contributions, each year’s implicit subsidy is treated as a contribution toward the payment of retiree benefits.

The following hypothetical example illustrates this treatment:

| Hypothetical Illustration of Implicit Subsidy Recognition | For Active Employees | For Retired Employees |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Prior to Implicit Subsidy Adjustment**                 |                      |                       |
| Premiums Paid by Agency During Fiscal Year               | $411,000             | $48,000               |
| Accounting Treatment                                      | Compensation Cost for Active Employees | Contribution to Plan & Benefits Paid from Plan |
| **After Implicit Subsidy Adjustment**                    |                      |                       |
| Premiums Paid by Agency During Fiscal Year               | $411,000             | $48,000               |
| Implicit Subsidy Adjustment                               | ($23,000)           | $23,000               |
| Accounting Cost of Premiums Paid                          | $388,000             | $71,000               |
| Accounting Treatment Impact                               | Reduces Compensation Cost for Active Employees | Increases Contributions to Plan & Benefits Paid from Plan |

The example above shows that total payments toward active and retired employee healthcare premiums is the same, but for accounting purposes part of the total is shifted from actives to retirees. This shifted amount is recognized as an OPEB contribution and reduces the current year’s premium expense for active employees.

**Important Background Information**  
**(Continued)**  

**Discount Rate**  
When the financing of OPEB liabilities is on a pay-as-you-go basis, GASB 75 requires that the discount rate used for valuing liabilities be based on the yield or index rate for 20-year, tax-exempt general obligation municipal bonds with an average rating of AA/Aa or higher (or equivalent quality on another rating scale). When a plan sponsor makes regular, sufficient contributions to a trust in order to prefund the OPEB liabilities, GASB 75 allows use of a rate up to the expected rate of return of the trust. Therefore, prefunding has an advantage of potentially being able to report overall lower liabilities due to future expected benefits being discounted at a higher rate.

**Actuarial Funding Method and Assumptions**  
The “ultimate real cost” of an employee benefit plan is the value of all benefits and other expenses of the plan over its lifetime. These expenditures are dependent only on the terms of the plan and the administrative arrangements adopted, and as such are not affected by the actuarial funding method.

The actuarial funding method attempts to spread recognition of these expected costs on a level basis over the life of the plan, and as such uses the “incidence of cost”. GASB 75 specifically requires that the actuarial present value of projected benefit payments be attributed to periods of employee service using the Entry Age Actuarial Cost Method, with each period’s service cost determined as a level percentage of pay.

The results of this report may not be appropriate for other purposes, where other assumptions, methodology and/or actuarial standards of practice may be required or more suitable.

**Appendix 3: MacLeod Watts Age Rating Methodology**

Both accounting standards (e.g. GASB 75) and actuarial standards (e.g. ASOP 6) require that expected retiree claims, not just premiums paid, be reflected in most situations where an actuary is calculating retiree healthcare liabilities. Unfortunately, the actuary is often required to perform these calculations without underlying claims information. In most situations, the information is not available, but even when available, the information may not be credible due to the size of the group being considered.

Actuaries have developed methodologies to approximate healthcare claims from the premiums being paid by the plan sponsor. Any methodology requires adopting certain assumptions and using general studies of healthcare costs as substitutes when there is a lack of credible claims information for the specific plan being reviewed.

Premiums paid by sponsors are often uniform for all employee and retiree ages and genders, with a drop in premiums for those participants who are Medicare-eligible. While the total premiums are expected to pay for the total claims for the insured group, on average, the premiums charged would not be sufficient to pay for the claims of older insureds and would be expected to exceed the expected claims of younger insureds. An age-rating methodology takes the typically uniform premiums paid by plan sponsors and spreads the total premium dollars to each age and gender intended to better approximate what the insurer might be expecting in actual claims costs at each age and gender.

The process of translating premiums into expected claims by age and gender generally follows the steps below.

1. **Obtain or Develop Relative Medical Claims Costs by Age, Gender, or other categories that are deemed significant.** For example, a claims cost curve might show that, if a 50 year old male has claims of $1, then on average a 50 year old female has claims of $1.25, a 30 year old male has claims of $0.40, and an 8 year old female has claims of $0.20. The claims cost curve provides such relative costs for each age, gender, or any other significant factor the curve might have been developed to represent. Section 3 provides the source of information used to develop such a curve and shows sample relative claims costs developed for the plan under consideration.

2. **Obtain a census of participants, their chosen medical coverage, and the premium charged for their coverage.** An attempt is made to find the group of participants that the insurer considered in setting the premiums they charge for coverage. That group includes the participant and any covered spouses and children. When information about dependents is unavailable, assumptions must be made about spouse age and the number and age of children represented in the population. These assumptions are provided in Section 3.

3. **Spread the total premium paid by the group to each covered participant or dependent based on expected claims.** The medical claims cost curve is used to spread the total premium dollars paid by the group to each participant reflecting their age, gender, or other relevant category. After this step, the actuary has a schedule of expected claims costs for each age and gender for the current premium year. It is these claims costs that are projected into the future by medical cost inflation assumptions when valuing expected future retiree claims.

The methodology described above is dependent on the data and methodologies used in whatever study might be used to develop claims cost curves for any given plan sponsor. These methodologies and assumptions can be found in the referenced paper cited as a source in the valuation report.

**Appendix 4: MacLeod Watts Mortality Projection Methodology**

Actuarial standards of practice (e.g., ASOP 35, Selection of Demographic and Other Noneconomic Assumptions for Measuring Pension Obligations, and ASOP 6, Measuring Retiree Group Benefits Obligations) indicate that the actuary should reflect the effect of mortality improvement (i.e., longer life expectancies in the future), both before and after the measurement date. The development of credible mortality improvement rates requires the analysis of large quantities of data over long periods of time. Because it would be extremely difficult for an individual actuary or firm to acquire and process such extensive amounts of data, actuaries typically rely on large studies published periodically by organizations such as the Society of Actuaries or Social Security Administration.

As noted in a recent actuarial study on mortality improvement, key principles in developing a credible mortality improvement model would include the following:

1. Short-term mortality improvement rates should be based on recent experience.
2. Long-term mortality improvement rates should be based on expert opinion.
3. Short-term mortality improvement rates should blend smoothly into the assumed long-term rates over an appropriate transition period.

The MacLeod Watts Scale 2022 was developed from a blending of data and methodologies found in two published sources: (1) the Society of Actuaries Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2021 Report, published in October 2021 and (2) the demographic assumptions used in the 2021 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds, published August 2021.

MacLeod Watts Scale 2022 is a two-dimensional mortality improvement scale reflecting both age and year of mortality improvement. The underlying base scale is Scale MP-2021 which has two segments – (1) historical improvement rates for the period 1951-2017 and (2) an estimate of future mortality improvement for years 2018-2020 using the Scale MP-2021 methodology but utilizing the assumptions used in generating Scale MP-2015. The MacLeod Watts scale then transitions from the 2020 improvement rate to the Social Security Administration (SSA) Intermediate Scale linearly over the 10-year period 2021-2030. After this transition period, the MacLeod Watts Scale uses the constant mortality improvement rate from the SSA Intermediate Scale from 2030-2044. The SSA’s Intermediate Scale has a final step in 2045 which is reflected in the MacLeod Watts scale for years 2045 and thereafter. Over the ages 95 to 117, the age 95 improvement rate is graded to zero.

Scale MP-2021 can be found at the SOA website and the projection scales used in the 2021 Social Security Administrations Trustees Report at the Social Security Administration website.

**June 30, 2023, Actuarial Valuation and GASB 75 Report for Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2024**

**Glossary**

- **Actuarial Funding Method** – A procedure which calculates the actuarial present value of plan benefits and expenses, and allocates these expenses to time periods, typically as a normal cost and an actuarial accrued liability.

- **Actuarial Present Value of Projected Benefits (APVPB)** – The amount presently required to fund all projected plan benefits in the future. This value is determined by discounting the future payments by an appropriate interest rate and the probability of nonpayment.

- **CalPERS** – Many state governments maintain a public employee retirement system; CalPERS is the California program, covering all eligible state government employees as well as other employees of other governments within California who have elected to join the system.

- **Defined Benefit (DB)** – A pension or OPEB plan which defines the monthly income or other benefit which the plan member receives at or after separation from employment.

- **Deferred Contributions** – When an employer makes contributions after the measurement date and prior to the fiscal year end, recognition of these contributions is deferred to a subsequent accounting period by creating a deferred resource. We refer to these contributions as Deferred Contributions.

- **Defined Contribution (DC)** – A pension or OPEB plan which establishes an individual account for each member and specifies how contributions to each active member’s account are determined and the terms of distribution of the account after separation from employment.

- **Discount Rate** – Interest rate used to discount future individual benefit payments to the valuation date. Under GASB 75, if a plan is prefunded, then the discount rate is equal to the expected trust return. If a plan is not prefunded (pay-as-you-go), then the rate of return is based on a yield or index rate for 20-year, tax-exempt general obligation municipal bonds with an average rating of AA/Aa or higher.

- **Expected Average Remaining Service Lifetime (EARSL)** – Average of the expected remaining service lives of all employees that are provided with benefits through the OPEB plan (active employees and inactive employees), beginning in the current period.

- **Entry Age Actuarial Cost Method** – An actuarial funding method where, for each individual, the actuarial present value of benefits is evenly spread over the individual’s projected earnings or service from entry age to the last age at which benefits can be paid.

- **Explicit Subsidy** – The projected dollar value of future retiree healthcare costs expected to be paid directly by the Employer, e.g., the Employer’s payment of all or a portion of the monthly retiree premium billed by the insurer for the retiree’s coverage.

- **Fiduciary Net Position** – The value of trust assets used to offset the Total OPEB Liability to determine the Net OPEB Liability.

- **Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB)** – A private, not-for-profit organization which develops generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for U.S. state and local governments; like FASB, it is part of the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF), which funds each organization and selects the members of each board.

- **Health Care Trend** – The assumed rate(s) of increase in future dollar values of premiums or healthcare claims, attributable to increases in the cost of healthcare; contributing factors include medical inflation, frequency or extent of utilization of services and technological developments.

**Glossary (Continued)**

- **Implicit Subsidy** - The projected difference between future retiree claims and the premiums to be charged for retiree coverage; this difference results when the claims experience of active and retired employees are pooled together and a ‘blended’ group premium rate is charged for both actives and retirees; a portion of the active employee premiums subsidizes the retiree premiums.

- **Net OPEB Liability (NOL)** - The liability to employees for benefits provided through a defined benefit OPEB. Only assets administered through a trust that meet certain criteria may be used to reduce the Total OPEB Liability.

- **Net Position** - The impact on Statement of Net Position is the Net OPEB Liability adjusted for deferred resource items.

- **OPEB Expense** - The OPEB expense reported in the Agency’s financial statement. OPEB expense is the annual cost of the plan recognized in the financial statements.

- **Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB)** - Post-employment benefits other than pension benefits, most commonly healthcare benefits but also including life insurance if provided separately from a pension plan.

- **Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO)** - Contributions to the plan are made at about the same time and in about the same amount as benefit payments and expenses coming due.

- **PEMHCA** - The Public Employees’ Medical and Hospital Care Act, established by the California legislature in 1961, provides community-rated medical benefits to participating public employers. Among its extensive regulations are the requirements that a contracting Agency contribute toward medical insurance premiums for retired annuitants and that a contracting Agency file a resolution, adopted by its governing body, with the CalPERS Board establishing any new contribution.

- **Plan Assets** - The value of cash and investments considered as ‘belonging’ to the plan and permitted to be used to offset the AAL for valuation purposes. To be considered a plan asset, GASB 75 requires (a) contributions to the OPEB plan be irrevocable, (b) OPEB assets to dedicated to providing OPEB benefit to plan members in accordance with the benefit terms of the plan, and (c) plan assets be legally protected from creditors, the OPEB plan administrator and the plan members.

- **Public Agency Miscellaneous (PAM)** - Non-safety public employees.

- **Select and Ultimate** - Actuarial assumptions which contemplate rates which differ by year initially (the select period) and then stabilize at a constant long-term rate (the ultimate rate).

- **Service Cost** - Total dollar value of benefits expected to be earned by plan members in the current year, as assigned by the actuarial funding method; also called normal cost.

- **Total OPEB Liability (TOL)** - Total dollars required to fund all plan benefits attributable to service rendered as of the valuation date for current plan members and vested prior plan members; a subset of "Actuarial Present Value."

- **Vesting** - As defined by the plan, requirements which when met make a plan benefit nonforfeitable on separation of service before retirement eligibility.

**DATE:** May 23, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Equipment Lease Financing Contract for Fiscal Year 2023/24  

**TOPIC**  
Resolution for equipment lease financing for capital expenditures budgeted in FY 2023/24  

**SUMMARY**  
The District's FY 2023/24 adopted Midyear Budget reflects the financing of apparatus and vehicle purchases over a 5-year period. Financing for vehicles and equipment is typically secured near the end of the fiscal year when the funds are needed.  

**DISCUSSION**  
On April 2, 2024, staff issued a request for proposal for lease financing for fire apparatus and vehicles. A total of seven qualified proposals were received from Bank of America, Bank Funding LLC, Municipal Finance Corp., First American, JPMorgan Chase, TD Equipment Finance Inc. and Wells Fargo. Based on the information received from these proposals, staff concluded that the District should enter into an equipment lease with Banc of America Capital Corp (Lessor) based on providing the lowest overall cost and terms acceptable to the District. Staff has begun preparing preliminary documentation with the Lessor and a draft lease purchase agreement is attached.  

The estimated total equipment costs to be financed are listed below:  

| Item                     | Cost       |
|--------------------------|------------|
| 3 - Ambulances           | $850,840   |
| 6 - Ambulance remounts   | $1,009,392 |
| 1 - Service Truck        | $200,000   |
| 1 - Type V Engine       | $234,001   |
| 2 - Delivery Vans        | $150,000   |

**Total estimated cost to be financed**: **$2,444,233**

![ESCROW AND ACCOUNT CONTROL AGREEMENT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=ESCROW+AND+ACCOUNT+CONTROL+AGREEMENT)

This ESCROW AND ACCOUNT CONTROL AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of June 13, 2024, by and among Banc of America Public Capital Corp, a Kansas corporation (together with its successors and assigns, hereinafter referred to as "Lessor"), Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, a special district of the State of California, (hereinafter referred to as "Lessee") and Argent Institutional Trust Company, a Florida trust company (hereinafter referred to as "Escrow Agent").

Reference is made to that certain Schedule of Property No. 2, dated June 13, 2024 to Master Equipment Lease/Purchase Agreement dated as of May 24, 2021, between Lessor and Lessee (hereinafter referred to as the "Lease"), covering the acquisition and lease of certain Equipment described herein (the "Equipment"). It is a requirement of the Lease that the Acquisition Amount in the amount of $2,444,233.00 be deposited into a segregated escrow account under terms satisfactory to Lessor, for the purpose of fully funding the Lease, and providing a mechanism for the application of such amounts to the purchase of and payment for the Equipment.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1. Creation of Escrow Account.

   (a) There is hereby created an escrow fund to be known as the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District Sch1z Escrow Account (the "Escrow Account") to be held by the Escrow Agent for the purposes stated herein, for the benefit of Lessor and Lessee, to be held, disbursed and returned in accordance with the terms hereof.

   (b) Lessee may, from time to time, provide written instructions for Escrow Agent to use any available cash in the Escrow Account to purchase any money market fund or liquid deposit investment vehicle that Escrow Agent from time to time makes available to the parties hereto. Such written instructions shall be provided via delivery to Escrow Agent of a signed and completed Escrow Account Investment Selection Form (such form available from Escrow Agent upon request). All funds invested by Escrow Agent at the direction of Lessee in such short-term investments (as more particularly described in Escrow Agent's Escrow Account Investment Selection Form) shall be deemed to be part of the Escrow Account and subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If any cash is received for the Escrow Account after the cut-off time for the designated short-term investment vehicle, the Escrow Agent shall hold such cash uninvested until the next Business Day. In the absence of written instructions from Lessee (on Escrow Agent's Escrow Account Investment Selection Form) designating a short-term investment of cash in the Escrow Account, cash in the Escrow Account shall remain uninvested and it shall not be collateralized. Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to pay interest on cash in respect of any period during which it remains uninvested. Lessee shall be solely responsible for ascertaining that all proposed investments and reinvestments are Qualified Investments and that they comply with federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances governing investment of such funds and for providing appropriate notice to the Escrow Agent for the reinvestment of any maturing investment. Accordingly, neither the Escrow Agent nor Lessor shall be responsible. 

P270
<!-- Page 270 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
for any liability, cost, expense, loss or claim of any kind, directly or indirectly arising out of or related to the investment or reinvestment of all or any portion of the moneys on deposit in the Escrow Account, and Lessee agrees to and does hereby release the Escrow Agent and Lessor from any such liability, cost, expenses, loss or claim. Interest on the Escrow Account shall become part of the Escrow Account, and gains and losses on the investment of the moneys on deposit in the Escrow Account shall be borne by the Lessee. The Escrow Agent shall have no discretion whatsoever with respect to the management, disposition or investment of the Escrow Account. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for any market decline in the value of the Escrow Account and has no obligation to notify Lessor and Lessee of any such decline or take any action with respect to the Escrow Account, except upon specific written instructions stated herein. For purposes of this Agreement, “Qualified Investments” means any investments which meet the requirements of the applicable laws of the State of California.

(c) Unless the Escrow Account is earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) below, amounts in the Escrow Account shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent in payment of amounts described in Section 2 hereof upon receipt of written instruction(s) from Lessor, as is more fully described in Section 2 hereof. If the amounts in the Escrow Account are insufficient to pay such amounts, Lessee shall provide any balance of the funds needed to complete the acquisition of the Equipment. Any moneys remaining in the Escrow Account on or after the earlier of (i) the expiration of the Acquisition Period or (ii) the date on which Lessee executes an Acceptance Certificate shall be applied as provided in Section 4 hereof.

(d) The Escrow Account shall be terminated at the earliest of (i) the final distribution of amounts in the Escrow Account, (ii) the date on which Lessee executes a Final Acceptance Certificate or (iii) written notice given by Lessor of the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Lease or termination of the Lease due to an Event of Non-appropriation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall not terminate nor shall the Escrow Account be closed until all funds deposited hereunder have been disbursed.

(e) The Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any writing or instrument or signature which it, in good faith, believes to be genuine and may assume the validity and accuracy of any statement or assertion contained in such a writing or instrument. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any manner for the sufficiency or correctness as to form, manner of execution, or validity of any instrument nor as to the identity, authority, or right of any person executing the same; and its duties hereunder shall be limited to the receipt of such moneys, instruments or other documents received by it as the Escrow Agent, and for the disposition of the same in accordance herewith. Notwithstanding and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, Lessee and Lessor, respectively, shall deliver to the Escrow Agent an authorized signers form in the form of Exhibit A-1 (Lessee) and Exhibit A-2 (Lessor) attached hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Escrow Agent is authorized to comply with and rely upon any notices, instructions or other communications believed by it to have been sent or given by the parties or by a person or persons authorized by the parties. The Escrow Agent specifically allows for receiving direction by written or electronic transmission from an authorized representative with the following caveat, Lessee and Lessor agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Escrow Agent against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) (collectively, “Losses”) incurred or sustained by

the Escrow Agent as a result of or in connection with the Escrow Agent’s reliance upon and compliance with instructions or directions given by written or electronic transmission given by each, respectively, provided, however, that such Losses have not arisen from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent, it being understood that forbearance on the part of the Escrow Agent to verify or confirm that the person giving the instructions or directions, is, in fact, an authorized person shall not be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct.

In the event conflicting instructions as to the disposition of all or any portion of the Escrow Account are at any time given by Lessor and Lessee, the Escrow Agent shall abide by the instructions or entitlement orders given by Lessor without consent of the Lessee.

(f) Unless the Escrow Agent is guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct with regard to its duties hereunder, Lessee agrees to and does hereby release and indemnify the Escrow Agent and hold it harmless from any and all claims, liabilities, losses, actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity, or any other expenses, fees or charges of any character or nature, which it may incur or with which it may be threatened by reason of its acting as Escrow Agent under this Agreement; and in connection therewith, does to the extent permitted by law, indemnify the Escrow Agent against any and all expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and the cost of defending any action, suit or proceeding or resisting any claim.

(g) If Lessee and Lessor shall be in disagreement about the interpretation of the Lease, or about the rights and obligations, or the propriety of any action contemplated by the Escrow Agent hereunder, the Escrow Agent may, but shall not be required to, file an appropriate civil action including an interpleader action to resolve the disagreement. The Escrow Agent shall be reimbursed by Lessee for all costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, in connection with such civil action, and shall be fully protected in suspending all or part of its activities under the Lease until a final judgment in such action is received.

(h) The Escrow Agent may consult with counsel of its own choice and shall have full and complete authorization and protection with the opinion of such counsel. The Escrow Agent shall otherwise not be liable for any mistakes of fact or errors of judgment, or for any acts or omissions of any kind unless caused by its willful misconduct.

(i) Lessee shall reimburse the Escrow Agent for all reasonable costs and expenses, including those of the Escrow Agent’s attorneys, agents and employees incurred for non-routine administration of the Escrow Account and the performance of the Escrow Agent’s powers and duties hereunder in connection with any Event of Default under the Lease, any termination of the Lease due to an Event of Non-appropriation or in connection with any dispute between Lessor and Lessee concerning the Escrow Account.

(j) The Escrow Agent or any successor may at any time resign by giving mailed notice to Lessee and Lessor of its intention to resign and of the proposed date of resignation (the “Effective Date”), which shall be a date not less than 60 days after such notice is delivered to an express carrier, charges prepaid, unless an earlier resignation date and the appointment of a successor shall have been approved by the Lessee and Lessor. After the Effective Date, the Escrow Agent shall be under no further obligation except to hold the Escrow Account in accordance with

P272
<!-- Page 272 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

the terms of this Agreement, pending receipt of written instructions from Lessor regarding further disposition of the Escrow Account.

(k) The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibilities, obligations or duties other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement and no implied duties, responsibilities or obligations shall be read into this Agreement.

2. Acquisition of Property.

(a) Acquisition Contracts. Lessee will arrange for, supervise and provide for, or cause to be supervised and provided for, the acquisition of the Equipment, with moneys available in the Escrow Account. Lessee represents the estimated costs of the Equipment are within the funds estimated to be available therefor, and Lessor makes no warranty or representation with respect thereto. Lessor shall have no liability under any of the acquisition or construction contracts. Lessee shall obtain all necessary permits and approvals, if any, for the acquisition, equipping and installation of the Equipment, and the operation and maintenance thereof. Escrow Agent shall have no duty to monitor or enforce Lessee’s compliance with the foregoing covenant.

(b) Authorized Escrow Account Disbursements. It is agreed as between Lessor and Lessee that disbursements from the Escrow Account shall be made for the purpose of paying (including the reimbursement to Lessee for advances from its own funds to accomplish the purposes hereinafter described) the cost of acquiring the Equipment.

(c) Requisition Procedure. No disbursement from the Escrow Account shall be made unless and until Lessor has approved such requisition. Prior to disbursement from the Escrow Account there shall be filed with the Escrow Agent a requisition for such payment in the form of Disbursement Request attached hereto as Schedule 1, stating each amount to be paid and the name of the person, firm or corporation to whom payment thereof is due. All disbursements shall be made by wire transfer. The Escrow Agent is authorized to obtain and rely on confirmation of such Disbursement Request and payment instructions by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated for verifying such requests on Exhibit A-2 (such person verifying the request shall be different than the person initiating the request). The Lessor and Lessee hereby confirm that any call-back performed by Escrow Agent to verify a disbursement instruction pursuant to a Disbursement Request submitted pursuant to this Section 2(c) before release, shall be made to Lessor only and Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to call-back Lessee.

Each such Disbursement Request shall be signed by an authorized representative of Lessee (an “Authorized Representative”) and by Lessor, and shall be subject to the following conditions, which Escrow Agent shall conclusively presume have been satisfied at such time as a requisition executed by Lessee and Lessor is delivered to it:

1. Delivery to Lessor of an executed Disbursement Request in the form attached hereto as Schedule 1; and

2. Delivery to Lessor of copies of invoices (and proofs of payment such invoices, if Lessee seeks reimbursement) and bills of sale (if title to such Equipment has passed to Lessee) therefor as required by Section 3.04 of the Lease and any additional documentation reasonably requested by Lessor.

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

Lessee and Lessor agree that their execution of the form attached hereto as Schedule 1 and delivery of the executed form to Escrow Agent confirms that all of the requirements and conditions with respect to disbursements set forth in this Section 2 have been satisfied.

3. **Deposit to Escrow Account.** Upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in Section 3.04 of the Lease, Lessor will cause the Acquisition Amount to be deposited in the Escrow Account. Lessee agrees to pay any costs with respect to the Equipment in excess of amounts available therefor in the Escrow Account.

4. **Excessive Escrow Account.** Upon receipt of written instructions from Lessor including a representation that one of the following conditions has been satisfied (upon which representation Escrow Agent shall conclusively rely), any funds remaining in the Escrow Account on or after the earlier of (a) the expiration of the Acquisition Period or (b) the date on which Lessee executes an Acceptance Certificate, or upon a termination of the Escrow Account as otherwise provided herein, shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the Lessor in order for the Lessor to apply such funds to amounts owed by Lessee under the Lease in accordance with Section 4.07 of the Lease.

5. **Security Interest.** The Escrow Agent and Lessee acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Account and all proceeds thereof are being held by Escrow Agent for disbursement or return as set forth herein. Lessee hereby grants to Lessor a first priority perfected security interest in the Escrow Account, and all proceeds thereof, and all investments made with any amounts in the Escrow Account. If the Escrow Account, or any part thereof, is converted to investments as set forth in this Agreement, such investments shall be made in the name of Escrow Agent and the Escrow Agent hereby agrees to hold such investments as bailee for Lessor so that Lessor is deemed to have possession of such investments for the purpose of perfecting its security interest.

6. **Control of Escrow Account.** In order to perfect Lessor’s security interest by means of control in (i) the Escrow Account established hereunder, (ii) all securities entitlements, investment property and other financial assets now or hereafter credited to the Escrow Account, (iii) all of Lessee’s rights in respect of the Escrow Account, such securities entitlements, investment property and other financial assets, and (iv) all products, proceeds and revenues of and from any of the foregoing personal property (collectively, the “Collateral”), Lessor, Lessee and Escrow Agent further agree as follows:

(a) All terms used in this Section 6 which are defined in the Commercial Code of the State of California (“Commercial Code”) but are not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Commercial Code, as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

(b) Escrow Agent will comply with all entitlement orders originated by Lessor with respect to the Collateral, or any portion of the Collateral, without further consent by Lessee.

(c) Provided that account investments shall be held in the name of the Escrow Agent, Escrow Agent hereby represents and warrants (i) that the records of Escrow Agent show that Lessee is the sole owner of the Collateral, (ii) that Escrow Agent has not been served with any notice of levy or received any notice of any security interest in or other claim to the Collateral, or

5  
P274
<!-- Page 274 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
any portion of the Collateral, other than Lessor’s claim pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) that Escrow Agent is not presently obligated to accept any entitlement order from any person with respect to the Collateral, except for entitlement orders that Escrow Agent is obligated to accept from Lessor under this Agreement and entitlement orders that Escrow Agent, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) below, is obligated to accept from Lessee.

(d) Without the prior written consent of Lessor, Escrow Agent will not enter into any agreement by which Escrow Agent agrees to comply with any entitlement order of any person other than Lessor or, subject to the provisions of paragraph (e) below, Lessee, with respect to any portion or all of the Collateral. Escrow Agent shall promptly notify Lessor if any person requests Escrow Agent to enter into any such agreement or otherwise asserts or seeks to assert a lien, encumbrance or adverse claim against any portion or all of the Collateral.

(e) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e) and subject to Section 1(b) hereof, Lessee may effect sales, trades, transfers and exchanges of Collateral from the Escrow Account, but will not, without the prior written consent of Lessor, withdraw any Collateral from the Escrow Account. Escrow Agent acknowledges that Lessor reserves the right, by delivery of written notice to Escrow Agent, to prohibit Lessee from effecting any withdrawals (including withdrawals of ordinary cash dividends and interest income), sales, trades, transfers or exchanges of any Collateral held in the Escrow Account. Further, Escrow Agent hereby agrees to comply with any and all written instructions delivered by Lessor to Escrow Agent (once it has had a reasonable opportunity to comply therewith) and has no obligation to, and will not, investigate the reason for any action taken by Lessor, the amount of any obligations of Lessee to Lessor, the validity of any of Lessor’s claims against or agreements with Lessee, the existence of any defaults under such agreements, or any other matter.

(f) Lessee hereby irrevocably authorizes Escrow Agent to comply with all instructions and entitlement orders delivered by Lessor to Escrow Agent.
