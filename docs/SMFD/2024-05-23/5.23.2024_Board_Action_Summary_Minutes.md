# REPORTS

1. **PRESIDENT'S REPORT** - (President Goold)  
   President Goold requested a survey of our region of how other Board Members are compensated and other agencies.

2. **FIRE CHIEF'S REPORT** — (Chief House)  
   Good evening, President Goold, Directors, Colleagues, and Members of the Public.  
   At Metro Fire, we are deeply committed to prioritizing the health and wellness of our personnel, with cancer prevention emerging as a paramount focus area. In light of this commitment, I am eager to report to you this evening;

   **Health & Wellness (Cancer)**  
   Over the course of this week, Metro Fire hosted the Firefighters Cancer Support Network for several information-packed 2-hour sessions in which best practices to minimize the risk of cancer on the fireground, at the station, and at home were discussed. Emphasis was placed on the following areas:  
   1. How to minimize off-duty exposure  
   2. How to prevent/handle fireground exposures  
   3. Station setup and cleaning practices  
   4. Understanding the role of wellness in cancer prevention  
   5. How to receive support for those dealing with cancer  

   As of this afternoon, 224 Metro Fire members have attended this opportunity, and four more sessions will be offered over the next two days.

   **Establishment of Metro Fire Cancer Task Force**  
   Additionally, Metro Fire is in the process of establishing the Metro Fire Cancer Task Force.  
   This initiative will bring together various disciplines involved in cancer prevention, including education, research, prevention, and detection, under the leadership of the Office of the Fire Chief, managed by BC Tony Peck. By uniting these efforts, we aim to enhance our current work while minimizing duplication of efforts.  
   The task force will comprise members from both suppression and non-suppression roles who possess the desire and passion to contribute to this critical endeavor. President Goold suggested including a spouse of a cancer victim on the task force.  
   Members who attended the Firefighters Cancer Support Network Training this week received a brief introduction to the Task Force. An official inaugural meeting for all interested members will follow soon.

   **New Hires**  
   Please join us in welcoming:  
   • Robyn Anderson, hired for the position of Grant Specialist in the Finance Division, effective May 15. Robyn came to the podium and provided a brief personal history to the Board.

Other  
In alignment with the District’s Members Initiative, on May 15-16, Battalion Chief Matt Cole, Captain Pete Votava, Captain Bret Randle and I toured the Wellness Centers at Denver Fire and South Metro Fire Rescue. This visit was similar to the one we made to the Phoenix Fire Department in February of this year. We will continue to tour health and wellness centers nationwide to obtain best practices when designing a centralized resource for physical, emotional, psychological, and life-stage needs.  

** Reminder that district offices will be closed on Monday, May 27, in observance of Memorial Day!  

OPERATIONS REPORT – (Deputy Chief Mitchell)  
Shift Commander Kiley Keeley spoke about the training that B13 did and how he coordinated with state parks, CERT, PIO, dispatch, copter 2, and others to get his whole battalion through in one day. This allowed for crews to practice their tasks and the IC to practice crew accountability and maintaining the big picture. He also mentioned Tablet Command and how the technology in the ICP has proven to be extremely valuable.  

E32 crew discussed the importance of training like this from a crew perspective.  
BC C. Vestal spoke of an upcoming fuel management burn in the Mather area.  

ADMINISTRATIVE REPORT – (Deputy Chief Bailey)  
No Report  

SUPPORT SERVICES REPORT – (Deputy Chief Wagaman)  
No Report  

3. SMFD – FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL 522 REPORT (Firefighter Mike Gildone, Local 522 Director)  
Firefighter Gildone here in place of Sean Scollard. A few weeks ago, most of our Board toured the San Diego Fire Wellness Center, and got some ideas from what they learned about how they handle Workers’ Compensation, Cancer treatment, mental health, etc. Went to the State Assembly to sit in on a Resolution bringing awareness to Firefighter Suicide Awareness Week which was overwhelmingly supported. Thanked the Board as Squad 102 went into service and without your support, I don’t think that would have happened.  

4. COMMITTEE AND DELEGATE REPORTS  
All Committee Meetings will be held at the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District Board Room, 10545 Armstrong Avenue, Mather, California unless otherwise specified.  

A. Executive Committee – (President Goold)

B. Communications Center JPA – (AC Greene)  
The SRFECC Board met on May 14, 2024 and approved the lease of administrative office space, entering into a contract with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 340 (IBEW). The administration team, including executive management of SRFECC, is currently located approximately half a mile from the Center. The separation of personnel was identified in the Strategic Blueprint and Growth Strategy as an opportunity for improvement and it has been recommended to consolidate location of personnel, in addition to preparing SRFECC for Sustained Future Growth.

C. Finance and Audit Committee – (Director Jones)  
Met tonight and received two presentations, the CIP Plan and the Preliminary Budget. Finance has been working proactively on forecasting and planning many years ahead. The CIP Plan and the Preliminary Budget will come to the Board at our June 13th meeting.

D. Policy Committee – (Director Saylors)  
No Report

BOARD MEMBER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS  
Director Saylors – Big thanks to Engine 111, B Shift for getting Old Betsy to the Rio Linda Farm and Tractor Day. Director Saylors requested that the Executive Committee consider that her District borders Placer County and we often go into Placer County and put out fires, she would like to take the Committee with doing a unit history utilization of every fire and medical and that we go in Placer County whether we are dispatched or our crews self-dispatch because we don’t have mutual aid or automatic aid agreements with any agencies in Placer County. Also, would like to take a look at getting the gate/fence removed on Locust Road so that we can get into our District. Since Wildland season has begun, I would like us to keep track of how much time we spend putting out fires in Placer County, not just in our section of Placer County.

Director Jones gave a shout out to the Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD) and the EMS Division for responding to questions from the community. Also, to the Finance Division for always being available to discuss any matters that come up.

Director Rice thanked Firefighter Derrick Sheetz for inviting me to be the master of ceremonies for the last two academies and congratulations to the latest graduating class.

Director Wood thanked you to E61 for coming out to the preschool in Rancho Cordova, the kids were thrilled to have there. Reminder that The Firefighters Burn Institute Luau on the Links will take place on Saturday, June 29, 2024 at Haggin Oaks and tickets are on sale now, please go to https://ffburn.org/.

President Goold welcomed the new staff member Robyn Anderson, hired for the position of Grant Specialist, with your years of experience it sounds like you are the ideal candidate to be in that position. During Capital-to-Capital in April, Chief Mitchell gave a Wildland Fire presentation which scared me, please be careful out there when you work in those horrible environments.
