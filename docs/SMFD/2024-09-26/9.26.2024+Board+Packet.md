**DATE:** September 26, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Purchase Approval - Purchase of Motorola Portable Radios  

**TOPIC**  
Staff requests Board approval for the purchase of APX 6000 Series portable radios from Motorola using Houston-Galveston Area Council (H-GAC) contract RA05-21.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) is a subscriber to Sacramento County's Motorola 800 MHz radio system and utilizes Motorola 800 MHz radios for two-way voice communication between field units and dispatch. To ensure optimal interoperability with Sacramento County's radio system and to meet public safety and mutual-aid demands, utilizing compatible products is a necessity. The District's current portable radios are no longer supported and parts are no longer available for repairs. Since the current radios cannot be repaired, the District would like to purchase 15 radios, some to be assigned to members and some for stock to replace broken equipment.  

H-GAC cooperative agreement RA05-21 will be utilized to purchase these radios. H-GAC is a nationwide, government cooperative procurement program where products are contracted after having been subject to a public competitive bidding process. Cooperative purchasing provides participating agencies increased administrative efficiencies and the power of combined purchasing volume that results in overall cost savings.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Funding for the portable radios is included in this fiscal year's budget.  

| Provider | Product        | Cost       |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Motorola | APX 6000 Series| $107,185.59|

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends that the Board of Director's allow the District to procure the APX 6000 Series Portable Radios from Motorola using H-GAC contract RA05-21.

2. **Compensation** - Grantee shall pay Grantor a lump sum fee of Two Thousand Three Hundred Forty Dollars ($2,340.00) as compensation for the TCE within 30 days of the execution of this document and upon Grantee's receipt from Grantor of the IRS W-9.

4. **Indemnification** - Grantee agrees to indemnify Grantor against any loss and damage which shall be caused by any wrongful or negligent act or omission of Grantee or of its agents or employees in the course of their employment, provided, however, that this indemnity shall not extend to that portion of such loss or damage that shall have been caused by Grantor's comparative negligence or willful misconduct.

5. **Compliance with Laws** - In exercising the rights granted under this TCE, Grantee shall comply with all laws, ordinances, and regulations pertaining to its use.

**DISCUSSION**  
On September 3, 2024, the District received an award notification from FEMA in the amount of $11,805,297 to fully fund the request. The grant award will fund salary and benefits costs for 21 new firefighters over an approximate three-year performance period, ending no later than March 1, 2028.

Grant funding in the amount of $1,085,819 will be added to the FY2024/25 Final Budget. Remaining funding will be budgeted in future fiscal years in accordance with anticipated expenses across the three-year performance period. There is no match requirement.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends adoption of the attached resolution accepting the FY23 SAFER grant and requests that the Board authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to execute all required documents for the administration of the grant award.

**DATE:** September 26, 2024  

**TO:** Board of Directors  

**SUBJECT:** FY2023 Fire Prevention and Safety Grant Award  

**TOPIC**  
Acceptance of a FY2023 Fire Prevention and Safety Grant Award.  

**BACKGROUND**  
On April 12, 2024, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) submitted an application for funding totaling $498,458 through FEMA’s FY2023 Fire Prevention and Safety Grant Program (FP&S) to fund the addition of (1) full-time fire investigator to the District’s Fire Investigations Unit in order to increase the District’s capacity to aggressively investigate every fire.  

**DISCUSSION**  
On September 3, 2024, the District received an award notification from FEMA in the amount of $411,821 to partially fund the request. The grant award will fund salary and benefits for (1) full-time fire investigator over an approximate two-year performance period, ending no later than September 3, 2026. The grant award will also cover costs to train and equip the new investigator.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The $411,821 grant award is comprised of $392,210 in federal funding and a District match requirement of $19,611. Grant funding in the amount of $212,183 will be added to the FY2024/25 Final Budget, with a federal share of $202,079 and a District match of $10,104. Remaining funding will be budgeted in future fiscal years in accordance with anticipated expenses across the two-year performance period.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends adoption of the attached resolution accepting the FY23 FP&S grant, authorizing the Fire Chief or his designee to execute all required documents for the administration of the grant award, and amending the FY2024/25 Position Authorization Document to reflect the added position. Staff further recommends that the Board adopt budget amendment resolutions to add the funding into the District’s FY2024/25 Final Budget.
