The mission of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District is to provide professional and compassionate protection, education and service to our community.

The Governor has declared a State of Emergency to exist in California as a result of the threat of COVID-19 (aka the “Coronavirus”).

The Executive Order also allows local legislative bodies to hold meetings via conference calls while satisfying state transparency requirements.

The Governor has also issued Executive Order N-33-20, prohibiting people from leaving their homes or places of residence except to access necessary supplies and services or to engage in specified critical infrastructure employment.

The Public’s health and well-being are the top priority for the Board of Directors of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District and you are urged to take all appropriate health safety precautions. To facilitate this process, the meeting of the Board will be available via Zoom at the phone number listed above.
