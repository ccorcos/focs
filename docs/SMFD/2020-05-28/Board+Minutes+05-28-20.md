**REPORTS**  
1. **PRESIDENT’S REPORT:**  
   President Sheetz took a moment and addressed the current situation with COVID-19 in regards to remote meetings. The original County Order and Governor's Executive Order still applies to public meetings allowing for remote meetings. Conducting public meetings subject to the Brown Act by personal attendance or gathering is not currently part of the reopening phase, and therefore Metro Fire will continue to hold Board meetings and committee meetings remotely by way of teleconference.  
   When the reopening Phase of the Governor’s order and/or the Sacramento County public health officer order allows these meetings to return to normal attendance in a safe manner as we have done the past, the Board will do so. Hopefully that is something that can occur not too far down the line. Compliance with the orders are mandatory, and the health and safety of Board members, Metro Fire employees, and the public are paramount, and we are looking forward to returning to our regular practices when it is safe to do so.

2. **FIRE CHIEF’S REPORT:**  
   Chief Harms continued with an update on Covid-19 and extended the working remotely option for members who are able to do so, it has worked out really well. Additionally, the antibody testing kits have arrived. So far 177 tests have been administered, with five having positive results, this translates to a 2.8% rate. Overall the response has been very positive and it's a great investment in our folks.  
   He let the Board know the copter was out doing some work in the southern portion of the county, and assisted rescue crews in looking for a missing person from a boat that had overturned.
