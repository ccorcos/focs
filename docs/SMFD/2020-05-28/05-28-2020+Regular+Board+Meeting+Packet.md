The mission of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District is to provide professional and compassionate protection, education and service to our community.

The Governor has also issued Executive Order N-33-20, prohibiting people from leaving their homes or places of residence except to access necessary supplies and services or to engage in specified critical infrastructure employment.

The Public’s health and well-being are the top priority for the Board of Directors of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District and you are urged to take all appropriate health safety precautions.

DC Bridge reports out for Operations. Members are healthy and beginning to schedule training for perishable skills with safe practices in place. They are eager to participate in refresher courses in boat rescue on the American River, as we see people beginning to use the river as a way to get outdoors.

He also shares that strike teams are gearing up, keeping in mind best practices for base camps.

Captain Perryman and the MIH Program have 2 Metro Units in service, they saw 93 patients yesterday. As of April 1st they have seen over 1,000 patients with 10% of them testing positive for Covid-19. DC Bridge is happy to report the PPE is working, as no one working on those units have tested positive.

Giving a snapshot on call volume, we are receiving about 220 calls per day, and increasing approximately 7% per day as we move toward our normal call volume. Transportation rates remain low, as people are nervous about going to the hospital. Engine 53 and Medic 24 are receiving about 18 calls per day.

Director Jones asks about the MIH and if plans are underway to transition the unit to the original concept when Covid-19 winds down. Will we be able to carry on the momentum of using the unit for the pandemic? DC Bridge assures the Board with confidence and excitement being high, they are looking to move forward with all stakeholders.

**DATE:** May 28, 2020  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Medical Aid and Ambulance Transport User Fee Annual Adjustment  

**TOPIC**  
Ordinance # 2017-01 (the Ordinance), which was adopted by the Board of Directors on August 10, 2017, provides for an annual increase in the District’s Medical Aid and Ambulance Transport User Fees. The effective date of the increase would be July 1, 2020.  

**BACKGROUND**  
In order to keep pace with annual cost inflation, the Ordinance specifies that the fees identified in Exhibit “A” of the Ordinance shall be adjusted annually, beginning July 1, 2018, and each July 1st thereafter, by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) Series Title Medical Care in the U.S. City Average, All Urban Consumers, Not Seasonally Adjusted, as published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (the Medical CPI) for the twelve (12) month period ending December 31st of the preceding calendar year. The Ordinance also states that approval by the Board of Directors shall be by resolution, adopted at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board prior to the enactment of the increase.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Based on the percentage change in the annual Medical CPI for calendar year 2019 compared to calendar year 2018, the percentage fee adjustment effective July 1, 2020 would be 2.8%. The current and recommended fees are shown in the table below:

Cal OES Form 130 Instructions

A Designation of Applicant’s Agent Resolution for Non-State Agencies is required of all Applicants to be eligible to receive funding. A new resolution must be submitted if a previously submitted Resolution is older than three (3) years from the last date of approval, is invalid or has not been submitted.

When completing the Cal OES Form 130, Applicants should fill in the blanks on page 1. The blanks are to be filled in as follows:

**Resolution Section:**

**Governing Body:** This is the group responsible for appointing and approving the Authorized Agents. Examples include: Board of Directors, City Council, Board of Supervisors, Board of Education, etc.

**Name of Applicant:** The public entity established under the laws of the State of California. Examples include: School District, Office of Education, City, County or Non-profit agency that has applied for the grant, such as: City of San Diego, Sacramento County, Burbank Unified School District, Napa County Office of Education, University Southern California.

**Authorized Agent:** These are the individuals that are authorized by the Governing Body to engage with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services regarding grants applied for by the Applicant. There are two ways of completing this section:

1. **Titles Only:** If the Governing Body so chooses, the titles of the Authorized Agents could be entered here, not their names. This allows the document to remain valid (for 3 years) if an Authorized Agent leaves the position and is replaced by another individual in the same title. If “Titles Only” is the chosen method, this document must be accompanied by a cover letter naming the Authorized Agents by name and title. This cover letter can be completed by any authorized person within the agency and does not require the Governing Body’s signature.

2. **Names and Titles:** If the Governing Body so chooses, the names and titles of the Authorized Agents would be listed. A new Cal OES Form 130 will be required if any of the Authorized Agents are replaced, leave the position listed on the document or their title changes.

**Governing Body Representative:** These are the names and titles of the approving Board Members. Examples include: Chairman of the Board, Director, Superintendent, etc. The names and titles cannot be one of the designated Authorized Agents, and a minimum of two or more approving board members need to be listed.

**Certification Section:**

**Name and Title:** This is the individual that was in attendance and recorded the Resolution creation and approval. Examples include: City Clerk, Secretary to the Board of Directors, County Clerk, etc. This person cannot be one of the designated Authorized Agents or Approving Board Member (if a person holds two positions such as City Manager and Secretary to the Board and the City Manager is to be listed as an Authorized Agent, then the same person holding the Secretary position would sign the document as Secretary to the Board (not City Manager) to eliminate “Self Certification.”

**TODD HARMS**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** May 28, 2020  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Extension of Metro Fire Aircraft Support Contract with DynCorp  

**TOPIC**  
Proposal to extend the service contract with DynCorp International, LLC (DynCorp) for the maintenance of Metro Fire’s Bell UH-1H helicopters until June 30, 2021, with one option to renew an additional six months until December 31, 2021.  

**SUMMARY**  
The current DynCorp service contract is set to expire on June 30, 2020. The expiration of the current contract falls in the middle of wildfire season; therefore, Air Operations supports a contract commencement period starting the first of the year to prevent a potential interruption in service delivery. DynCorp is willing to extend the current contract for an additional year, plus an additional six month extension, thus having a new expiration date of December 31, 2021. This extension will allow a new contract to commence on January 1, 2022, and will provide the District with the time required to issue a request for proposals from qualified vendors for a new contract.  

**DISCUSSION**  
All conditions of the original contract dated June 9, 2016 and the labor amendment approved March 14, 2019 remain in effect. The changes in the new contract renewal and the extension are the hourly rates for the mechanics.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Upon execution of the contract, Metro Fire would agree to pay DynCorp funds due upon submission of an itemized, signed original invoice, payable within 45 calendar days.
