2. FIRE CHIEF'S REPORT — (Chief House)  
   Good evening, President Goold, Directors, Colleagues, and Members of the Public.  
   This evening, I would like Chief Law to inform you of two significant events that took place recently.  
   - On June 20, a joint investigation between Metro Fire and the Sacramento Sheriff’s Office (SSO) led to the seizure of 8,000 pounds of illegal fireworks at a residence in Sacramento. I want to commend Chief Law, the Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD), our logistics team, and the E50 crew for their outstanding work. I would also like to recognize the EOD team, whose contribution was particularly significant. The sheer volume of 8,000 pounds of fireworks meant a lot of boxes, and their extra hands were crucial in managing this operation. Chief Law stated she was very appreciative of the anonymous tipster.  
   - Additionally, on June 18, our Station 24 crews responded to a series of nuisance fires. Investigator Stanton began the initial investigation and, on June 19, passed the torch to Inspector Christensen. Christensen dedicated the day to canvassing the neighborhood, capturing several videos and still shots of the suspect and operation. On the evening of June 20, the suspect reemerged. Thanks to Christensen's vigilance.  

6.27.2024 Board Meeting Action Summary Minutes

<!-- Page 7 -->
and the efforts of the 24 crew, the suspect was promptly recognized and apprehended. The suspect, an unhoused arson registrant, was subsequently booked by the SSO, with charges filed by the District Attorney based on the compelling evidence gathered.

These events not only highlight the dedication and effectiveness of our teams but also emphasize the significant impact of their work in keeping our community safe and secure. Take care over the July 4th holiday and if you are going to use fireworks, only use “Safe and Sane” legal fireworks.

**DATE:** July 25, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**FROM:** Ty Bailey, Deputy Chief - Administration  
**SUBJECT:** Employer-Employee Relations Resolution  

**TOPIC**  
The Board of Director's approval is requested on the updated Employer-Employee Relations Resolution (EERR).  

**BACKGROUND**  
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District's (District) current EERR, Resolution No. 16 83/84, was developed by the American River Fire District and adopted on November 16, 1983. An EERR provides procedures for meeting and conferring in good faith with recognized employee organizations regarding matters that directly and significantly affect and primarily involve the wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The District in coordination with Local 522, Liebert Cassidy Whitmore, and Mastagni Holstedt have updated the EERR. All parties are in agreement with the language as edited. The EERR establishes procedures to promote full communication between the District and its employees by providing a reasonable method of resolving disputes regarding wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment between the District and its employee organizations. It is the purpose of this resolution to promote the improvement of personnel management and employer-employee relations within the District by providing a uniform basis for recognizing the right of its employees to join organizations of their own choice and be represented by such organizations in their employment relationship with the District.  

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to supersede the provisions of existing State law, ordinances, resolutions and rules which establish and regulate the merit system, or which provide for other methods of administering employer-employee relations. This resolution is intended, instead, to strengthen merit, and other methods of administering employer-employee relations through the establishment of uniform and orderly methods of communication between employees and the District.

Within thirty (30) days of the date written notice was given to affected employees that a valid recognition petition for an appropriate unit has been filed, any other employee organization may file a competing request to be formally acknowledged as the exclusively recognized employee organization of the employees in the same or in an overlapping unit (one which corresponds with respect to some, but not all the classifications or positions set forth in the recognition petition being challenged), by filing a petition evidencing proof of employee support in the unit claimed to be appropriate of at least thirty percent (30%) and otherwise in the same form and manner as set forth in section 1 of this Article IV. If the challenging petition seeks establishment of an overlapping unit, the Employee Relations Officer shall call for a hearing on the overlapping petitions for the purpose of ascertaining the more appropriate unit. The petitioning employee organizations shall have the opportunity to be heard during the hearing. Thereafter, the Employee Relations Officer shall determine the appropriate unit or units in accordance with the standards in section 9 of this Article IV and shall provide written notice of the Employee Relations Officer’s determination.

If the petitioning employee organizations do not agree with the decision rendered by the Employee Relations Officer, the petitioning employee organizations shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of when the notice of such determination is communicated to them by the Employee Relations Officer to amend their petitions to conform to such determination or to appeal such determination pursuant to 12 of this Article IV.

4. **Granting Recognition Without an Election**

If the Petition is in order, and the proof of support shows that a majority of the employees in the unit deemed to be appropriate have designated the petitioning employee organization to represent them, and if no other employee organization filed a challenging petition, the petitioning employee organization and the Employee Relations Officer shall request the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service (“CSMCS”), or another agreed-upon neutral third party, to review the count, form, accuracy and propriety of the proof of support. If the neutral third party makes an affirmative determination, the Employee Relations Officer shall formally acknowledge the petitioning employee organization as the Exclusive Recognized Employee Organization for the designated unit.

5. **Election Procedure**

Where recognition is not granted pursuant to section 4 of this Article IV, then, upon determination of an appropriate unit in accordance with sections 2 and 9 of this Article IV, the Employee Relations Officer shall arrange for a secret ballot election to be conducted and supervised by a party agreed to by the Employee Relations Officer and the concerned employee organization(s), in accordance with such party's rules and procedures subject to the provisions of this Resolution.

In the event that the parties are unable to agree on a third party to conduct an election, the Employee Relations Officer shall request CSMCS to call and conduct a secret ballot election in accordance with its own procedures and regulations and pursuant to the election procedures as herein below set forth. If a challenging petition is filed, and is accompanied by proof of employee approval.

equal to at least ten percent (10%) of the employees within the representation unit, the CSMCS shall include such challenging employee organization on the ballot.

Whenever the CSMCS calls an election pursuant hereto, it shall include the choice of no organization on the ballot. Employees entitled to vote in a representational election shall be those employees within the representation unit whose name appeared on the payroll immediately prior to the date of the election. An employee organization shall be certified by the Employee Relation Officer as the recognized employee organization within the representation unit if:

(1) That employee organization has received the vote of a numerical majority of all the employees eligible to vote in the unit in which the election is held, or,

(2) More than fifty percent (50%) of the total number of employees in the unit eligible to vote have voted in the election, and the employee organization receives a numerical majority of all votes cast in the election, or

(3) In an election involving three or more choices, where none of the choices receives a majority of the ballot votes cast, and where more than a fifty percent (50%) of the total number of employees in the unit eligible to vote have voted in the election, a run-off election shall be conducted between the two choices receiving the largest number of ballot votes cast; the rules governing an initial election being applicable to a run-off election.

There shall be no more than one valid election under this Resolution pursuant to any petition in a 12-month period affecting the same unit.

The costs of conducting elections shall be borne in equal shares by the District and by each employee organization appearing on the ballot.

6. Decertification Procedures

A decertification petition may be filed with the Employee Relations Officer by employees or an employee organization to determine whether or not a recognized employee organization continues to represent a majority of the employees in the representation unit only during the month of March of any year following the first full year of recognition, during the thirty (30) day period commencing one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the termination date of a Memorandum of Understanding then having been in effect less than three (3) years, whichever occurs later, or any time following expiration of a Memorandum of Understanding.

A Decertification Petition may be filed by ten percent (10%) or more of an established bargaining unit or three employees, whichever is more, or their representative, or an employee organization, and shall contain the following information and documentation declared by the duly authorized signatory under penalty of perjury to be true, correct and complete:

a. The name, address and telephone number of the petitioner and a designated representative authorized to receive notices or requests for further information.

<!-- Page 18 -->
![Resolution No. 2024-xxx](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Resolution+No.+2024-xxx)

b. The name of the established appropriate unit and of the incumbent Exclusively Recognized Employee Organization sought to be decertified as a representative of that unit.

c. An allegation that the incumbent Exclusively Recognized Employee Organization no longer represents a majority of the employees in the appropriate unit, and any other relevant and material facts relating thereto.

d. Proof of employee support that at least thirty (30) percent of the employees in the established appropriate unit no longer desire to be represented by the incumbent Exclusively Recognized Employee Organization. Such proof shall be submitted for confirmation to the Employee Relations Officer or to a mutually agreed upon disinterested third party within the time limits specified in the first paragraph of this Section.

An employee organization may file a Petition for Decertification by filing a Recognition Petition that evidences proof of employee support of at least thirty percent (30%) percent, that includes the allegations and information required under this section 6, and otherwise conforms to the requirements of section 1 of this Article IV.

The Employee Relations Officer shall initially determine whether the Petition has been filed in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Article IV. If the Employee Relations Officer determines the Petition does not comply with Article IV, the Employee Relations Officer shall offer to consult with the petitioning employees and/or employee organization. If the Employee Relations Officer's negative determination remains unchanged, the Employee Relations Officer shall return the Petition to the employees or employee organization with a written statement of the reasons for the Employee Relations Officer's determination. The petitioning employees or employee organization may appeal such determination in accordance with section 12 of this Article IV.

If the determination of the Employee Relations Officer is affirmative, or if the Employee Relations Officer's negative determination is reversed on appeal, the Employee Relations Officer shall give written notice of such Decertification or Recognition Petition to the incumbent Exclusively Recognized Employee Organization and to unit employees. Upon request, the Employee Relations Officer shall provide a copy of the Petition.

The Employee Relations Officer shall then arrange for a secret ballot election to be held on or about thirty (30) days after the written notice of Decertification or Recognition to determine the wishes of unit employees as to the question of decertification and, if a Recognition Petition was duly filed hereunder, the question of representation. Such election shall be conducted in conformance with section 5 of this Article IV.

During the "open period" specified in the first paragraph of this section 6, the Employee Relations Officer may, with good reason to believe that a majority of unit employees no longer wish to be represented by the incumbent Exclusively Recognized Employee Organization, notify that organization and all unit employees that the Employee Relations Officer shall arrange for an election to determine that issue. In such event any other employee organization may, within fifteen election to determine that issue. In such event any other employee organization may, within fifteen.

(15) days of such notice, file a Recognition Petition in accordance with this section 6, which the Employee Relations Officer shall act on in accordance with section 10.

If, pursuant to this section 6, a different employee organization is formally acknowledged as the Exclusively Recognized Employee Organization, such organization shall be bound by all the terms and conditions of any Memorandum of Understanding then in effect for its remaining term.

7. Costs of Conducting Elections  
Costs of conducting elections, if any, shall be borne equally by the District and the employee organization(s).

8. Updating Recognized Employee Organization Information  
Recognized employee organizations shall annually, on or before the anniversary date of recognition, file a written statement with the Employee Relations Officer, indicating changes in items (a) through (i) as they appeared in the recognition petition filed pursuant to section 1 of this Article IV, or as subsequently amended by a written statement hereunder, or, as appropriate, shall indicate that there has been no change in such information. The statement shall be signed by the duly authorized officer of the recognized employee organization.

9. Policy and Standards for Determination of Appropriate Units  
The Employee Relations Officer shall maintain a list of all current bargaining units in the District and shall have the management discretion to form and define reasonable bargaining units, based on the procedures specified in this Resolution. The policy objectives in determining the appropriateness of units shall be the effect of a proposed unit on (1) the efficient operations of the District and its compatibility with the primary responsibility of the District and its employees to effectively and economically serve the public, and (2) providing employees with effective representation based on recognized community of interest considerations. These policy objectives require that the appropriate unit shall be the broadest feasible grouping of positions that share an identifiable community of interest.

In considering whether classifications share an identifiable community of interest, the following facts shall be considered:

a. Similarity of the work performed, required qualifications, levels of responsibility, and the general working conditions.

b. History of representation in the District; except that no unit shall be deemed appropriate solely on the basis of the extent to which employees in the proposed unit have organized.

c. Consistency with the organizational patterns and structure of the District.

d. Effect of differing legally-mandated impasse resolution procedures.

<!-- Page 20 -->
![Resolution No. 2024-xxx](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Resolution+No.+2024-xxx)

e. Number of employees and classifications, and the effect on the administration of employer-employee relations created by the fragmentation of classifications and proliferation of units.

f. Effect on the classification structure and impact on the stability of the employer-employee relationship of dividing a single or related classifications among two or more bargaining units.

g. Whether the classifications have managerial, supervisory, and/or confidential responsibilities, as defined in Article III of this Resolution.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, managerial and confidential employees may only be included in a unit consisting solely of managerial or confidential employees respectively. Managerial and confidential employees may not represent any employee organization that represents other employees.

Also, under the MMBA, professional employees have the right to be represented separately from non-professional employees.

The Employee Relations Officer shall, after notice to and consultation with affected employee organizations, allocate new classifications or positions, delete eliminated classifications or positions, and retain, reallocate or delete classifications or positions from units in accordance with the provisions of this Section. The decision of the Employee Relations Officer may be appealed as provided in section 12 of this Article IV.

10. Procedure for Modification of Established Appropriate Units

a. Request for Modification from Employee Organization- Requests by employee organizations for modifications of established appropriate units may be considered by the Employee Relations Officer only during the period specified in section 6 of this Article IV. Such requests shall be submitted in the form of a Recognition Petition and, in addition to the requirements set forth in section 1 of this Article IV, shall contain a complete statement of all relevant facts and citations in support of the proposed modified unit in terms of the policies and standards set forth in section 9 of this Article IV. The Employee Relations Officer shall process such petitions as other Recognition Petitions under this Article IV.

b. Unit Modification by Action of the Employee Relations Officer- The Employee Relations Officer may initiate a unit modification at any time for good cause, including but not limited to when new classifications are adopted, existing classifications abolished, or when classifications are no longer compatible with the existing bargaining unit under the factors of section 9 of this Article IV. The Employee Relations Officer shall give written notice of the proposed modification(s) to any affected employee organization and shall hold a meeting concerning the proposed modification(s), at which time all affected employee organizations shall be heard.

Thereafter the Employee Relations Officer shall determine the composition of the appropriate unit or units in accordance with section 9 of this Article IV, and shall give written notice of such determination to the affected employee organizations. The Employee Relations Officer's determination to the affected employee organizations.

determination may be appealed as provided in section 12 of this Article IV. If a unit is modified pursuant to the motion of the Employee Relations Officer hereunder, employee organizations may thereafter file Recognition Petitions seeking to become the Exclusively Recognized Employee Organization for such new appropriate unit or units pursuant to section 1 of this Article IV.

11. Procedure for Processing Severance Requests  
An employee organization may file a request to become the exclusively recognized employee organization of a unit alleged to be appropriate that consists of a group of employees who are already a part of a larger established unit represented by another exclusively recognized employee organization. The timing, form and processing of such request shall be as specified in section 10 of this Article IV for modification requests.

Provided, however, that nothing herein shall require meeting and conferring between parties to a Memorandum of Understanding during the term of such Memorandum regarding matters to take effect during such term, except that such parties may meet and confer during such term on a matter within the scope of representation where (a) the matter was not covered by the Memorandum or expressly raised as an issue during the meeting and conferring process out of which such Memorandum arose, and (b) there shall have arisen a significant change in circumstances with respect to such matter, which could not have reasonably been anticipated by both parties at the time they signed such Memorandum.

Employees in classifications not included in supervisory and confidential representation units shall not participate in meeting and conferring or grievance resolution processes pertaining to supervisory and confidential representation unit classification.

In the absence of express authorization in advance by the Employee Relations Officer, not more than two District employees representing a recognized employee organization requesting such a meeting shall be entitled to attend without loss of compensation or other benefit, nor shall more

than a total of three representatives for each recognized employee organization be entitled to attend such meetings.

District employees who shall represent a recognized employee organization at such meeting shall give reasonable advance notice thereof to their immediate supervisor, but in no event shall such notice be given less than one full working day or shift before the meeting; except, however, that the Employee Relations Officer may, in his discretion, waive this requirement for advance notice.

2. Impasse Procedures – Impasse procedures are as follows:

(a) If the parties so agree, the dispute shall be submitted directly to the Board of Directors for determination.

(b) If they do not so agree within a reasonable period of time, the dispute shall be submitted to mediation. All mediation proceedings shall be private. The mediator shall make no public recommendation, nor take any public position at any time concerning the issues. If the parties are unable to agree on a mediator after a reasonable period of time, they shall select the mediator from a list of three names to be provided by the CSMCS, or if that body for any reason shall fail to provide such list, by the American Arbitration Association. The recognized employee organization or organizations shall first strike one name, the Employee Relations Officer shall then strike one name, and the name remaining shall be the mediator.

(c) If the parties have failed to resolve all their disputes through mediation within fifteen (15) days after the mediator commenced meeting with the parties, the parties may agree to submit the issues in dispute directly to the Board of Directors. In that event the Board of Directors shall finally determine the issues after conducting a public hearing thereon and after such further investigation of the relevant facts as it may deem appropriate.

(d) If the parties fail to agree to submit the dispute directly to the Board of Directors the disputed issues shall be submitted to fact-finding. The parties may agree on the appointment of one or more fact-finders. If they fail to so agree, a fact-finding panel of three shall be appointed in the following manner: One member of the panel shall be appointed by the Employee Relations Officer, one member shall be appointed by recognized employee organizations, and those two shall name a third, who shall be the chair. If they are unable to agree upon a third, they shall select the third member from a list of five names to be provided by the American Arbitration Association, the one to serve to be determined by the alternate striking of names, with the party who is to strike the first name to be determined by chance method.

The following constitute the jurisdictional and procedural requirements for fact-findings:

(1) Fact-finders shall not have served as mediator in the same impasse under subparagraph b.

(2) Fact-finding is authorized hereunder in connection with all disputed issues that are within the scope of representations.

(3) The Fact-finder(s) shall, in arriving at their findings and recommendations, consider, weigh, and be guided by the criteria set forth in California Government Code section 3504.5(d).

(4) The Fact-finder(s) shall make written finding of fact and recommendations for the resolution of the issues in dispute, which shall be presented in terms of the standards specified in (3) above. The fact-finder or chairman of the fact-finding panel shall serve such findings and recommendations on the Employee Relations Officer and the designated representative of the recognized employee organizations. If these parties have not resolved recommendations upon

**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** July 25, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** General Obligation Bond Measure  

**TOPIC**  
Request to adopt a resolution to put a $415 million general obligation bond measure on the November 2024 ballot.  

**BACKGROUND**  
One of the strategic initiatives identified in the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) Board of Directors 2020 Strategic Plan is identifying and analyzing new revenue sources in order to meet the District’s short- and long-term needs. In consideration of this initiative, staff initiated a revenue measure feasibility study to evaluate potential funding options for critical projects and services and assess the viability and public support for various revenue-raising mechanisms such as taxes, fees, or bonds. The study was intended to aid the District in developing a well-informed strategy to secure adequate resources necessary for providing essential fire protection and emergency medical services to the community.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The District engaged Capitol Public Finance Group LLC to conduct the study, along with their partners at FM3 Research and TeamCivX. The study’s financial analysis identified an unfunded capital need of $415 million over the next ten years, evaluated the feasibility and potential effectiveness of various revenue measures (such as parcel taxes, special assessments, or bond measures), assessed the potential economic impact of various revenue measure options on the community, and ultimately determined a general obligation bond as the optimal mechanism for generating necessary revenue to meet the District’s needs. A voter opinion survey was conducted with a research population of over 600 likely November 2024 voters throughout the District’s jurisdiction, and measured community attitudes and willingness to support a proposed general obligation measure. Results from this research revealed that a solid majority of voters (three in five) are willing to support a $415 million bond measure, with annual tax rates averaging approximately $19/$100,000 of assessed value.  

Based on the results of the revenue measure feasibility study, and in consideration of a growing unfunded capital need, staff recommends that the District move forward with a proposed $415 million general obligation bond measure for the November 2024 ballot.

![Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+2)

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The proposed general obligation bond measure would authorize the District to issue $415 million in bonds over a ten year period, based on expected project expenditure schedule. The maximum term of each series of the bonds will not exceed 30 years and the maximum rate of interest on the bonds will not exceed 12% per annum, in accordance with applicable law. The bonds will be payable from and secured by ad valorem taxes levied and collected in a manner prescribed by applicable law.  

The District will be responsible for paying applicable election fees to Sacramento and Placer counties, currently estimated at a total of approximately $1,000,000.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board adopt the attached resolution ordering a general obligation bond election, and authorizing necessary actions in connection therewith.

**RESOLUTION NO. 2024-XXX**  

**RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN FIRE DISTRICT ORDERING A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND ELECTION, AND AUTHORIZING NECESSARY ACTIONS IN CONNECTION THEREWITH**  

RESOLVED, by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (the "District"), within Sacramento and Placer Counties, California (the "Counties"), as follows:

WHEREAS, the District serves a population of over 720,000 who depend on the District to lend a helping hand in a crisis;

WHEREAS, from medical emergencies, local fire protection, natural disasters, devastating wildfires, or general fire-related neighborhood services, the District answers calls from community members in need 24 hours a day, seven days a week;

WHEREAS, the District actively analyzes and plans for how to best provide service and coverage to the communities it serves and how the condition of its facilities and vehicles impacts those services;

WHEREAS, the District's planning process identified an extensive list of life-saving equipment upgrades, fire station improvements, and fire engine and vehicles replacements necessary to continue to provide rapid 911 response;

WHEREAS, more than 70 percent of 911 calls received are for medical emergencies, such as heart attacks, strokes and car accidents where seconds matter in these life-threatening situations; yet the current state of facilities and equipment, the number of overlapping calls, and station locations place a worsening strain on emergency response times;

WHEREAS, the District is an independent special district for fire protection duly organized and existing under section 13800 et seq. of the California Health and Safety Code (the "Fire Protection District Act");

WHEREAS, by a vote of not less than two-thirds of the voters of the District voting in favor upon a proposition incurring such indebtedness, the District is authorized to issue general obligation bonds pursuant to section 13925 et seq. of the Fire Protection District Act and Article 4.5, commencing with section 53506 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the California Government Code (collectively, together with other applicable state law, the "Bond Law");

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Bond Law, the District intends to issue the Bonds to finance the Projects, generally including (a) construct, expand, reconstruct, relocate, modernize, and improve fire stations to maintain local fire and wildfire protection services, (b) construct, expand, and improve the training facility for first responders to ensure staff is well prepared to respond to fire and emergency medical calls, and (c) acquire and replace life-saving fire and emergency medical response vehicles, apparatus, and capital equipment;

WHEREAS, net proceeds from the sale of the Bonds will be used to finance the Projects, and all expenditures will be subject to annual independent audits and oversight;

WHEREAS, no proceeds of the sale of the Bonds shall be expended for salaries, pensions or benefits of District employees; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to section 10403 et seq. of the California Elections Code, it is appropriate for the Board to request the Boards of Supervisors of the Counties (the "County Boards") to coordinate the election for the Bonds with any and all other elections to be held in the District on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, and to request the Registrars of Voters of the Counties (the "County Registrars") to perform certain election services for the District.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, as follows:

**Section 1.** The Board finds that public interest and necessity demand the acquisition, construction and completion of the Projects and the Board has decided to issue the Bonds, if approved by the District voters, to finance the cost thereof, subject to completion of the proceedings required by the Bond Law.

**Section 2.** The Board hereby calls an election and submits to the electors of the District the question of whether the Bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $415,000,000 shall be issued and sold in one or more series for the purpose of financing the Projects described in Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference, and paying costs and expenses incident thereto, as set forth more fully in the ballot proposition approved pursuant to Section 4 hereof if approved by at least 2/3 of the registered voters voting on the proposition; provided, however, that if Proposition 5 is approved by California voters on the same date that voters of the District are voting on the proposed Bond measure, such measure shall be deemed to be approved if approved by at least 55% of the registered voters voting on the proposition, consistent with the provisions of Proposition 5. The aggregate principal amount of the Bonds shall not exceed 10% of the assessed value of all taxable property within the District. This Resolution constitutes the order of the District to call such election.

**Section 3.** The date of the election shall be November 5, 2024, and the election shall be held solely within the boundaries of the District.

**Section 4.** The purpose of the election shall be for the voters in the District to vote on a bond measure, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. As required by Section 13247 of the Elections Code, the abbreviated form of the measure to appear on the ballot is attached hereto as Exhibit B. The District Fire Chief (the "Fire Chief") in his discretion is hereby P31

# RESOLUTION NO. 2024-XXX  
Page 3  

authorized and directed to make any changes to the text of the proposition as required to conform to any requirements of the County Registrars.  

**Section 5.** The Board hereby certifies that the maximum term of each series of the Bonds shall not exceed 30 years and the maximum rate of interest on the Bonds shall not exceed 12% per annum, which is the maximum interest rate permitted by applicable law. The Bonds shall be payable from and secured by ad valorem taxes levied and collected in the manner prescribed by the laws of the State of California, all equally and ratably secured, without priority, by the taxing power of the District, if two-thirds of all qualified voters voting on the measure vote in favor thereof; provided, however, that if Proposition 5 is approved by California voters on the same date that voters of the District are voting on the proposed Bond measure, such measure shall be deemed to be approved if approved by at least 55% of the registered voters voting on the proposition.  

**Section 6.** The County Registrars are hereby requested to give notice of the election in the Sacramento Bee, as required by the Bond Law and the California Elections Code.  

**Section 7.** The Tax Rate Statement as signed by the Fire Chief and attached hereto as Exhibit C is hereby approved, and the Fire Chief is hereby authorized and directed to deliver such Tax Rate Statement to the County Registrars.  

**Section 8.** The Bond project lists the specific projects the District proposes to finance with proceeds of the Bonds. Listed repairs, rehabilitation projects and upgrades will be completed as needed. Each project is assumed to include its share of costs of the election and bond issuance, architectural, engineering, and similar planning costs, construction management, and a customary contingency for unforeseen design and construction costs. The final cost of each project will be determined as plans are finalized, construction bids are awarded, and projects are completed. In addition, certain construction funds expected from non-bond sources, including State grant funds for eligible projects, have not yet been secured. Therefore the Board cannot guarantee that the bonds will provide sufficient funds to allow completion of all listed projects.  

**Section 9.** The expenditure of Bond proceeds for the financing of the Projects shall be subject to strict financial accountability requirements, including an annual independent financial audit to ensure that Bond proceeds are expended to finance the Projects as authorized by voters. The District will have an annual report prepared describing the funds expended and the projects authorized. The Board shall establish and appoint a citizens' oversight committee (the "Oversight Committee"). The Oversight Committee shall annually review the expenditure of the proceeds of the bonds for the prior year and shall report to the Board whether the proceeds of the Bonds were spent in accordance with the purposes set forth in the ballot measure.  

**Section 10.** No Bond proceeds shall be expended for salaries, pensions or benefits of District employees.  

**Section 11.** The County Registrars are hereby requested to consolidate the election ordered hereby with any and all other elections to be held on November 5, 2024, within the District. The Board acknowledges that such consolidated election will be held and conducted in the manner prescribed in section 10418 of the Elections Code.  

**Section 12.** The members of the Board and the Fire Chief (each, an "Authorized Representative") are hereby authorized, but not directed, to prepare and file with the County Registrars a ballot argument in favor of the proposition within the time established by the County Registrars.  

**Section 13.** Each Authorized Representative and their respective designees are hereby authorized and directed to do any and all things and to execute, deliver, and perform any and all agreements and documents that they deem necessary or advisable in order to effectuate the purposes of this Resolution, including but not limited to such changes to the Exhibits hereto which  

P32

may be necessarily or desirable to correct or finalize such Exhibits. All actions heretofore taken by the officers and agents of the District that are in conformity with the purposes and intent of this Resolution are hereby ratified, confirmed, and approved in all respects.

**Section 14.** The District declares its official intent to reimburse prior expenditures of the District incurred prior to the issuance and sale of the Bonds in connection with the Projects or portions thereof to be financed by the Bonds. The Board declares the District's intent to reimburse the District with the proceeds of the Bonds for the expenditures with respect to the Projects ("Expenditures") made on and after that date that is no more than 60 days prior to adoption of this Resolution. The District reasonably expects on the date of adoption of this Resolution that it will reimburse the Expenditures with the proceeds of the Bonds.

**Section 15.** The identification of the Projects herein and as set forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit B hereto shall not be interpreted as and does not constitute an official approval of any listed project for the California Environmental Quality Act or any other purpose. Furthermore, the listing of the Project does not imply any particular prioritization among such Project components, which is to be determined by the Board.

**Section 16.** This Resolution shall take effect immediately upon its passage.

![EXHIBIT A MEASURE](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=EXHIBIT+A+MEASURE)

The County Registrars are requested to print the full text of the Measure set forth below in the voter information pamphlet to be distributed to voters:

SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN FIRE DISTRICT FIRE/EMERGENCY MEDICAL RESPONSE MEASURE. To maintain 911 fire/emergency medical response times, attract/retain qualified professional firefighters/paramedics, support local fire protection, and prevent firefighter exposure to cancer-causing air pollution by upgrading outdated/deteriorating lifesaving equipment, engines/stations, shall Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District's measure be adopted, authorizing $415,000,000 in bonds at legal rates, levying approximately $19/$100,000 assessed value, generating approximately $24,000,000 annually while bonds are outstanding, with annual audits, citizens’ oversight and local control?

Findings

- The District serves a population of over 720,000 who all depend on the District to lend a helping hand in a crisis.

- From medical emergencies, local fire protection, natural disasters, devastating wildfires, or general fire-related neighborhood services, the District answers calls from community members in need 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

- The District actively analyzes and plans for how to best provide service and coverage to the communities it serves and how the condition of its facilities and vehicles impacts those services.

- The District's planning process identified an extensive list of life-saving equipment upgrades, fire station improvements, and fire engine and vehicle replacements necessary to continue to provide rapid 911 response.

- More than 70 percent of 911 calls received are for medical emergencies, such as heart attacks, strokes, and car accidents where seconds matter in these life-threatening situations; yet the current state of facilities and equipment, the number of overlapping calls, and station locations place a worsening strain on emergency response times.

- The scope and scale of the needs identified in its Capital Improvement Program far exceed the District's current operating budget even as the District sets aside funding each year for capital improvements.

- By law all funds from the proposed bond measure are required to be spent only for the construction, expansion, acquisition, upgrade, and modernization of fire stations, facilities, vehicles, equipment, and real property in communities served by the District and none of the funds may be spent on salaries, benefits, pensions or other purposes.

- All bond measure proceeds are legally required to stay local for the construction, expansion, acquisition, upgrade, and modernization of fire stations, facilities, vehicles, equipment, and real property in the communities served by the District, and none of the money may be seized by the State or other government agencies.

![Object and Purpose of Bonds](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Object+and+Purpose+of+Bonds)

**Object and Purpose of Bonds**

This measure (the "Measure") authorizes the issuance of general obligation bonds (the "Bonds"), the object and purpose of which is to finance the Projects and certain costs in connection with the issuance of the Bonds.

The Projects will be completed as needed, and each is assumed to include its share of costs, including planning and construction costs. The final cost of each Project will be determined as real property is purchased, plans are finalized, construction bids are awarded, or projects are completed.

Proceeds of the Bonds may be used to reimburse the District for amounts advanced from the general fund or other funds or accounts to fund Projects when such purchases are made prior to the availability of Bond proceeds.

**Required Approval**

The Measure shall be deemed approved if approved by at least 2/3 of the registered voters voting on the proposition; provided, however, that if Proposition 5 is approved by California voters on the same date that voters of the District are voting on the proposed Bond measure, such measure shall be deemed to be approved if approved by at least 55% of the registered voters voting on the proposition, consistent with the provisions of Proposition 5.

**Estimated Cost of Projects**

The estimated cost of the portion of the costs of the Projects to be paid for from the Bonds is $415,000,000. The estimated cost includes legal and other fees and the cost of printing the Bonds and other costs and expenses incidental to or connected with the authorization, issuance or sale of the Bonds. The cost of the Projects includes planning and construction costs.

**Principal Amount of Bonds**

The aggregate principal amount of Bonds to be issued in or more series is not to exceed $415,000,000.

**Maximum Interest Rate**

The maximum rate of interest to be paid on the Bonds shall not exceed 12% per annum, the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

**Accountability Requirements**

The following accountability measures apply to the issuance of Bonds pursuant to this Measure:

(a) The specific purpose of the Bonds is to finance the Projects;

(b) The proceeds from the sale of the Bonds will be used only for the purposes specified in this Measure, and not for any other purpose;

(c) The proceeds of the Bonds will be deposited into an account to be created and held by the District;

**Exhibit A**  
P36
<!-- Page 37 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

(e) All expenditures will be subject to oversight by an independent oversight committee, composed of individuals appointed by the Board, to confirm that Bond expenditures are consistent with the intent of this Measure; and

(f) All expenditures also will be subject to an annual independent financial audit to confirm that Bond expenditures are consistent with the intent of this Measure.

**Identification of Tax; Use of Revenue**

The tax imposed by this Measure is an ad valorem tax levied upon taxable real property in the District. The tax will be used to pay the principal and interest on the Bonds.

**Bond Project List**

This Bond Project List describes the specific projects the District proposes to finance with proceeds of the bonds.

In order to meet all identified facility needs, the District intends to complete projects using a combination of funding sources, including contributions, development impact fees, medical aid and ambulance transport fees, District Capital Improvement Program budget allocations, and grant funding (if available). Approval of this measure does not guarantee that all projects on this Bond Project List will be funded beyond the local revenues generated by this measure.

Proceeds from the sale of bonds authorized by this measure shall be used only for the construction, expansion, reconstruction, rehabilitation, replacement, furnishing, and equipping of fire facilities, the acquisition or lease of real property for fire facilities, and the acquisition or lease of fire and emergency medical vehicles, apparatus, and capital equipment, all as listed on the Bond Project List. Specific projects to be funded by the bond measure include, without limitation, the following:

**A. Fire Station Construction, Expansion, and Improvement Projects**

- Construct, expand, reconstruct, relocate, modernize, and/or improve fire stations, including:
  - New fire stations in Vineyard, North Highlands, and Rancho Cordova areas of the District
  - Expansion and/or relocation of existing fire stations in North Highlands, Rancho Cordova, Mather, Citrus Heights, Florin, and Carmichael, or other District stations that are found to be inadequate to serve the District's service population

- Acquire land, as needed, for the construction and/or relocation of fire stations;

- Remove or replace existing, inadequate fire station buildings as needed; and

- Perform infrastructure improvements and site-work related to fire station construction, expansion, reconstruction, relocation, and improvement projects.

**B. Training Facility Construction and Expansion Project**

- Continue the construction of the Zinfandel First Responder Training Facility in Rancho Cordova, including training classrooms, training structures and towers, vehicle operations training course, training offices, and other facilities and ground improvements needed for first responder training; and

**Exhibit A**  
P37
<!-- Page 38 -->
* Perform infrastructure improvements and site-work related to training facility construction and improvement projects.

C. Fire and Emergency Vehicles, Apparatus, and Equipment Acquisition and Replacement Projects

* Acquire and/or replace life-saving fire and emergency medical vehicles, apparatus, and capital equipment.

For any project involving modernization or renovation of a building or the major portion of a building, the District shall be authorized to proceed with new replacement construction if the Board of Directors determines that replacement and new construction is economically more practical considering the building’s age, condition and other relevant factors.

The listed projects will be completed as needed. Each project is assumed to include its share of furniture, equipment, architectural, engineering, and similar planning costs, program management, staff training expenses and a customary contingency, and escalation for unforeseen design and construction costs.

The budget for each project is an estimate and may be affected by factors beyond the District’s control. The final cost of each project will be determined as plans are finalized, construction bids are awarded, and projects are completed. Based on the final costs of each project, certain of the projects described above may be delayed or may not be completed. Demolition of existing facilities and reconstruction of facilities scheduled for repair and upgrade may occur, if the Board determines that such an approach would be more cost-effective in creating enhanced and operationally efficient facilities. Necessary site preparation/recreation and landscaping may occur in connection with new construction, expansion, renovation or remodeling, including ingress and egress, removing, replacing, or installing irrigation, utility lines, trees and landscaping, redirecting fire access, and acquiring any necessary easements, licenses, or rights of way to the property.

Bond proceeds shall be expended only for the specific purposes identified herein. Proceeds of the bonds may be used to pay or reimburse the District for the cost of District staff when performing work on or necessary and incidental to the bond projects, but not for other administrator salaries.

**ABBREVIATED MEASURE**

The County Registrars are requested to cause the exact wording of the following abbreviation of the Measure to appear on the ballot:

**SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN FIRE DISTRICT FIRE/EMERGENCY MEDICAL RESPONSE MEASURE.** To maintain 911 fire/emergency medical response times, attract/retain qualified professional firefighters/paramedics, support local fire protection, and prevent firefighter exposure to cancer-causing air pollution by upgrading outdated/deteriorating lifesaving equipment, engines/stations, shall Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District’s measure be adopted, authorizing $415,000,000 in bonds at legal rates, levying approximately $19/$100,000 assessed value, generating approximately $24,000,000 annually while bonds are outstanding, with annual audits, citizens’ oversight and local control?

<!-- Page 40 -->
![EXHIBIT C TAX RATE STATEMENT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=EXHIBIT+C+TAX+RATE+STATEMENT)

An election will be held in the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (the "District") on November 5, 2024, to authorize the sale of up to $415,000,000 in bonds of the District for the specific projects listed in the Bond Project List established by the District, as described in the proposition. If the bonds are authorized, the District expects to sell the bonds in two or more series. Principal and interest on the bonds will be payable from the proceeds of tax levies made upon the taxable property in the District. The following information is provided in compliance with sections 9400-9404 of the California Elections Code.

1. The best estimate from official sources of the average annual tax rate that would be required to be levied to fund that bond issue over the entire duration of the bond debt service, based on assessed valuations available at the time of the election or a projection based on experience within the same jurisdiction or other demonstrable factors is 19 cents per $100 of assessed valuation ($19 per $100,000 of assessed valuation) of all property to be taxed. The best estimate of the final fiscal year in which the tax is anticipated to be collected is 2060-61.

2. The best estimate from official sources of the highest tax rate that would be required to be levied to fund that bond issue, and an estimate of the year in which that rate will apply, based on assessed valuations available at the time of the election or a projection based on experience within the same jurisdiction or other demonstrable factors is 33 cents per $100 of assessed valuation ($33 per $100,000 of assessed valuation) of all property to be taxed. The best estimate of the year in which the highest tax rate will apply is anticipated to be 2036-37.

3. The best estimate from official sources of the total debt service, including the principal and interest, that would be required to be repaid if all the bonds are issued and sold is $890,000,000.

Voters should note that such estimated tax rates are specific to the repayment of bonds issued under this authorization and are and will be in addition to tax rates levied in connection with other bond authorizations approved or to be approved by local voters for the District or for any other overlapping public agency.

Voters should note that estimated tax rate is based on the ASSESSED VALUE of taxable property on the Sacramento County's and the Placer County's official tax rolls, not on the property's market value. Property owners should consult their own property tax bills to determine their property's assessed value and any applicable tax exemptions.

Attention of all voters is directed to the fact that the foregoing information is based upon the District's projections and estimates only, which are not binding upon the District. The actual tax rates and the years in which they will apply may vary from those presently estimated, due to variations from these estimates in the timing of bond sales, the amount of bonds sold and market interest rates at the time of each sale, and actual assessed valuations over the term of repayment of the bonds. The dates of sale and the amount of bonds sold at any given time will be determined by the District based on need for construction funds and other factors. The actual interest rates at which the bonds will be sold will depend on the bond market at the time of each sale. Actual future assessed valuation will depend upon the amount and value of taxable property within the District as determined by the Sacramento County Assessor and the Placer County Assessor in the annual assessment and the equalization process.
