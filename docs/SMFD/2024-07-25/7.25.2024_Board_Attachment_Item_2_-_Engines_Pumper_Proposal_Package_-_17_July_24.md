   g. “GSFA” means Golden State Fire Apparatus, Inc., a California corporation.  
   h. “Manufacturer” means the person or persons, company, firm, corporation, partnership, or other organization identified in the Product Proposal as responsible for manufacturing the Product.  
   i. “Party” or “Parties” means GSFA and/or Customer, as applicable.  
   j. “Predelivery Service” means the Products and/or Services that will be provided by GSFA after transportation of the Product(s) from the manufacturing facility and prior to Final Delivery or Pick-Up.  
   k. “Prepayment Discount” means a discount to the purchase price for the Product granted to Customer in connection with Customer’s advance payment of the Grand Total Purchase Price (or portion thereof, as specified in the Product Proposal).  
   l. “Product” means the fire apparatus(es) and any associated equipment listed in the Product Proposal and further described in the Specifications.  
   m. “Product Completion” means the fire apparatus(es) in the Product Proposal and further described in the Specifications being ready for final inspection by Customer at the manufacturing facility.

   p. “Specifications” means the specifications for the Product attached to the Product Proposal as Exhibit B.  
   q. “Terms and Conditions” means these Standard Terms and Conditions, which are attached to the Product Proposal as Exhibit A.  

2. Purchase and Payment.

   a. **Purchase.** Customer agrees to purchase the Product at the Grand Total Purchase Price (as such amount may be adjusted in accordance with these Terms and Conditions), pursuant to the payment terms set forth in the Product Proposal. The Grand Total Purchase Price is payable in U.S. dollars.  

   b. **Contingency Reserve Fund.** The Grand Total Purchase Price may include an amount to be set aside for the purpose of funding any future costs or financial obligations incurred by Customer under the Product Proposal or any valid Change Order(s) (the “Contingency Reserve Fund”). If applicable, the amount of any required Contingency Reserve Fund will be set forth in either the Product Proposal or Exhibit D. The Contingency Reserve Fund may be withdrawn against by Customer or GSFA for the purpose of satisfying Customer’s payment obligations under the initial Product Proposal or any valid Change Order(s) (including, without limitation, a Change Order submitted by GSFA pursuant to Section 8.b). If a Contingency Reserve Fund is required under the Agreement, the amount of such fund is not intended as an estimate of the actual additional costs of contingencies, Change Orders, unforeseen items or other required work that may be incurred under the Agreement after submission of the Product Proposal to  

1
<!-- Page 12 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
Customer, which amounts Customer acknowledges may exceed the Contingency Reserve Fund amount. The balance of any Contingency Reserve Fund will be credited against Customer’s payment obligations, or otherwise returned to Customer within thirty (30) calendar days of delivery of all Products under the Agreement (provided that Customer has paid all amounts owed under the Agreement as of such date).

c. Prepayment Discount. If GSFA has granted Customer a Prepayment Discount, Customer must provide each associated prepayment (each, a “Prepayment”) within the time frame specified in the Product Proposal in order to receive such discount. Customer’s failure to timely make such Prepayment may result in: (i) GSFA’s termination of the Agreement; and/or (ii) Customer’s loss of the Prepayment Discount for the portion of the Grand Total Purchase Price represented by such outstanding Prepayment and the application of a late fee as set forth in Section 6, in each case in GSFA’s sole discretion.

d. Sales Tax. Customer shall be responsible for the cost of state sales tax associated with, or attributable to, the Product. The taxes stated in the Product Proposal are subject to adjustment for the applicable state sales tax rate in effect at the time of delivery. Therefore, the sales tax set forth on the Product Proposal is only an estimate of such taxes and will be increased or decreased at the time of delivery if a change in the applicable sales tax rate has occurred, in which case Customer shall pay GSFA (or be refunded by GSFA) the difference in the applicable sales tax.

3. Product Completion Date. Within thirty (30) calendar days of the date on which the last required signatory executes the Product Proposal (such date, the “Executed Date”), GSFA shall submit to Customer a tentative Product completion date (which may differ from the Product completion estimate contained in the Product Proposal). Due to global supply chain constraints, any Product completion date contained herein, or in the Product Proposal, or otherwise provided to Customer, is a good faith estimate only as of the date provided to Customer, and merely an approximation based on current information available to GSFA and Manufacturer. Customer shall not be entitled to rely on any such estimate, and GSFA shall have no liability to Customer for a failure by GSFA to meet any such estimate. All Product completion estimates are subject to modification and, if applicable, GSFA will provide updates to such estimates to Customer when available. If the product is not available for delivery on the Product Completion Date, no additional costs, fees, or charges shall be billed to or attributable to Customer in the Grand Total Purchase Price solely by reason of failure to meet the Product Completion Date, including but not limited to any costs identified in Section 8 below.

4. Stock / Demo Units. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in the Agreement (including Section 12 hereof concerning warranties), any Products constituting stock/demo unit(s) are sold to Customer on an as-is, first-come and first-served basis and GSFA makes no further representation or warranty to any customer with respect to such unit(s). Regardless of the terms of the Product Proposal, GSFA shall only be obligated to sell such stock/demo unit(s) to the first customer to enter into a purchase agreement with GSFA identifying such unit(s), and after the execution by GSFA of such agreement any subsequent purchase agreement (including the Agreement, as applicable) shall have no further force or effect with respect to such unit(s).

5. Multiple Unit Purchase. If the Grand Total Purchase Price includes pricing for multiple Products, the Product price stated in the Product Proposal shall only be valid if the quantity of Products being proposed are purchased at the same time, pursuant to the same Agreement. GSFA shall have no obligation to offer the same price for any Product if purchased by Customer pursuant to a later purchase agreement.

6. Late Fee; Storage Fee. A late fee equal to 0.033% of the outstanding portion of the Grand Total Purchase Price will be charged for each calendar day for overdue payments beginning ten (10) calendar days after the payment is due and continuing for the first thirty (30) calendar days thereafter. After such thirty (30) calendar day period, the late fee shall increase to 0.044% per calendar day until payment of the outstanding portion of the Grand Total Purchase Price is received. Any such charges shall not exceed the statutory limit for such charges pursuant to California Government Code 926.10. If Customer is unable to satisfy the delivery requirements hereunder or is unwilling to take delivery of the Product, then GSFA shall be entitled to a storage charge running from the earlier of: (i) the date of delivery agreed to between GSFA and Customer (provided GSFA is willing and able to deliver the Product on such date), or  
2
<!-- Page 13 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

(ii) twenty-one (21) calendar days after GSFA notifies Customer that the Product is available for delivery. The storage charge is equal to: (i) $175.00 per calendar day per apparatus stored, or (ii) the actual charges incurred by GSFA with a third party for storage of the Product, whichever is greater. Such storage charge shall continue until the actual time of delivery and Customer’s possession of the Product, and any such storage by GSFA or such third party shall be at the sole risk of Customer.

7. Delivery; Inspection and Acceptance.

a. Delivery. Subject to Section 5 hereof, the Product is scheduled to be delivered to the location and within the time period specified in the Product Proposal. Such delivery date is an estimate, and GSFA is, notwithstanding this Section 7.a, not bound to such date unless it otherwise agrees in a separate writing to complete delivery by a date certain. For the avoidance of doubt, GSFA is not responsible for delivery delays caused by or because of actions, omissions or conduct of Customer, the Manufacturer, or their respective employees, affiliates, suppliers, contractors, and carriers. Risk of loss for the Product shall pass to Customer at the point and time of delivery (which shall include attempted delivery by GSFA which cannot be completed due to any act of Customer). However, title to the Product shall only pass to Customer upon delivery if Customer has then fully paid GSFA all amounts due hereunder (including additional amounts due under any valid Change Order). Absent GSFA’s separate written agreement, which it may or may not provide in its sole and absolute discretion, delivery of the Product will not occur before Customer has fully paid all amounts due under the Agreement and provided proof of insurance reasonably satisfactory to GSFA. If GSFA permits Customer to take possession of the Product, Customer may not mount equipment, conduct training, or place the Product into service until all amounts due under the Agreement have been paid. If Customer has ordered multiple Products, GSFA reserves the right to deliver such Products in installments and to separately invoice Customer for such Products.

b. Inspection and Acceptance. Upon delivery, Customer shall have ten (10) calendar days within which to inspect the Product for substantial conformity to the Specifications and in the event of non-substantial non-conformance (“Notice of Nonconformance to Specifications”). Contingent upon great availability and Customer’s cooperation, any Product not in substantial conformity to material Specifications shall be remedied by GSFA (by repair or replacement, at GSFA’s election) within thirty (30) calendar days from GSFA’s receipt of the Notice of Nonconformance to Specifications. In the event GSFA does not receive a Notice of Nonconformance to Specifications within ten (10) calendar days of delivery, the Product will be deemed to be in conformance with Specifications and accepted by Customer.

8. Changes to Agreement Terms.

a. Change Orders. The Customer may request that GSFA incorporate a change to the Product or the Specifications for the Product, or GSFA may submit changes to the Agreement required or permitted to be made by GSFA (pursuant to Section 8.b or otherwise) by delivering a written Change Order to the other party hereto, which shall include a description of the proposed change sufficient to permit the receiving party to evaluate such change (either, a “Change Order”). For any Change Order submitted by Customer, GSFA will provide Customer a written response (a “Response”) stating (i) whether GSFA will accommodate such Change Order (which GSFA may decide in its sole and absolute discretion); and (ii) the terms of the modification to the order, including any increase or decrease in the Grand Total Purchase Price resulting from such Change Order, a date on which any increase in the Grand Total Purchase Price must be paid, and an estimate of any effect on production scheduling or delivery resulting from such Change Order. Customer shall have seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the Response to notify GSFA as to whether Customer desires to make the changes GSFA has approved in the Response. In the event Customer countersigns GSFA’s Response, Customer shall pay the increase (or be refunded the decrease) in the Grand Total Purchase Price by the date specified in the Response. GSFA may also send Customer a Change Order to account for any changes to the Agreement required or permitted to be made by GSFA (including those changes required pursuant to Section 8.b hereof), and such Change Order shall be effective upon delivery to Customer unless Customer elects to terminate the applicable Product order under the Agreement in accordance with Section 9.
<!-- Page 14 -->
![Document](https://www.bls.gov)  
**b. Additional Changes.**

**i. Component Price Volatility; Increases Imposed by Manufacturer.** GSFA shall not be responsible for (i) any unforeseen price increase or surcharge enacted by suppliers of major components of the Product (including but not limited to commercial chasiss, engine, transmission, and fire pump); or (ii) price increases imposed on GSFA by Manufacturer pursuant to Manufacturer’s terms and conditions for sale of the Product (a “Manufacturer Price Increase”), after Customer becomes bound by the Agreement. Customer shall be responsible for all amounts arising from any price increases for major components of the Product (including all associated taxes and fees thereon) for the Product or any Manufacturer Price Increases occurring after the execution of the Agreement which increases the cost of the Product to GSFA, and such amounts will be documented on a Change Order adjusting the Grand Total Purchase Price accordingly. Customer shall pay any such price increase prior to Product delivery. A Manufacturer Price Increase may include, but shall not be limited to, an increase in Product price resulting from an increase in the Producer Price Index of Components for Manufacturing (see www.bls.gov Series ID: WPDUI6112) in excess of a compounded annual growth rate of five percent (5%), as measured between the month Manufacturer accepts the applicable Product order and the month that is fourteen (14) months prior to the then-current estimated Product completion date (the foregoing, a “PPI-Based Price Increase”). If, upon Customer’s receipt of a Change Order reflecting a PPI-Based Price Increase, Customer elects to terminate the applicable Product Order in accordance with Section 8.b.iii rather than pay such increase, then in lieu of the cancellation fees described in Section 9.a hereof GSFA shall be entitled to recover and Customer shall pay GSFA’s actual non-reimbursable costs incurred in connection with the Product order through the date of Customer’s termination of such Product order.

**ii. New Legal Standards.** In the event the Product design, materials or specifications require an alteration arising from new regulations issued by any governmental entity or trade association, including, but not limited to, the NFPA, DOT, and EPA, and such alteration increases the cost of the Product to GSFA, Customer shall be responsible for changes to the Grand Total Purchase Price arising from such alteration. GSFA shall promptly notify Customer when it becomes aware of any potential or required change in regulations occurring prior to delivery that would impact the Product purchased.

**iii. Change Orders.** Customer shall execute any Change Order submitted by GSFA documenting any of the changes required or permitted by Sections 8.b.i and 8.b.ii above (which shall, to the extent practicable, itemize any increases in the Grant Total Purchase Price and specify a commercially reasonable date by which Customer may pay such increase), unless Customer instead elects to terminate the applicable Product order under the Agreement within fifteen (15) calendar days of Customer’s receipt of such Change Order and in accordance with Section 9. Absent such a termination, failure to execute a Change Order does not alter Customer’s obligations under this Section 8.b.

**c. Changes in Commercial Specifications.** Specifications for all components of the Product manufactured by companies other than the Manufacturer are subject to change without notice. Specifications for such components will be as available at the time of manufacture of the Product. GSFA shall not be liable for any deviations in such specifications arising from a substitution of components or changes in the design of any component by their original manufacturer.

**9. Termination.**

**a. By Customer.** Customer may terminate a Product order identified in the Product Proposal or a Change Order by providing written notice to GSFA in accordance with Section 16 hereof. If Customer elects to terminate a Product order, Customer shall pay GSFA a cancellation fee as follows: (a) after the Product order is accepted and entered by GSFA, 10% of the portion of the Grand Total Purchase Price applicable to such Product (including all associated taxes, fees and costs) (such amount, the “Product Purchase Price”); (b) after completion of the pre-construction phase of the order process, 20% of the Product Purchase Price; and (c) after the requisition of any materials or commencement of any manufacturing or assembly of the Product by either GSFA or Manufacturer but before substantial completion of such Product, 50% of the Product Purchase Price. Customer shall not be permitted.
<!-- Page 15 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image) 

to terminate a Product order after substantial completion of manufacturing and assembly of such Product (excluding any Dealer Preparation or other pre-delivery services or product customization, if applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable tier of cancellation fee is not sufficient to cover all actual costs and fees incurred by GSFA with Manufacturer in connection with Customer’s termination of the Product order (“Manufacturer Termination Fees”), then in addition to such cancellation fee Customer shall pay the balance of all Manufacturer Termination Fees. If Customer received a Prepayment Discount, such discount shall not be considered for the purpose of calculating the above cancellation fee. The tier of cancellation fee applicable to any cancellation, as well as the determination of whether a Product has reached substantial completion, shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of GSFA. Customer may request a fee waiver, and GSFA, in its sole discretion, may agree to waive and/or adjust such fee. GSFA will return the balance of the Grand Total Purchase Price or Product Purchase Price, as applicable, within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of the cancellation of the Product order or termination of the Agreement.

Customer may terminate the Agreement for an Event of Default by GSFA after providing GSFA with written notice in accordance with Section 16 (which notice shall describe with reasonably particularity the Event of Default justifying such termination) if such Event of Default remains uncured (if capable of cure) thirty (30) days following GSFA’s receipt of such notice; provided, however, that the foregoing cure period shall continue if and for so long as GSFA has commenced and is continuing to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to cure such Event of Default as promptly as reasonably practicable.

b. By GSFA. GSFA may terminate the Agreement for an Event of Default by Customer after providing Customer with written notice in accordance with Section 16 (which notice shall describe with reasonably particularity the Event of Default justifying such termination) if such Event of Default remains uncured (if capable of cure) thirty (30) days following Customer’s receipt of such notice; provided, however, that the foregoing cure period shall continue if and for so long as Customer has commenced and is continuing to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to cure such Event of Default as promptly as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GSFA may terminate the Agreement effective immediately upon written notice to Customer of Customer’s failure to pay any amount owed under the Agreement when due.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if Customer terminates a Product order in accordance with Section 9.a above, GSFA may elect to instead terminate the Agreement upon notice to Customer in accordance with Section 16 hereof. If GSFA terminates the Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.b, Customer shall pay the applicable tier of cancellation fee for all Products pursuant to Section 9.a above as if Customer had elected to terminate each applicable Product order.

c. Based on Discontinuation or Cancellation by Manufacturer. In the event that Manufacturer cancels a Product order (provided that such cancellation is not the result of an act by Customer in violation of the Agreement) or discontinues the manufacture of a Product prior to its completion and delivery: (i) if such Product is the only Product contemplated under the Agreement, then the Agreement shall terminate; or (ii) if additional Products are contemplated under the Agreement, then only the Product order for the applicable cancelled or discontinued Product shall be terminated. Such Agreement termination or Product termination, as applicable, shall be effective upon GSFA’s written notice to Customer of such cancellation or discontinuance in accordance with Section 16 hereof. GSFA’s only obligation to Customer in such event shall be the return of any Prepayment paid by Customer for the cancelled or discontinued Product. For the avoidance of doubt, the cancellation fees contemplated in Section 9.a hereof shall not apply in the event of a termination pursuant to this Section 9.c.

10. Customer’s Obligations. Customer shall provide its timely and best efforts to cooperate with GSFA and Manufacturer during the Product manufacturing process. Reasonable and timely cooperation includes, without limitation, Customer’s providing timely information in response to any requests from Manufacturer or GSFA and the participation of Customer’s authorized representatives in traveling to Manufacturer’s facility for inspections and approval of the Product, including a final approval before the Product leaves Manufacturer’s facility.

14. **Indemnification of GSFA.** Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless GSFA, its agents, servants, successors and assigns from and against all losses, damages, injuries, claims, demands and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, of whatever nature (“Damages”), to the extent Damages arise out of or in connection with: (i) Customer’s breach of the Agreement, or (ii) Customer’s use, storage, or operation of the Product following delivery, regardless of where, how, and by whom operated (excluding any negligent operation by GSFA). The indemnification and assumptions of liability and obligation herein provided shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination of the Agreement, whether by expiration of time, by operation of law or otherwise. This provision is not intended to and shall not constitute the exclusive remedy of the Parties under the Agreement; the Parties may seek indemnity from one another under other legal principles, whether based in equity or law, as long as they do not nullify or cancel the effects of this paragraph. This provision does not apply to any claims or actions by any employee of Customer against GSFA for which GSFA seeks indemnification from Customer for those claims.

**ProposalText**  
Golden State Fire Apparatus Inc is pleased to submit a proposal to Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District for a Pierce® triple combination pumper per your request for quotation. The following paragraphs will describe in detail the apparatus, construction methods, and equipment proposed. This proposal will indicate size, type, model and make of components parts and equipment, providing proof of compliance with each and every item (except where noted) in the departments advertised specifications.  

PIERCE MANUFACTURING was founded in 1913. Since then we have been building bodies with one philosophy, "BUILD THE FINEST". Our skilled craftsmen take pride in their work, which is reflected in the final product. We have been building fire apparatus since the early "Forties" giving Pierce Manufacturing over 75 years of experience in the fire apparatus market. Pierce Manufacturing has built and put into service more than 62,500 apparatus, including more than 93,000 on Pierce custom chassis designed and built specifically for fire and emergency applications. Our Appleton, Wisconsin facility has over 870,000 total square feet of floor space situated on approximately 105 acres of land. Our Bradenton, Florida facility has 300,000 square feet of floor space situated on approximately 38 acres of land. Our beliefs in high ethical standards are carried through in all of our commitments and to everyone with whom we do business. Honesty, integrity, accountability and citizenship are global tenets by which we all live and work. Consequently, we neither engage in, nor have we ever been convicted of price fixing, bid rigging, or collusion in any domestic or international fire apparatus market.  

Pierce has only one brand of fire apparatus "Pierce", ensuring you are receiving top of the line product that meets your specification. In accordance with the current edition of applicable NFPA standards, this proposal will specify manufactured in Pierce owned manufacturing facilities. This includes the chassis, pump module and body.  

**GENERAL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION**  
To control quality, ensure compatibility, and provide service for and warranty the custom cab, chassis, pump module and body will be entirely designed, assembled and painted in Pierce owned manufacturing facilities. This includes the chassis, pump module assembly, and the pumphouse module assembly.  

**QUALITY AND WORKMANSHIP**  
Pierce has set the pace for quality and workmanship in the fire apparatus field. Our tradition of building the highest quality units with craftsmanship second to none has been the right from the beginning and we demonstrate that ongoing commitment by our certified welders following American Welding Society D1.1-2004 recommendations for structural welding. All aluminum welding follows American Welding society and D1.2-2004 requirements for structural welding of aluminum. All sheet metal welding follows American Welding Society D1.3-2004 requirements for structural welding of sheet metal. Our flux core welding uses alloy rods, type 7000 and is performed to American Welding Society standards A2.26-2701. Furthermore, all employees classified as welders are tested and certified to American Welding Society codes upon hire and every three (3) years thereafter. Pierce also employs an American Welding Society certified welding inspector in part during work for the module and quality. Pierce Manufacturing operates a Quality Management System according to ISO 9001. These standards sponsored by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) specify the quality systems that are established by the manufacturer for design, installation and service. A copy of the certificate of compliance is available with this proposal. In addition to the Quality Management system, we also employ the Six Sigma quality program to ensure the vendors and suppliers that we utilize meet the high standards we set. That is just part of our overall "Quality at the Source" program at Pierce. To demonstrate the quality of our products and services, a list of at least fifteen (15) departments/municipalities that have purchased vehicles for a second time is provided.  

**DELIVERY**  
The apparatus will be delivered under its own power to ensure proper break-in of all components while the apparatus is still under warranty. A qualified delivery representative shall deliver the apparatus and remain on hand for a sufficient length of time to instruct personnel in proper operation, care and maintenance of the equipment delivered.

|             | A vehicle control system will be provided as an integral part of ABS brake system from Wabco. The system will monitor and update the lateral acceleration of the vehicle and compare it to a critical threshold where a side roll event may occur. If the critical threshold is met, the vehicle control system will automatically reduce engine RPM, engage the engine retarder (if equipped), and selectively apply brakes to the individual wheels of the front and rear axles to reduce the possibility of a side roll event. The system will monitor directional stability through a lateral accelerometer, steering angle sensor and yaw rate sensor. If spinout or drift is detected, the vehicle control system will selectively apply brakes to the individual wheels of the front and rear axles to bring the vehicle back to its intended direction. |

|             | The vehicle will be equipped with a Wabco 4S/4M anti-lock braking system. The ABS will provide a four (4) channel anti-lock braking control on both the front and rear wheels. A digitally controlled system that utilizes microprocessor technology will control the anti-lock braking system. Each wheel will be monitored by the system. When a wheel begins to lockup, a signal will be sent to the control unit. This control unit will then release the brake braking of that wheel for a fraction of a second and then reapply the brake. This anti-lock brake system will eliminate the lockup of any wheel thus preventing the apparatus from skidding out of control. |
|             | AUTOMATIC TRACTION CONTROL                                                                           |
|             | An anti-slip feature will be included with the ABS. The Automatic Traction Control will be used for traction in poor road and weather conditions. The Automatic Traction Control will act as an electronic differential lock that will not allow driving wheel slip, thereby supplying traction at all times. The ABS electronic control unit (ECU) will work with the engine ECU, sharing information concerning wheel slip. Engine ECU will use information to control engine speed, allowing only as much throttle application as required for the available traction, regardless of how much the driver is asking for. An "off road traction" switch will be provided on the instrument panel. Activation of the switch will allow additional tire slip to let the truck climb out and get on top of deep snow or mud. |

Paint Process / Environmental Requirements, Appleton  
**PAINT PROCESS**  
The exterior custom cab and body painting procedure will consist of a seven (7) step finishing process as follows:  
- **Manual Surface Preparation** - All exposed metal surfaces on the custom cab and body will be thoroughly cleaned and prepared for painting. Imperfections on the exterior surfaces will be removed and sanded to a smooth finish. Exterior seams will be sealed before painting. Exterior surfaces that will not be painted include: chrome plating, polished stainless steel, anodized aluminum and bright aluminum treadplate.  
- **Chemical Cleaning and Pretreatment** - All surfaces will be chemically cleaned to remove dirt, oil, grease, and metal oxides to ensure the subsequent coatings bond well. The aluminum surfaces will be properly cleaned and treated using a high pressure, high temperature 4 step Acid Etch process. The steel and stainless surfaces will be properly cleaned and treated using a high temperature 3 step process specifically designed for steel or stainless. The chemical treatment converts the metal surface to a passive condition to help prevent corrosion.  
- **Surfacers Primer** - The Surfacers Primer will be applied to a chemically treated metal surface to provide a strong corrosion protective basecoat. A minimum thickness of 2 mils of Surfacers Primer is applied to surfaces that require a Critical aesthetic finish. The Surfacers Primer is a two-component high solids urethane that has excellent sanding properties and an extra smooth finish when sanded.  
- **Finish Sanding** - The Surfacers Primer will be sanded with a fine grit abrasive to achieve an ultra-smooth finish. This sanding process is critical to produce the smooth mirror like finish in the topcoat.  
- **Sealer Primer** - The Sealer Primer is applied prior to the Basecoat in all areas that have not been previously primed with the Surfacers Primer. The Sealer Primer is a two-component high solids urethane that goes on smooth and provides excellent gloss hold out when topcoated.  
- **Basecoat Paint** - Two coats of a high performance, two component high solids polyurethane Basecoat will be applied. The Basecoat will be used in conjunction with the color match. The Basecoat will be applied to achieve the desired color match.  
- **Clear Coat** - Two (2) coats of Clear Coat will be applied to the Basecoat. The Clear Coat is a two-component high solids urethane that provides a durable and high gloss surface. Lap swipes and roll-up doors will be clear coat break provided.  
After the cab and body are painted, the color will be reviewed to make sure that it matches the color standard. Electronic color measuring equipment will be used to compare the color sample to the color standard entered into the computer. Color specifications will be used to determine the color match. A Delta E reading will be used to determine a good color match with each family color.  
All removable items such as brackets, compartment doors, door hinges, and trim will be removed and painted separately if required, to ensure paint adheres and mounted items. Body assemblies that cannot be painted in the paint booth will be finished painted before assembly.  
The paint finish quality levels for critical areas (cab front and sides, body sides and doors, and boom lettering panels) are to meet or exceed Cadillac/GMC standards GM/W577, global paint requirements. Contractor will ensure that standards are met or exceed the #6 A.C.T. request. The manufacturer's written paint standards will be available upon request.  
**Environmental Impact**  
Contractor will meet or exceed all current state regulations concerning paint operations. Pollution control will include measures to protect the atmosphere, water and soil. Controls will include the following conditions:  
- Topcoats and primers will be chrome and lead free.  
- Metal treatment chemicals will be chrome free. The wastewater generated in the metal treatment process will be treated on-site to remove any other heavy metals.  
- Particulate emission collection from sanding operations will have a 99.99 percent efficiency factor.  
Particulate emissions from painting operations will be collected by a dry filter or water wash process. If the filter is used, it will have an efficiency rating of 98 percent. Water wash systems will be 99.97 percent efficient.  
Water from water wash booths will be reused. Solids will be removed on a continual basis to keep the water clean.  
Paint wastes are disposed of in an environmentally safe manner.  
Empty metal paint containers will be recycled to recover the metal.  
Solvents used in clean-up operations will be recycled on-site or sent off-site for distillation and returned for reuse.  
Additionally, the finished approvals will not be manufactured with or contain products that have ozone depleting substances. Contractor will, upon demand, present evidence that the manufacturing facility meets the above conditions and that it is in compliance with his state EPA rules and regulations.

This Warranty applies to new diesel Engines sold by Cummins and delivered to the first user on or after April 1, 2007, that are used in fire apparatus truck* and crash truck* applications Worldwide.

### Base Engine Warranty
The Base Engine Warranty covers any failures of the Engine which result, under normal use and service, from a defect in material or factory workmanship (Warrantable Failure). This Coverage begins with the sale of the Engine by Cummins and ends five years or 100,000 miles (160,935 kilometers), whichever occurs first, after the date of delivery of the Engine to the first user.

Engine aftermarket components included in the Cummins Critical Parts List (CPL) and marked with a Cummins part number are covered under Base Engine Warranty.

Additional Coverage is outlined in the Emission Warranty section.

These Warranties are made to all Owners in the chain of distribution and Coverage continues to all subsequent Owners until the end of the periods of Coverage.

Cummins will pay for the lubricating oil, antifreeze, filter elements, belts, hoses and other maintenance items that are not reusable due to the Warrantable Failure.

Cummins will pay for reasonable labor costs for Engine removal and reinstallation when necessary to repair a Warrantable Failure.

Cummins will pay reasonable costs for towing a vehicle disabled by a Warrantable Failure to the nearest authorized repair location. In lieu of the towing expense, Cummins will pay reasonable costs for mechanics to travel to and from the location of the vehicle, including meals, mileage and lodging when the repair is performed at the site of the failure.

# Owner Responsibilities
Owner is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Engine as specified in Cummins Operation and Maintenance Manuals. Owner is also responsible for providing proof that all recommended maintenance has been performed.

Before the expiration of the applicable Warranty, Owner must notify a Cummins distributor, authorized dealer or other repair location approved by Cummins of any Warrantable Failure and make the Engine available for repair by such facility. Except for Engines disabled by a Warrantable Failure, Owner must also deliver the Engine to the repair facility.

Service locations are listed on the Cummins Worldwide Service Locator at cummins.com.

Owner is responsible for the cost of lubricating oil, antifreeze, filter elements and other maintenance items provided during Warranty repairs unless such items are not reusable due to the Warrantable Failure.

Owner is responsible for communication expenses, meals, lodging and similar costs incurred as a result of a Warrantable Failure.

Owner is responsible for non-Engine repairs and for “downtime” expenses, cargo damage, fines, all applicable taxes, all business costs and other losses resulting from a Warrantable Failure.

Owner is responsible for a $100 (U.S. Dollars) deductible for each service visit under this plan in the 3rd, 4th and 5th years of Base Engine Warranty. The deductible will not be charged during the first 2 years of the Base Engine Warranty.

# Limitations
Cummins is not responsible for failures or damage resulting from what Cummins determines to be abuse or neglect, including, but not limited to: operation without adequate coolants or lubricants; overfuelling; overspeeding; lack of maintenance of lubricating, cooling or intake systems; improper storage, starting, warm-up, run-in or shutdown practices; unauthorized modifications of the Engine.

Any unauthorized modifications to the aftertreatment could negatively effect emissions certification and void Warranty.

Cummins is also not responsible for failures caused by incorrect oil, fuel or diesel exhaust fluid or by water, dirt or other contaminants in the fuel, oil or diesel.

**I. WARRANTY:** The Commercial Steering Systems group of TRW, Inc., hereinafter referred to as "CSS", warrants that each new product supplied by CSS to its customer, when properly installed, used and maintained, shall be free from defect in material and workmanship for the period specified below:  

(A) CSS Product installed in **New On-highway Motor Vehicle:**  
Within twelve (12) months after date of delivery of such vehicle to the original retail purchaser, or before such vehicle has been driven one hundred thousand (100,000) miles, whichever event shall first occur.  

(B) CSS Product installed in **New Agricultural, Turf, Industrial, or Construction Vehicles and Related Equipment:**  
Within twelve (12) months after date of delivery of such vehicle/equipment to the original retail purchaser or before such vehicle/equipment has been operated for two thousand (2000) hours or fifty thousand (50,000) miles, whichever occurs first.  

(C) CSS Product installed in **New End Product, Not Specifically Mentioned in Classifications (A) or (B) Above and All Other Off-Highway/Severe Applications:**  
Within six (6) months after date of delivery of the original equipment manufacturer’s end product to the original retail purchaser.  

**II. REMEDY:** Customer’s sole remedy under the foregoing warranty is limited to correction by means of repair, replacement or issuance of credit, at the option of CSS, of any product which is:  

(A) Returned to CSS within the specified warranty time period, with prior notice to, and the written consent of, CSS, with transportation and handling charges prepaid, together with a statement describing the alleged defect, the part number, model number and application, and mileage or hours of use of such product; and  

(B) Upon examination, determined by CSS not to conform to the warranty.  

**III.** Any product which is repaired or replaced under this warranty will be returned to customer prepaid. Disposition of any product determined not to be covered by this warranty will be at the customer’s expense.

## Terms and Conditions

(1) What is Covered by this Commercial Warranty?  
Meritor Heavy Vehicle Systems, LLC warrants to the Owner (“Owner”) that the components listed in this publication, which have been installed by an Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) as original equipment in vehicles licensed for on-highway use, will be free from defects in material and workmanship. This warranty coverage begins only after the expiration of the OEM’s vehicle warranty for the applicable covered components. Warranty coverage ends at the expiration of the applicable time period from the date of vehicle purchase by the first Owner or the applicable mileage limitation, whichever occurs first. Duration of coverage varies by component and vocation as detailed elsewhere in this warranty statement.

Some components are warranted for parts only and the Owner must pay any labor costs associated with the repair or replacement of the component. Other components are warranted for both parts and reasonable labor to repair or replace the subject component. Components (whether new, used or remanufactured) installed as replacements under this warranty are warranted only for the remainder of the original period or time or mileage under the original warranty.

For certain components, coverage requires the use of specific extended drain interval or synthetic lubricants. For further information about lubrication and maintenance, see Cummins-Meritor publication Maintenance Manual Number 1 and the applicable Cummins-Meritor maintenance manual for the product in question. Other conditions and limitations applicable to this warranty are detailed below.
<!-- Page 127 -->
# TERMS AND CONDITIONS

(2) **Designation of Vocational Use Required**  
To obtain warranty coverage, each Owner must notify Cummins-Meritor through the OEM new truck and/or trailer dealer of the intended vocational use of the vehicle into which the Cummins-Meritor components have been incorporated prior to the vehicle in-service date. This notification may be accomplished by registering the vehicle through your OEM new truck and/or trailer dealer or with Cummins-Meritor directly. Failure to notify Cummins-Meritor of (i) the intended vocational use of the vehicle or (ii) a change in vocational use from that which was originally designated, will result in the application of a one year, unlimited mileage, parts only warranty (1/Un/P) from the initial in-service date.

A second Owner and each subsequent Owner must also notify Cummins-Meritor as to the intended vocational use of the vehicle. This notification can be sent directly to Cummins-Meritor or through the OEM new truck and/or trailer dealer. The duration and mileage coverage of this warranty cannot exceed the coverage extended to the first Owner after his or her initial designation of vocational use.

Coverage under Cummins-Meritor’s warranty requires that the application of products be properly approved pursuant to OEM and Cummins-Meritor approvals. Refer to TP-9441 for axles, SP-8320 for trailer axles, TP-12126 for driveline and/or contact Cummins-Meritor regarding specific application approval questions on any product line.

(3) **What is the Cost of this Warranty?**  
There is no cost to the Owner for the warranty.

(4) **What is Not Covered by this Warranty?**  
This warranty does not cover normal wear and tear; nor does it cover a component that fails, malfunctions or is damaged as a result of (i) improper installation, adjustment, repair or modification (including the use of unauthorized attachments or changes or modification in the vehicle’s configuration, usage or vocation from that which was originally approved by Cummins-Meritor), (ii) accident, natural disaster, abuse or improper use (including loading beyond the specified maximum vehicle weight or altering engine power settings to exceed the axle and/or driveline capacity) or (iii) improper or insufficient maintenance (including deviation from approved lubricants, change intervals or lube levels). This warranty does not cover any component, or part that is not branded by Cummins-Meritor. For vehicles that operate full or part time outside of the United States and Canada, a one year, unlimited mileage, parts only warranty (1/Un/P) will apply.

(5) **Remedy**  
The exclusive remedy under this warranty shall be the repair or replacement of the defective component at Cummins-Meritor’s option. Cummins-Meritor reserves the right to require that all applicable failed materials are available and/or returned to Cummins-Meritor for review and evaluation.

(6) **Disclaimer of Warranty**  
THIS WARRANTY IS EXPRESSLY IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

(7) **Limitation of Remedies**  
In no event shall Cummins-Meritor be liable for special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind or under any legal theory, including, but not limited to, towing, downtime, lost productivity, cargo damage, taxes or any other losses or costs resulting from a defective covered component.

(8) **To Obtain Service**  
If the Owner discovers within the applicable coverage period a defect in material or workmanship, the Owner must give notice to either Cummins-Meritor or the dealer from which the vehicle was purchased. To obtain service, the vehicle must be taken to any participating OEM new truck and/or trailer dealer or authorized Cummins-Meritor service location. The dealer will inspect the vehicle and contact Cummins-Meritor for an evaluation of the claim. When authorized by Cummins-Meritor, the dealer will repair or replace during the term of this warranty any defective Cummins-Meritor component covered by this warranty.

(9) **Entire Agreement**  
This is the entire agreement between Cummins-Meritor and the Owner about warranty and no Cummins-Meritor employee or dealer is authorized to make any additional warranty on behalf of Cummins-Meritor. This agreement allocates the responsibilities for component failure between Cummins-Meritor and the Owner.

# WARRANTY - MODEL YEAR 2021 VEHICLES

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

(1) **What is Covered by this Commercial Warranty?**  
ZF CV Systems North America LLC and its North American subsidiaries and affiliates (ZF) warrant to the owner (“Owner”) that the components listed in this publication, which have been installed by an Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) as original equipment will be free from defects in material and workmanship. This warranty coverage begins from the original in-service date to the limits provided and runs concurrently with any warranties provided by OEMs and/or any distribution agreements and/or any service contracts that cover the components listed in this publication, if any. If the components listed in this publication are covered by an OEM warranty and/or service contract, then the OEM’s warranty and/or service contract shall supersede ZF’s warranty and Owner shall comply with all OEM’s warranty and/or service contract requirements for claims under such OEM’s warranty and/or service contract until those agreements expire. Once those agreements expire and provided the ZF warranty has not expired under the terms stated above, the ZF warranty will be in effect until its expiration date.

Warranty coverage ends at the expiration of the applicable time period from the date of vehicle purchase by the first Owner, or the applicable mileage limitation, whichever occurs first. Duration of coverage varies by component and vocation as detailed previously in this publication. Some components are warranted for parts only and the Owner must pay any labor costs associated with the repair or replacement of the component. Other components are warranted for both parts and reasonable labor to repair or replace the subject component. Additional diagnostic time to use of an outdated version of TOOLBOX™, time to purchase or install latest version of TOOLBOX™ are the responsibility of the authorized ZF distributor networks and are not covered under product warranty. Components installed as replacements under this warranty are warranted only for the remainder of the original period of time or mileage under the original warranty.

(2) **Designation of Vocational Use Required.** To obtain warranty coverage, each Owner must notify ZF through the OEM new truck and/or trailer dealer of the intended vocational use of the vehicle into which the WABCO components have been incorporated prior to the vehicle in-service date. This notification may be accomplished by registering the vehicle through your OEM new truck and/or trailer dealer or with ZF directly. Failure to notify ZF of (i) the intended vocational use of the vehicle or (ii) a change in vocational use from which was originally designated, will result in the application of a one year, unlimited mileage, parts only warranty (1/(1)h/1P) from the initial in-service date. A second Owner and each subsequent Owner must also notify ZF as to the intended vocational use of the vehicle. This notification can be sent directly to ZF or through

the OEM new truck and/or trailer dealer. The duration and mileage coverage of this warranty cannot exceed the coverage extended to the first Owner after his or her initial designation of vocational use. Coverage under ZF’s warranty requires that the application of products be properly approved pursuant to OEM and ZF approvals.

(3) **What is the Cost of this Warranty?** There is no charge to the Owner for this warranty.

(4) **What is not Covered by this Warranty?** In addition to the items listed on “Coverage Exclusions,” this warranty does not cover normal wear and tear, or service items; nor does it cover a component that fails, malfunctions or is damaged as a result of (a) improper handling, storage, installation, adjustment, repair or modification including the use of unauthorized attachments or changes or modification in the vehicle’s configuration, usage, or vocation from that which was originally approved by ZF, (b) accident, fire or other casualty, natural disaster, road debris, negligence, misuse, abuse, or improper use (including loading beyond the specified maximum vehicle weight or altering engine power settings to exceed the brake system capacity), or (c) improper or insufficient maintenance (including deviation from maintenance intervals, approved lubricants, or lube levels). This warranty does not cover any component or part that is not sold by ZF.

(5) **To obtain service.** If the owner discovers within the applicable coverage period a defect in material or workmanship, the Owner must promptly give notice to either ZF or the dealer from which the vehicle was purchased. To obtain service, the vehicle must be taken to any participating OEM dealer or ZF distributor networks’ service. The dealer or ZF authorized servicer will inspect the vehicle and contact ZF for an evaluation of the claim. When authorized by ZF, the dealer or ZF authorized servicer will repair or replace during the term of this warranty any defective WABCO component covered by this warranty.

(6) **Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of remedies.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH HEREIN IS EXCLUSIVE AND IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND/OR WARRANTY FOR HIDDEN OR LATENT DEFECTS, AND IN NO EVENT WILL ZF OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PROGRESSIVE, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND.

![Warranty Information](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Warranty+Information)

(7) Legal action. Any legal action or claim arising from or related to this Warranty, in contract or otherwise, must be commenced within one year from the accrual of that cause of action, or be barred forever. Any dispute arising in connection with this agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the laws of the State of Michigan and be brought, heard and determined exclusively in either the Circuit Court for the County of Oakland, State of Michigan or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The parties stipulate that the referenced venues are convenient.

(8) Remedy. The exclusive remedy under this warranty shall be the repair or replacement of the defective component at ZF's option. ZF reserves the right to require that all applicable covered components are available and/or returned to ZF for review and evaluation. THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY, IF ANY, OF ZF FOR ALL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITH-OUT LIMITATION CONTRACT DAMAGES, BREACH OF WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER TORT, IS LIMITED TO AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT and where indicated in the product and application warranty information above, the inclusion of labor is limited to the standard repair time. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE LIMITATION OF DAMAGES PROVISION SET FORTH IN THIS PARAGRAPH SURVIVES BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL END USER AND ZF EVEN IF THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY SET FORTH ABOVE IS DEEMED TO FAIL OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. ZF may change the design or make improvements to its Products without incurring any warranty obligation for previously manufactured Product.

(9) Entire Agreement. This is the entire agreement between ZF and the Owner about warranty and no, ZF employee, or dealer is authorized to make any additional warranty on behalf of ZF unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of ZF.

![LIFETIME SERVICE WARRANTY](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=LIFETIME+SERVICE+WARRANTY)

**Effective 1 August, 2009**

**LIFETIME SERVICE WARRANTY**

United Plastic Fabricating, Inc. (hereinafter called “UPF”) warrants each POLY-TANK®, Booster/Foam Tank POLYSIDE® Wetside Tank, Integrator Tank/Body, ELLIPSE™ Elliptical Tank, Ellip-T-Tank and DEFENDER™ Skid Tank to be free from defects in material and workmanship for the service life of the original vehicle (vehicle must be actively used in an emergency response for fire suppression). All UPF Tanks must be installed and operated in accordance with the UPF Installation and Operating Guidelines. Failure to do so can void the warranty.

Every UPF Tank is inspected and tested before leaving our facility. Should your UPF Tank require service, please notify UPF via email, fax, in writing or by calling UPF at 1-978-975-4520. Please provide the serial number, a description of the service request, the location along with the phone number and name of the contact person. Our goal is to have scheduled work completed within a reasonable time period.

Under a valid warranty claim, UPF will cover the cost to repair the UPF Tank including the customary and reasonable costs to make the tank accessible such as the removal and reinstallation of the tank if authorized in advance (pre-approved) by UPF. The warranty will not cover tanks that have been improperly installed, operated, misused, abused, or modified from its intended or designed use. Serial number must not have been altered, defaced or removed. Tanks that are not stored or installed properly which results in the tank suffering undue damage will not be covered by this agreement.

Should UPF determine that the service claim is valid under this warranty for a tank located outside of the United States and Canada, UPF will assume the costs for labor and material for the warranty repair as described above plus all travel costs to the U.S. port of embarkation. Costs for airline travel outside of the U.S. and Canada will not be the responsibility of UPF.

In the event the tank shall become stationed in an area of the world that is considered to be a war zone or where unsafe conditions exist for the safe passage of United States Nationals, as reported by the U.S. Department of State, (http://www.state.gov), and a request to perform service or warranty repairs, UPF reserves the right to refuse to honor such requests. It is the purchaser’s responsibility to relocate the tank to an area where such repairs can be performed without undue risk to UPF employees or designee. UPF will make every reasonable effort to support our products through alternative means.

For Ellipse™ elliptical tanks, a separate five year warranty provided by the subcontractor is applied to the sub-frames, chute linings (rubber isolation strips) and metal components. The stainless steel wrap provided by UPF shall be warranted by the subcontractor performing the wrap installation in accordance with their warranty in place at the time of the installation. UPF will not be liable for any warranty costs associated with the wrap, sub-frames, chute linings (rubber isolation strips) and metal components but will assist with all claims on behalf of its customer.

For PolySide® wetsided tanks and Integrator™ Tank/Body units, all polypropylene components related to the tank shall carry the standard UPF lifetime warranty.

service warranty. Other polypropylene components, including but not limited to compartments, wheel wells, fenders and other body related components shall be warranted by UPF for a period of ten years. The warranty for the PolySide® and Integrator™ units excludes paint or hardware, which shall be covered by the manufacturer of the paint/hardware.

All UPF tanks 50 gallons or less utilized for non-fire applications and installed on specialty vehicles such as ATVs, trailers, boats, etc. are covered under a separate warranty policy available from UPF. Further, UPF Protector™ foam and water trailers are warranted under a separate warranty policy available from UPF.

This UPF warranty is transferable within the United States only with prior written approval by UPF (except an original apparatus manufacturer may assign this warranty to the first titled owner/lessee of the apparatus).

UPF will NOT reimburse any unnecessary work and/or work that has not been pre-approved. Any and all third party charges must be pre-authorized and approved in writing by UPF prior to commencing the work. Any unauthorized third party repairs, alterations, actions or modifications will not be covered and can void the warranty. UPF will be the sole determining authority as to whether a service claim will be valid and covered under this warranty.

In no event will UPF be liable for an amount in excess of the purchase price of the booster/foam tank at the time of manufacture or for any loss or damage, whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or otherwise arising out of failure of its product. Loss of contents (water, foam, etc.) shall not be the responsibility of UPF. Further, UPF is not responsible for costs associated with service repairs to chassis, sub-frames, valves, dumps, hoses, pressure vacuum vents, and other components (i.e. liquid level transducers, etc.). Further, UPF will not cover the cost for travel of the vehicle to and from a repair facility.

This warranty contains the entire warranty. It is the sole warranty and price agreements or representation, whether oral or written, are either merged herein or expressly canceled. UPF neither assumes, nor authorizes any person supposing to act on its behalf to change, nor assume for it, any warranty or liability concerning its product.

This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. Some states do not allow exclusion or limitation or incidental or consequential damage, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Since some states do not allow limitations on the length of an implied warranty, the above limitation may not apply to you.

**THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, WHICH EXTEND BEYOND THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FACE HEREOF. THERE IS NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR A WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. ADDITIONALLY, THIS WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES ON THE PART OF UPF.**

**TO:** All Dealer Service Representatives  
**From:** Kevin Hanegraaf  
**DATE:** January 4, 2010  
**RE:** UPF Tank Warranty Policy – Truck in Accident  
**Service Topic #292**

To keep the UPF tank warranty valid on trucks that have been involved in a vehicular accident, it is UPF’s policy that the customer must remove the tank from the truck and send it back to one of UPF’s facilities for inspection. In the event that this does not take place, the warranty will be considered null and void.

The customer must remove and send the tank back to UPF for inspection in order to maintain the original warranty coverage, at which time it will be:  
- Filled with water  
- Visually inspected  
- Ultraviolet spark tested on articulating test stand in the dark  
- Recommendation for repairs if necessary provided by UPF  
- Fully evaluated and repaired by UPF  

If your customer chooses to leave the tank on the truck and wants a technician to inspect and/or repair the tank in the field, then the warranty is no longer in effect. This direction is upheld by UPF because the technician cannot inspect the entire tank when it is still installed on the truck.

**Note:** This memo is intended to relay the information Pierce has received on UPF’s tank warranty for trucks that are in a vehicular accident. In the event of an actual claim, we direct you to consult with UPF’s service Manager Maura Watts (800-638-8265 x253)

**AUTHORIZED MANUFACTURER**  
In accordance with the State of California Vehicle Code, specifically Section 11701, it is mandated that "every manufacturer of a vehicle subject to registration shall make application to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for a license containing a general distinguishing number." The manufacturer, as of the proposal submission, holds a valid license in compliance with this requirement and is prepared to furnish a copy upon request. This adherence to regulatory standards ensures that the manufacturer maintains a current and official status, promoting transparency and compliance with legal requirements throughout the duration of the proposal and subsequent processes.

**AUTHORIZED DEALERSHIP**  
In compliance with the State of California Vehicle Code, specifically Section 11701, it is mandated that "a dealer in vehicles of a type subject to registration shall make application to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for a license containing a general distinguishing number." Golden State Fire Apparatus, Inc. possesses a valid license at the time of the bid, as detailed above, and can promptly provide a copy upon request. This adherence to regulatory standards ensures that the dealership maintains a current and official status, promoting transparency and compliance with legal requirements throughout the duration of the proposal and subsequent processes.

**AUTHORIZED SALES REPRESENTATIVE**  
In accordance with the State of California Vehicle Code, specifically Section 11800, it is expressly prohibited for any individual to function as a vehicle salesperson without obtaining a license issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The representative, at the time of proposal, holds a valid vehicle salesperson's license and is ready to furnish a copy upon request. This adherence to regulatory standards ensures that the sales representative maintains a current and official status, promoting transparency and compliance with legal requirements throughout the bidding process and subsequent phases.

**VEHICLE REGISTRATION**  
In adherence to the State of California Vehicle Code Section 11739, it is mandated that the "dealer of a new motor vehicle sale is responsible for applying for the title, securing vehicle registration, and obtaining license plates for the Customer" through the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).

GSFA is committed to facilitating an excellent vehicle ownership experience for the customer. As such, we will manage all necessary applications and complete all transfer papers, including the application for California Exempt "E" license plates. This approach ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and a hassle-free registration process for our valued customers.
<!-- Page 155 -->
# WEEKLY PROGRESS PHOTOGRAPHS
GSFA is committed to ensuring transparency and comprehensive reporting throughout the construction process of the apparatus. To achieve this, GSFA will provide weekly photographs capturing various stages of the apparatus or major components under construction.

Commencing from the initiation of the manufacturing process, the photographic documentation will extend throughout the entire production phase by the manufacturer. These weekly reports will offer a visual representation of the ongoing progress of the apparatus, highlighting key milestones and showcasing unique features and aspects as construction unfolds.

Our focus is to provide customers with a clear and detailed insight into the evolution of the apparatus, fostering a deeper understanding of the craftsmanship and distinct elements incorporated during the construction process. This commitment to regular, visual updates aims to enhance communication and transparency regarding the progress of the apparatus.

# FINAL INSPECTION, FACTORY VISIT
A final inspection trip to the manufacturing facility is included for six (6) Customer representatives. The primary objective of this visit is to ensure the adherence of the apparatus to specifications and promptly identify any potential deficiencies. The final inspection trip is anticipated to span four (4) days and three (3) nights, with scheduling details collaboratively determined between GSFA and the Customer.

GSFA will cover the costs associated with airfare, lodging, meals, and ground transportation during the stay at the manufacturer's location. Air travel will be arranged from one of the following airports: Sacramento, San Francisco, or San Jose.

It is important to note that certain costs, including Customer ground transportation within California, airport parking, luggage fees, and incidental expenses during travel to the factory, fall within the responsibility of the Customer. Furthermore, flight reservations are non-refundable, and in the event of a cancellation post-booking, the Customer will bear all associated costs, encompassing not only the original ticket cost but also any change or cancellation fees levied by the airline and/or travel agency. Additionally, flight reservations are non-transferable. This delineation aims to establish clarity and transparency regarding the allocation of responsibilities and potential costs associated with the final inspection trip.  
**Please note that one (1) factory final inspection trip has been priced for the five (5) units being proposed.**

The use of rail or truck freight for transportation is deemed unacceptable in order to uphold the highest standards of quality assurance during the delivery process.
