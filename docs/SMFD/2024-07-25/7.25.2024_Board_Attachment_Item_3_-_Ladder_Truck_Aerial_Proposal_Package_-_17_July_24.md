The foregoing estimate is provided as a good faith approximation as of the date of submission of this Product Proposal and is subject to the Terms and Conditions.

**PROPOSAL EXPIRATION** – This Product Proposal supersedes any previous proposal(s) presented to Customer by GSFA and its employees and may be accepted by Customer on or before the Expiration Date identified above.

ANY ADDITIONAL OR DIFFERENT TERMS, WHETHER CONTAINED IN CUSTOMER’S FORMS OR OTHERWISE PRESENTED BY CUSTOMER AT ANY TIME, ARE HEREBY REJECTED AND OF NO EFFECT UNLESS APPROVED IN WRITING SIGNED BY GSFA.

**COUNTERPARTS** - This Product Proposal may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original (including copies sent to a party by electronic transmission) as against the party signing such counterpart, but which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. A signed copy of this Product Proposal delivered by facsimile, email or other means of electronic transmission will be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Product Proposal. If this Product Proposal is returned to GSFA with the signature of Customer’s authorized representative but without an attestation or co-signers signature, then absent Customer’s written notice to the contrary, GSFA shall be entitled to rely on such single signature as sufficient evidence of the signatory’s authority to execute the Agreement and bind Customer thereby.

   g. “GSFA” means Golden State Fire Apparatus, Inc., a California corporation.  
   h. “Manufacturer” means the person or persons, company, firm, corporation, partnership, or other organization identified in the Product Proposal as responsible for manufacturing the Product.  
   i. “Party” or “Parties” means GSFA and/or Customer, as applicable.  
   j. “Predelivery Service” means the Products and/or Services that will be provided by GSFA after transportation of the Product(s) from the manufacturing facility and prior to Final Delivery or Pick-Up.  
   k. “Prepayment Discount” means a discount to the purchase price for the Product granted to Customer in connection with Customer’s advance payment of the Grand Total Purchase Price (or portion thereof, as specified in the Product Proposal).  
   l. “Product” means the fire apparatus(es) and any associated equipment listed in the Product Proposal and further described in the Specifications.  
   m. “Product Completion” means the fire apparatus(es) in the Product Proposal and further described in the Specifications being ready for final inspection by Customer at the manufacturing facility.

   p. “Specifications” means the specifications for the Product attached to the Product Proposal as Exhibit B.  
   q. “Terms and Conditions” means these Standard Terms and Conditions, which are attached to the Product Proposal as Exhibit A.  

2. Purchase and Payment.

   a. **Purchase.** Customer agrees to purchase the Product at the Grand Total Purchase Price (as such amount may be adjusted in accordance with these Terms and Conditions), pursuant to the payment terms set forth in the Product Proposal. The Grand Total Purchase Price is payable in U.S. dollars.  

   b. **Contingency Reserve Fund.** The Grand Total Purchase Price may include an amount to be set aside for the purpose of funding any future costs or financial obligations incurred by Customer under the Product Proposal or any valid Change Order(s) (the “Contingency Reserve Fund”). If applicable, the amount of any required Contingency Reserve Fund will be set forth in either the Product Proposal or Exhibit D. The Contingency Reserve Fund may be withdrawn against by Customer or GSFA for the purpose of satisfying Customer’s payment obligations under the initial Product Proposal or any valid Change Order(s) (including, without limitation, a Change Order submitted by GSFA pursuant to Section 8.b). If a Contingency Reserve Fund is required under the Agreement, the amount of such fund is not intended as an estimate of the actual additional costs of contingencies, Change Orders, unforeseen items or other required work that may be incurred under the Agreement after submission of the Product Proposal to  

1
<!-- Page 12 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
Customer, which amounts Customer acknowledges may exceed the Contingency Reserve Fund amount. The balance of any Contingency Reserve Fund will be credited against Customer’s payment obligations, or otherwise returned to Customer within thirty (30) calendar days of delivery of all Products under the Agreement (provided that Customer has paid all amounts owed under the Agreement as of such date).

c. Prepayment Discount. If GSFA has granted Customer a Prepayment Discount, Customer must provide each associated prepayment (each, a “Prepayment”) within the time frame specified in the Product Proposal in order to receive such discount. Customer’s failure to timely make such Prepayment may result in: (i) GSFA’s termination of the Agreement; and/or (ii) Customer’s loss of the Prepayment Discount for the portion of the Grand Total Purchase Price represented by such outstanding Prepayment and the application of a late fee as set forth in Section 6, in each case in GSFA’s sole discretion.

d. Sales Tax. Customer shall be responsible for the cost of state sales tax associated with, or attributable to, the Product. The taxes stated in the Product Proposal are subject to adjustment for the applicable state sales tax rate in effect at the time of delivery. Therefore, the sales tax set forth on the Product Proposal is only an estimate of such taxes and will be increased or decreased at the time of delivery if a change in the applicable sales tax rate has occurred, in which case Customer shall pay GSFA (or be refunded by GSFA) the difference in the applicable sales tax.

3. Product Completion Date. Within thirty (30) calendar days of the date on which the last required signatory executes the Product Proposal (such date, the “Executed Date”), GSFA shall submit to Customer a tentative Product completion date (which may differ from the Product completion estimate contained in the Product Proposal). Due to global supply chain constraints, any Product completion date contained herein, or in the Product Proposal, or otherwise provided to Customer, is a good faith estimate only as of the date provided to Customer, and merely an approximation based on current information available to GSFA and Manufacturer. Customer shall not be entitled to rely on any such estimate, and GSFA shall have no liability to Customer for a failure by GSFA to meet any such estimate. All Product completion estimates are subject to modification and, if applicable, GSFA will provide updates to such estimates to Customer when available. If the product is not available for delivery on the Product Completion Date, no additional costs, fees, or charges shall be billed to or attributable to Customer in the Grand Total Purchase Price solely by reason of failure to meet the Product Completion Date, including but not limited to any costs identified in Section 8 below.

4. Stock / Demo Units. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in the Agreement (including Section 12 hereof concerning warranties), any Products constituting stock/demo unit(s) are sold to Customer on an as-is, first-come and first-served basis and GSFA makes no further representation or warranty to any customer with respect to such unit(s). Regardless of the terms of the Product Proposal, GSFA shall only be obligated to sell such stock/demo unit(s) to the first customer to enter into a purchase agreement with GSFA identifying such unit(s), and after the execution by GSFA of such agreement any subsequent purchase agreement (including the Agreement, as applicable) shall have no further force or effect with respect to such unit(s).

5. Multiple Unit Purchase. If the Grand Total Purchase Price includes pricing for multiple Products, the Product price stated in the Product Proposal shall only be valid if the quantity of Products being proposed are purchased at the same time, pursuant to the same Agreement. GSFA shall have no obligation to offer the same price for any Product if purchased by Customer pursuant to a later purchase agreement.

6. Late Fee; Storage Fee. A late fee equal to 0.033% of the outstanding portion of the Grand Total Purchase Price will be charged for each calendar day for overdue payments beginning ten (10) calendar days after the payment is due and continuing for the first thirty (30) calendar days thereafter. After such thirty (30) calendar day period, the late fee shall increase to 0.044% per calendar day until payment of the outstanding portion of the Grand Total Purchase Price is received. Any such charges shall not exceed the statutory limit for such charges pursuant to California Government Code 926.10. If Customer is unable to satisfy the delivery requirements hereunder or is unwilling to take delivery of the Product, then GSFA shall be entitled to a storage charge running from the earlier of: (i) the date of delivery agreed to between GSFA and Customer (provided GSFA is willing and able to deliver the Product on such date), or  
2
<!-- Page 13 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

(ii) twenty-one (21) calendar days after GSFA notifies Customer that the Product is available for delivery. The storage charge is equal to: (i) $175.00 per calendar day per apparatus stored, or (ii) the actual charges incurred by GSFA with a third party for storage of the Product, whichever is greater. Such storage charge shall continue until the actual time of delivery and Customer’s possession of the Product, and any such storage by GSFA or such third party shall be at the sole risk of Customer.

7. Delivery; Inspection and Acceptance.

a. Delivery. Subject to Section 5 hereof, the Product is scheduled to be delivered to the location and within the time period specified in the Product Proposal. Such delivery date is an estimate, and GSFA is, notwithstanding this Section 7.a, not bound to such date unless it otherwise agrees in a separate writing to complete delivery by a date certain. For the avoidance of doubt, GSFA is not responsible for delivery delays caused by or because of actions, omissions or conduct of Customer, the Manufacturer, or their respective employees, affiliates, suppliers, contractors, and carriers. Risk of loss for the Product shall pass to Customer at the point and time of delivery (which shall include an attempted delivery by GSFA which cannot be completed due to any act of Customer). However, title to the Product shall only pass to Customer upon delivery if Customer has then fully paid GSFA all amounts due hereunder (including additional amounts due under any valid Change Order). Absent GSFA’s separate written agreement, which it may or may not provide in its sole and absolute discretion, delivery of the Product will not occur before Customer has fully paid all amounts due under the Agreement and provided proof of insurance reasonably satisfactory to GSFA. If GSFA permits Customer to take possession of the Product, Customer may not mount equipment, conduct training, or place the Product into service until all amounts due under the Agreement have been paid. If Customer has ordered multiple Products, GSFA reserves the right to deliver such Products in installments and to separately invoice Customer for such Products.

b. Inspection and Acceptance. Upon delivery, Customer shall have ten (10) calendar days within which to inspect the Product for substantial conformity to the Specifications and in the event of non-substantial non-conformance (“Notice of Nonconformance to Specifications”). Contingent upon product availability and Customer’s cooperation, any Product not in substantial conformity to material Specifications shall be remedied by GSFA (by repair or replacement, at GSFA’s election) within thirty (30) calendar days from GSFA’s receipt of the Notice of Nonconformance to Specifications. In the event GSFA does not receive a Notice of Nonconformance to Specifications within ten (10) calendar days of delivery, the Product will be deemed to be in conformance with Specifications and accepted by Customer.

8. Changes to Agreement Terms.

a. Change Orders. The Customer may request that GSFA incorporate a change to the Product or the Specifications for the Product, or GSFA may submit changes to the Agreement required or permitted to be made by GSFA (pursuant to Section 8.b or otherwise) by delivering a written Change Order to the other party hereto, which shall include a description of the proposed change sufficient to permit the receiving party to evaluate such change (either, a “Change Order”). For any Change Order submitted by Customer, GSFA will provide Customer a written response (a “Response”) stating (i) whether GSFA will accommodate such Change Order (which GSFA may decide in its sole and absolute discretion); and (ii) the terms of the modification to the order, including any increase or decrease in the Grand Total Purchase Price resulting from such Change Order, a date on which any increase in the Grand Total Purchase Price must be paid, and an estimate of any effect on production scheduling or delivery resulting from such Change Order. Customer shall have seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the Response to notify GSFA as to whether Customer desires to make the changes GSFA has approved in the Response. In the event Customer countersigns GSFA’s Response, Customer shall pay the increase (or be refunded the decrease) in the Grand Total Purchase Price by the date specified in the Response. GSFA may also send Customer a Change Order to account for any changes to the Agreement required or permitted to be made by GSFA (including those changes required pursuant to Section 8.b hereof), and such Change Order shall be effective upon delivery to Customer unless Customer elects to terminate the applicable Product order under the Agreement in accordance with Section 9.
<!-- Page 14 -->
![Document](https://www.bls.gov)  
**b. Additional Changes.**

**i. Component Price Volatility; Increases Imposed by Manufacturer.** GSFA shall not be responsible for (i) any unforeseen price increase or surcharge enacted by suppliers of major components of the Product (including but not limited to commercial chasiss, engine, transmission, and fire pump); or (ii) price increases imposed on GSFA by Manufacturer pursuant to Manufacturer’s terms and conditions for sale of the Product (a “Manufacturer Price Increase”), after Customer becomes bound by the Agreement. Customer shall be responsible for all amounts arising from any price increases for major components of the Product (including all associated taxes and fees thereon) for the Product or any Manufacturer Price Increases occurring after the execution of the Agreement which increases the cost of the Product to GSFA, and such amounts will be documented on a Change Order adjusting the Grand Total Purchase Price accordingly. Customer shall pay any such price increase prior to Product delivery. A Manufacturer Price Increase may include, but shall not be limited to, an increase in Product price resulting from an increase in the Producer Price Index of Components for Manufacturing (see www.bls.gov Series ID: WPDUI6112) in excess of a compounded annual growth rate of five percent (5%), as measured between the month Manufacturer accepts the applicable Product order and the month that is fourteen (14) months prior to the then-current estimated Product completion date (the foregoing, a “PPI-Based Price Increase”). If, upon Customer’s receipt of a Change Order reflecting a PPI-Based Price Increase, Customer elects to terminate the applicable Product Order in accordance with Section 8.b.iii rather than pay such increase, then in lieu of the cancellation fees described in Section 9.a hereof GSFA shall be entitled to recover and Customer shall pay GSFA’s actual non-reimbursable costs incurred in connection with the Product order through the date of Customer’s termination of such Product order.

**ii. New Legal Standards.** In the event the Product design, materials or specifications require an alteration arising from new regulations issued by any governmental entity or trade association, including, but not limited to, the NFPA, DOT, and EPA, and such alteration increases the cost of the Product to GSFA, Customer shall be responsible for changes to the Grand Total Purchase Price arising from such alteration. GSFA shall promptly notify Customer when it becomes aware of any potential or required change in regulations occurring prior to delivery that would impact the Product purchased.

**iii. Change Orders.** Customer shall execute any Change Order submitted by GSFA documenting any of the changes required or permitted by Sections 8.b.i and 8.b.ii above (which shall, to the extent practicable, itemize any increases in the Grant Total Purchase Price and specify a commercially reasonable date by which Customer may pay such increase), unless Customer instead elects to terminate the applicable Product order under the Agreement within fifteen (15) calendar days of Customer’s receipt of such Change Order and in accordance with Section 9. Absent such a termination, failure to execute a Change Order does not alter Customer’s obligations under this Section 8.b.

**c. Changes in Commercial Specifications.** Specifications for all components of the Product manufactured by companies other than the Manufacturer are subject to change without notice. Specifications for such components will be as available at the time of manufacture of the Product. GSFA shall not be liable for any deviations in such specifications arising from a substitution of components or changes in the design of any component by their original manufacturer.

**9. Termination.**

**a. By Customer.** Customer may terminate a Product order identified in the Product Proposal or a Change Order by providing written notice to GSFA in accordance with Section 16 hereof. If Customer elects to terminate a Product order, Customer shall pay GSFA a cancellation fee as follows: (a) after the Product order is accepted and entered by GSFA, 10% of the portion of the Grand Total Purchase Price applicable to such Product (including all associated taxes, fees and costs) (such amount, the “Product Purchase Price”); (b) after completion of the pre-construction phase of the order process, 20% of the Product Purchase Price; and (c) after the requisition of any materials or commencement of any manufacturing or assembly of the Product by either GSFA or Manufacturer but before substantial completion of such Product, 50% of the Product Purchase Price. Customer shall not be permitted.
<!-- Page 15 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image) 

to terminate a Product order after substantial completion of manufacturing and assembly of such Product (excluding any Dealer Preparation or other pre-delivery services or product customization, if applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable tier of cancellation fee is not sufficient to cover all actual costs and fees incurred by GSFA with Manufacturer in connection with Customer’s termination of the Product order (“Manufacturer Termination Fees”), then in addition to such cancellation fee Customer shall pay the balance of all Manufacturer Termination Fees. If Customer received a Prepayment Discount, such discount shall not be considered for the purpose of calculating the above cancellation fee. The tier of cancellation fee applicable to any cancellation, as well as the determination of whether a Product has reached substantial completion, shall be in the sole and absolute discretion of GSFA. Customer may request a fee waiver, and GSFA, in its sole discretion, may agree to waive and/or adjust such fee. GSFA will return the balance of the Grand Total Purchase Price or Product Purchase Price, as applicable, within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of the cancellation of the Product order or termination of the Agreement.

Customer may terminate the Agreement for an Event of Default by GSFA after providing GSFA with written notice in accordance with Section 16 (which notice shall describe with reasonably particularity the Event of Default justifying such termination) if such Event of Default remains uncured (if capable of cure) thirty (30) days following GSFA’s receipt of such notice; provided, however, that the foregoing cure period shall continue if and for so long as GSFA has commenced and is continuing to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to cure such Event of Default as promptly as reasonably practicable.

b. By GSFA. GSFA may terminate the Agreement for an Event of Default by Customer after providing Customer with written notice in accordance with Section 16 (which notice shall describe with reasonably particularity the Event of Default justifying such termination) if such Event of Default remains uncured (if capable of cure) thirty (30) days following Customer’s receipt of such notice; provided, however, that the foregoing cure period shall continue if and for so long as Customer has commenced and is continuing to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to cure such Event of Default as promptly as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GSFA may terminate the Agreement effective immediately upon written notice to Customer of Customer’s failure to pay any amount owed under the Agreement when due.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if Customer terminates a Product order in accordance with Section 9.a above, GSFA may elect to instead terminate the Agreement upon notice to Customer in accordance with Section 16 hereof. If GSFA terminates the Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.b, Customer shall pay the applicable tier of cancellation fee for all Products pursuant to Section 9.a above as if Customer had elected to terminate each applicable Product order.

c. Based on Discontinuation or Cancellation by Manufacturer. In the event that Manufacturer cancels a Product order (provided that such cancellation is not the result of an act by Customer in violation of the Agreement) or discontinues the manufacture of a Product prior to its completion and delivery: (i) if such Product is the only Product contemplated under the Agreement, then the Agreement shall terminate; or (ii) if additional Products are contemplated under the Agreement, then only the Product order for the applicable cancelled or discontinued Product shall be terminated. Such Agreement termination or Product termination, as applicable, shall be effective upon GSFA’s written notice to Customer of such cancellation or discontinuance in accordance with Section 16 hereof. GSFA’s only obligation to Customer in such event shall be the return of any Prepayment paid by Customer for the cancelled or discontinued Product. For the avoidance of doubt, the cancellation fees contemplated in Section 9.a hereof shall not apply in the event of a termination pursuant to this Section 9.c.

10. Customer’s Obligations. Customer shall provide its timely and best efforts to cooperate with GSFA and Manufacturer during the Product manufacturing process. Reasonable and timely cooperation includes, without limitation, Customer’s providing timely information in response to any requests from Manufacturer or GSFA and the participation of Customer’s authorized representatives in traveling to Manufacturer’s facility for inspections and approval of the Product, including a final approval before the Product leaves Manufacturer’s facility.

0593759  
ESC/ABS/ITC Wabco Brake System, Tandem Rear Axle  
**ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL**  
A vehicle control system will be provided as an integral part of the ABS brake system from Meritor Wabco.  
The system will monitor and update the lateral acceleration of the vehicle and compare it to a critical threshold where a side roll event may occur. If the critical threshold is exceeded, the control system will automatically reduce engine power, if equipped, and selectively apply brakes to the individual front and rear axles to reduce the possibility of a side roll event.  
The system will monitor directional stability through a lateral accelerometer, steer angle sensor and wheel speed sensor. If a spinout or drift is detected, the vehicle control system will selectively apply brakes to the individual wheel ends of the front and rear axles to bring the vehicle back to its intended direction.  
**ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM**  
The vehicle will be equipped with a Wabco 658M anti-lock braking system. The ABS will provide a six (6) channel anti-lock braking control on both the front and rear wheels. A digitally controlled system that utilizes microprocessor technology will control the anti-lock braking system. Each wheel will be monitored by the system. When any wheel begins to lockup, a signal will be sent to the control unit. This control unit will then reduce the braking of that wheel for a fraction of a second and then reapply the brake. This anti-lock brake system will eliminate the lockup of any wheel thus helping to prevent the apparatus from skidding out of control.  
**AUTOMATIC TRACTION CONTROL**  
An anti-slip feature will be included with the ABS. The Automatic Traction Control will be used for traction in poor road and weather conditions. The Automatic Traction Control will act as an electronic differential lock that will not allow a driving wheel to spin, thereby supplying traction at all times. The ABS electronic control unit (ECU) will monitor the engine ECU, sharing information concerning wheel slip. Engine ECU will use information to control engine speed, allowing only as much throttle application as required for the available traction, regardless of how much the driver is asking for. An "off road traction" switch will be provided on the instrument panel. Activation of the switch will allow additional tire slip to let the truck climb out and get on top of deep snow or mud.

To provide quality at the source and single source customer support, the cab will be built by the apparatus manufacturer in a facility located on the manufacturer's premises.  
For reasons of structural integrity and enhanced occupant protection, the cab will be of heavy duty design, constructed to the following minimum standards:  
The cab will have 12 main vertical structural members located in the A-pillar (front cab door posts), B-pillar (side center posts), C-pillar (rear center posts) and rear wall areas. The A-pillar will be constructed of 0.25" heavy wall extrusions joined by a solid A356-T6 aluminum joint casting. The B-pillar and C-pillar will also be constructed from 0.25" heavy wall extrusions. The rear wall will be constructed of two (2) 4.00" x 2.00" outer aluminum extrusions and two (2) 3.00" x 2.00" inner aluminum extrusions. All main vertical structural members will run from the floor to 7.50" x 3.50" x 0.125" thick roof extrusions to provide a cage-like structure with the A-pillar and roof extrusions being welded into a 0.75" thick corner casting at each of the front corners of the roof assembly.  
The front of the cab will be constructed of a 0.25" thick firewall, covered with a 0.125" front skin (for a total thickness of 0.38"), and reinforced with 24.50" wide x 10.00" deep x 0.50" thick supports on each side of the engine tunnel. The cross-cab support will be welded to the A-pillar, 0.25" firewall, and engine tunnel, on the left and right sides.  
The cab floors will be constructed of 0.1875" thick aluminum plate and reinforced at the firewall with an additional 0.25" thick cross-floor support allowing a total thickness of 0.44" of structural material at the front floor area. The front floor area will be supported with three (3) 0.50" plates bolted together that also provides the mounting point for the cab lift. This tubing will run from the front of the cab to the 0.1875" thick engine tunnel, creating the structure to support the forces created when lifting the cab.  
The cab will be a full-lift style. A 3-point cab mount system with rubber isolators will improve ride quality by isolating vibrations from the chassis.  
The crew cab will be a totally enclosed design. The crew cab will be designed to improve visibility and verbal communication between the crew members.  
The dimension of the front floor area will be approximately 120.00". The crew cab section will have a 20" raised roof, with a height of approximately 112.00". The raised roof will allow the most headroom for the crew and provide a comfortable working environment.  
The rear section of the crew cab will be designed with the smallest diameter tires for the suspension, not wider than 8.00", and will have a minimum of 6" of clearance between the wheels, and should be designed to allow for a 10" center section of the roof. This will allow the rear cab to have a device to be mounted in the center section of the roof.  
The cab will have an interior width of not less than 93.50". The driver and passenger seating positions will have a minimum 24.00" clear width at knee level.

Vehicle applications where Sheppard product is used require an application approval before production build. If Pierce uses Sheppard product for any purpose or application which has not been approved by Sheppard in advance, including aftermarket devices (defined as a device added to the steering system directly or indirectly affecting the performance or operation of the Sheppard product in its approved application) not tested and approved by Sheppard this limited warranty SHALL NOT APPLY AND SHALL BE VOID. SHEPPARD MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. SHEPPARD EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE WHICH EXTEND BEYOND THE DESCRIPTION ON THE FACE HEREOF. SHEPPARD SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING FROM THE USE OF A PRODUCT. Pierce expressly acknowledges its obligation to inform all users (customers) of the above disclaimer.

**CONDITIONS:** Claims under this Limited Warranty may only be made by Pierce. In no event shall Sheppard be held liable for warranty charges by unauthorized persons. No allowance will be made for repairs or alterations, unless made with the written consent of Sheppard. Authorized Pierce dealers shall be the only authorized repair facility for Sheppard products applied to Pierce vehicles. Any warrantable repair made under this Limited Warranty must be made on or before 36 months of the in-service date for the Product to which the claim relates. Sheppard shall not be liable for claims made after such date. Sheppard product fitted to Pierce vehicles that are repaired at a repair facility other than an authorized Pierce dealer within the warranty period will be considered for payment under the guidelines of this agreement only by joint written consideration of Sheppard and Pierce warranty departments.

A warranty claim for both parts and labor will then be generated by the dealer and sent to Pierce. After reviewing the claim, Pierce will submit it to Sheppard for reimbursement.

**Parts Reimbursement:** Sheppard agrees to reimburse Pierce at Pierce’s purchase price plus 30% mark-up for parts found to be defective within the warranty period. Parts being returned for warranty consideration shall be sent to the R. H. Sheppard Company, 447 E. Middle St., Hanover, PA 17331 ATTN: Warranty Dept.

![TERMS AND CONDITIONS](https://www.meritor.com/terms-and-conditions)

(1) What is Covered by this Commercial Warranty?  
Meritor Heavy Vehicle Systems, LLC warrants to the owner (“Owner”) that the components listed in this publication, which have been installed by an Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) as original equipment in vehicles licensed for on-highway use, will be free from defects in material and workmanship. This warranty coverage begins only after the expiration of the OEM’s vehicle warranty for the applicable covered components. Warranty coverage ends at the expiration of the applicable time period from the date of vehicle purchase by the first Owner, or the applicable mileage limitation, whichever occurs first. Duration of coverage varies by component and vocation as detailed elsewhere in this warranty statement.

Some components are warranted for parts only and the Owner must pay any labor costs associated with the repair or replacement of the component. Certain components are warranted for both parts and reasonable labor to repair or replace the subject component. Components (whether new, used or remanufactured) installed as replacements under this warranty are warranted only for the remainder of the original period of time or mileage under the original warranty.

For certain components, coverage requires the use of specific extended drain interval or synthetic lubricants. For further information about lubrication and maintenance, see Meritor publications Maintenance Manual Number 1 and the applicable Meritor maintenance manual for the product in question. Other conditions and limitations are included in this warranty.

(2) Designation of Vocational Use Required.  
To obtain warranty coverage, each Owner must notify Meritor through the OEM new truck and/or trailer dealer of the intended vocational use of the vehicle into which the Meritor components have been incorporated prior to the vehicle in-service date. This notification may be accomplished by registering the vehicle through your OEM new truck and/or trailer dealer or with Meritor directly. Failure to notify Meritor of (I) the intended vocational use of the vehicle or (II) a change in vocational use from that which was originally designated, will result in the application of a one year, unlimited mileage, parts only warranty (1/Un/P) from the initial in-service date.

A second Owner and each subsequent Owner must also notify Meritor as to the intended vocational use of the vehicle. This notification can be sent directly to Meritor or through the OEM new truck and/or trailer dealer. The duration and mileage coverage of this warranty cannot exceed the coverage extended to the first Owner after his or her initial designation of vocational use.

Coverage under Meritor’s warranty requires that the application of products be properly approved pursuant to OEM and Meritor approvals. Refer to TP-9414 for axles, SP-8320 for trailers, TP-12126 for drivelines, and/or contact Meritor regarding specific application approval questions on any product line.

(3) What is the Cost of this Warranty?  
There is no charge to the Owner for this warranty.

(4) What is not Covered by this Warranty?  
This warranty does not cover normal wear and tear; nor does it cover a component that fails, malfunctions or is damaged as a result of (I) improper installation, adjustment, repair or modification (including the use of unauthorized attachments or changes or modification in the vehicle’s configuration, usage, or vocation from that which was originally approved by Meritor), (II) accident, natural disaster, abuse, or improper use (including loading beyond the specified maximum vehicle weight or altering engine power settings to exceed the axle and/or driveline capacity), or (III) improper or insufficient maintenance (including deviation from approved lubricants, change intervals, or lube levels). This warranty does not cover any component or part that is not branded by Meritor. For vehicles that operate full or part time outside of the United States and Canada, a one year, unlimited mileage, parts only warranty (1/Un/P) will apply.

(5) Remedy.  
The exclusive remedy under this warranty shall be the repair or replacement of the defective component at Meritor’s option. Meritor reserves the right to require that all applicable failed materials are available and returned to Meritor for review and evaluation.

(6) Disclaimer of Warranty.  
THIS WARRANTY IS EXPRESSLY IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

(7) Limitation of Remedies.  
In no event shall Meritor be liable for special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages of any kind or under any legal theory, including, but not limited to, towing, downtime, lost productivity, cargo damage, taxes, or any other losses or costs resulting from a defective covered component.

(8) To Obtain Service.  
If the Owner discovers within the applicable coverage period a defect in material or workmanship, the Owner must promptly give notice to either Meritor or the dealer from which the vehicle was purchased. To obtain service, the vehicle must be taken to any participating OEM new truck and/or trailer dealer or authorized Meritor service location. The dealer will inspect the vehicle and contact Meritor for an evaluation. If the claim is authorized by Meritor, the dealer will repair or replace during the term of this warranty any defective Meritor component covered by this warranty.

(9) Entire Agreement.  
This is the entire agreement between Meritor and the Owner about warranty and no Meritor employee or dealer is authorized to make any additional warranty on behalf of Meritor. This agreement allocates the responsibilities for component failure between Meritor and the Owner.

Product names, brands, names and trademarks depicted herein are the property of their respective owners and, except where otherwise indicated, are not in any way associated with Meritor Heavy Vehicle Systems, LLC, or any part of affiliation, thereof.

   This limited warranty shall apply only if the product is properly maintained in accordance with Pierce's maintenance instructions and manuals and is used in service which is normal to the particular model. Normal service means service under conditions that do not cause or impact the product to a degree that normally results in failure. If the Buyer discovers a defect or nonconformity, it must notify Pierce in writing within thirty (30) days after the date of discovery, but in any event prior to the expiration of the warranty period. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY MAY NOT BE ASSIGNED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED BY THE BUYER TO ANY SUBSEQUENT USER OR PURCHASER OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Pierce makes no warranty whatsoever as to:

(a) any integral parts, components, attachments or trade accessories of or to the product that are not manufactured by Pierce, including but not limited to engines, transmissions, driveline, axles, water pumps and generators with respect to such parts, components, attachments and accessories, Pierce shall assign to Buyer the applicable warranties, if any, made by the respective manufacturers thereof;

(b) any vehicle, chassis, or component, part, attachment or accessory damaged by misuse, neglect, fire, exposure to severe environmental or chemical conditions, acidic environment, improper maintenance, accident, or for cause including such as natural disaster, lightning, earthquake, windstorm, flood, or fire;

(c) any vehicle, chassis or component, part, attachment or accessory that has been repaired, altered or assembled in any way by any person or entity other than Pierce which, in the sole judgment of Pierce, adversely affects the performance, stability or purpose for which it was manufactured;

(d) products or parts which may in the ordinary course wear out and have to be replaced during the warranty period, including, but not limited to, tires, fluids, gaskets and light bulbs. Pierce assumes no responsibility for the assembly of its parts or subassemblies into finishing products or vehicles unless the assembly is performed by Pierce.

The original purchaser may void this warranty in part or in its entirety if the product is repaired or replaced (a) without prior written approval of the Pierce Service Department (or detail to fulfill warranty obligations) or (b) by a service facility not approved by Pierce and lacking the required technical capability. Any repairs, modifications, alterations or advertisements made by any manufacturer without the authorization of Pierce may void this warranty.

3. **BUYER'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY.**  
   The warranty set forth in paragraph 1 is the sole and exclusive remedy available to the Buyer for the product during the warranty period, and such nonconformity is not due to misuse, neglect, accident or improper maintenance. Buyer must notify Pierce within the prescribed time period. At the request of Pierce, any allegedly defective product shall be returned to Pierce by Buyer for examination and repair. Buyer shall be responsible for the cost of such transportation and for risk of loss or damage to the product during transportation. Within a reasonable time, Pierce shall repair or replace the product (as applicable) any nonconforming or defective parts. Repair or replacement shall be made only by a facility approved in advance in writing by Pierce. THIS REMEDY SHALL BE THE EXCLUSIVE AND SOLE REMEDY FOR ANY BREACH OF WARRANTY.

4. **EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL AND INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.**  
   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein in any agreement between Pierce and Buyer, IN NO EVENT SHALL PIERCE BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, WHETHER ARISING OUT OF BREACH OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY) OR OTHER THEORY OF LAW OR COURT, WITH RESPECT TO VEHICLES OR PRODUCTS SOLD BY PIERCE, OR THEIR OPERATION, USE OR PERFORMANCE. THE FOREGOING, PARTICULARLY INCLUDING ACTS OF OMISSION OR COMMISSION THERETO, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER PIERCE HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Pierce disclaims liability for loss of revenues, profits, or any associated expenses, damages for loss of use, or costs of downtime, delay and any damages, whether direct or consequential, arising from the injury to any such damages.

**Note:** Any Surety Bond, if a part of the sale of the vehicle to which this warranty applies, applies only to the parts and accessories made by Pierce in a separate document and not to any other parts or accessories that are incorporated into or attached to the vehicle.

# WARRANTY - MODEL YEAR 2021 VEHICLES

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

(1) **What is Covered by this Commercial Warranty?**  
ZF CV Systems North America LLC and its North American subsidiaries and affiliates (ZF) warrant to the owner (“Owner”) that the components listed in this publication, which have been installed by an Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) as original equipment will be free from defects in material and workmanship. This warranty coverage begins from the original in-service date to the limits provided and runs concurrently with any warranties provided by OEMs and/or any distribution agreements and/or any service contracts that cover the components listed in this publication, if any. If the components listed in this publication are covered by an OEM warranty and/or service contract, then the Owner’s warranty and/or service contract shall supersede ZF’s warranty and Owner shall comply with all OEM’s warranty and/or service contract requirements for claims under such OEM’s warranty and/or service contract until those agreements expire. Once those agreements expire and provided the ZF warranty has not expired under the terms stated above, the ZF warranty will be in effect until its expiration date.

Warranty coverage ends at the expiration of the applicable time period from the date of vehicle purchase by the first Owner, or the applicable mileage limitation, whichever occurs first. Duration of coverage varies by component and vocation as detailed provisions in this publication. Some components are warranted for parts only and the Owner must pay any labor costs associated with the repair or replacement of the component. Other components are warranted for both parts and reasonable labor to repair or replace the subject component. Additional diagnostic time to use of an outdated version of TOOLBOX™, time to purchase or install latest version of TOOLBOX™ are the responsibility of the authorized ZF distributor networks and are not covered under product warranty. Components installed as replacements under this warranty are warranted only for the remainder of the original period of time or mileage under the original warranty.

(2) **Designation of Vocational Use Required.** To obtain warranty coverage, each Owner must notify ZF through the OEM new truck and/or trailer dealer of the intended vocational use of the vehicle into which the WABCO components have been incorporated prior to the vehicle in-service date. This notification may be accomplished by registering the vehicle through your OEM new truck and/or trailer dealer or with ZF directly. Failure to notify ZF of (i) the intended vocational use of the vehicle or (ii) a change in vocational use from which was originally designated, will result in the application of a one year, unlimited mileage, parts only warranty (1/1h/1P) from the initial in-service date. A second Owner and each subsequent Owner must also notify ZF as to the intended vocational use of the vehicle. This notification can be sent directly to ZF or through

the OEM new truck and/or trailer dealer. The duration and mileage coverage of this warranty cannot exceed the coverage extended to the first Owner after his or her initial designation of vocational use. Coverage under ZF’s warranty requires that the application of products be properly approved pursuant to OEM and ZF approvals.

(3) **What is the Cost of this Warranty?** There is no charge to the Owner for this warranty.

(4) **What is not Covered by this Warranty?** In addition to the items listed on “Coverage Exclusions,” this warranty does not cover normal wear and tear, or service items; nor does it cover a component that fails, malfunctions or is damaged as a result of (a) improper handling, storage, installation, adjustment, repair or modification including the use of unauthorized attachments or changes or modification in the vehicle’s configuration, usage, or vocation from that which was originally approved by ZF, (b) accident, fire or other casualty, natural disaster, road debris, negligence, misuse, abuse, or improper use (including loading beyond the specified maximum vehicle weight or altering engine power settings to exceed the brake system capacity), or (c) improper or insufficient maintenance (including deviation from maintenance intervals, approved lubricants, or lube levels). This warranty does not cover any component or part that is not sold by ZF.

(5) **To obtain service.** If the owner discovers within the applicable coverage period a defect in material or workmanship, the Owner must promptly give notice to either ZF or the dealer from which the vehicle was purchased. To obtain service, the vehicle must be taken to any participating OEM dealer or ZF distributor networks’ service. The dealer or ZF authorized servicer will inspect the vehicle and contact ZF for an evaluation of the claim. When authorized by ZF, the dealer or ZF authorized servicer will repair or replace during the term of this warranty any defective WABCO component covered by this warranty.

(6) **Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of remedies.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH HEREIN IS EXCLUSIVE AND IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARISING BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND/OR WARRANTY FOR HIDDEN OR LATENT DEFECTS, AND IN NO EVENT WILL ZF OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PROGRESSIVE, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND.
<!-- Page 129 -->
![Warranty Information](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Warranty+Information)

**Telescopic Waterways**

### A. PRESHIPMENT TESTING  
All waterways fabricated by Amity are final inspected using the following pressure minimums:  
1. Hydrostatic applications will be tested to 400 PSI unless specified otherwise on approved drawings. Operating pressures on installed systems are not to exceed 250 PSI at any point in the system. Warranty will be voided and Amity will not be held liable for failure and/or damage occurring from Water Hammering or freezing of water in any system.

### B. COMPONENTS DESCRIPTION AND MAINTENANCE  
1. All components are thoroughly greased at assembly. Since internally lubricated seals are used, regular greasing is not required. We recommend components not be greased at installation.  
2. Slip Tube Assemblies may be greased at the Amity’s regularly scheduled Aerial Inspections. The seals in the Slip Tube Assemblies are self-lubricating, so greasing is not mandatory. We do recommend a visual inspection of the Slip Tube Assembly while it is fully extended after initial installation; from that point on we recommend inspection every ten hours of aerial operation. If any deposits of aluminum appear, they are to be rubbed off using a Teflon scrubbing pad. Slip Tube Assemblies are designed to give long maintenance free service; however, like any product, problems may occur and periodic visual inspections will aid in determining if a potential problem exists and warrants a call to us. Care must be taken to keep debris off of extended tubes. We recommend wiping tubes with light oil (10 weight) or hydraulic oil after use, if tubes appear to have contamination on them. Under no circumstances are tubes to be cleaned with lacquer thinner, or any other solvent.

5. Amity assumes responsibility for our product, which is defective only, and therefore, it will not assume responsibility for labor to either remove or install our product unless it agrees in writing to assume such responsibility.  
6. Unless otherwise approved in writing by the Amity all returns of defective (or allegedly defective products) are at Purchaser’s expense and must include a RGA number issued by the Amity.
