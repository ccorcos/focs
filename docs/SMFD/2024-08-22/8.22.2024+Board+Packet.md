**DATE:** August 22, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Authority to Reenter into an Agreement with State of California Department of Health Care Services for Intergovernmental Transfers from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023  

**TOPIC**  
Reauthorize the Fire Chief to enter into an intergovernmental agreement to transfer public funds to the State of California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), which is necessary to participate in the Voluntary Rate Range Program (VRRP) Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT), a federal reimbursement program, for eligible medical transports between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Beginning in Fiscal Year 2014/15, the District has participated in the VRRP IGT to receive federal funds associated with the District's transport of Medi-Cal managed care beneficiaries. Participation in the VRRP requires the District annually to enter into an agreement with the DHCS and each of the participating managed care plans (Plans), currently Anthem, Health Net, Kaiser, and Molina.  

The proposed agreement covers the 12-month period of transports between January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023.  

The DHCS agreement is substantially similar to those entered into in previous fiscal years.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
No impact. This agreement does not change the current FY 2024/25 net budgeted IGT revenue of $8.4 million.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends that the Board approve the attached resolution reauthorizing the Fire Chief to enter into the necessary agreement with DHCS to participate in the VRRP IGT reimbursement period covering January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023.

The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District's (District) Board of Directors has previously approved the execution of short-term leases of real property adjacent to Fire Station 21 to accommodate the additional parking needs for academies on an as-needed basis. There are currently no leases in effect.  

**DISCUSSION**

The cost of the lease will be $7,500 with an initial security deposit of $1,500 to be refunded at term expiration. These costs will be paid out of the Training Division budget.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board of Directors authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to negotiate and execute a lease agreement materially similar to the attached.

10. **Liability; Indemnification.** Each party agrees that they shall indemnify, defend and hold the other party and its governing body, officers, agents and employees, harmless from any and all claims, damages, losses, causes of action and demands, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, incurred in connection with or in any manner arising out of the indemnifying party's performance of this Agreement. The indemnifying party, at the indemnifying party's own expense and risk shall defend any and all actions, suits, or other legal proceedings that may be brought or instituted against the other party, the members of its governing body, officers, agents, and employees for any such claims, damages, losses, demands, liabilities, costs or expenses incurred in connection with or in any manner arising out of the indemnifying party's performance of this Agreement. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for damage or injury occasioned by the sole negligence or willful misconduct of the non-indemnifying party and its officers, agents, or employees. It is the intention of the parties that where comparative fault is determined to have been contributory, principles of comparative fault will be followed and each party shall bear the proportionate cost of any damage attributable to the fault of that party, its elected and appointed officials, officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, subcontractors, and volunteers. These indemnification provisions shall survive the termination of the Lease.

11. **Insurance.** Lessee shall maintain at all times commercial general liability insurance insuring Lessor and Lessee against all claims or demands for personal injuries to or death of any person, and damage to or destruction or loss of property, that may be claimed to have occurred on the Premises as a result of Lessee’s use thereof. The policies shall cover such risks and be in such amounts as Lessor from time to time may reasonably request, but in any event with a combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage per occurrence of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00).

Lessee’s insurance shall be issued by an insurer licensed to do business in the State of California and shall contain a waiver of subrogation endorsement. Lessee shall deliver to Lessor certificates of such insurance coverage and evidence of payment of all premiums promptly upon demand by Lessor, which certificates shall show Lessor as an additional insured and shall provide that no cancellation, reduction in amount, or material change in coverage shall be effective until at least thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice to Lessor.

12. **Assignment; Sublease.** Lessee may assign this Lease and Lessee may sublease the Premises in whole or in part with Lessor’s written approval which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

13. **Lessor’s Right of Access.** Lessor and Lessor’s employees or agents, shall have the right to enter the Premises in a reasonable manner upon reasonable advance notice to Lessee to inspect the Premises or to conduct surveys, testing, or studies in connection with any engineering, design, financing, or permitting activities related to potential development of the Premises; provided, however, that no notice will be required in emergency circumstances where it is impractical to provide Lessee with advance notice. Lessor shall use reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption of Lessee’s activities.

14. **Default.** Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default:

a. Lessee fails to maintain at all times the insurance required by this Lease.  
b. Lessee fails to comply with any agreement or requirement in this Lease for a period of thirty (30) days after notice from Lessor.
