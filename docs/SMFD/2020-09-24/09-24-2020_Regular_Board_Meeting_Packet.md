**TODD HARMS**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** September 24, 2020  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Intergovernmental Transfers for July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020  

**TOPIC**  
Authorize the Fire Chief to enter into the necessary agreements to participate in the Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) Program covering the period July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Beginning in Fiscal Year 2014/2015, the District has participated in the IGT Program to receive federal funds associated with the District’s transport of Medi-Cal managed care beneficiaries. Participation in the program requires agreements between the District and each of the participating Managed Care Plans (Aetna, Anthem, Health Net, Kaiser, and Molina) and with the State of California to complete the transfers.  

Under the Program, the District makes IGT contributions associated with each plan as well as a 20% State administrative fee, and the State receives matching funds from the federal government. The State then uses the amount contributed by the District and the federal government to pay the Plans enhanced rates, and the Plans use these funds (net of Plan administrative fees) to pay the District under the terms of the agreements.  

The proposed agreements cover the 18-month period July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020, with an initial transfer anticipated for July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 (IGT #1) expected to occur during FY 2020/21 and a later transfer for July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 (IGT #2). The State intends to transition the IGTs to a calendar year basis beginning in 2021. The State and plan agreements are substantially similar to those entered into in previous fiscal years, with the exception of the extended 18-month timeframe and the Aetna agreement, which is new for this fiscal year.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Under the proposed IGTs, the District will transfer an estimated total of $9,535,205 to the State (including the State administrative fee). This amount is subject to change by the State based on the finalization of actual plan activity. Estimated total plan payments to the District are $24,104,538, for estimated net new funds to the District of $14,569,333.

# INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT REGARDING TRANSFER OF PUBLIC FUNDS

This Agreement is entered into between the CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ("DHCS") and the SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN FIRE DISTRICT (GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY) with respect to the matters set forth below.  
The parties agree as follows:

## AGREEMENT

1. **Transfer of Public Funds**  
   1.1 The GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY agrees to make a transfer of funds to DHCS pursuant to sections 14164 and 14301.4 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. The amount transferred shall be based on the sum of the applicable rate category per member per month (PMPM) contribution increments multiplied by member months, as reflected in Exhibit 1. The GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY agrees to initially transfer amounts that are calculated using the Estimated Member Months in Exhibit 1, which will be reconciled to actual enrollment for the service periods of July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, and July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and reconciled to actual PMPMs for the service period of July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 in accordance with Sub-Section 1.3 of this Agreement. The funds transferred shall be used as described in Sub-Section 2.2 of this Agreement. The funds shall be transferred in accordance with the terms and conditions, including schedule and amount, established by DHCS.

1.2 The GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY shall certify that the funds transferred qualify for Federal Financial Participation pursuant to 42 C.F.R. part 433, subpart B, and are not derived from impermissible sources such as recycled Medicaid payments, Federal money excluded from use as State match, impermissible taxes, and non-bona fide provider-related donations. Impermissible sources do not include patient care or other revenue received from programs such as Medicare or Medicaid to the extent that the program revenue is not obligated to the State as the source of funding.

1.3 DHCS shall reconcile the “Estimated Member Months,” in Exhibit 1, to actual enrollment in HEALTH PLAN(S) for the service periods of July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, and July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 using actual enrollment figures taken from DHCS records. Enrollment reconciliation will occur on an ongoing basis as updated enrollment figures become available. Actual enrollment figures will be considered final two years after June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. DHCS shall reconcile the “Projected Contribution PMPM,” in Exhibit 1(b), to actual PMPM for HEALTH PLAN(S) for the service period of July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 using actual PMPMs that result from the risk adjustment process as reflected in figures taken from DHCS records. PMPM reconciliation will occur on an ongoing basis as the risk adjustment process is finalized. Actual PMPM amounts will be considered final two years after December 31, 2020. If reconciliation results in an increase to the total amount necessary to fund the nonfederal share of the payments described in Sub-Section 2.2, the GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY agrees to transfer any additional funds necessary to cover the difference. If reconciliation results in a decrease to the total amount necessary to fund the nonfederal share of the payments described in Sub-Section 2.2, DHCS agrees to return the unexpended funds to the GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY. If

DHCS and the GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY mutually agree, amounts due to or owed by the GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY may be offset against future transfers.

2. Acceptance and Use of Transferred Funds  
2.1 DHCS shall exercise its authority under section 14164 of the Welfare and Institutions Code to accept funds transferred by the GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY pursuant to this Agreement as IGTs, to use for the purpose set forth in Sub-Section 2.2.  
2.2 The funds transferred by the GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY pursuant to Section 1 and Exhibit 1 of this Agreement shall be used to fund the non-federal share of Medi-Cal Managed Care actuarially sound capitation rates described in section 14301.4(b)(4) of the Welfare and Institutions Code as reflected in the contribution PMPM and rate categories reflected in Exhibit 1. The funds transferred shall be paid, together with the related Federal Financial Participation, by DHCS to HEALTH PLAN(S) as part of HEALTH PLAN(S)’ capitation rates for the service periods of July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, and July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, in accordance with section 14301.4 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.  
2.3 DHCS shall seek Federal Financial Participation for the capitation rates specified in Sub-Section 2.2 to the full extent permitted by federal law.  
2.4 The parties acknowledge that DHCS will obtain any necessary approvals from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  
2.5 DHCS shall not direct HEALTH PLAN(S)’ expenditure of the payments received pursuant to Sub-Section 2.2.  

3. Assessment Fee

![CONTRACT #19-96461](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=CONTRACT+%2319-96461)

3.1 DHCS shall exercise its authority under section 14301.4 of the Welfare and Institutions Code to assess a 20 percent fee related to the amounts transferred pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement, except as provided in Sub-Section 3.2. GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY agrees to pay the full amount of that assessment in addition to the funds transferred pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement.

3.2 The 20-percent assessment fee shall not be applied to any portion of funds transferred pursuant to Section 1 that are exempt in accordance with sections 14301.4(d) or 14301.5(b)(4) of the Welfare and Institutions Code. DHCS shall have sole discretion to determine the amount of the funds transferred pursuant to Section 1 that will not be subject to a 20 percent fee. DHCS has determined that $0.00 of the transfer amounts will not be assessed a 20 percent fee, subject to Sub-Section 3.3.

3.3 The 20-percent assessment fee pursuant to this Agreement is non-refundable and shall be wired to DHCS separately from, and simultaneous to, the transfer amounts made under Section 1 of this Agreement. If, at the time of the reconciliation performed pursuant to Sub-Section 1.3 of this Agreement, there is a change in the amount transferred that is subject to the 20-percent assessment in accordance with Sub-Section 3.1, then a proportional adjustment to the assessment fee will be made.

4. Amendments  
4.1 No amendment or modification to this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless made in writing and executed by both parties.

4.2 The parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement as necessary and appropriate to implement the requirements set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement.

This Health Plan-Provider Agreement ("Agreement") is made by and between Aetna Better Health of California, a corporation, hereinafter referred to as "PLAN," and the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District hereinafter referred to as "PROVIDER."

**RECITALS:**

WHEREAS, PLAN is a health care service plan licensed under and subject to the Knox-Keene Care Service Plan Act of 1975, as amended, and is a party to a Medi-Cal managed care contract with the California Department of Health Care Services ("State DHCS") to arrange and pay for the provision of covered Medi-Cal health care services to eligible Medi-Cal members, including Medi-Cal members residing in Sacramento County;

WHEREAS, PROVIDER is a local government entity duly licensed by the State of California to provide emergency ambulance transports;

NOW, THEREFORE, PLAN and PROVIDER hereby agree as follows:

1. **2019-20 IGT Medi-Cal Managed Care Capitation Rate Range Increases to PLAN**

   A. **Payment**

   Should PLAN receive any Medi-Cal managed care capitation rate increases from State DHCS where the nonfederal share is funded by the GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY specifically pursuant to the provisions of the Intergovernmental Agreement Regarding Transfer of Public Funds, # 19-96461, effective for the period of July 1, 2019

---

Plan-Provider Agreement, Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District and Aetna Better Health, 2019-20 Rate Range IGTs P28
<!-- Page 29 -->
through December 31, 2020 for Intergovernmental Transfer Medi-Cal Managed Care Rate Increases (“IGT MMCRIs”), PLAN shall pay to PROVIDER the amount of the IGT MMCRRIs received from State DHCS, in accordance with Paragraph 1.E below regarding the form and timing of Local Medi-Cal Managed Care Rate Range (“LMMCRR”) IGT Payments. LMMCRR IGT Payments paid to PROVIDER shall not replace or supplant any other amounts paid or payable to PROVIDER by PLAN.

B. Health Plan Retention  
(1) As compensation for its administrative services in connection with this Agreement, PLAN shall retain a two percent (2%) administrative fee based on the total amount of the IGT MMCRRI received from State DHCS. Each provider’s share of the two percent (2%) fee shall be calculated based on that provider’s proportionate share of the LMMCRR IGT Payments made by PLAN in Sacramento County.  
(2) PLAN will not retain any other portion of the IGT MMCRIs received from the State DHCS other than those specified above.

C. Conditions for Receiving Local Medi-Cal Managed Care Rate Range IGT Payments  
As a condition for receiving LMMCRR IGT Payments, PROVIDER shall, as of the date the particular LMMCRR IGT Payment is due:  
(1) Remain a participating provider in the PLAN and not issue a notice of termination of the Agreement; and  
(2) Maintain its current emergency response services for PLAN Medi-Cal beneficiaries.

D. Schedule and Notice of Transfer of Non-Federal Funds  
PROVIDER shall notify PLAN when funding has been made pursuant to the Intergovernmental Agreement within five (5) business days of such transfer.

E. Form and Timing of Payments  
PLAN agrees to pay LMMCRR IGT Payments to PROVIDER in the following form and according to the following schedule:  
Plan-Provider Agreement, Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District and Aetna Better Health, 2019-20 Rate Range IGTs  
P 29
<!-- Page 30 -->
(1) PLAN agrees to pay the LMMCRR IGT Payments to PROVIDER using the same mechanism through which compensation and payments are normally paid to PROVIDER (e.g., electronic transfer).

(2) PLAN will pay the LMMCRR IGT Payments to PROVIDER no later than thirty (30) calendar days after PLAN’s receipt of the IGT MMCRRI from State DHCS.

F. Consideration

(1) As consideration for the LMMCRR IGT Payments, PROVIDER shall use the LMMCRR IGT Payments for the following purposes and shall treat the LMMCRR IGT Payments in the following manner:

(a) The LMMCRR IGT Payments shall represent compensation for Medi-Cal services rendered to Medi-Cal PLAN members by PROVIDER during the State fiscal year to which the LMMCRR IGT Payments apply.

(b) To the extent that total payments received by PROVIDER for any State fiscal year under this Agreement exceed the cost of Medi-Cal services provided to Medi-Cal beneficiaries by PROVIDER during that fiscal year, any remaining LMMCRR IGT Payment amounts shall be retained by PROVIDER to be expended for health care services. Retained LMMCRR IGT Payment amounts may be used by the PROVIDER in either the State fiscal year for which the payments are received or subsequent State fiscal years.

(2) For purposes of subsection (1)(b) above, if the retained LMMCRR IGT Payments, if any, are not used by PROVIDER in the State fiscal year received, retention of funds by PROVIDER will be established by demonstrating that the retained earnings account of PROVIDER at the end of any State fiscal year in which it received payments based on LMMCRR IGT Payments funded pursuant to the Intergovernmental Agreement, has increased over the unspent portion of the prior State fiscal year’s balance by the amount of LMMCRR IGT Payments received, but not used. These retained PROVIDER funds may be commingled with other GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY funds for cash management purposes provided that such funds are appropriately tracked and only the depositing facility is authorized to expend them.

(3) Both parties agree that none of these funds, either from the GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY or federal matching funds, will be recycled back to the GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY’s general fund, the State, or any other.

G. PLAN’s Oversight Responsibilities  
PLAN's oversight responsibilities regarding PROVIDER's use of the LMMCRR IGT Payments shall be limited as described in this paragraph. PLAN shall request, within thirty (30) calendar days after the end of each State fiscal year in which LMMCRR IGT Payments were transferred to PROVIDER, a written confirmation that states whether and how PROVIDER complied with the provisions set forth in Paragraph 1.F above. In each instance, PROVIDER shall provide PLAN with written confirmation of compliance within thirty (30) calendar days of PLAN's request.

H. Cooperation Among Parties  
Should disputes or disagreements arise regarding the ultimate computation or appropriateness of any aspect of the LMMCRR IGT Payments, PROVIDER and PLAN agree to work together in all respects to support and preserve the LMMCRR IGT Payments to the full extent possible and permitted by law on behalf of the safety net in Sacramento County.

I. Reconciliation  
Within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after the end of each of PLAN’s fiscal years in which LMMCRR IGT Payments were made to PROVIDER, PLAN shall perform a reconciliation of the LMMCRR IGT Payments transmitted to the PROVIDER during the preceding fiscal year to ensure that the supporting amount of IGT MMCRRIs were received by PLAN from State DHCS. PROVIDER agrees to return to PLAN any overpayment of LMMCRR IGT Payments made in error to PROVIDER within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt from PLAN of a written notice of the overpayment error, unless PROVIDER submits a written objection to PLAN. Any such objection shall be resolved in accordance with Section H (above) of this Agreement. The reconciliation processes established under this paragraph are distinct from the indemnification provisions set forth in Section J below. PLAN agrees to transmit to the PROVIDER any underpayment of LMMCRR IGT Payments within thirty (30) calendar days of the PLAN’s identification of such underpayment.

(b) To the extent that total payments received by PROVIDER for any State fiscal year under this Agreement exceed the cost of Medi-Cal services provided to Medi-Cal beneficiaries by PROVIDER during that fiscal year, any remaining LMMCRR IGT Payment amounts shall be retained by PROVIDER to be expended for health care services. Retained LMMCRR IGT Payment amounts may be used by the PROVIDER in either the State fiscal year for which the payments are received or subsequent State fiscal years.

(2) For purposes of subsection (b) above, if the retained LMMCRR IGT Payments, if any, are not used by PROVIDER in the State fiscal year received, retention of funds by PROVIDER will be established by demonstrating that the retained earnings account of PROVIDER at the end of any State fiscal year in which it received payments based on LMMCRR IGT Payments funded pursuant to the Intergovernmental Agreement, has increased over the unspent portion of the prior State fiscal year’s balance by the amount of LMMCRR IGT Payments received, but not used. These retained PROVIDER funds may be commingled with other GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY funds for cash management purposes provided that such funds are appropriately tracked and only the depositing facility is authorized to expend them.

(3) Both parties agree that none of these funds, either from the GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY or federal matching funds will be recycled back to the GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY’s general fund, the State, or any other intermediary organization. Payments made by the health plan to providers under the terms of this Agreement constitute patient care revenues.

G. PLAN’s Oversight Responsibilities

PLAN’s oversight responsibilities regarding PROVIDER’s use of the LMMCRR IGT Payments shall be limited as described in this paragraph. PLAN may request, within thirty (30) calendar days after the end of each State fiscal year in which LMMCRR IGT Payments were transferred to PROVIDER, a written confirmation that states whether and how PROVIDER complied with the provisions set forth in Paragraph F above. In each instance, PROVIDER shall

provide PLAN with written confirmation of compliance within thirty (30) calendar days of PLAN’s request.

H. Cooperation Among Parties  
Should disputes or disagreements arise regarding the ultimate computation or appropriateness of any aspect of the LMMCRR IGT Payments, PROVIDER and PLAN agree to work together in all respects to support and preserve the LMMCRR IGT Payments to the full extent possible on behalf of the PROVIDER.

I. Reconciliation  
Within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after the end of each of PLAN’s fiscal years in which LMMCRR IGT Payments were made to PROVIDER, PLAN shall perform a reconciliation of the LMMCRR IGT Payments transmitted to the PROVIDER during the preceding fiscal year to ensure that the supporting amount of IGT MMCRRs were received by PLAN from State DHCS. PROVIDER agrees to return to PLAN any overpayment of LMMCRR IGT Payments made in error to PROVIDER within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt from PLAN of a written notice of the overpayment error, unless PROVIDER submits a written objection to PLAN. Any such objection shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution processes set forth in Section H of this Agreement or otherwise in good faith by the parties. The reconciliation processes established under this paragraph are distinct from the indemnification provisions set forth below. PLAN agrees to transmit to the PROVIDER any underpayment of LMMCRR IGT Payments within thirty (30) calendar days of PLAN’s identification of such underpayment.

J. Indemnification  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Agreement, PROVIDER shall indemnify and hold PLAN harmless against any losses, claims, demands, liabilities, court costs, judgments and expenses, imposed by a court or otherwise incurred by PLAN after the execution date of the Agreement as a result of PLAN’s receipt of IGT MMCRRs or payment of LMMCRR IGT, including but not limited to the following circumstances:

(1) In the event that State DHCS, the Department of Health and Human Services or any other federal or state agency recoups, offsets, or otherwise withdraws any monies from or fails to provide any monies to PLAN, or PLAN is denied any monies to which it otherwise would have been entitled, for any reason relating to the Medi-Cal managed care capitation rate increases arising from the Intergovernmental Agreement as such increases flow through the Medi-Cal Agreement between PLAN and the State and this Agreement, including but not limited to:

4  
P38
<!-- Page 39 -->
(a) State DHCS’ failure to treat the IGT MMCRRIs or LMMCRR IGT Payments as set forth in the applicable sections of the Intergovernmental Agreement;

(b) the failure of the IGT MMCRRIs to qualify for federal participation pursuant to 42 C.F.R. part 433, subpart B; or

(c) overpayment of IGT MMCRRIs to PLAN by State DHCS, PLAN shall have a right to immediately recoup, offset or withhold any and all such amounts from payments otherwise due to PROVIDER. Recovery by PLAN pursuant to this section shall include, but not be limited to, reduction in future LMMCRRs paid to PROVIDER in an amount equal to the amount of IGT MMCRR payments recovered from PLAN, or by reduction of any other amounts owed to PLAN by PROVIDER.

(2) PLAN shall pursue an appeal, a lawsuit, or any other available legal action to challenge any recoupment by State DHCS, the Department of Health and Human Services, or any other federal or state agency that is not required by law, unless after consultation with PROVIDER and with good cause, PLAN acting reasonably determines that it is not in the best interest of PLAN and/or PROVIDER to do so;

(3) At PLAN’s discretion PROVIDER shall either provide or arrange for legal representation on PLAN’s behalf or PLAN shall arrange for its own representation and be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs from PROVIDER for such representation, in addition to any and all other relief to which PLAN may be entitled, including but not limited to, the following circumstances:

(a) If any action at law, suit in equity, arbitration, or administrative action is brought against PLAN by State DHCS, the Department of Health and Human Services, or any other federal or state agency or other individual or organization to: (i) enforce or interpret the IGT MMCRRIs or LMMCRRs; or (ii) recoup, offset, or otherwise withhold any monies from PLAN relating to the IGT MMCRRIs or LMMCRR IGT Payments; or

(b) If PLAN brings any appeal, action at law, suit in equity, arbitration or administrative action against the State DHCS, or any other federal or state agency to (i) enforce or interpret the IGT MMCRRIs or LMMCRRs; or (ii) in response to an action described in subparagraph 1 or subparagraph 3(a) above; and

(4) If PLAN prevails in any appeal, action at law, suit in equity, arbitration, or administrative action taken against PLAN to enforce or interpret the IGT MMCRRIs or LMMCRRs, PLAN shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees and costs from PROVIDER.

K. Relationship of the Parties  
For purposes of this Agreement, PLAN and PROVIDER are and will act at all times as independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed, or be deemed to create, a relationship of employer or employee or principal and agent, or any relationship other than that of independent entities contracting with each other for the purposes of effectuating this Agreement. In no way shall PLAN be construed to be providers of Health Services or responsible for the provision of such Health Services. PROVIDER shall be solely responsible to the Covered Individual for treatment and medical care with respect to the provision of Health Services. PROVIDER may freely communicate with Covered Individuals regarding the treatment options available to them, including medication treatment options, regardless of benefit coverage limitations.

PROVIDER hereby expressly acknowledges its understanding that this Agreement constitutes a contract between PROVIDER and PLAN, that PLAN is an independent corporation operating under a license from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, an association of independent Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans ("Association"), permitting PLAN to use the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Service Marks in the state where PLAN is located, and that PLAN is not contracting as the agent of the Association. PROVIDER further acknowledges and agrees that it has not entered into this Agreement based upon representations by any person other than PLAN, and that no person, entity or organization other than PLAN shall be held accountable or liable to PROVIDER for any of PLAN's obligations to PROVIDER created under this Agreement. PROVIDER has no license to use the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield names, symbols, or derivative marks (the "Brands") and nothing in the Agreement shall be deemed to grant a license to PROVIDER to use the Brands. Any references to the Brands made by PROVIDER in its own materials are subject to review and approval by PLAN. This section shall not create any additional obligations whatsoever on the part of Plan, other than those obligations created under other provisions of this Agreement.

L. Severability  
In case any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, the remaining provisions shall be construed liberally in order to effectuate the purposes hereof, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. If one or more provisions of the Agreement are invalid, illegal or unenforceable and an amendment to the Agreement is necessary to maintain its integrity, the parties shall make commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate an
<!-- Page 41 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

amendment to this Agreement and any attachments or addenda to this Agreement which could reasonably be construed not to contravene such statute, regulation, or interpretation. In addition, if such invalid, unenforceable or materially affected provision(s) may be severed from this Agreement and/or attachments or addenda to this Agreement without materially affecting the parties' intent when this Agreement was executed, then such provision(s) shall be severed rather than terminating the Agreement or any attachments or addenda to this Agreement.

This Amendment is made this _____ day of _______________, (month/year), by and between Health Net of California, Inc., a California corporation licensed pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 1349 et seq. to act as a health plan hereinafter referred to as "PLAN," and Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, hereinafter referred to as "PROVIDER."

RECITALS:

WHEREAS, PLAN and PROVIDER have previously entered into an Agreement effective January 1, 2013;

WHEREAS, Section XIII of such Agreement provides for amending such Agreement;

WHEREAS, Health Net Community Solutions, Inc. (HNCS), a corporate entity licensed under Health and Safety Code Section 1349 et seq. has a contract with the California Department of Health Care Services (State DHCS) pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14087.3 to act as a Medi-Cal managed care plan. HNCS has contracted with Health Net of California, Inc. to fulfill its responsibilities for the provision of Medi-Cal covered services for eligible Medi-Cal members. Health Net of California, Inc. has subsequently entered into the Agreement referenced above, and amendments to it, to allow PROVIDER to render such services to HNCS Medi-Cal members in Sacramento County. For purposes of this Amendment, Health Net of California, Inc. and Health Net Community Solutions, Inc. shall collectively be referred to as "PLAN;"

WHEREAS, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District ("Metro Fire") is a California special district located in Sacramento County serving a population of more than 700,000. As a 9-1-1 ambulance provider, Metro Fire responds to emergencies with a paramedic staffed vehicle and transports patients to area hospitals regardless of their type of health insurance or ability to pay.

WHEREAS, PLAN and PROVIDER desire to amend the Agreement to provide for Medi-Cal managed care capitation rate increases to PLAN as a result of intergovernmental transfers ("IGTs") from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY) to the California Department of Health Care Services ("State DHCS") to maintain the availability of Medi-Cal health care services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries.

NOW, THEREFORE, PLAN and PROVIDER hereby agree as follows:

   B. **Health Plan Retention**

   (2) The PLAN shall retain a two percent (2%) administrative fee based on the total amount of the IGT MMCRRIs received from DHCS for PLAN’s cost to administer this program. Each provider’s share of the two percent (2%) fee shall be calculated based on that provider’s proportionate share of the LMMCRR IGT payments made by Plan in Sacramento County.

   (3) PLAN will not retain any other portion of the IGT MMCRRIs received from the State DHCS other than those mentioned above.

Retained LMMCRR IGT Payment amounts may be used by the PROVIDER in either the State fiscal year for which the payments are received or subsequent State fiscal years.  
(2) For purposes of subsection (1) (b) above, if the retained LMMCRR IGT Payments, if any, are not used by PROVIDER in the State fiscal year received, retention of funds by PROVIDER will be established by demonstrating that the retained earnings account of PROVIDER at the end of any State fiscal year in which it received payments based on

Retained LMMCRR IGT Payment amounts may be used by the PROVIDER in either the State fiscal year for which the payments are received or subsequent State fiscal years.

(2) For purposes of subsection (1)(b) above, if the retained LMMCRR IGT Payments, if any, are not used by PROVIDER in the State fiscal year received, retention of funds by PROVIDER will be established by demonstrating that the retained earnings account of PROVIDER at the end of any State fiscal year in which it received payments based on LMMCRR IGT Payments funded pursuant to the Intergovernmental Agreement, has increased over the unspent portion of the prior State fiscal year’s balance by the amount of LMMCRR IGT Payments received, but not used. These retained PROVIDER funds may be commingled with other GOVERNMENT FUNDING ENTITY funds for cash management purposes provided that such funds are appropriately tracked and only the depositing facility is authorized to expend them.

**AMENDMENT TO AGREEMENT BETWEEN MOLINA HEALTHCARE AND SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN FIRE DISTRICT**

**AMENDMENT 7**

This Amendment is made by and between Molina Healthcare, a California corporation licensed pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 1349 et seq. to act as a health plan hereinafter referred to as "PLAN," and Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, hereinafter referred to as "PROVIDER."

**RECITALS:**

WHEREAS, PLAN and PROVIDER have previously entered into an Agreement effective January 1, 2013;

WHEREAS, Section XIII of such Agreement provides for amending such Agreement;

WHEREAS, Molina Healthcare, a corporate entity licensed under Health and Safety Code Section 1349 et seq. has a contract with the California Department of Health Care Services (State DHCS) pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14087.3 to act as a Medi-Cal managed care plan. Molina Healthcare of California Partner Plan, Inc. has subsequently entered into the Agreement referenced above, and amendments to it, to allow PROVIDER to render such services to Molina Healthcare of California Partner Plan, Inc. Medi-Cal members in Sacramento County;

WHEREAS, PROVIDER is a California special district located in Sacramento County serving a population of more than 700,000. As a 9-1-1 ambulance provider, Metro Fire responds to emergencies with a paramedic staffed vehicle and transports patients to area hospitals regardless of their type of health insurance or ability to pay.

WHEREAS, PLAN and PROVIDER desire to amend the Agreement to provide for Medi-Cal managed care capitation rate increases to PLAN as a result of intergovernmental transfers ("IGTs") from the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY) to the California Department of Health Care Services ("State DHCS") to maintain the availability of Medi-Cal health care services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries.

NOW, THEREFORE, PLAN and PROVIDER hereby agree as follows: Amendment 7 of the Agreement is added to read as follows:

**2019-20 IGT MEDI-CAL MANAGED CARE CAPITATION RATE RANGE INCREASES**

1. IGT Capitation Rate Range Increases to PLAN
<!-- Page 57 -->
A. Payment  
Should PLAN receive any Medi-Cal managed care capitation rate increases from State DHCS where the nonfederal share is funded by the GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY’s Intergovernmental Agreement Regarding Transfer of Public Funds, # 19-96461, effective for the period July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020 for Intergovernmental Transfer Medi-Cal Managed Care Rate Range Increases, (“IGT MMCRRs”), PLAN shall pay to PROVIDER the amount of the IGT MMCRRs received from State DHCS, in accordance with paragraph I.E below regarding the form and timing of Local Medi-Cal Managed Care Rate Range (“LMMCRR”) IGT Payments. LMMCRR IGT Payments paid to PROVIDER shall not replace or supplant any other amounts paid or payable to PROVIDER by PLAN.

B. Health Plan Retention  
(1) The PLAN shall retain a two percent (2%) administrative fee based on the total amount of the IGT MMCRRs received from DHCS for PLAN’s cost to administer this program. Each provider’s share of the two percent (2%) fee shall be calculated based on that provider’s proportionate share of the LMMCRR IGT payments made by Plan in Sacramento County.  
(2) PLAN will not retain any other portion of the IGT MMCRRs received from the State DHCS other than those mentioned above.

C. Conditions for Receiving Local Medi-Cal Managed Care Rate Range IGT Payments  
As a condition for receiving LMMCRR IGT Payments, PROVIDER shall, as of the date the particular LMMCRR IGT Payment is due:  
(1) remain a participating provider in the PLAN and not issue a notice of termination of the Agreement; and  
(2) maintain its current emergency response services for PLAN Medi-Cal beneficiaries.

D. Schedule and Notice of Transfer of Non-Federal Funds  
GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY shall notify the PLAN within five (5) business days after the funds referred to in the Intergovernmental Transfer Agreement have been transferred to the State.

P57
<!-- Page 58 -->
E. Form and Timing of Payments  
PLAN agrees to pay LMMCRR IGT Payments to PROVIDER in the following form and according to the following schedule:  

(1) PLAN agrees to pay the LMMCRR IGT Payments to PROVIDER using the same mechanism through which compensation and payments are normally paid to PROVIDER (e.g., electronic transfer). After retaining the Plan’s administrative fee, as shown in PROVIDER (e), PLAN will pay PROVIDER a percent of the remaining LMMCRR IGT payment equal to the PROVIDER’s contribution as a percent of total governmental entity contributions to this IGT.  

(2) PLAN will pay the LMMCRR IGT Payments to PROVIDER no later than thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the IGT MMCRRs from State DHCS.  

F. Consideration  
(1) As consideration for the LMMCRR IGT Payments, PROVIDER shall use the LMMCRR IGT Payments for the following purposes and shall treat the LMMCRR IGT Payments in the following manner:  

(a) The LMMCRR IGT Payments shall represent compensation for Medi-Cal services tendered to Medi-Cal PLAN members by PROVIDER during the State fiscal year to which the LMMCRR IGT Payments apply.  

(b) To the extent that total payments received by PROVIDER for any State fiscal year under this Amendment exceed the cost of Medi-Cal services provided to Medi-Cal beneficiaries by PROVIDER during that fiscal year, any remaining LMMCRR IGT Payment amounts shall be retained by PROVIDER to be expended for health care services. Retained LMMCRR IGT Payment amounts may be used by the PROVIDER in either the State fiscal year for which the payments are received or subsequent State fiscal years.  

(2) For purposes of subsection (1)(b) above, if the retained LMMCRR IGT Payments, if any, are not used by PROVIDER in the State fiscal year received, retention of funds by PROVIDER at the end of any State fiscal year in which it received payments based on LMMCRR IGT Payments funded pursuant to the Intergovernmental Agreement, has increased over the unspent portion of the prior State fiscal year’s balance by the amount of LMMCRR IGT Payments received, but not used. These retained PROVIDER funds may be commingled with other GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY’s funds for cash management purposes provided that such funds are appropriately tracked and only the depositing facility is authorized to expend them.  

(3) Both parties agree that none of these funds, either from the GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY or federal matching funds will be recycled back to the GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING ENTITY’s general fund, the State, or any other intermediary.

The parties shall share all interim costs of the arbitration until decision. The prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement by the other party of such party’s attorneys’ fees and costs and any arbitration fees and expenses incurred with the arbitration. The substantive law of the State of California shall be applied by the arbitrator. The parties shall have the rights of discovery as provided in Part 4 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and as provided for in Section 1283.05 of said Code. The California Code of Evidence shall apply to testimony and documents submitted to the arbitrator. Arbitration shall take place in San Diego, California. As soon as reasonably practicable, a hearing with respect to the dispute or matter to be resolved shall be conducted by the arbitrator. As soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, the arbitrator shall arrive at a final decision, which shall be reduced to writing, signed by the arbitrator and mailed to each of the parties and their legal counsel. All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties and shall constitute the only method of resolving disputes or matters. A court of appropriate jurisdiction may issue a writ to enforce the arbitrator’s decision. Judgment may be entered upon a decision in accordance with applicable law in any court having appropriate jurisdiction.

L. Severability  
If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any provision of this Agreement or application thereof to any person or circumstances to be invalid or if any provision of this Agreement contravenes any federal, state or county statute, ordinance, or regulation, the remaining provisions of this Agreement or the application thereof shall remain valid and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and to the extent the provisions of this Agreement are severable.

**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Disposal of Surplus Property – Mobile Data Terminals  

**TOPIC**  
Board authorization to dispose of outdated/broken Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs).  

**DISCUSSION**  
Metro Fire’s Communication Division has removed outdated Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs) from fire district vehicles. The service life of the MDTs has been exhausted and their value has been fully depreciated. A list of equipment removed and ready for disposal is attached in Appendix A.  

MDTs will be disposed of as electronic waste.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
This item will not result in additional discretionary general funding. There is no cost to Metro Fire for the disposal of electronic waste through a current agreement with E-Waste Recovery Systems (ERS) located in Rancho Cordova.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board adopt a Resolution to approve the disposal of outdated/broken MDTs as outlined in this report.

**TODD HARMS**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** September 24, 2020  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Ten Year Sacramento Regional Radio Communications System Licensing Agreement  

**TOPIC**  
Board authorization for the Fire Chief to renew Metro Fire’s Primary User Licensing Agreement with the Sacramento Regional Radio Communications System (SRRCS).  

**DISCUSSION**  
Metro Fire is a Primary User on the Sacramento Regional Radio Communications Systems through a Licensing Agreement for 800 MHz radio communications. Access to the radio system enables Metro Fire personnel to communicate with each other and with Fire Dispatch during emergency incidents. The current Agreement was set to expire on July 1st, 2020. On June 11th, 2020, the board approved an amendment to the radio agreement to extend the terms and conditions of the original agreement through October 1st, 2020. On September 10th, 2020, the board approved a second amendment to further extend the agreement through December 1st, 2020 while language and terms for the new agreement were finalized.  

The new Radio Licensing Agreement, attached as Appendix A, is now complete and ready for approval. Modifications and updates to the agreement have been made with feedback from SRRCS subscribing agencies, including Metro Fire and Metro Fire Legal Counsel. The new agreement will allow Metro Fire to remain a SRRCS Primary User without a disruption to radio communications through July 1st, 2030. Continued access to the Radio System is critical for crew safety and Operational Response/Readiness.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Metro Fire would continue to pay annual radio subscription fees to SRRCS based upon the formula in Section 8 of the new agreement. Fiscal Year 2021 subscription fees are $330 per radio or $212,850 total. Fees are projected to increase by 2-5% each year through 2025.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board approve the Fire Chief or designee to renew Metro Fire’s Primary User Licensing Agreement with the Sacramento Regional Radio Communications System (SRRCS) as outlined in this report.

3) The SMG shall have the authority to:

a) Elect officers and conduct meetings. The Chair of the SMG shall be elected from among the membership of the SMG for a term of two years. The term will begin on July 1. The Chair may serve additional terms if nominated and elected.

b) Advise the Chief Information Officer as to all matters relative to the construction, expansion, operation, and management of the System.

c) Approve new Participants and Secondary/Paid Secondary System Users of the System. The County of Sacramento may not allow additional Secondary System Users, nor enter into Agreements with new Participants, without the consent of the SMG. If a new user is a Participant, the SMG shall determine the appropriate fee structure for the Backbone pursuant to Article 12.

The Annual Backbone Maintenance and Operation Fee on account of a Paid Secondary System User shall be the same as if the Secondary System User were an individual Participant, except that the SMG may specify a usage level for the Paid Secondary System User and may reduce its fees by factors, which the SMG considers appropriate, which factors need not be the same for both Fees.

d) Determine how much capacity, if any, is available to a Participant who wishes to reenter the system after termination of participation pursuant to Article 16 ("terminating party"). In making such determination the SMG shall consider on the one hand that the terminating party has paid or is obligated to pay for certain capacity in the Backbone, and, on the other hand, any commitments of such capacity to other Participants or users, it being the intention of the parties to this Agreement that reentry by any such terminating party shall not be permitted if such reentry causes an unreasonable exhaustion of capacity, diminution of reasonable expectations as to growth and capabilities, or shortening of the expected life of the System beyond that which might reasonably have been expected had the terminating party not terminated participation and the vacated capacity been otherwise committed. No credits will be paid for previously paid Buy-in Fee to terminating party.

B. AGENCY shall be responsible to County of Sacramento for payment of all amounts due to County of Sacramento as a result of the purchase and use of such equipment.

Any Secondary System User shall enter into a written agreement with the Participant through whom its System usage is derived in the form provided by the County of Sacramento. Such agreement shall be subject to all terms and conditions developed by the SMG. If applicable, the agreement shall provide for the Annual Backbone Maintenance and Operation Fee to be paid on account of a Secondary System User in accordance with the determination of the SMG.

12. SYSTEM OPERATIONS  
County of Sacramento and AGENCY agree that policy or management decisions regarding the design of the Backbone and the level of operation and maintenance of the System shall be under the jurisdiction of the Chief Information Officer. The Chief Information Officer shall be responsible for administration of this Agreement and the System. The SMG shall advise the Chief Information Officer in accordance with Article 4. In the event the Chief Information Officer reports to County of Sacramento's Board of Supervisors and any recommendation therein is contrary to advice rendered by the SMG, the Chief Information Officer shall state to the Board of Supervisors the position of the SMG. The Chief Information Officer shall inform the SMG of the date and time of the Board Report to give the SMG representative an opportunity to present the position of the SMG.

The County of Sacramento may contract with any Participant or Secondary System User for additions or improvements to the System provided that the cost thereof is borne in a manner which does not affect non-consenting parties and the additions or improvements are approved by the SMG.

Agreement and shall provide that such new Participant shall have the same rights, duties, and obligations as the original Participants. Any such contract shall require the payment by the new Participant of an appropriate Buy-In Fee that recognizes the contributions of the participating agencies in the development of the radio system. The Buy-In Fee shall be in an amount recommended to the Chief Information Officer by the SMG.

Any such contract shall be first approved by the SMG as to availability of capacity. Any such contract may provide for a lump sum payment of the Buy-In fee or may allow the new Participant to pay such fee with interest over a period of time acceptable to the SMG.

AGENCY shall pay the Buy-In Fee in the amount and in the manner described in Attachment 1; or, as an alternative to the Buy-In Fee, AGENCY may substitute compensation in the form and amount as described in Attachment 1.

13. FREQUENCY ALLOCATION

The County of Sacramento and AGENCY agree that if additional frequency capacity is desired to be added to the System, AGENCY, after approval by the SMG, may apply to the FCC for a license and shall pay all applicable fees.

Several of the Participants have frequencies that have been assigned to them by the FCC. The parties agree that these frequencies will be pooled for use by all of the Participants and users during the term of this Agreement and shall be subject to the management of the County of Sacramento and the System Manager. Each Participant retains all rights to the frequencies it has pooled.

14. PUBLIC SAFETY PRIORITY

The County of Sacramento and AGENCY agree that Public Safety shall be given priority access to the communications functions of the System over other uses of the Backbone.

15. RADIO SYSTEM COVERAGE

The County of Sacramento makes no warranty or guarantee of any kind whatsoever including but not limited to indoor and outdoor radio coverage. The County of Sacramento has no role in resolution of indoor radio coverage issues/complaints in any type of buildings or structures. Indoor radio coverage and solutions either by BDAs or DAS systems are governed by the local Fire Marshall and the local Fire codes and ordinances.

Outdoor radio coverage issues/complaints will be reviewed by the County of Sacramento. The County of Sacramento will make a determination if the problem is being caused by interference/equipment malfunction or by inadequate system coverage in that area. If interference is found, the County of Sacramento will attempt to intervene with the responsible parties to eliminate the source of interference to the extent determined.

appropriate by the County of Sacramento. SRRCS will attempt to repair all Backbone malfunctions in a timely manner.

Upon receiving a complaint of outdoor coverage problems and at the request of a Delivered Participant, if outdoor radio coverage problems are due to inadequate radio Delivered Audio Quality (DAQ) of 3.4, and cannot be resolved without new construction of radio facilities, The County of Sacramento will request a meeting with the SMG to inform them of the findings and discuss a solution to fund any new construction to resolve the issues, if possible to the extent determined appropriate by the County of Sacramento.

16. TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION FOR CONVENIENCE

AGENCY may terminate its participation in use of the Backbone pursuant to this Agreement for its convenience at any time upon 120 days advance written notice. In the event that participation is terminated, AGENCY shall no longer be entitled to access the Backbone or membership on the SMG or TAC, and shall be relieved from payment of the Annual Backbone Maintenance and Operation Fee on a prorated basis for the Backbone until such time as AGENCY elects to recommence participation by providing 120 days advance written notice of its election. Any such recommencement of participation shall be effective as of July 1st next following the expiration of the 120 day notice period, and will require a new licensing agreement.

17. CANCELLATION FOR BREACH

Should either party fail to substantially perform its obligations in accordance with the Agreement provisions, the other party shall thereupon have the right to serve upon the breaching party a written notice of breach and requirement to cure. The notice shall advise the other party of the nature of the breach and provide a reasonable opportunity to cure.

Such opportunity shall provide a minimum of 30 days (seven days in the case of non-payment of money) following the date of service in which to cure the default, or, if the default is of such a nature that it cannot reasonably be cured within 30 days, to provide a plan for curing and to commence the cure and diligently prosecute it to completion.

If the breaching party fails to cure within the period specified, the other party may serve upon the breaching party written notice of cancellation specifying the reasons therefore and the date of cancellation, which shall not be sooner than 30 days following the date the notice is served.

If AGENCY cancels for breach and it is subsequently determined that County of Sacramento did not fail to substantially perform its obligations in accordance with the Agreement, then cancellation for breach by AGENCY shall be deemed and treated as termination of participation for convenience.

The parties agree that the rights granted under this Agreement for use of the System are unique, and in the event of a breach of the Agreement by either party, the remedy of cancellation may be inadequate. Therefore, in the event of a material breach by either party, the other party shall be entitled to the remedy of specific performance and any other remedy available at law or in equity.

18. REMEDIES OF COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO UPON TERMINATION OR BREACH  
1) In the event of termination by AGENCY of participation for convenience, County of Sacramento shall continue to bill AGENCY for all radios that continue to operate on the Backbone, and AGENCY shall be obligated to continue to pay such billings in the same time and manner as had there been no termination.  

2) In the event of the failure of AGENCY to make any payment required herein when due, County of Sacramento may bring an action for the recovery of such payment and interest thereon. With respect to payments not yet due at the time of breach, County of Sacramento may bring an action, or actions, from time to time as such payments become due. The exercise of any right provided in this Agreement shall not preclude the County of Sacramento from exercising any other right so provided or at law, remedies provided herein or at law being cumulative and not exclusive.  

3) If AGENCY has terminated participation in accordance with Article 16, the County of Sacramento shall be free to contract for and license the use of any capacity previously used by and any frequencies pooled by AGENCY pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, which are not taken by AGENCY upon termination of participation. Any right of AGENCY to revoke the termination and rejoin the system shall be subject to availability of capacity and frequencies at the time of re-application.  

4) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason, there shall be no refund to AGENCY of any Buy-in Fee paid by AGENCY.  

19. INDEMNIFICATION  
To the extent permitted by law, each party hereto agrees to defend, indemnify, protect, save and keep harmless the other party and its respective governing board, directors, officers, employees, authorized agents and volunteers, and its successors and assigns from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, fines, claims, actions, suits, costs and expenses and disbursements (including legal fees and expenses) of any kind and nature imposed in, asserted against, incurred or suffered by such indemnified party or its directors, officers or employees or its successors and assigns by reason of damage, loss.

We, ______________________ agree to the following terms as primary members of SRRCS:

- The Emergency button on our radios will be disabled unless the Agency has their own dispatch center or are specifically contracted by a dispatch center to operate on their talkgroup and use the Emergency button. In the future, if our Agency’s needs change regarding the emergency button, we will bring the matter to TAC for discussion and coordination. All Secondary User requests to activate the emergency buttons on their radios must be approved by the SMG.

- We will primarily and routinely utilize only our assigned talkgroups.

- The non-emergency use of another agency’s talkgroup requires a pre-arranged operational plan or contract with the talkgroup’s owner.

- The points of contact above are knowledgeable; and have the means to immediately resolve issues pertaining to using the SRRCS radio system.

- We will provide training to all of our staff utilizing the SRRCS radio system regarding proper talkgroup protocols as outlined herein, and any changes hereto.

- Our agency understands and agrees to notify, when possible, the appropriate SRRCS dispatch center prior to conducting operations in their area that may have a potential of requiring emergency support.

- Our agency understands and agrees to respond to dispatcher inquiries regarding “Accidental Key-ups”. The appropriate response to these inquiries will be similar to “our agency’s name XXX accidental”.

- In the case of life-threatening events, i.e. “shots fired”, “one at gun-point”, “physical”, etc., we understand, and agree that SRRCS dispatchers may not be aware of our location, and they will require our staff to include any additional information needed to provide them with assistance.
