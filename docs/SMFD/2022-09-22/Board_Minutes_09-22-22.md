**New Hire**  
Welcome to Jake Whealen who was hired as the Geographic Information Data Analyst effective September 19th.

**Recruitment**  
Continuous Quality Improvement Manager (CQI) open through October 4th.  
Reserve Firefighter (internal/external) open through October 14th.

**Meetings/Conferences**  
Sacramento 9/11 Memorial Stair Climb event, they were in a new location this year, and happy to be back post-pandemic. Thank you to everyone involved in planning the event, and to those who participated in the climb.  
Deputy Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs Greene and Rudnicki attended the CalChiefs Conference in Sacramento. It was great to have the event locally, and we were able to reconnect and build back some relationships throughout the state.

**OPERATIONS’ REPORT**  
Deputy Chief Mitchell shared there have been 4,106 total incidents since our last report on September 8, 2022; an average of 293 calls per day. There were 148 fire incidents, an average of 10.5 calls per day. Crews had two fire incidents as the storm front moved through last week with the wind.  
As for OES Deployments, all engines and members deployed have returned safely back home. The rain was a welcome weather change for fire behavior.  
Metro Fire responding crew received some positive feedback from an EMS call involving a 78 year old female complaining of weakness post fall. She fell face first on the court playing pickle ball, striking her forehead on the ground. Even though the patient was GCS 15, Paramedic Plotka determined the patient could have sustained significant spinal injury. She was placed in full spinal mobile restriction (SMR) and transported code 3 to MSJ. Paramedic Plotka also identified that her weakness was a new onset, and could have caused her to fall, so he advised MSJ of both a trauma and stroke alert. Per MSJ, the patient had multiple spinal fractures and significant artery damage in her spine that mimicked a stroke. MSJ praised our crew’s treatment and assessment, mentioning that any additional head movement without SMR could have left her paralyzed. Excellent work to Captain Jon Davis, Engineer Steve Tafoya, Firefighter/Paramedic Ryan Bridges, Paramedic Artur Plotka, and Paramedic Noah Novotny.

**3. SMFD – FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL 522 REPORT**  
Vice President Matt Cole shared that the E-Board met last week, and they are preparing for the 50th Anniversary for the Firefighters Burn Institute this weekend. He invited everyone to come and participate in the remembrance event that created the institute on Saturday, October 24th.  
He wishes those members who moved onto other agencies all the best. He also welcomes Jake as the GIS Specialist. This is a position that has been vacant for some time, Local 522 worked closely with Administration to make the position what it is now. VP Cole is looking forward to strengthening the organization and retaining the employees we bring to Metro Fire.
