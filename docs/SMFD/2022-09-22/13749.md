Thanks to all of those that have participated to get us this far, and we look forward to what the team brings forward next.

for release. This was an incredibly complex incident with many difficult decisions that ended up with a rescue of two people. We are very proud of their efforts. More to come on recognition of those members involved on the scene.

DC Mitchell shared some general operational information with members' recent deployments at the Mosquito Incident with the OES engines, copter, and Single Resource IMT. Also, we have a member in Yosemite as part of an IMT. A-Shift worked Monday and Tuesday in record setting high temperatures. During this time our crews performed at the high level of professionalism we expect. During these two days our crews faced three working structure fires involving residential occupancies. We also had numerous other fires that were on a smaller scale, media unit drawdown issues due to heavy call volume, and Strike Team and IMT deployment on night two. CERT was available for rehab and did deploy on a fire in B9, as did our reserve firefighters on multiple incidents. B shift has been busy for the last day and a half as well while the high temps continue, and our members continue to perform at a high level of professionalism.

Lastly, on August 21st, E28 and M21 responded for a 69 year old female who was found to be in Super Ventricular Tachycardia after assessment. Upon recognition of the critical situation, members delivered 6 shocks, with base contact, and the patient's rhythm final converted to a heart rate of 90 with a BP of 100/64, and skin signs improved. Delivering energy to a conscious and awake patient is a tough procedure to perform in the field, but understanding the importance to improve the patient condition is key. Kudos to Firefighter Adam Rosen, Firefighter Nick Wanner, Firefighter John Ten Brinke, Engineer Tim Eiser, and Captain Eric Alekman for performing professional treatment in a difficult circumstance.

3. SMFD – FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL 522 REPORT
President Fernal Jamison reported out for VP Cole, as he is traveling. While FF Jamison represents all 522 members, he is incredibly proud to be a member of Metro Fire. He wished Joanna Navarro and Chris Dargan well on their future endeavors, and congratulated Brenda Briggs on her promotion. Two members left Metro Fire to go to other agencies, and we wish them well also.

He congratulated Tim White and Scott Schneider for the success of the Del Campo Fire Technology program. In fact, he was working at a firehouse recently and two students from the program stopped by for a station tour.

Lastly, he asked for a moment of silence honoring Matthew Clapsaddle from Ventura City Fire, who passed away suddenly on August 20th.
