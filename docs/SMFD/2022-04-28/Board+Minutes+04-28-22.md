Assistant Chief Law provided the Operations report since the last Board Meeting on April 14th. We responded to 3,865 total incidents; call volume is consistent with the last reporting period at 276 calls per day. Of those incidents, 2,586 (67%) were EMS related, an average of 184 calls per day which is a small decrease from the last report. There were 123 fire incidents, an average of 8.8 calls per day which is just a slight decrease from the last report.  

Two notable incidents this week, the first was in Battalion 7 on A-shift. There was a residential structure fire in Carmichael with a victim reported to still be in the house at the time of dispatch. Crews arrived to find fire in a bedroom to the rear of the house with heavy smoke throughout.

Sadly, there was a victim found deceased in the house. The fire was quickly knocked down with no other firefighter or civilian injuries. The fire is under investigation at this time.

This afternoon there was a dryer fire at Logistics involving commercial turnouts. Quick action by the team at Logistics contained the fire to the dryer, and no one was injured. Of note, James Thomas utilized dry chem and water extinguisher to extinguish the flames, Bobby Sestito shut off the gas to the building, Garett Putnam unplugged the dryer, the door was closed to the office which kept smoke to the warehouse area, and Mark Jones ensured everyone was evacuated. A quick reaction by everyone involved helped keep damage to a minimum.

The Training Division is finishing up week nine of Academy 22-1, currently with 38 recruits. They spent the week working on Fire Control 3, or live fire training, using the flashover prop at station 52, and working on Hazmat.

The EMS Division hosted a regional run review with UC Davis Medical Center. April is Child Abuse Prevention month, and Dr. Julia Magana provided a lecture on child abuse recognition and prevention, and the Peer Review meeting that followed focused on pediatric case reviews from Metro Fire incidents. Continuing Education was provided by Metro Fire for EMTs and Paramedics, while UCD provided Continuing Education for nurses. This training was very well attended, and we look forward to future opportunities with other EMS partners.

Captain Scott Shield will return to the line on May 1st and Captain Brendan Hogan will be reassigned to the EMS Division once he’s completed his work with the fire academy.

Lastly, CERT members donated over 310 hours of their time in March, the majority of which was for training.

3. SMFD – FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL 522 REPORT  
Firefighter Michael Gildone, shop steward on C Shift gave the report. He began by thanking Directors Saylors, Wood, and Gold for taking time to visit stations, and to Director Jones for visiting logistics.

They recently had a membership meeting via Zoom with over 50 attendees, and Local 522 participated in the recent Service Delivery meeting and anticipate having a rough draft of the proposal for SAFER Positions.

Vice President Cole attended the Care Port meeting with Chief Harms and CPF President Rice at the Governor’s Office, and had a very informative meeting about the future of homeless services.
