COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO TREASURY OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE

March 31, 2022

As a resident living within the boundaries of the North Highlands Recreation and Park District, and a member of the North Highlands Recreation and Park District's Board of Directors, it would be an honor to represent special districts on the Sacramento County Treasurers Oversight Committee. I would love the opportunity to serve my community further.

I understand the duties and requirements of the position and believe that I can carry out these responsibilities in a professional manner. In closing, I believe that my professional experience in the financial industry makes me uniquely qualified to serve as a member of the Treasury Oversight Committee. I thank you for your consideration.

# CANDIDATE STATEMENT FOR DAVE O'TOOLE  
## COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO TREASURY OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE  

I would be honored to represent special districts on the Sacramento County Treasury Oversight Committee. With 21 years of experience in state and local public finance, including two Sacramento special district finance roles (Director of Internal Services for Regional San and the Sacramento Area Sewer District, and now Chief Financial Officer at the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District), I believe I am well-qualified to serve Sacramento County in this position. I previously served on the County’s Deferred Compensation Advisory Committee and represented the State Controller on several investment-related boards associated with the State Treasurer’s Office. Additionally, I meet all of the criteria specified on the Treasury Oversight Committee fact sheet.

I understand that the duties of the committee include review of the Investment Policy of the Pooled Investment Fund, quarterly review of investments, and to cause an audit of the portfolio; and I’m prepared to see that those duties are carried out successfully.

I believe my unique breadth and depth of experience will enable me to make important contributions to the work of the Treasury Oversight Committee, and I thank you for your consideration of my candidacy.

Fire Chief  

**DATE:** April 28, 2022  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Disposition of Capital Assets – Cardiac Monitor/Defibrillators  

**TOPIC**  
Staff is seeking Board approval to surplus and dispose ninety (90) cardiac monitor/defibrillators.  

**DISCUSSION**  
In 2012, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) received a FY2011 AFG grant award to purchase seventy-five (75) cardiac monitor/defibrillators. At the time of this purchase, the District also purchased an additional fifteen (15) devices for a total of ninety (90) devices to fully equip the District. This equipment has now reached the end of its serviceable life and needs to be replaced.  

On September 10, 2021, the District was awarded a FY2020 AFG grant to replace all ninety (90) cardiac monitor/defibrillators. Subsequently, the Board of Directors approved a bid award to Stryker for this purchase. Staff then submitted a request of disposition to FEMA and on November 4, 2021, the District received FEMA approval to trade-in the AFG11 devices for a credit. Including the additional fifteen (15) units, the District received a $540,000 ($6,000 each) credit to off-set costs of the replacement equipment. This credit allowed Staff to submit an amendment on the AFG20 award to use the remaining funds for the purchase of twelve (12) automatic chest compression devices.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The disposal of this equipment reduces capital outlay expenses in the amount of the total trade-in value of $540,000. This reduction was reflected in the mid-year budget. This cost savings, combined with the cost of the additional equipment that was added to the AFG20 grant, results in a reduction of $256,686 to the District’s costs.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends adoption of the attached resolution to surplus and dispose of the ninety (90) cardiac monitor/defibrillators so they can be returned to the vendor per the terms of the bid award in consideration of the trade-in credit.

**DATE:** April 28, 2022  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Purchase Approval – One (1) additional BME Type V Engine  

**TOPIC**  
Staff seeks Board approval for the purchase of one (1) additional 2022 BME Type V Engine from Boise Mobile Equipment.  

**SUMMARY**  
This purchase is available through the Houston-Galveston Area Council (H-GAC) Contract [FS12-19]. This contract includes a clause allowing local government agencies to purchase vehicles with the same rights and privileges as the State under the terms of the contract. The State utilized a competitive bid process when awarding this contract. Additionally, purchasing has reviewed the contract and determined it is consistent with Metro Fire purchasing policies and procedures.  

**DISCUSSION**  
After reviewing cost overruns and delayed delivery timelines for purchasing new Type III engines budgeted in this fiscal year, Staff recommends postponing the Type III purchase and instead adding a fourth Type V to this budget year. This vehicle will be replacing a Type V Engine that is at the end of its service life due to age and mileage.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The total cost of the purchase for this additional Type V Engine is $220,532.15. The funds for this purchase are included in the FY 2021/22 Final Budget.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff respectfully recommends the Board approve the purchase of this additional BME Type V Engine from Boise Mobile Equipment.

**DATE:** April 28, 2022  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Purchase of Boardroom Audio/Visual (A/V) Equipment  

### TOPIC
Staff seeks Board of Directors approval for the purchase of A/V equipment from vendor Signal Perfection, LTD., a wholly owned subsidiary of AVI-SPL, utilizing OMNIA Partners cooperative contract 2019.001535.

### BACKGROUND
The District's existing boardroom A/V equipment is over 9 years old. Several components of the equipment are no longer supported and therefore require replacement. Additionally, the existing equipment is not compatible with Zoom microphone, speaker, and camera functions. This purchase was approved by the board on October 28th, 2021 for an amount of $111,492.30. During the course of the project some equipment has been changed to meet the needs for recording the board meetings. The additional cost is $20,639.16 bringing the total to $132,131.46.

### DISCUSSION
OMNIA Partners is a national cooperative procurement organization offering publicly solicited contracts to government entities nationwide. All cooperative purchasing agreements offered through OMNIA Partners have been awarded via a thorough Request for Proposal (RFP) competitive solicitation by a lead public agency.

On February 1, 2010, lead agency University of California issued RFP 000817-Nov2018 Audio Visual Goods and Services. This RFP contained provisions to make the agreement accessible to agencies in states that allow intergovernmental contract usage. The University of California received proposals from 16 vendors. The proposals were evaluated by an evaluation committee, and the committee subsequently elected to issue a contract award to AVI-SPL.

The IT Division wishes to leverage OMNIA Partners contract 2019.001535 to procure the boardroom A/V equipment and installation services from Signal Perfection, LTD.

**DATE:** April 28, 2022  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** General District Election – November 8, 2022  

**TOPIC**  
Calling for a General District Election for four Board of Directors expired terms and requesting consolidation with the Statewide General Election.  

**DISCUSSION**  
A General District Election must be held on November 8, 2022 for the purpose of electing members to the Board of Directors for four-year terms. District Board Members are elected by division, with the following seats up for election on November 8, 2022:  

- **Division 1**  Director Cinthia Saylors  
- **Division 3**  Director Randy Orzalli  
- **Division 7**  Director Matt Kelly  
- **Division 9**  Director Walt White  

Divisions Three (3), Seven (7), and Nine (9) are entirely within the boundaries of Sacramento County. Division One (1) is split between Sacramento and Placer Counties.  

Pursuant to Elections Code §10403 the Board must adopt a resolution calling for the General District Election and requesting consolidation with Sacramento County and Placer County. The enclosed resolutions establish the same election process utilized in previous elections: 1) consolidation of the General District Election with the Statewide General Election in each county; 2) if a candidate desires to have a Candidate Statement of no more than 200 words included in the Voter Pamphlet, the candidate will pay the cost of publication to the Voter Registration and Elections office at the time the candidate files nomination papers; 3) in the event of a tie vote, the election for that office will be determined by lot by the Governing Board of the District; and 4) the District will reimburse Sacramento County and Placer County for actual costs incurred for providing election services.  

Candidates are required to obtain candidate papers from the Registrar of Voters in the county they reside in and are registered to vote in during the declaration of candidacy period which starts on Monday, July 18, 2022 and ends on Friday, August 12, 2022 at 5:00 p.m. Candidates will also be required to file campaign statements with the Registrar of Voters once they declare their intent to run for office.

**FISCAL IMPACT**

Consolidating the General District Election with the Statewide General Election on November 8, 2022 will eliminate the need for a special election and significantly reduce the District's election costs. The District is required to reimburse Sacramento County and Placer County for actual expenses. The District has budgeted $140,500 for the 2022 District Election.

**RECOMMENDATION**

Staff recommends the Board of Directors adopt the two (2) Resolutions calling for the November 8, 2022 General District Election and requesting consolidation of this election with the Statewide General Election, and requesting that both Sacramento County and Placer County provide election services for this election.
