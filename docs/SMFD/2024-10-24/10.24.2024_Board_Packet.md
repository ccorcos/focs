2. FIRE CHIEF'S REPORT — (Deputy Chief Mitchell)

Good evening, President Good, Directors, Colleagues, and Members of the Public.

- Chief House is attending the Integrated Benefits Institute Conference and Board Health and Productivity Forum in Chicago, where he is joining Director/CPF President Brian Rice and members of Kaiser Permanente’s Workforce Health and Cancer teams for a panel discussion about the impacts of cancer and achieving optimal outcomes in cancer care.

- This past week, several members attended the IAFF Fallen Fire Fighter Memorial ceremony in Colorado Springs, to honor 306 IAFF members who passed away or whose name was submitted between Jan. 1, 2023, and Dec. 31, 2023. Three of our very own were honored: Retired Engineer Christopher Anaya, Retired Captains Jeffrey Vitti and Robert (Bob) Bruce. It was an honor to be there.

- Yesterday morning, our members responded to a structure fire incident in B13. During the firefight, some members encountered a hostile fire environment. All members and civilians evacuated the building successfully, however two of our members received minor burns. I wanted to thank our crews for how they professionally handled the incident. I also wanted to thank our partners at the Firefighter Burn Institute (FFBI) and the UC Davis Burn Center for their extraordinary responsiveness and care for our members during this incident. I’m happy to report that both members were treated and released and will be following up with the Burn Center for further evaluation and treatment.

Upcoming Events:
- To kick off Fire Prevention Week (October 6-12), Metro Fire in collaboration with CERT, Firefighter Burn Institute, UC Davis Health, American Red Cross, Kiwanis, and the City of Rancho Cordova will be hosting a Night at the Museum on Monday, October 7 from 4 pm to 6 pm. The event will be held at the Sacramento Children’s Museum in Rancho Cordova and will offer interactive stations that include home escape planning and fire safety and prevention.

- Open House at Station 28 is scheduled for October 19 from 10-noon.

- Engineer Timothy Hall of the West Sacramento Fire Department passed away on September 23, 2024, in the line of duty during a training exercise. I would like to request a moment of silence in his honor before we adjourn this evening. Service details are pending.

OPERATIONS REPORT – (Assistant Chief Keeley)

AC Keeley spoke of the 4th squad project charter he led, in collaboration with many different divisions of Metro Fire. It was quickly determined it would be placed at Station 53 and we were able to go from concept to implementation in 22 days. Their first call was for a childbirth and they delivered a baby on scene and transported in a Sac City medic unit.

Shift Commander Spotlight: E53’s Captain Oshiro brought his crew and introduced them. He spoke of his firsthand experience with the difference that the squad has made including reducing the number of times that the city covers calls in 53’s area, the improvement of

**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** October 24, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Equipment Lease Financing Contract for the Purchase of Six Ambulances  

**TOPIC**  
Resolution for equipment lease financing for six ambulances budgeted in fiscal year 2023/24 and carried over to fiscal year 2024/25.

**SUMMARY**  
The District's Final Budget reflects apparatus and vehicle purchase financing over a five-year period. Financing for vehicles and equipment is typically secured near the end of the fiscal year after the Board has adopted a schedule for the purchase and delivery of budgeted capital equipment. However, due to the earlier-than-anticipated delivery of six ambulances, the District must now secure additional financing for those ambulances.

**DISCUSSION**  
On May 23, 2024, Board directed staff to enter into a contract for lease financing with Bank of America. The purchase of six ambulances, while budgeted in fiscal year 2023/24, was not included in the schedule of items to be financed that year because staff expected the ambulances to be delivered after fiscal year 2023/24.

Following the award for lease financing, but before the close of fiscal year 2023/24, the six ambulances were delivered. Due to the earlier-than-expected delivery, the District must now secure financing for the six ambulances.

An informal bid request was sent to banks with whom the District has previously secured lease financing. The District received proposals from Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo. Based on the information received from these proposals, staff concluded that the District should enter into an equipment lease with Banc of America Capital Corp (Lessor), based on their providing the lowest overall cost and terms acceptable to the District. Staff has begun preparing preliminary documentation with the Lessor and a draft lease purchase agreement is attached. Bank of America will provide financing for the six ambulances for a total of $1,759,267.

In 2021, the District entered into a Master Lease Purchase Agreement (Master Lease) with Lessor for the purpose of securing apparatus financing. The apparatus and vehicles above will be added to the master lease under a new lease schedule with an associated

payment schedule over the next five years. A payment schedule is included in the draft agreement.

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The interest rate for the proposed financing is 3.2752% per year. Semi-annual payments over the five-year term of the financing would be approximately $189,801.48 with the first semi-annual payment due in December 13, 2024.

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends adopting the resolution to authorize the Fire Chief and/or Chief Financial Officer to enter into an equipment lease with Banc of America Capital Corp.

**DATE:** October 24, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Approve Request for Exception to Formal Solicitation Process: Copter 1 External Hoist Rebuild  

---

**TOPIC**  
Staff seeks Board of Directors' (Board) approval for an exception to the formal solicitation process and have Copter 1's external hoist rebuild performed by the hoist manufacturer, Goodrich Corporation, a part of Collins Aerospace.  

**BACKGROUND**  
In scenarios where ground-based rescues are either impossible, or can only be performed with considerable risk or time delays, having helicopters available that are equipped with hoists is extremely valuable. As part of Metro Fire Air Operations’ multi-mission capabilities, all helicopters are outfitted with hoists for inserting rescuers and extracting victims from a rescue site. The external hoist currently on Copter 1 was manufactured and installed in March of 2015. This installation also included the installation of a hoist provisions kit located inside the helicopter. This hoist provisions kit allows the hoist to safely connect to the aircraft.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Per Goodrich Corporation, the manufacturer of the hoist, an overhaul must be completed every 3,330 cycles, 111 operating hours, or every 10 years. The first overhaul is measured from the date of manufacture. This service requirement is also supported by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aircraft maintenance standards. The 10-year requirement for this specific hoist is due March of 2025. The current turnaround time for the overhaul is approximately 9 months.  

As required by the manufacturer, all overhaul services must be performed by a Goodrich Corporation authorized repair center, making this service ineligible for a formal solicitation process. For this service, the hoist would be sent to the manufacturer’s facility located in Monroe, NC. Additionally, per the Goodrich Component Maintenance Manual:  

*"All maintenance tasks must be performed by personnel who are qualified and experienced in the specific task that is to be performed. Personnel must have completed a training course for this task at Goodrich Corporation, or a Goodrich Corporation authorized training facility, or on site."*

![Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/988x768.png?text=Page+2)

“Deviation from the operating, maintenance, repair and/or test procedures contained in this manual is not approved by Goodrich Corporation and is therefore at the operators OWN RISK. Any deviation from the procedures and instructions, other than those which have been authorized in writing by Goodrich Corporation, could result in considerable financial liability to those who authorize the deviations.”

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The Board has already approved $120,000.00 for this required service. Current quotes from the manufacturer, however, show that the cost for such service has increased beyond what Air Operations anticipated and will increase further if these repairs are delayed until 2025. If the services begin in 2024, the cost estimate is $141,773.14. This cost will increase to $150,280.00 if services begin in 2025. Additionally, where previously staff has been able to drive hoists to the manufacturer’s facility in Anaheim, CA for repairs, this service must be performed at their facility in North Carolina, adding unanticipated shipping and insurance costs to this service.

To cover the cost of the price increase for service, shipping and insurance charges, and any unforeseen repairs that may need to be completed during the overhaul, Air Operations will defer some non-critical items that were budgeted in Fiscal Year (FY) 24/25 to FY 25/26.

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends that the Board authorize this exception to the formal solicitation process and authorize hoist overhaul services to be performed by the hoist manufacturer, Goodrich Corporation.

**REQUEST FOR EXCEPTION TO FORMAL SOLICITATION PROCESS**  
**and**  
**DISCLOSURE STATEMENT**

**Purchase Description:** Copter 1's External Hoist Rebuild

**Proposed Vendor:** GP Collins Hoist & Winch / Collins Aerospace  
**Check One:** ☑ Exception to Formal Solicitation Process  
(Sole Source)  
(An exception to the formal solicitation process is when there are similar products/services available from other sources, but you have a strong justification to purchase a specific product/service from the proposed vendor. A sole source is when there is no alternative product/service available.)

**Estimated Total Cost:** $ 141,773.14

This form must accompany the vendor quote document whenever an exception to the formal solicitation process is requested. State and local laws subject the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District to competitive bidding rules. Requests for goods and/or services from a specific vendor or that are limited to a specific brand, where substitutes to the recommended vendor or brand are not in the best interest of the District, must be accompanied by a written justification explaining the circumstances that make alternatives unacceptable. The employee signing the justification must disclose in writing whether or not they have a potential or actual conflict of interest. Metro Fire employees who have a business relationship with or financial or personal interest in the recommended vendor must disclose the conflict of interest. Any employee with an actual or potential conflict of interest may not participate in the purchase decision.

The Purchasing Agent and branch Deputy Chief will determine whether the justification is appropriate. Requests for exceptions to the formal solicitation process must be supported by factual statements that will pass an audit and must be submitted to the Board of Directors for final review and approval.

**INSTRUCTIONS**  
Complete the above fields and all the following pages and sign in the appropriate places. If needed, attach all supporting documentation. Once completed, submit to Purchasing for review. This form shall be attached to your requisition after you have received approval from the Board of Directors.
