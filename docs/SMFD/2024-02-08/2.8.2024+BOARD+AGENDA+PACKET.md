**DATE:** February 8, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Zinfandel Phase 3 Buildout – Design-Build Request for Proposals  

---

**TOPIC**  
Request to authorize the issuance of Request for Proposals (RFP) 24-02 Zinfandel First Responder Training Facility Phase 3 Buildout.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) is proceeding through its two-step best value procurement process for completion of the Zinfandel Phase 3 Buildout project (Project) pursuant to Resolutions 2023-065 and 2024-002, which determined that it was in the best interest of the District to use the design-build construction delivery method for the Project and subsequently established a prequalified short-list of design-build entities to compete for the Project.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Staff has worked with its owner advisor team (Benham Design, LLC) to develop a request for proposals (RFP) that reflects the District’s goals for the Project and outlines the technical and performance requirements to support the District’s functional needs. Project scope is centered around supporting the administrative and operational needs of the Training Division, as well as the Firefighter and Metro Medic Program Academies. The estimated Project budget is $17 million, which will be further refined as the competition process continues. In accordance with Public Contract Code Section 22160 et seq., the RFP also outlines the District’s selection criteria and the relative importance of weight assigned to each selection factor as shown below:  

- Project Organization and Layout 35%  
- Quality, Flexibility, and Lifecycle Cost of Building Systems and Materials 30%  
- Building Form and Expression 20%  
- Site Design 15%  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
A stipend equal to 0.25% of the Project budget will be paid to each of the two unsuccessful proposers in consideration for preparation of the design documents required for a fully compliant proposal submission, in an effort to promote increased competition and to enhance design innovation. This stipend is already accounted for in the Project budget.  

A contract award and project authorization, with confirmed budget, will be brought for the Board’s consideration at the conclusion of the procurement process, along with final fiscal impacts.
