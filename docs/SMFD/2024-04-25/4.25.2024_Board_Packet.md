**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** April 25, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Renewal of AMR Agreement for Ambulance Services  

**TOPIC**  
Request to authorize the approval of a contract renewal with American Medical Response (AMR), to renew the term through June 30, 2025.  

**BACKGROUND**  
On July 1, 2020, The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) executed an Agreement for Ambulance Services with AMR to provide supplemental ambulances into our EMS system. The Agreement was subsequently amended several times since then to make adjustments in number of units, unit cost updates, and term extensions, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. The current term of the Agreement is set to expire on June 30, 2024.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Section 01 ("Term") of the Agreement provides that the Agreement may be renewed for no more than two (2) additional one (1) year terms after the Initial Term. The District exercised its first extension effective July 1, 2023 and desires to further exercise its option to extend for a final one (1) year term through June 30, 2025. The number of units (10 ambulances) will not change.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The proposed unit hour cost for the extended term is $182.37, which reflect a 6% escalation adjustment from the previous term to reflect market escalation. Staff anticipates that the increase in cost will be fully offset by cost recovery. The revised contract cost will be included into the proposed FY2024/25 Preliminary Budget.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board approve a contract renewal with AMR and authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to execute the renewal agreement.

**DATE:** April 25, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Request for Proposal (RFP) Award Recommendation – RFP 24-01 Deferred Compensation Consulting Services  

**TOPIC**  
Request to award a contract for professional deferred compensation consulting services to Hyas Group, a separate business unit within Morgan Stanley Institutional Investment Advisors LLC (Hyas Group).  

**BACKGROUND**  
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District's (District) Deferred Compensation Committee (Committee) utilizes professional financial consulting services to assist in ensuring participants are offered the best 457(b) plan possible. Financial consulting firms, like Hyas Group, offer fiduciary guidance on industry best practices, investment fund portfolio management, and annual policy review of internal policies of the Committee. This consultant would also aid in future RFP processes to ensure program administrators (like the current vendor, Nationwide) offer the Committee the best services and products at competitive servicing fees. Additionally, consulting services help the Committee and the Plan Administrator (Nationwide) to keep abreast of changing legislation that affect 457(b) plan governance, such as the Secure Act 2.0.  

**DISCUSSION**  
On February 16, 2024, the District issued RFP 24-01 for the purpose of finding a professional consulting firm to assist with the analysis of the District’s current deferred compensation program. The District received a total of three submittals in response to the RFP from the following firms:  
- CAPTRIST Financial Advisors  
- Hyas Group, a separate business unit within Morgan Stanley Institutional Investment Advisors LLC  
- Innovest Portfolio Solutions LLC  

The submittals were evaluated and scored by an evaluation committee comprised of members of the District's deferred compensation committee. Proposals were evaluated using the following criteria:  
- Qualifications and Experience with Providing Services of Similar Size, Scope, and Complexity  

**Serving Sacramento and Placer Counties**  

P13
<!-- Page 14 -->
![Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+2)

- Program Understanding & Methodology
- Past Performance
- Conformance to Specified RFP Format
- Fee Proposal

Hyas Group, a separate business unit within Morgan Stanley Institutional Investment Advisors LLC was the highest scoring proposer.

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The proposed cost for a five-year contract is $189,000, however, there is no fiscal impact to the District as the cost of such consulting services are paid by 457 plan participants using a calculation based on account balance.

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends that the Board authorize the deferred compensation committee Chairperson, Mitchell Thomas, to execute and administer an agreement materially similar to the draft attached with the highest ranked proposer, Hyas Group, a separate business unit within Morgan Stanley Institutional Investment Advisors LLC.
