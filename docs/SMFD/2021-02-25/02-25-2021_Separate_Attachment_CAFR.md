Fire Chief

January 22, 2021

To the Citizens and Board of Directors of the  
Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District

We are pleased to present the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (“Metro Fire”) Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. This report has been prepared by the Finance Division following the guidelines recommended by the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) and is in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for state and local government entities established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). Management assumes full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of the information contained in this report, based upon a comprehensive framework of internal control that management has established for this purpose. Because the cost of internal control should not exceed anticipated benefits, the objective is to provide reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance that the financial statements are free of any material misstatements.

Richardson & Company, LLP, Certified Public Accountants, have issued an unmodified (“clean”) opinion on Metro Fire’s financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2020. The independent auditor’s report is located at the front of the financial section of this report. Management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) immediately follows the independent auditor’s report and provides a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis of the basic financial statements. MD&A complements this letter of transmittal and should be read in conjunction with it.

## PROFILE OF SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN FIRE DISTRICT

### REPORTING ENTITY

Metro Fire is an autonomous Special District established under California Health and Safety Code Section 13800 on December 1, 2000. Metro Fire is the result of the reorganization of the American River and Sacramento County Fire Protection Districts, which brought together 16 predecessor fire districts including Arcade, Arden, Carmichael, Citrus Heights, Elverta, Fair Oaks, Florin, Mather Field, McClellan Field, Michigan Bar, Mills, North Highlands, Orangevale, Rancho Cordova, Rio Linda, and Sloughhouse. Metro Fire provides fire suppression and emergency medical services (EMS) along with various other public safety and hazard mitigation community services.

As a special district, Metro Fire is governed by a Board of Directors; each member is elected by the voters within a geographical area, or division, of Metro Fire's operational area. The Fire Chief oversees the general operations of Metro Fire in accordance with the policy direction prescribed by the Board of Directors. The Fire Chief is supported by his executive staff consisting of the Senior Staff Coordinator, Board Clerk, and three Deputy Chiefs that manage the Operations, Administration, and Support Services Branches of Metro Fire.

The Board of Directors is required to adopt a preliminary budget no later than June 30 preceding the beginning of the fiscal year on July 1 and a final budget no later than October 1 of each year. The budget is prepared by fund, division, and object level. Division heads may transfer resources within object levels. Transfers between funds or object levels, however, need special approval from the Board.

# SERVICE AREA AND SERVICES

Metro Fire serves a population of about 759,000 in a service area encompassing 359 square miles that include most of unincorporated Sacramento County, the cities of Citrus Heights and Rancho Cordova, and a portion of Placer County. Within the boundaries of Metro Fire are wildland areas, single and multi-family residential units, commercial and light industrial occupancies, hotels, regional hospitals, institutional buildings, local airfields, numerous convalescent/assisted living facilities, equestrian areas, and open space areas including hiking trails. Several major interstate highways also traverse Metro Fire’s jurisdiction, along with the American River, a major recreation resource for area residents.

Metro Fire provides all-hazard emergency services to the communities it serves. Additionally, mutual aid agreements to provide fire and/or emergency medical assistance between Metro Fire and other public safety agencies are in place and are honored by Metro Fire. Metro Fire staff is also routinely deployed to local, state, and federal emergencies around the country.

Metro Fire’s philosophy with regard to all-hazard emergencies is one of a rapid and effective deployment of appropriate resources to mitigate any emergency. Metro Fire’s response goal as approved by the Board of Directors is for a 4-minute travel time to 90% of all major emergencies (in addition to a 1 minute dispatch and 1 minute turnout time).

# OPERATIONS

The all-hazard nature of Metro Fire is exemplified by the Operations Branch, which consists of Suppression, EMS, Special Operations, Fire Prevention, and Emergency Planning.

- **Suppression** encompasses all aspects of Metro Fire’s all-hazard emergency services delivered from 41 stations with daily shift staffing of 185 personnel. Suppression resources answered over 96,230 calls for service in 2019-20.

- **The EMS Division** is responsible for the management of the emergency medical system, ensuring that emergency medical technician (EMT) and paramedic personnel are trained and equipped to serve the public at the highest levels. EMTs are certified health care professionals trained to provide basic life support in accordance with the State of California Scope of Practice for EMTs, while paramedics are licensed by the State of California to provide advanced life support (ALS). The provision of ALS services is accomplished through the strategic deployment of dual-role fire department medic (FDM) units and the single role paramedic program (SRPP). Metro Fire employs about 490 paramedics and 70 EMTs who are assigned on engines, trucks, ambulances, helicopters, aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) units, boats, and bicycles. On a daily basis, all ambulances and suppression apparatus are staffed with at least one paramedic.

As of June 30, 2020, Metro Fire deployed fourteen 24-hour and two 12-hour FDM units that are staffed by Firefighter/Paramedics and Firefighter/EMTs, along with six reserve ambulances that are available if needed to be staffed and placed in service. The additional ambulances provide surge protection during periods of high call volume. There are 36 ALS engine companies and seven ALS truck companies in service on a 24-hour basis. These apparatus respond to calls for emergency medical service with paramedics who assist with critically ill or injured patients if needed. In addition, the SRPP enhances emergency medical services within the community by providing four additional 24-hour ALS ambulances along with four peak time ambulances from an outside contractor to augment the EMS system during times of high demand. The SRPP units are staffed with non-firefighter EMT and paramedic personnel.

**CAFR 2019/20 | Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District**
<!-- Page 10 -->
- Metro Fire has several Special Operations programs that are managed under the Operations Division. These programs include Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT), Technical Rescue, Urban Search and Rescue (US&R), Swift Water Rescue, Tactical Emergency Medical Support (TEMS), Aviation, and Dozer. Metro Fire’s HAZMAT and Technical Rescue programs are certified by the California Office of Emergency Services for Type I statewide response. The US&R program is a member of California Urban Search and Rescue Task Force 7 (CA TF-7), one of 28 US&R task forces in the nation, and one of eight in California. Metro Fire’s aviation and dozer programs are the only ones of their kind regionally, and provide critical response capabilities to the region. Metro Fire’s TEMS program, also the only one of its kind regionally, provides tactical medical support to the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, Citrus Heights Police Department, and FBI SWAT Teams. Additionally, Metro Fire is a member of the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, Regional Fusion Center and Urban Area Security Initiative’s Urban Area Working Group.

- The Training Division’s mission is to improve service delivery to the community by providing realistic, ongoing, and verifiable training to Metro Fire personnel and assisting them to develop and strengthen essential job skills. Training strives to ensure all-hazard operational readiness and enhance the ability of our Metro Fire to provide quality public service.

**SUPPORT SERVICES**

The Support Services branch of Metro Fire comprises five divisions: Fleet, Facilities, Logistics, Information Technology, and Communications.

- The Fleet Maintenance Division maintains a fleet of about 330 emergency and support vehicles in a modern facility that contains 30 functional working bays. The majority of the fleet services and repairs are performed at this facility and range from routine service and maintenance to full engine in-frame and pump overhauls. A mobile repair program provides limited field repairs in an effort to reduce inconvenience and downtime to emergency apparatus.

- The Facilities Division has the responsibility of providing repairs, improvements and maintenance for all of Metro Fire’s existing fire stations, support and administrative facilities.

- Logistics is responsible for ordering, receiving and storing fire suppression equipment, emergency medical equipment and other essential supplies that are used on a daily basis.

- Information Technology is responsible for providing data, voice, and video communications to 41 fire stations, four administrative buildings, and over 330 vehicles.

- Communications oversees radio communications throughout Metro Fire’s fire stations, administrative buildings, and vehicles.

**ADMINISTRATION**

The Administration Branch comprises three divisions: Community Risk Reduction, Human Resources, and Finance.

- Under the direction of the Fire Marshal, the Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD) works with developers and citizens to make the community safe through activities such as plan review, fire inspections, code enforcement, fire investigation and exterior fire hazard mitigation.

- Providing the highest quality of service to the citizens of Metro Fire depends on having a dedicated, well-qualified group of employees. The Human Resources Division seeks to recruit and maintain a diverse workforce that reflects the community served, and strives to support Metro Fire’s mission of providing professional and compassionate protection, education, and service to the community.

- The Finance Division oversees all financial aspects of Metro Fire’s multi-million dollar operation. Processes are in place to safeguard Metro Fire’s assets, track spending, properly pay employees, collect all revenue and cost reimbursements, and produce quality reporting of all transactions. This Division also guides the very important budget process to see resources are properly allocated for optimum public service levels.

## APPARATUS

Metro Fire has in place a 20-year rolling vehicle/apparatus replacement plan which measures the proper utilization period for each piece of apparatus and identifies when replacements should occur. Metro Fire’s fleet is made up of emergency vehicles and apparatus which must be kept in a constant state of readiness.

| Apparatus Type               | No. In Service | Apparatus Type                     | No. in Service |
|------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|----------------|
| Engine                       | 58             | Aircraft Rescue Firefighting Unit  | 3              |
| Wildland Engine              | 41             | Ambulance                           | 39             |
| Ladder Truck                 | 8              | Dozer                               | 2              |
| Hazmat Truck                 | 2              | Rescue Boat                         | 3              |
| Rescue Truck                 | 2              | Helicopter                          | 2              |
| Water Tender                 | 8              | Support/Other Vehicles              | 164            |
| Contamination Unit           | 1              |                                    |                |

Metro Fire’s fire suppression apparatus have been equipped to the highest industry standards for fighting and extinguishing structural type fires, and rendering assistance to patients on medical emergency incidents. Metro Fire’s fire engines are capable of delivering water at rates up to 1,500 gallons per minute. Metro Fire's philosophy related to wildland fires revolves around strategically located, specialized "off road" wildland apparatus specifically designed to combat these difficult fires. Because of the potential for major wildland fires, Metro Fire deploys water tender units capable of supplying smaller attack vehicles during large incidents. These units are strategically placed within Metro Fire’s service area for maximum effectiveness.

Metro Fire is the only fire agency in the region with aircraft and dozer response programs. Because of this, these apparatus are critical assets to the region and enhance regional capabilities. Other support vehicles include mobile air units, fuel trucks, helicopter tender, an aircraft tow vehicle, battalion chief and staff vehicles, a Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) repair unit, trailers, flatbeds, forklifts, a pallet jack, a scissor lift, tractors, and tow vehicles.

## ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

### LOCAL ECONOMY

Metro Fire’s primary source of funding is property tax revenue and, as such, the resources available to support its operations are driven by assessed property values, with residential property accounting for more than three quarters of the net taxable value within the Metro Fire’s jurisdiction. The recovery of the housing market from the last recession has contributed to growth in assessed values, with the median price of detached single family residences within Metro Fire now above the pre-recession peak.

CAFR 2019/20 | Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District
<!-- Page 12 -->
![Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District | CAFR 2019/20](https://example.com/image-url)

Fiscal year 2019/20 total assessed property value within Metro Fire’s jurisdiction increased by $3.6 billion which was 5.38% higher than the prior year. The largest factor contributing to the increase (2.7%) was the assessed value changes resulting from transfer of ownership in the prior year which accounted for 51% of all growth experienced in Metro Fire. The increase in assessed value contributed to an increase of about $10.3 million (6.9%) in property tax revenues in fiscal year 2019/20.

In 1978 California voters approved Proposition 8 that allows county assessors to reduce the value of properties below their Proposition 13 taxable values when the real estate market declines. Such reductions are to be restored as the real estate market improves. After five years of declining and seven years of improved real estate values, the Sacramento County Assessor has restored value for approximately 89% of parcels that were lowered during the recession under Proposition 8. This means that the impact of future increases is expected to be smaller. Looking ahead, Metro Fire is projecting a 4% increase in property tax revenues for the upcoming year based on published assessed values. Metro Fire will continue to monitor trends that impact property values to develop realistic projections of property tax revenues upon which budgeting and service level decisions can be made.

Another major source of funding for Metro Fire is cost recovery associated with providing emergency medical services. Metro Fire bills approximately $147 million annually for these services, with a collection rate ranging from 25% to 30%, which is typical for these services due to lower reimbursement rates for patients covered by Medi-Cal and Medicare. As property tax revenues declined during the recession, greater emphasis was placed on cost recovery, and this revenue source has steadily increased in recent years.

Metro Fire led a statewide effort, enacted into State law in 2011, to increase the cost recovery associated with emergency medical transport services by sponsoring state legislation allowing ground emergency medical transporters (GEMT) in California to seek additional reimbursement from the federal government related to fee-for-service Medi-Cal patients. In addition, Metro Fire has participated in an Inter-Governmental Transfer (IGT) program that allows Metro Fire to receive federal matching funds for medical transports related to Medi-Cal Managed Care beneficiaries. For FY 2019/20, net revenue from IGT was $8.7 million. Due to uncertainty surrounding the status of proposed changes in the GEMT program not yet approved, no revenues were accrued for this revenue source in the current fiscal year.

Finally, under the Ground Emergency Medical Transport Quality Assurance Fee (GEMT QAF) implemented in FY 2018/19, Metro Fire was required to pay a current QAF rate of $26.07 for every ambulance transport and received a reimbursement rate add-on of $220.80 for every Medi-Cal transport, resulting in additional net revenue to Metro Fire.

# LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLANNING AND SUSTAINABILITY

The Board of Directors, command staff and employees have a track record of working together to not only address the immediate fiscal challenges that were presented by the most recent economic recession, but also to establish and maintain policies and practices to ensure Metro Fire’s long-term financial sustainability. Metro Fire’s long-term financial planning efforts have identified key issues that, if left unaddressed, would create fiscal uncertainty and likely result in a disruption in future service delivery. Two of these critical issues are the liabilities associated with retiree medical benefits and pensions, including the retirement of the remaining $33 million of pension obligation bonds originally issued in 2004.

## OPEB Trust Fund

| FY      | Contributions | Net Earnings |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| 2012    | $0            | $0           |
| 2013    | $10           | $0           |
| 2014    | $20           | $0           |
| 2015    | $30           | $0           |
| 2016    | $40           | $0           |
| 2017    | $50           | $0           |
| 2018    | $60           | $0           |
| 2019    | $0            | $0           |
| 2020    | $0            | $0           |

Accounting standards require the reporting of the net liability relating to retiree medical or other post-employment benefits (OPEB). Metro Fire’s OPEB funding plan involves a combination of contributions to a trust and cost-saving measures agreed to by Metro Fire employees that both lower the long-term cost of OPEB and provides for funding the actuarially determined contribution associated with the explicit rate subsidy for retiree medical premiums. To help finance future costs with investment earnings, Metro Fire makes contributions to California Employers' Benefit Trust (CERBT) Fund managed by California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS).

Metro Fire continues to make required pension contributions to CalPERS each year to fund both the normal cost and amortization of the unfunded liability for its miscellaneous and safety plans. While required pension contributions continue to increase each year, these contributions are expected to result in improvement to the funded ratio, which was 66.6% for Metro Fire’s safety plan as of June 30, 2020.

Finally, Metro Fire has a longstanding policy to set aside funds each year, in addition to the annual debt service required by the bond documents, so as to accumulate the necessary funds to retire early its pension bonds. Metro Fire retired one of the bond series in November 2018 for $25.5 million and is set to retire early another series by 2025. Combined with scheduled principal and interest payments on a third series of pension bonds, also issued in 2004, Metro Fire’s pension bond debt is expected to be fully retired by 2025.

Another key component of Metro Fire’s long-term financial sustainability is looking ahead and planning for the needs of future development. Based on information provided by regional planning departments about current and future development plans, Metro Fire is actively planning for the facility and service needs of those future developments. The cost of future capital needs will be funded with revenue generated from a Capital Facilities Fee that was implemented in fiscal year 2014/15 specifically to address the impacts of new development and to date has generated nearly $7.1 million in available funding. Much of this funding will be used for the construction of a new fire station that will serve the Anatolia Community in the City of Rancho Cordova. To the extent that property tax revenues expected to be generated by new development would not be sufficient to fund the expected operating cost to provide service, Metro Fire will explore alternative funding mechanisms to ensure that adequate service is provided and to avoid any degradation of service to existing communities.

Metro Fire’s approach to financial sustainability encompasses both ensuring maximum cost recovery for the fee-based services provided as well as identifying and sustainably funding long-term liabilities, with an overall goal of annually aligning revenues and expenditures such that reserves sufficient to cover future contingencies are established and maintained.

![District History](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**District History**

**1918** - Mather Air Force Base Fire Department was established in 1918, named after a WWI test pilot, Carl Mather.

**1922** - Established in June 1922, the Mills Fire Department covered approximately 55 square miles. Its original budget was in the $3,000 range.

**1923** - In May 1923, the first meeting was held to form the Rio Linda Outpost of Fire Protection which had a roster of 13 volunteers and a newly purchased soda and acid type fire engine, affectionately known as “Old Betsy”.

**1925** - The Elverta Fire District was formed in October 1925. A Graham Dodge truck was later purchased and modified to serve as its first fire truck. On its main fire station, a siren was installed with a button on the outside of the building – the first person to hear of a fire would run to the station to push it and activate the siren.

**1933** - The Orangevale Volunteer Fire Dept. was formed in 1933 with a single fire station located on Hazel Avenue and Greenback Lane. Its first fire engine was a converted 1917 REO touring car purchased for $650 by volunteers.

**1935** - While onlookers stood by helplessly as a barn burned to the ground on December 31, 1933, talk began on the need for fire protection. In 1935, the non-profit corporation called the Citrus Heights Fire District was formed. Amidst the depression and lack of funds, everything pertaining to the District was purchased with funds from the local residents rather than county taxes. This was the only source of income until 1941.

**1938** - In late December 1938, the first piece of firefighting equipment was put into service at the Sacramento Air Depot and staffed by temporary firefighters. In 1939, staff was replaced with an all-civilian fire department and the base was ultimately renamed to McClellan Air Force Base. McClellan AFB Fire Department grew to a maximum of six fire stations with personnel in excess of 30. It was augmented early on by over 125 airmen.

**1942** - In January 1942, a temporary Board of Commissioners was elected and in July of that same year, a groundbreaking ceremony was held for Station 1 of the newly formed Protection District. The construction of the station began with volunteer labor and donated materials. In the summer of 1952, Station 2 was built, Station 3 was purchased from the San Juan School District in 1957, and Station 4 was converted from a portion of a warehouse in 1973.

**1942** - In 1935, several concerned citizens conceived the idea of fire protection and received eight donated Indian back pumps. In 1938, the community appropriated $250 for the purchase of a 1932 Model “B” Ford pickup with a small water tank, pump and hose. In 1942, the Fair Oaks Fire District was legally formed. Ten volunteer firemen served the area and in 1947 the first voluntary Fire Chief was appointed.

**1942** - Local merchants and citizens, seeing the need for fire protection, purchased a hand drawn chemical cart for $950 in 1918. In the 1930s, the cart was no longer serviceable and the area was without any organized fire protection. On July 26, 1942, the Florin Fire District was formally organized and the first official act of the Board of Directors was to appoint a Fire Chief.

1942- Mr. Daniel W. Carmichael developed the Carmichael Colony in 1909 with the purchase of 2,000 acres of land north and west of the American River. Two years later, he acquired an additional 1,000 acres. Fire prevention at that time was a community endeavor. In 1927 a local businessman instituted a more formal volunteer firefighting force, purchasing a Model T fire engine which held 30 gallons of water, 100 feet of hose and other tools and equipment. In 1942, the Carmichael Fire District was officially organized and the area that was known as Donovan’s Corners became Fire Station 1.

1943- County maps refer to Arden as “Rancho del Paso.” It is a community of approximately 2,000 people which included two stores, two service stations, three large hop ranches, and one school in a nine-square mile agricultural area. On January 4, 1943, from the efforts of a close-knit group of citizens, a petition for formation of a fire district was submitted and approved by the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors and the Arden Fire District was born.

1945- The Citrus Heights Fire Protection District became a legal governmental entity in 1945 with the merger of the Citrus Heights Fire District and the Orangevale Volunteer Fire Department.

1947- The Sloughhouse Fire Protection District was formed in 1947 with volunteers and donated equipment. Without a formal fire station, the pumper and other apparatus were housed at Riella Ranch and the Sloughhouse Grocery Store until 1965 when volunteers built a station on Sloughhouse Road.

1951- The first firehouse for the North Highlands Village Fire District, which was formed in September 1951, was located next to the Flying A gasoline station on North Haven Drive. Daytime alarms were received by telephone at the Flying A gasoline station and night calls were answered at an apartment across the street. This District remained an all-volunteer district until July, 1957 when three firefighters were hired at $340 per month.

1958- The Rancho Cordova community was protected by the Mills Fire Dept. In 1958, the name of the department was changed to the Rancho Cordova Fire Protection District.

1983- The American River Fire Protection District was formed on August 1, 1983 by the consolidation of the Arden and Carmichael Fire Districts. At conception, the District had six fire stations and served 26 square miles. It responded to 3,715 alarms during the inaugural year.

1984- In 1983 the Board of Directors voted to merge the Citrus Heights and North Highlands Fire Districts. It was approved and on February 4, 1984, the North Highlands Village Fire District became part of the Citrus Heights Fire Protection District.

1989- The Sacramento County Fire Protection District was organized with the consolidation of the Rancho Cordova Fire Protection District, Fair Oaks Fire District and the Citrus Heights Fire Protection District in July of 1989. Emergency services were provided to the community through 20 fire stations.

2000- On December 1, 2000, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District was formed from the consolidation of 16 historic fire districts. Now commonly known as Metro Fire, it is the seventh largest local fire district in the State of California and the largest in Sacramento County. For more detail on the merge, please see the Letter of Transmittal in this report.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

To the Board of Directors  
Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District  
Sacramento, California  

## Report on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund and the aggregate remaining fund information of Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (Metro Fire) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2020, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise Metro Fire’s financial statements as listed in the table of contents.

## Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

## Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and the State Controller’s Minimum Audit Requirements for California Special Districts. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.

**Opinions**

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, each major fund and the aggregate remaining fund information of Metro Fire as of June 30, 2020 and the respective changes in financial position and the budgetary comparison for the General Fund for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as well as accounting systems prescribed by the State Controller’s Office and state regulations governing special districts.

**Other Matters**

**Required Supplementary Information**

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management’s discussion and analysis, Schedule of Changes in Net Pension Liability – CalPERS Safety Plan, Schedule of Plan’s Proportionate Share of Net Pension Liability – CalPERS Miscellaneous Plans and SCERS Plan, Schedule of Employer Contributions to the Pension Plan, Schedule of Changes in Net OPEB Liability and Schedule of Employer Contributions to the OPEB Plan be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

**Other Information**

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise Metro Fire’s basic financial statements. The introductory section, other supplementary information and statistical section are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements.

The budgetary comparison schedule for the Capital Facilities, Impact Fee and Grant Funds and combining and individual nonmajor governmental funds financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the other supplementary information is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

The introductory and statistical sections have not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on them.

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated January 22, 2021 on our consideration of Metro Fire’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations and contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Metro Fire’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

# MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Our discussion and analysis of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (Metro Fire) provides the reader with a narrative overview of Metro Fire’s financial position and performance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. We encourage readers to consider the information presented here in conjunction with additional information that we have furnished in our letter of transmittal, which can be found on pages i-vii of this report.

## FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

### Government-wide:
- During the year, Metro Fire recognized $237,319,911 in taxes and other revenues from governmental activities, which was $905,012 less than related expenses. As a result, overall financial position has deteriorated by approximately $1 million compared to the prior year.
- Metro Fire’s net position as of the end of the year is a net deficit of $570,877,025 mainly due to unfunded pension and other post-employment benefits obligations. Offsetting these amounts are net investments in capital assets of $77,152,984.
- Overall outstanding long-term liabilities increased by $26 million during the year. This was mainly the result of increases in the pension liability.

### Fund level:
- Metro Fire’s governmental funds reported combined fund balances of $66,890,567, an increase of $6,431,514 in comparison with the prior year largely due to higher property tax revenues combined with lower than expected overtime and deferral of certain service expenditures into the next fiscal year.
- Unassigned fund balance for the general fund was $43.7 million or 20% of total general fund expenditures. This amount is available for spending at Metro Fire’s discretion in the furtherance of its mission.

## ANNUAL REPORT OVERVIEW

The discussion and analysis provided herein is intended to serve as an introduction to Metro Fire’s basic financial statements. The basic financial statements consist of three components:
- Government-wide financial statements
- Fund financial statements including budgetary comparison statements
- Notes to financial statements.

## GOVERNMENT-WIDE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The government-wide financial statements comprise the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities which provide broad financial information and present a longer-term view of Metro Fire’s finances. These statements are reported using the accrual basis of accounting which is similar to the accounting used by most private sector companies. The government-wide financial statements can be found on pages 20-21 of this report.

The Statement of Net Position presents information on all of Metro Fire’s assets and deferred outflows, and liabilities and deferred inflows, with the difference between them reported as net position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial health of Metro Fire is improving or deteriorating.

# MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The Statement of Activities presents information showing how Metro Fire’s net position changed during the most recent fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses are reported for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected taxes and earned but unused vacation leave).

## GOVERNMENTAL FUND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A fund is a grouping of related accounts used to maintain control over resources segregated for specific activities or objectives. Metro Fire uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements.

Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. However, unlike the government-wide financial statements, governmental fund financial statements focus on near-term inflows and outflows of spendable resources, as well as on balances of spendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in assessing a government’s near-term financing requirements. Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing decisions.

Governmental fund financial statements comprise the Balance Sheet and the Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances both of which provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental activities. The modified accrual basis of accounting is used to measure cash and all other financial assets that can readily be converted into cash. It helps determine the availability of financial resources that can be spent in the near future to finance programs.

**General Revenues**  
Metro Fire monitors property valuation closely with a property tax consultant to identify trends and develop forecasts of this critical revenue source. In fiscal year 2008/09, assessed property values in Metro Fire’s service area reached a high point of $57.8 billion. The real estate market in the region since then was hit hard by the recession, and assessed property values within Metro Fire’s boundaries steadily declined to $49.5 billion in 2012/13; a reduction of $8.3 billion, or 14%. Annual property tax revenue during this time declined from its peak of $129 million to $105 million in 2012/13; a drop of $24 million, or 19%. Since then, Metro Fire experienced 7 straight years of growth in assessed property values, increasing by $3.6 billion in the most recent fiscal year to a total of $70.8 billion. Property tax revenue in 2019/20 grew by $10.3 million, or 6.9%.

While management expects to see modest growth in future property taxes, it continues to find ways to lessen its fiscal dependency on property tax revenues. The chart below presents Metro Fire’s revenue history for the past 10 fiscal years.

### Revenue History

As reflected in the chart, non-property tax related revenue grew from $33 million in 2009/10 to $78 million in 2019/20; an increase of $45 million. The introduction of the Single-Role Paramedic Program (SRPP), supplemental medical transport cost reimbursements (GEMT and IGT) as discussed below, and other changes relative to delivery of emergency medical transport services have resulted in a substantial increase in cost recovery for emergency medical services. As a result of the efforts mentioned above, charges for services amounting to $67 million now comprise 28% of total revenues compared to just 12% in 2009/10.

### Program Revenues

Charges for services in the current year amounted to $67 million which decreased by $1.1 million compared to the prior year. Much of the decrease can be attributed to two factors. Firstly, there was a decrease in deployment for wild fires in the current fiscal year compared to last year resulting in a decrease in deployment reimbursements of $4.7 million. And secondly, due to the initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical transports decreased resulting in lower revenues by $1.2 million.

Starting in 2013/14, Metro Fire participated in the Ground Emergency Medical Transport (GEMT) Program that allows qualified public entities to collect federal matching funds for services provided to Medi-Cal Fee for Service beneficiaries. This program accounts for approximately 5% of the medical patients seen by Metro Fire. The GEMT cost reimbursement program is pending federal approval of changes applied for by the State of California. Due to the uncertainty in this program, revenues were not accrued in the current fiscal year.

For the past 6 fiscal years, Metro Fire was able to receive additional federal funds for the rest of its Medi-Cal patients consisting of managed care beneficiaries through a mechanism called Rate Range Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT). The IGT programs provided gross reimbursement of about $14.9 million before related fees, or $8.7 million net of related fees.

# MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Metro Fire continues to participate in the GEMT Quality Assurance Fee (GEMT QAF) program implemented by the State in FY 2018/19. Under this program, Metro Fire received an additional $220.80 per Medi-Cal transport and paid a QAF rate of $26.07 for every ambulance transport.

During the year, Metro Fire recognized $5.2 million in capital and operating grants and contributions largely due to new grants the largest of which is from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Assistance to Firefighters (AFG) regional grant of $3.45 million with a $583 thousand local agency matching requirement billed to regional fire agency partners for the purchase of Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) used in firefighting operations. Metro Fire also received $804 thousand funding under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, to replace lost medical revenues. In contrast, $5.4 million was recognized in the prior year due mainly to the donation of two helicopters from the US State Department.

## EXPENSES

As a public safety provider, the majority of Metro Fire’s operating expense relates to labor costs, which comprise about 80% of total expenses. A summary of Metro Fire’s expenses is presented below:

### Table 2
**Condensed Schedule of Expenses**  
*(in thousands)*

|                     | 2020      | 2019      | $ Change | % Change |

| Public protection    |           |           |          |          |
| Salaries and benefits | $190,010  | $171,189  | $18,821  | 11%      |
| Services and supplies | 33,719    | 31,118    | 2,601    | 8%       |
| Other                | 6,211     | 3,827     | 2,384    | 62%      |
| **Subtotal**        | **229,940** | **206,134** | **23,806** | **12%**  |
| Interest            | 2,478     | 3,458     | (980)    | (28%)    |
| Loss on disposal of capital assets | 45 | -         | 45       | -        |
| Depreciation        | 5,762     | 5,434     | 328      | 6%       |
| **TOTAL EXPENSES** | **$238,225** | **$215,026** | **$23,199** | **11%**  |

Public protection expenses for the year were $230 million, or 12% higher than the prior year. The majority of the expenses relates to salaries and benefits which increased by about 11%, primarily due to the increase in net pension liability and the related deferred outflows and inflows. The pension expense used for financial reporting is usually larger than the required employer contributions and will likely be more volatile from year-to-year as both favorable and unfavorable results flow through the statements on an accelerated basis.

The other significant program expense is services and supplies which amounted to $33.7 million, an increase of $2.6 million or 8% from the prior year. The increase is due to several factors including higher insurance costs, vehicle maintenance, dispatch fees, and the purchase of new fire equipment supplies and turnouts.

# MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

As mentioned in the previous page, the FEMA regional grant for SCBAs also included amounts intended for other local fire agencies. SCBAs costing $2.3 million, which were partly paid from grant funds and partly from local match, were purchased by Metro Fire and delivered to regional fire agency partners. This expense accounts for the $2.3 million increase in the “Other” category of expenses.

As Metro Fire’s available resources at its disposal are dictated mainly by property values which are subject to cyclical changes, management will continue to work collaboratively with the Board and Labor to seek out new sources of revenue and cost-saving opportunities.

## ANALYSIS OF NET POSITION

This analysis focuses on the net position and changes in net position of Metro Fire’s Governmental Activities, as presented below in the government-wide Statement of Net Position and Statement of Activities.

![MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=MANAGEMENT%E2%80%99S+DISCUSSION+AND+ANALYSIS)

Metro Fire’s net position decreased by $905 thousand during the year. Due to the effects of recognizing the full amount of unfunded liabilities in pension and Other Post-Employment Liability (OPEB), changes in Metro Fire’s net position will be highly dependent on changes in those liabilities.

### Net Investment in Capital Assets
Metro Fire uses capital assets to deliver firefighting and medical services to the citizens and as such these are not available for future spending. Metro Fire’s investment in capital assets of $77 million is shown net of related debt of $23 million. This represents an increase of $2 million from the prior year mainly due to the purchase of new capital assets and paying down debt. Although reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources used to repay this debt must be provided from other sources since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to repay this debt.

### Restricted Net Position
Restricted net position of $8.7 million represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on their use. These resources can be used mainly for capital acquisition, debt payments, and for grant approved expenditures.

### Unrestricted Net Position
Unrestricted net position, which can be used to finance day-to-day operations without constraints, is a negative $657 million, a decrease of $4 million from the prior year. This decrease is mainly caused by the unfavorable effect of the increase in net pension liability partially offset by the decrease in OPEB liability. Metro Fire’s net position for the past ten years is shown on page 76.

### ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
As shown in Table 3, Metro Fire’s total assets increased by about $7.7 million due mainly to an increase in restricted cash set aside from the Impact Fee Fund and positive operating cash flows from the General Fund.

Total liabilities also increased by $24.4 million mainly due to increases in long-term liabilities. These liabilities include capital leases, bonds, compensated absences, workers’ compensation liability, net OPEB liability, and net pension liability.

<!-- Page 43 -->
![Management's Discussion and Analysis](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Management's+Discussion+and+Analysis)

Below is a breakdown of Metro Fire’s liabilities:

- **OPEB Liability:** $159M
- **Net Pension Liability:** $466M
- **Workers' Compensation:** $26M
- **Bonds:** $42M
- **Compensated Absences:** $1.4M
- **Capital Leases:** $1.5M
- **CalPERS Miscellaneous:** $161M
- **CalPERS Safety:** $403M
- **SCERS Retirement:** $47M

Unfunded liabilities from pension and OPEB account for 87% of Metro Fire’s total liabilities. Net pension liability increased by $35 million, net of current year employer and employee contributions and investment earnings, mainly due to additions from current service costs and interest on the outstanding liability plus unfavorable plan experience. This is partially offset by a decrease in the OPEB liability of $9 million arising from favorable experience and changes in assumptions.

Metro Fire is self-insured for workers’ compensation claims and the liability is actuarially determined. Claim liabilities and related expenditures are reported when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the loss amount can be reasonably estimated. The liability for workers’ compensation claims at year end was $26 million which increased by $1.7 million from the prior year. Below is a chart depicting Metro Fire’s claim losses by policy year for the last ten years, which also reflects how much remains outstanding for each year (i.e. reserves and Incurred but not reported-IBNR).

### Summary of Workers' Compensation Claims

| Policy Year | Net Paid (Millions) | Reserves (Millions) | IBNR (Millions) |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 2011        | $1                    | $2                   | $3                |

# MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Over the last several years, Metro Fire has restored services eliminated during the recession, resulting in additional time worked. This additional exposure would be expected to increase ultimate losses from worker’s compensation claims. However, due to Metro Fire’s efforts to emphasize safety on the job, the number of claims and severity of claims being reported were kept in check. Metro Fire experienced an increase in claim losses, resulting in part from COVID-19 exposures and illnesses.

Capital leases and bonds are discussed in Note 5.

## DEFERRED OUTFLOWS & INFLOWS OF RESOURCES

Deferred outflows are not available to pay liabilities in the way assets are available. In the same vein, deferred inflows of resources are not technically liabilities. When all the recognition criteria are met, the deferred outflow of resources will become an expense while the deferred inflow of resources will become revenues. These deferrals relate to the implementation of the accounting standards on pension liability reporting. The majority of the deferred outflows of resources reported resulted from current year pension and OPEB contributions while deferred inflows arose from changes in assumptions, actual investment gains in excess of the amount assumed, and other deferred items.

## GOVERNMENTAL FUND BALANCE AND BUDGETARY HIGHLIGHTS

This analysis focuses on fund balances and changes in fund balance presented in the Governmental Funds Balance Sheet and Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances reported using the modified accrual basis.

### GENERAL FUND

The General Fund is the operating fund of Metro Fire and is generally used to account for all financial resources relative to operations. The major source of revenue for the General Fund is property taxes (159 million), which accounts for 69% of Metro Fire’s operating revenues. Charges for ambulance transport services, deployments, and other services ($64 million) account for 28% of operating revenues.

General Fund revenues remained largely unchanged and only increased by $3 million or 1.3% when compared to the prior year. Property taxes increased by $10 million as a result of higher assessed property values which was partially offset by a reduction in charges for services of $6 million due primarily to lower reimbursements from deployments to other agencies.

General Fund expenditures increased by $8 million or 4% compared to the prior year. About $6 million of this increase is from labor as a result of a 4.3% wage increase, increases in required pension and other postemployment benefits (OPEB) contributions, and increases in medical premiums. Services and supplies increased by $2 million as a result of higher insurance costs, vehicle maintenance, dispatch fees, and the purchase of new fire equipment supplies and turnouts.

### GENERAL FUND BUDGETARY HIGHLIGHTS

Budgetary fund variances are monitored by the Board of Directors during regular Finance and Audit Committee meetings. As necessary, the Board revises the budget when new information is available. For budgeting purposes, Metro Fire accounts for the activities of its leased properties and IGT separately from its other general fund activities. For purposes of this report, those activities have been combined.

# MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The combined General Fund final adopted budget for fiscal year 2019/20 forecasted for a $1.2 million deficit. Actual results show a $5 million surplus. Comparisons of Metro Fire’s original and final budget as well as the actual governmental fund results for the General Fund and other funds appears on pages 26, 69, 73, and 74 of this report. Below is a summary of final budget and actual results for the General Fund as of the fiscal year end:

## Table 5
### Condensed Schedule of Revenues and Expenditures
### Budget to Actual - General Fund
#### (in thousands)

|                     | 2019-20 Final Budget | 2019-20 Actual | Variance      |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Total Revenues      | $231,458             | $230,287       | $(1,171)      |
| Total Expenditures   | $(225,736)          | $(218,161)     | $7,575        |
| Financing Sources (Uses) | $(6,940)        | $(6,940)       | -             |
| Net Change in Fund Balance | $(1,218)      | $5,186         | $6,404        |

Actual revenues were lower than budgeted revenues by $1 million mainly due to lower reimbursements for medical transports as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual expenditures were $7.6 million lower than budget due to the following:

- $2.3 million was set aside in anticipation of pension bond retirements which was essentially treated as an expenditure to transfer from unassigned fund balance to committed fund balance; in the fund financial statements, it is treated as a transfer from cash to investments rather than as an expenditure.
- The rest of the budget savings resulted from lower than expected overtime and deferral of certain service expenditures into the next fiscal year.

The final budget and original budget revenues and appropriations remained relatively the same.

## OTHER GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS

The Capital Facilities Fund is used to account for capital lease proceeds and general operating transfers to fund capital purchases. The final budget projected a deficit of $2 million while actual results ended with a more favorable $558 thousand surplus due mainly to the deferral of certain capital outlays into the next fiscal year.

The Impact Fee Fund accounts for the proceeds from development impact fees. The final budget projected a deficit of $2.3 million while actual results ended with a more favorable $1.2 million surplus which was mainly due to the deferral into next year of most of the costs of a planned new fire station. The fund balance is restricted for use on capital outlay relating to construction of future fire stations and acquisition of apparatus to serve new developments.

The Grant Fund is used to account for various types of grants awarded to Metro Fire. As previously discussed, Metro Fire received a $4.4 million regional grant for the purchase of new SCBAs which accounted for much of the increase in grant activity from prior year. The remaining fund balances can only be used for purposes authorized in the grant awards.

Funding for infrastructure has historically come from development fees and property tax revenue; both of which were negatively impacted by the recession. As a result, in order to fund infrastructure and fire service apparatus needs, a combination of lease revenue bond issues and capital lease financing was employed.

# MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

At the end of the current fiscal year, Metro Fire had over $100 million invested in a broad range of capital assets, including buildings, fire stations, and various pieces of equipment. During the current year, Metro Fire invested about $7.6 million in capital assets in accordance with its capital replacement plan. This increase was offset mainly by depreciation of $5.8 million. Additional detail regarding capital assets can be found in Note 3 of the financial statements.

## DEBT ADMINISTRATION

The following table summarizes the long-term debt for the last two years:

### Table 7
**Outstanding Debt at Year-End**  
*(in thousands)*

|                     | 2020    | 2019    | $ Change | % Change |
|---------------------|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| Pension bonds payable| $32,840 | $35,090 | $(2,250) | (6%)     |
| Lease revenue bonds payable | $8,686  | $8,929  | $(243)   | (3%)     |
| Capital Leases      | $15,395 | $16,234 | $(839)   | (5%)     |
| **Totals**          | **$56,921** | **$60,253** | **$(3,332)** | **(6%)** |

Metro Fire's budget includes bi-annual principal and interest payments. In addition, Metro Fire has a policy that requires setting aside of an annual deposit payment for the eventual extinguishment of the Pension Bond Series B in 2025. In conjunction with the pension bond debt and lease revenue bonds, S&P Global Ratings rated Metro Fire’s credit with a rating of AA and AA-, respectively. This rating means that Metro Fire’s capacity to meet its financial commitments on its debt is very strong. Additional detail regarding long-term debt is located in Note 5 of the financial statements.

## ECONOMIC FACTORS AND NEXT YEAR’S BUDGET

The economic recession that began in 2008 presented Metro Fire with significant challenges. The Board of Directors, management, and employees responded by working together to address both the immediate and long-term fiscal challenges confronting Metro Fire, with the goal of preserving service levels. While fiscal challenges remain, steps have been taken that place Metro Fire on a more predictable and fiscally sustainable path moving forward. As discussed previously, Metro Fire utilizes long-term financial planning tools to help identify fiscal challenges and guide current decision making. These financial planning efforts reflect a shared commitment on the part of the Board, management, and employees to provide an exceptionally high level of service within a framework that promotes long-term financial sustainability.

During the recession, management and union representatives engaged in a highly collaborative effort to address a structural budget imbalance in the General Fund brought on by the negative impacts of the lingering economic recession; namely, reduced property tax revenue, rising health care costs and rising pension costs caused by significant pension fund investment losses. Labor and management were able to reach agreement on a number of concessions that both achieved operational cost savings and allowed Metro Fire to begin pre-funding retiree medical benefits. Pre-funding retiree medical benefits was identified as a key measure in preserving and reducing the long-term cost of this significant retirement benefit.

# MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The chart to the right provides a history of the assessed value of properties within Metro Fire’s jurisdiction in the last 10 fiscal years. Property values have now increased for 7 consecutive years and are projected to grow by 5% next fiscal year. The assessed value increase between 2019/20 and 2020/21 is estimated at $3.5 billion, with the largest share of that amount (approximately $1.8 billion) resulting from increases in assessed value due to transfers of ownership in the prior year.

While the District was forced to reduce service as a result of property tax revenue reductions during the recession, improved revenues in recent years have gradually permitted the restoration of service.

The final budget for FY 2020/21 projects a General Fund overall planned surplus (including leased property and IGT activities) of $2.2 million in order to increase the General Fund reserve balance for potential future need in light of the adverse effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. There is tremendous uncertainty regarding future levels of property tax revenues. While residential property values within the District have actually improved since the pandemic began, sales volume remains low. Longer term, the impact on property values of high unemployment and reduced personal income is unknown.

The final budget provides for increasing ongoing spending requirements resulting from labor cost escalation, including salary increases and an increase in required pension contributions, and additional debt service payments resulting from substantial capital replacement and other equipment purchases financed in recent years.

The final budget for 2020/21 keeps Metro Fire on track with respect to addressing the long-term financial obligations associated with the commitment to current employees and retirees to pay medical benefits after retirement by funding the OPEB funding policy contribution as well as maintaining the funding plan for the outstanding pension obligation bonds. Establishing and maintaining adequate reserves remains an important goal for Metro Fire.

Management regularly reviews financial projections and makes adjustments based on recent trends in real property value, capital needs and financing costs, and changes adopted by the retirement and healthcare systems under which Metro Fire provides benefits to its employees. District spending choices are prioritized and reflect public values, with service levels balanced against adequate funding to maintain facilities, vehicles and equipment and providing a sustainable level of fair and reasonable employee compensation. These efforts are undertaken with a commitment to sustaining the high level of service Metro Fire currently provides to the community and maintaining its long-term fiscal stability.

# Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District
## Reconciliation of the Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances of Governmental Funds to the Statement of Activities
### For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020

**Net Change in Fund Balance - Total Governmental Funds**  
$ 6,431,514  

**Capital Asset Transactions**  
Governmental funds report capital outlay as expenditures. However, in the Government-wide Statement of Activities the cost of those assets when completed is allocated over their estimated useful lives as depreciation expense.  
- Cost of assets capitalized: $ 7,637,842  
- Depreciation expense: $(5,762,229)  

Governmental funds report proceeds from disposal of capital assets as revenues. However, in the government-wide statement of activities only the gain or (loss) on the sale of capital assets is reported. This is the difference between the gain or (loss) and proceeds.  
- Long-term Debt: $(127,546)  
- Debt proceeds provide current financial resources to governmental funds, but issuing debt increases long-term liabilities and has no effect on net position: $(4,510,000)  
- Repayment of principal is an expenditure in the governmental funds, but the repayment reduces long-term liabilities and has no effect on net position: $ 7,838,613  
- Other bond related items that do not require the use of current financial resources but affects net position:  
  - Amortization of bond premiums and discounts: $ 2,921  

**Measurement Focus**  
The amounts below included in the Statement of Activities do not provide or (require) the use of current financial resources and therefore are not reported as revenue or expenditures in governmental funds (net change):  
- Change in accrued interest payable: $ 209,575  
- Change in compensated absences: $(1,839,815)  
- Change in workers' compensation: $(1,572,733)  
- Change in net pension liability: $(35,381,056)  
- Change in net deferrals relating to pension: $ 11,575,581  
- Change in OPEB liability: $ 9,151,915  
- Change in net deferrals relating to OPEB: $ 4,316,709  

Some receivables are unavailable in the Governmental Funds because the amounts do not represent current financial resources that are recognized under the accrual basis in the Statement of Activities.  
- Change in Net Position of Governmental Activities: $(905,012)  

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.

**NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The basic financial statements of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (“Metro Fire”) have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as applied to government units. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the standard-setting body for establishing governmental accounting and financial reporting principles. Metro Fire’s significant accounting policies are described below.

**A. SCOPE OF FINANCIAL REPORTING ENTITY**

Metro Fire was established under Health & Safety Code Section 13800 on December 1, 2000, as a result of the merger between the American River and Sacramento County Fire Protection Districts. It is governed by a nine member Board of Directors elected by geographic division. Metro Fire’s boundaries cover approximately 359 square miles that includes portions of Sacramento and Placer counties with an estimated population of 759,000 residents. Metro Fire provides fire protection services including fire suppression, fire prevention, inspection, plan checking, and public education programs. It also provides emergency medical services, including advanced life support; hazardous materials response; and rescue services. It employs close to 700 personnel and operates 41 fire stations, an administration building, a supply warehouse, a training facility, a fleet shop, and several other support buildings.

Metro Fire has reviewed criteria to determine whether other entities with activities that benefit Metro Fire should be included within its financial reporting entity. The criteria used is financial accountability which is determined by a combination of factors such as fiscal dependence, board appointment, the existence of a financial benefit or burden relationship, or the ability of Metro Fire to impose its will on the other entity. Metro Fire has determined that no outside entity meets the reporting criteria, and therefore, no agency has been included as a component unit in Metro Fire's financial statements. In addition, Metro Fire is not aware of any entity that would exercise such oversight responsibility that would result in Metro Fire being considered a component unit of that entity.

**Joint Powers Authorities or Jointly Governed Organizations**

Metro Fire participates in three joint ventures under joint powers agreement (JPAs):

- The California Fire and Rescue training Authority (CFRTA) provides fire, rescue, EMS, and Haz-Mat training,
- Sacramento Regional Fire/EMS Communications Center (SRFECC) serves as Metro Fire’s fire and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) dispatch center,
- Special District Risk management Authority (SDRMA) provides insurance coverage for general and auto liability, errors and omissions, property, boiler and machinery and employee dishonesty.

The JPAs are governed by boards consisting of representatives from member districts. Each board controls the operations of their JPAs, including selection of management and approval of operating budgets independent of any influence by the member districts beyond their representation on the Board. The relationships between Metro Fire and the JPAs are such that the JPAs are not component units of Metro Fire for financial reporting purposes. In the event of the dissolution of CFRTA or SRFECC, Metro Fire will receive a pro-rata share of the assets and liabilities of these organizations. In the event of the dissolution of SDRMA, Metro Fire is only liable for unpaid insurance premiums and is neither entitled to nor obligated for any assets or liabilities of SDRMA. Annual audited financial information can be obtained by contacting each JPA’s management.

During the year, Metro Fire contributed the following amounts: $4,220,003 to SRFECC, $1,212,886 to SDRMA, and $45,000 to CFRTA. Metro Fire also paid CFRTA $185,317 for training costs. Metro Fire currently has a ground lease agreement with CFRTA whereby it leased 15.6 acres of land to CFRTA for over 50 years at a minimum rental fee of $30,000 per year. In addition, Metro Fire leased office space to CFRTA at an annual base rate of $34,884.

**B. BASIS OF ACCOUNTING AND PRESENTATION**

The accounting and financial reporting treatment is determined by the applicable measurement focus and basis of accounting. Measurement focus indicates the type of resources being measured such as current financial resources or economic resources. The basis of accounting indicates the timing of transactions or events for recognition in the financial statements.

**Government-Wide Financial Statements**

While separate government-wide and fund financial statements are presented, they are interrelated. The government-wide financial statements (i.e., the statement of net position and the statement of activities) report information on all of the activities of Metro Fire and incorporate data from the governmental funds. Metro Fire has only governmental activities, which are supported primarily by taxes, intergovernmental revenues, and charges for services.

The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function or segment is offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific function or segment. Program revenues include 1) charges to customers who purchase, use or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function or segment and 2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular function or segment. Taxes and other items not properly included among program revenues are reported instead as general revenues.

The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year they are levied. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue when all eligibility requirements have been met.

**Fund Financial Statements**

Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, Metro Fire considers all revenues, except property taxes, to be available if they are collected within 90 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Property taxes are recognized if received within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Property taxes, charges for services, intergovernmental revenues, rental income, and investment earnings associated with the current fiscal period are all considered to be susceptible to accrual and so have been recognized as revenues of the current fiscal period. Expenditure-driven grants are recognized as revenue when the qualifying expenditures have been incurred and all other eligibility requirements have been met, and the amount is received during the period or within the availability period for this revenue source. All other revenue items are considered to be measurable and available only when cash is received by Metro Fire.

Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and workers compensation claims, are recorded only when payment is due. General capital asset acquisitions are reported as expenditures in governmental funds. Issuance of long-term debt and acquisitions under capital leases are reported as other financing sources.

![NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)](https://example.com/image.png)

The accounts of Metro Fire are organized on the basis of funds. A fund is a separate accounting unit with a self-balancing set of accounts. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a separate set of self-balancing accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund equity, revenues, and expenditures. Metro Fire resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the purpose for which they are to be spent. The emphasis of fund financial statements is on major governmental funds reported as separate columns in the fund financial statements. All remaining governmental funds are aggregated and reported as nonmajor funds.

Metro Fire reports the following major governmental funds:

- **The General Fund** is the general operating fund of Metro Fire. It is used to account for all financial resources except those required or designated by the Board of Directors to be accounted for in another fund.

- **The Capital Facilities Fund** is a capital projects fund used to account for the acquisition and construction of Metro Fire’s major capital facilities. It is primarily funded by capital lease financing and general fund operating transfers.

Metro Fire reports the following nonmajor governmental funds:

- **The Grant Fund** is a special revenue fund used to account for the proceeds of federal and state grants that are legally restricted to expenditures for specific purposes.

- **The Impact Fee Fund** is a capital projects fund used to account for all resources received from development impact fees. It is used for the construction or acquisition of future fire stations and acquisition of apparatus to serve new developments.

During the course of operations, Metro Fire has activity between funds for various purposes. Any residual balances outstanding at year end are reported as due from/to other funds and advances to/from other funds. While these balances are reported in fund financial statements, they are eliminated in the government-wide financial statements. Further, certain activity occurs during the year involving transfers of resources between funds. In fund financial statements these amounts are reported at gross amounts as transfers in/out. While reported in fund financial statements, they are eliminated in the government-wide financial statements.

### C. BUDGETARY PRINCIPLES

Annual budgets are adopted on a basis consistent with generally accepted accounting principles for the General Fund, Grant Fund, Capital Facilities Fund, and Impact Fee Fund. As required by the laws of the State of California, a preliminary and then a final budget are adopted on or before October 1 of each fiscal year. Significant operating changes are addressed by the Board of Directors in their Mid-Year Budget amendment or earlier if necessary. The appropriated budget is prepared by fund, division, and object level. The legal level of budgetary control is at the fund level and then the object level. Each fund will have its own budget for the following items: 1) salaries and benefits, 2) services and supplies, 3) capital outlay, and 4) debt service and other expenditures. The Board must approve amendments or transfers of appropriations between funds or objects.

A Statements of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balances – Budget and Actual is presented for all funds on pages 26, 69, 73, and 74. It is presented at the legal level except for debt service and other expenditures in which debt service is presented separately from other expenditures. Reclassifications were made in the budgeted amounts to be consistent with the presentation of the actual balances.

Appropriations in all budgeted funds lapse at the end of the fiscal year even if they have related encumbrances. Encumbrances are commitments related to unperformed (executory) contracts for goods or services (i.e., purchase orders, contracts, and commitments). Encumbrance accounting is utilized to the extent necessary to assure effective budgetary control and accountability and to facilitate effective cash planning and control. While all appropriations and encumbrances lapse at year end, valid outstanding encumbrances (those for which performance under the executory contract is expected in the next year) are re-appropriated and become part of the subsequent year’s budget.

For the year ended June 30, 2020, no instances existed in which expenditures exceeded appropriations.

D. ASSETS, LIABILITIES, DEFERRED OUTFLOWS/INFLOWS OF RESOURCES, AND NET POSITION/FUND BALANCE

1. Cash and Investments  
Cash and cash equivalents are considered to be cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition, including money market mutual funds.  

Investments are reported at fair value.

2. Medic Fees Receivable  
The medic fees receivable balance arises from billings to insurance companies and patients for medic services. Metro Fire has a receivable balance of $10,007,209 which is net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $8,190,331 at June 30, 2020. The allowance includes an estimate for future uncollectible debt and insurance write-offs.

3. Deferred Outflows and Inflows of Resources  
Pursuant to GASB Statement No. 63, “Financial Reporting of Deferred Outflows of Resources, Deferred Inflows of Resources, and Net Position,” Metro Fire recognizes deferred outflows and inflows of resources. In addition to assets, a deferred outflow of resources is reported separately which is defined as a consumption of net position that is applicable to a future reporting period. In addition to liabilities, a deferred inflow of resources is also reported separately and is defined as an acquisition of net position that is applicable to a future reporting period. See Note 6-E and 7-E for information about deferred outflows and inflows relating to Metro Fire’s pension plan and other postemployment benefits.

4. Inventory and Prepaid Items  
Inventories are stated at cost using the weighted average method. Inventories consist of medical and other supplies, vehicle parts, helicopter parts, and fuel. The cost of such inventories is recorded as expenditures/expenses when consumed rather than when purchased.

Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are recorded as prepaid costs in both government-wide and fund financial statements. The cost of prepaid items is recorded as expenditures/expenses when consumed rather than when purchased. Prepaid costs of governmental funds offset non-spendable fund balance to indicate they do not constitute resources available for future appropriation.

5. Capital Assets  
Capital assets for governmental fund types are not capitalized in the funds used to acquire or construct them. Capital acquisitions are reflected as expenditures in the governmental fund, and the related assets are reported in the government-wide financial statements. Capital assets are defined by Metro Fire as assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $5,000. Such assets are recorded at historical cost if purchased or constructed. Donated capital assets are recorded at the acquisition value or the price that would be paid to acquire an asset with equivalent service potential in an orderly market transaction at the acquisition date. For certain older assets, including infrastructure, estimated historical costs are used. The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially extend the asset’s life are not capitalized. Capital assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the following useful lives:

| Asset Class               | Years  |
|--------------------------|--------|
| Buildings and Improvements| 25 to 50 |
| Equipment                | 5 to 25  |

In addition, software is amortized on a straight-line basis over the service life of the asset in accordance with contractual provisions. Costs of assets sold or retired (and related amounts of accumulated depreciation) are eliminated from the accounts in the year of sale or retirement and the resulting gain or loss is included in the operating statement of the related fund. In governmental funds, the sale of general capital assets is included in the statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances as proceeds from sale.

6. Restricted Assets  
Metro Fire’s restricted assets consist of fees collected to defray the cost of constructing facilities to serve new development, unspent financing proceeds for capital acquisitions, amounts held for payment of workers’ compensation claims, and debt service reserves.

7. Long-term Obligations  
In the government-wide financial statements, long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported as liabilities in the applicable government activities. Issuance costs are expensed as incurred. In the financial statements, governmental fund types recognize bond premiums and discounts, as well as issuance costs, during the current period. The face amount of the debt issued is reported as other financing sources. Premiums received on debt issuances are reported as other financing sources while discounts on debt issuances are reported as other financing uses. Issuance costs, even if withheld from the actual net proceeds received, are reported as debt service expenditures.

8. Fund Balance Flow Assumptions  
Sometimes Metro Fire will fund outlays for a particular purpose from both restricted and unrestricted resources (the total of committed, assigned, and unassigned fund balance). In order to calculate the amounts to report as restricted, committed, assigned, and unassigned fund balance in the governmental fund financial statements a flow assumption must be made about the order in which the resources are considered to be applied. It is Metro Fire’s policy to consider restricted fund balance to have been depleted before using any of the components of unrestricted fund balance. Further, when the components of unrestricted fund balance can be used for the same purpose, committed fund balance is depleted first, followed by assigned fund balance. Unassigned fund balance is applied last.

**NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)**

9. **Net Position Flow Assumption**  
Sometimes Metro Fire will fund outlays for a particular purpose from both restricted (e.g. restricted bond or grant proceeds) and unrestricted resources. In order to calculate the amounts to report as restricted net position and unrestricted net position in the government-wide and proprietary fund financial statements, a flow assumption must be made about the order in which the resources are considered to be applied. It is Metro Fire’s policy to consider restricted net position to have been depleted before unrestricted net position is applied.

E. **REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES/EXPENSES**

1. **Property Taxes**  
The County of Sacramento is responsible for the collection and allocation of property taxes. Under California law, property taxes are assessed and collected by the County of Sacramento up to 1% of the full assessed value of taxable property, plus other increases approved by the voters and distributed in accordance with statutory formulas. Metro Fire recognizes property taxes when the individual installments are due provided they are collected within 60 days after year-end.

Secured property taxes are levied on or before the first day of November of each year. They become a lien on real property on January 1 preceding the fiscal year for which taxes are levied. These taxes are paid in two equal installments; the first is due November 1 and delinquent with penalties after December 10; the second is due February 1 and delinquent with penalties after April 10. Secured property taxes, which are delinquent and unpaid as of June 30, are declared to be tax defaulted and are subject to redemption penalties, costs, and interest when paid. If the delinquent taxes are not paid at the end of five years, the property is sold at public auction and the proceeds are used to pay the delinquent amounts due. Any excess is remitted, if claimed, to the taxpayer. Additional tax liens are created when there is a change in ownership of property or upon completion of new construction. Tax bills for these new tax liens are issued throughout the fiscal year and contain various payments and delinquent dates, but are generally due within one year. If the new tax liens are lower, the taxpayer receives a tax refund rather than a tax bill. Unsecured personal property taxes are not a lien against real property. These taxes are due on March 1, and become delinquent, if unpaid on August 31.

The County uses the alternative method of property tax apportionment known as the “Teeter Plan.” Under this method of property tax apportionment, the County purchases the delinquent secured taxes at June 30 of each fiscal year. These taxes are accrued as intergovernmental receivables; they are recognized as governmental fund revenues only if they are received from the County within 60 days after year-end. For government-wide presentation, they are accrued when earned regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.

2. **Charges for Services**  
Charges for services represent various cost reimbursements that Metro Fire obtains in the normal course of its operations. A bulk of these charges comes from cost recoveries for its emergency medical transports. In addition, Metro Fire obtains reimbursements from other agencies for costs associated with deploying personnel and equipment to respond to emergencies. These reimbursements are reflected as revenues and the related costs as expenses.
<!-- Page 63 -->
![NOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)](https://example.com/image-url)

Metro Fire participated in a statewide Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) program in which the federal government provides for federal matching funds related to the medical assessment and transportation of Medi-Cal managed care beneficiaries. This program required Metro Fire to transfer funds to the State of California, which then received matching funds from the federal government. The State then transferred the funds, less its administrative fees to the managed care plans which then paid Metro Fire. Metro Fire records the gross amount transferred to the State as expenses and the gross amount received from the plans as revenues.

### 3. Compensated Absences
Regular, full-time Metro Fire employees are granted vacation and sick leave in varying amounts based upon length of service. Any accrued hours, not in excess of the maximum allowable and unused during the current period, are carried forward to following years. Additionally, certain employees are allowed compensated time-off in lieu of overtime compensation and/or from working on holidays. Metro Fire employees may receive up to 40% of accumulated sick leave in cash upon retirement, with the remainder applied as an additional service credit for the purpose of determining pension benefits under the Public Employees’ Retirement System.

Compensated absences are accrued in the government-wide financial statements when earned. A liability for compensated absences is reported in governmental funds only if it has matured, for example, as a result of an employee resignation or retirement, and is currently payable.

### 4. Pensions
In government-wide financial statements, pensions are required to be recognized and disclosed using the accrual basis of accounting (see Note 6 and the required supplementary information [RSI] section immediately following the Notes to Financial Statements), regardless of the amount recognized as pension expenditures on the governmental fund statements, which use the modified accrual basis of accounting.

The net pension liability is measured as of Metro Fire’s prior fiscal year-end. Changes in the net pension liability are recorded, in the period incurred, as pension expense or as deferred inflows of resources or deferred outflows of resources depending on the nature of the change. The changes in net pension liability that are recorded as deferred inflows of resources or deferred outflows of resources (that arise from changes in actuarial assumptions or other inputs and differences between expected or actual experience) are amortized over the weighted average remaining service life of all participants in the respective pension plan and are recorded as a component of pension expense beginning with the period in which they are incurred.

For purposes of measuring the net pension liability and deferred outflows/inflows or resources relating to pensions and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of Metro Fire’s pension plans with the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) and Sacramento County Employees’ Retirement System (SCERS) and additions to/deductions from the plan’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by CalPERS and SCERS. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefits terms. Investments are reported at fair value. Projected earnings on pension investments are recognized as a component of pension expense. Differences between projected and actual investment earnings are reported as deferred inflows of resources or deferred outflows of resources and amortized as a component of pension expense on a closed basis over a five-year period.

5. **Other Postemployment Benefits Obligation (OPEB)**  
For purposes of measuring the net OPEB liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to OPEB, and OPEB expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District Retiree Healthcare Plan (“Plan”) and additions to/deductions from Plan’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the trustee for the Plan. For this purpose, the Plan recognizes benefit payments when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value. Gains and losses related to changes in total OPEB liability and fiduciary net position are recognized in OPEB expense systematically over time. Amounts are first recognized in OPEB expense for the year the gain or loss occurs. The remaining amounts are categorized as deferred outflow and deferred inflows of resources related to OPEB and are to be recognized in future OPEB expense. The net difference between projected and actual earnings on investments is spread over 5 years while the expected average remaining service life (EARSL, 7.38 years at June 30, 2020) is used for all other amounts. See Note 7 for additional information.

F. **USE OF ESTIMATES**  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

G. **NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS**  
In June 2017, GASB issued Statement No. 87, *Leases*, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The effective date of this statement was postponed to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2021 with the issuance of GASB Statement No. 95, *Postponement of the Effective Dates of Certain Authoritative Guidance*. The objective of this statement is to better meet the information needs of financial statement users by improving accounting and financial reporting for leases by governments.

In May 2019, GASB issued Statement No. 91, *Conduit Debt Obligations*, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The effective date of this statement was postponed to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 with the issuance of GASB Statement No. 95. The primary objectives of this statement are to provide a single method of reporting conduit debt obligations by issuers and eliminate diversity in practice associated with 1) commitments extended by issuers, 2) arrangements associated with conduit debt obligations, and 3) related note disclosures.

In January 2020, GASB issued Statement No. 92, *Omnibus 2020*, effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2020. The effective date of this statement was postponed to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2021 with the issuance of GASB Statement No. 95. The objectives of this statement are to enhance comparability in accounting and financial reporting and to improve the consistency of authoritative literature by addressing practice issues that have been identified during implementation of certain GASB Statements.

In May 2020, GASB issued Statement No. 96, *Subscription-Based Information Technology Arrangements*, effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2022. The primary objective of this statement is to provide guidance on the accounting and financial reporting for subscription-based information technology arrangements (SBITAs) for government and users.

Metro Fire has not determined the effect of these pronouncements, if any, on the financial statements.

![NOTE 2 – CASH AND INVESTMENTS (Continued)](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768)

**B. INVESTMENT IN POOLED FUNDS**  
Metro Fire’s investments in the Sacramento County pooled investment fund is managed by the Sacramento County Treasurer and is stated at fair value or amortized cost, which approximates fair value. The total amount invested by all public agencies as of June 30, 2020 was $4,493,782,290. The investment pool is actively managed with a weighted average maturity of 281 days. Metro Fire’s share of the pool is stated at market value in its financial statements. Sacramento County does not invest in any derivative financial products directly. The value of pooled shares in Sacramento County that may be withdrawn is determined on an amortized cost basis, which is different than the fair value of Metro Fire’s position in the pool. The Sacramento County Treasury Investment Oversight Committee (Committee) has oversight responsibility for the County’s cash and investment pool.

**C. INTEREST RATE RISK**  
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Generally, the longer the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value to changes in market interest rates. Information about the sensitivity of the fair values of Metro Fire’s investments to market fluctuations is provided by the following table that shows the distribution of its investments by maturity as of year-end:

| Type of Investment                     | Total       | < 1 year   | 1-2 years | 3-5 years |
|----------------------------------------|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Sacramento county pooled investment fund| $ 57,249,707| $ 57,249,707| $ -       | $ -       |
| Money market mutual funds              | 4,526,514   | 4,526,514  | $ -       | $ -       |
| U.S. government issues                 | 4,550,825   | $ -        | $ -       | 4,550,825 |
| **Total**                              | **$ 66,327,046** | **$ 61,776,221** | **$ -** | **$ 4,550,825** |

**D. CREDIT RISK**  
Generally, credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the instrument. This is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. Metro Fire is permitted to hold investments of issuers with a minimum short-term rating of A-1 and P-1, and the long-term rating of A and A2, respectively by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s rating agencies. Presented below is the actual rating as of year-end for each investment:

| Type of Investment                     | Total       | AAA/Aaa    | AA+/Aa1   | Unrated   |
|----------------------------------------|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Sacramento county pooled investment fund| $ 57,249,707| $ -        | $ -       | $ 57,249,707 |
| Money market mutual funds              | 4,526,514   | 4,526,514  | $ -       | $ -       |
| U.S. government issues                 | 4,550,825   | $ -        | $ -       | 4,550,825 |
| **Total**                              | **$ 66,327,046** | **$ 4,526,514** | **$ 4,550,825** | **$ 57,249,707** |

**E. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK**  
Metro Fire had no investment policy limiting the amount that can be invested in any one issuer beyond that stipulated by the California Government Code. At year-end, there were no investments in any one issuer (other than investments in external investment pools) that represented 5% or more of total district-wide investments.

![NOTE 2 – CASH AND INVESTMENTS (Continued)](https://example.com/image.png)

**F. CUSTODIAL CREDIT RISK**  
Custodial risk for deposits is the risk that, in the event of a bank failure, a government will not be able to recover its deposits or will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. The custodial credit risk for investments is the risk that, in the event of the failure of the counterparty (e.g., broker-dealer) to a transaction, a government will not be able to recover the value of its investment or collateral securities that are in the possession of another party.

The California Government Code requires that a financial institution secure deposits made by state or local governmental units by pledging securities in an undivided collateral pool held by a depository regulated under state law (unless waived by the governmental unit). The market value of the pledged securities must be equal to at least 110% of the total amount deposited by the public agencies. California law allows financial institutions to secure deposits by pledging first trust deed mortgage notes having a value of 150% of the secured deposits.

At June 30, 2020, Metro Fire’s actual bank balance was $1,339,755 of which $500,000 was covered by federal depository insurance while $839,755 was collateralized with securities held by the pledging or financial institution’s trust department or agent, but not in Metro Fire’s name.

**G. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS**  
Metro Fire categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles. The hierarchy is based on the valuation inputs used to measure the fair value of the asset. Metro Fire has the following recurring fair value measurements as of June 30, 2019:

| Fair Value Measurements Using | Amount |
|-------------------------------|--------|
| **Investments by fair value level:** | |
| Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical assets (Level 1) | |
| U.S. government issues | $ 4,550,825 |
| Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) | |
|  | $ 1,308,459 |
| Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) | |
|  | $ 3,242,366 |
|  | $ - |
| **Investments measured at the net asset value (NAV):** | |
| Money market mutual funds | $ 4,526,514 |
| **Investments not subject to fair value hierarchy:** | |
| Sacramento County Investment Pool | $ 57,249,707 |
| **Total investments measured at fair value** | $ 66,327,046 |

Debt securities classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy are valued using prices quoted in active markets for those securities. All securities classified in Level 2 are valued using pricing models based on market data, such as matrix or model pricing from outside pricing services. These valuation techniques include third party benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications.

**NOTE 4 – INTERFUND TRANSACTIONS (Continued)**  
The balance between the General and the Capital Facilities Fund represent an interfund loan which is not expected to be paid within the next year. All remaining balances resulted from processing certain disbursements by Metro Fire’s fiscal agent out of funds other than the intended fund.

The interfund transfer made by the General Fund to the Capital Facilities Fund was made to pay debt service for capital spending in previous years. The transfer by the General Fund to the Grant Fund was made to fulfill grant matching requirements.

**A. PENSION BONDS FROM DIRECT PLACEMENTS**  
In October 2004, Metro Fire issued taxable pension obligation bonds in three series for the original amount of $69,998,975. The proceeds were used to reduce the unfunded actuarial liabilities of its pension plans. Series A bonds were issued as fixed rate bonds which require semi-annual payments of interest at a fixed rate of 4.79% with annual principal payments that began on May 15, 2005 until the final maturity date of May 15, 2025. Series B bonds were issued as auction rate securities which initially require semi-annual interest payments at a rate of 5.37% which will reset to auction rates on November 19, 2025 with principal payments beginning on May 15, 2026 until the final maturity date of May 15, 2030. Series C bonds were issued as convertible auction rate securities and were redeemed in full in the prior fiscal year.

The bond indentures provide for optional redemption of the Series B bonds by their initial auction dates. By policy, Metro Fire is setting aside funds annually for the purpose of fully retiring the Series B bonds on their initial auction date. The bond indenture contains a provision, that in the event of default, the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest may be declared due and payable immediately.

## NOTE 6 – RETIREMENT PLANS

### A. PLAN DESCRIPTIONS

Metro Fire provides pension benefits to eligible employees through defined benefit pension plans administered by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) and Sacramento County Employees’ Retirement System (SCERS), which both act as a common investment and administrative agent for its participating member employers. Benefit provisions and all other requirements for CalPERS are established by State statute and benefit provisions and all other requirements for SCERS are established by Section 31584 of the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937. The establishment and amendment of specific benefit provisions of the plans are authorized by resolutions of the Board.

Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District | CAFR 2019/20 | 41
<!-- Page 72 -->
![NOTE 6 – RETIREMENT PLANS (Continued)](https://www.example.com/image-url)

Metro Fire contributes to the following defined benefit pension plans:

- The Safety Plan of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (the Safety Plan), an agent multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan administered by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS).
  
- The Miscellaneous Plan of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (the Miscellaneous Plan), a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan administered by CalPERS.
  
- The Sacramento County Employees Retirement System Plan (the SCERS Plan), a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan administered by the County of Sacramento.

Only the plans administered by CalPERS are open for new enrollment. SCERS is only responsible for providing benefits to employees or retirees of Metro Fire who were members of SCERS before January 1, 1997. CalPERS issues publicly available financial reports for its plans. Copies of the CalPERS annual financial report and pertinent past trend information may be obtained at https://www.calpers.ca.gov. SCERS issues a publicly available financial report for its plans. Copies of the SCERS annual report may be obtained at http://www.retirement.saccounty.net.

B. BENEFITS PROVIDED

Each plan provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. The passage of the Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act (“PEPRA”) imposed several restrictions to the pension benefits that may be offered to employees hired on or after January 1, 2013 that were not previously CalPERS members, including increasing minimum retirement ages, increasing the percentage required for member contributions, and excluding certain types of compensation as pensionable. PEPRA has also created limits on pensionable compensation tied to the Social Security taxable wage base. The cumulative effect of these PEPRA changes will ultimately reduce Metro Fire’s retirement costs.

All permanent full-time employees and part-time employees working at least 1,000 hours per year are enrolled in the CalPERS Safety Plan or the Miscellaneous Plan. Safety membership is extended only to those involved in fire suppression, and certain other related classifications, while all other employees are classified as Miscellaneous. Upon retirement, participants are entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, payable for life, in an amount equal to a benefit factor multiplied by their service years and by their highest average monthly salary over 12 consecutive months of employment or, in the case of PEPRA employees, 36 consecutive months of employment.

The Plans’ provisions and benefits in effect at June 30, 2020 are summarized as follows:

| CalPERS membership date | Safety Plan | Miscellaneous Plan |
|-------------------------|-------------|--------------------|
|                         | Prior to January 1, 2013 | On or after January 1, 2013 | Prior to January 1, 2013 | On or after January 1, 2013 |
| Benefit formula (at full retirement) | 3.00% @ 50 | 2.7% @ 57 | 3.0% @ 60 | 2.0% @ 62 |
| Benefit vesting schedule | 5 years service | 5 years service | 5 years service | 5 years service |
| Benefit payments | monthly for life | monthly for life | monthly for life | monthly for life |
| Retirement age | 50 and up | 50 and up | 50 and up | 52 and up |
| Monthly benefits, as a % of eligible compensation (based on retirement age) | 3.0% | 2.0% to 2.7% | 2.0% to 3.0% | 1.0% to 2.0% |

![NOTE 6 – RETIREMENT PLANS (Continued)](https://example.com/image-url)

### NOTE 6 – RETIREMENT PLANS (Continued)

The SCERS Plan provides benefits to employees or retirees of Metro Fire who were members of SCERS before January 1, 1997 (closed to new entrants). It provides retirement and death benefits based on the employee's years of service while an active member, age, and average final compensation. Employees with 5 years of service prior to January 1, 1997 are vested and may receive retirement benefits at age 50.

#### C. EMPLOYEES COVERED

The following employees were covered by the benefit terms for the Plans:

|                     | CalPERS | SCERS |
|---------------------|---------|-------|
|                     | Safety  | Miscellaneous |
| Inactive or their beneficiaries currently receiving benefits | 788     | 134   | 131   |
| Inactive entitled to but not yet receiving benefits | 181     | 78    | 6     |
| Active              | 578     | 85    | 8     |
| **Total covered employees** |         | **1,547** | **297** | **145** |

The information above was based on the most recent actuarial information available as of June 30, 2019.

#### D. CONTRIBUTIONS

Section 20814(c) of the California Public Employees’ Retirement Law (PERL) requires that the employer contribution rates for all public employers be determined on an annual basis by the actuary and shall be effective on the July 1 following notice of a change in the rate. For each of the CalPERS plans, the contribution rate required contribution for the year ended June 30, 2020, was a specified percent of annual payroll, actuarially determined as an amount that, when combined with employee contributions, is expected to finance the costs of benefits earned by employees during the year; and a fixed dollar amount contribution for any unfunded accrued liability for past service.

Contribution rates for the Safety Plan are individually determined for Metro Fire by CalPERS and do not reflect any cost-sharing provisions. Contribution rates for the Miscellaneous Plan are determined with reference to the risk pool to which they belong. Additionally, CalPERS manages a side fund for the Miscellaneous Plan, that was created at the time Metro Fire joined the plan, to reflect the difference between the funded status of Metro Fire’s plan and the funded status of the risk pool. The side fund is invested and is being amortized to reduce the normal required contributions.

Required normal cost contributions were made each period based on required contribution rates as shown below. Unfunded liability contributions were made in July 2019 for Miscellaneous Classic and PEPRA separately and for Safety Classic and PEPRA combined. In addition to their employee contributions, classic safety employees contribute 3% of their pay towards employer contributions. Required contributions of active plan members and of Metro Fire for fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 were as follows:

| Safety Plan        | Miscellaneous Plan |
|--------------------|--------------------|
|                    | Classic | PEPRA    | Classic | PEPRA    |
| Required employer normal cost rates | 19.012% | 19.012% | 15.499% | 7.863% |
| Unfunded Liability Contribution | $ 24,111,957 | $ 917,476 | $ 1,481 |
| Required employee contribution rates | 9.000% | 12.000% | 8.000% | 6.750% |
| Actual employer contributions made | $ 32,707,931 | $ 2,997,254 | $ 1,697,520 | $ 196,342 |
| Actual employee contributions made | $ 6,700,910 | $ 2,025,299 | $ 403,791 | $ 167,508 |

**NOTE 6 – RETIREMENT PLANS (Continued)**

As part of its withdrawal from the SCERS Plan, Metro Fire has contractually agreed to eliminate its net pension liability by July 2037. Metro Fire contributes annually to the Plan to pay down this liability which is recalculated annually by SCERS’ actuary. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, Metro Fire paid $3,530,927.

**E. PENSION LIABILITIES, PENSION EXPENSE, AND DEFERRED OUTFLOWS/INFLOWS OF RESOURCES RELATED TO PENSIONS**

**Net Pension Liability:** The net pension liability (NPL) is measured as of June 30, 2019 based on the results of the actuarial calculation performed as of June 30, 2018 for the CalPERS plans and as of June 30, 2019 for the SCERS plan. Fiduciary net position is based on fair value of investments as of June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2020, Metro Fire reported the following net pension liabilities:

| Plan                          | Net Pension Liability  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| CalPERS Safety Plan           | $403,365,994          |
| CalPERS Miscellaneous Plan    | $15,749,126           |
| SCERS Plan                    | $46,987,869           |
| **Total NPL**                | **$466,102,989**      |

Metro Fire’s net pension liability for the CalPERS Safety Plan is measured as the Plan’s total pension liability, less the Plan’s fiduciary net position. The changes in the NPL for the Safety Plan are as follows:

| CalPERS Safety Plan           | Total Pension Liability | Plan Fiduciary Net Position | Net Pension Liability |

The net pension liability for CalPERS Miscellaneous Plan is measured as the proportionate share of the collective net pension liability of the Miscellaneous Risk Pool (risk pool) as a whole. In determining an individual rate plan’s proportion of the risk pool’s net pension liability, CalPERS first estimates the total pension liability (TPL) and the fiduciary net position (FNP) for the risk pool as a whole as well as the individual rate plans. The allocated net pension liability represents the difference between the plan’s proportionate share of the TPL and FNP.

Metro Fire’s proportionate share of the net pension liability for the Miscellaneous Plan is as follows:

| Proportion - June 30, 2018 | 0.37975% |
|-----------------------------|----------|
| Proportion - June 30, 2019 | 0.39329% |
| Change - Increase (Decrease) | 0.01354% |

As Metro Fire has withdrawn from SCERS, SCERS calculates the net pension liability in a separate account as contractually agreed. Although a separate study is done to determine Metro Fire’s TPL and FNP, the study uses assumptions based on the combined experience of the risk pool as a whole (e.g. longevity, salary increases, etc.).

### Pension Expenses and Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources:
Pension expense represents the change in the net pension liability during the measurement period, adjusted for actual contributions and the deferred recognition of changes in investment gain/loss, actuarial gain/loss, actuarial assumptions or method, and plan benefits. For the year ended June 30, 2020, Metro Fire recognized pension expense as follows:

| Plan                          | Amount      |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| CalPERS Safety Plan           | $ 55,879,822 |
| CalPERS Miscellaneous Plan    | $ 3,265,696  |
| SCERS Plan                    | $ 6,216,108  |
| **Total Pension Expense**     | **$ 65,361,626** |

**NOTE 6 - RETIREMENT PLANS (Continued)**  
The $41,129,974 reported as deferred outflows of resources related to contributions subsequent to the measurement date will be recognized as a reduction of the net pension liability in the year ended June 30, 2021. Other amounts reported as deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions will be recognized as pension expense as follows:

| Year ending June 30, | CalPERS Safety | CalPERS Miscellaneous | SCERS | Total |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------|-------|
| 2021                 | $14,364,985    | $958,542              | $2,623,649 | $17,947,176 |

**F. ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS**  
The total pension liabilities were determined using the following actuarial methods and assumptions:

| CalPERS Plans                     | SCERS Plans                     |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Actuarial Cost Method             | Entry Age Normal Cost           | Entry Age Actuarial Cost       |
| Amortization Method               | Level Percent of Payroll        | Level Percent of Payroll       |
| Asset Valuation Method            | Market Value                    | Market Value                   |
| Actuarial Assumptions:           |                                 |                                 |
| Investment Rate of Return         | 7.15%                           | 7.00%                          |
| Inflation                          | 2.50%                           | 3.00%                          |
| Payroll Growth                    | Varies by entry and service     | 3.25% (includes inflation)    |
| Mortality Rate table              | Derived using CalPERS' membership data for all funds. The table includes 15 years of mortality improvements using the Society of Actuaries Scale 90% of scale MP 2016. | Derived using Headcount-Weighted RP-2014 Healthy Annuitant Mortality Table projected generationally with two-dimensional scale MP-2016 set back four years for males and females. |
| Post Retirement Benefit Increase   | The lesser of contract COLA or 2.5% until Purchasing Power Protection Allowance floor on purchasing power applies, 2.5% thereafter. | COLA up to 3.0% depending on retiree classification. |

**Discount Rate**  
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments for CalPERS Plans was determined using a building-block method in which expected future real rates of returns are developed for each major asset class.

In determining the long-term expected rate of return, CalPERS took into account both short-term and long-term market return expectations as well as the expected pension fund cash flows. Using historical returns of all the funds’ asset classes, expected compound (geometric) returns were calculated over the short-term (first 10 years) and the long-term (11+ years) using a building-block approach. Using the expected nominal returns for both short-term and long-term, the present value of benefits was calculated for each fund. The expected rate of return was set by calculating the rounded single equivalent expected return that arrived at the same present value of benefits for cash flows as the one calculated using both short-term and long-term returns. The expected rate of return was then set equal to the single equivalent rate calculated above and adjusted to account for assumed administrative expenses.

![NOTE 6 – RETIREMENT PLANS (Continued)](https://www.sacmetrofiredistrict.org/cafr-2019-20)

The expected real rates of return by asset class for CalPERS Plans are as follows:

| Asset Class      | Target Allocation | Real Return Years 1 - 10 | Real Return Years 11 + |
|------------------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Global Equity     | 50.00 %          | 4.80 %                    | 5.98 %                  |
| Fixed Income      | 28.00 %          | 1.00 %                    | 2.62 %                  |
| Inflation Assets  | -                | 0.77 %                    | 1.81 %                  |
| Private Equity    | 8.00 %           | 6.30 %                    | 7.23 %                  |
| Real Assets       | 13.00 %          | 3.75 %                    | 4.93 %                  |
| Liquidity         | 1.00 %           | -                         | (0.92) %                |

To produce the long-term expected rate of return, SCERS weighted the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage, adding expected inflation and subtracting expected investment expenses and a risk margin.

The target allocation and projected real rates of return for each major asset class for the SCERS Plan are as follows:

| Asset Class      | Target Allocation | Real Return |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| U.S. Equity      | 21.00 %          | 5.75 %      |
| International Equity | 20.00 %      | 7.42 %      |
| Fixed Income     | 24.00 %          | 1.61 %      |
| Absolute Return   | 10.00 %         | 3.62 %      |
| Private Equity    | 9.00 %          | 8.70 %      |
| Real Assets       | 16.00 %         | 5.77 %      |

**Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate:** The following presents Metro Fire’s net pension liability for each Plan, calculated using the discount rate for each Plan, as well as what Metro Fire’s proportionate share of the net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage point lower or 1-percentage point higher than the current rate:

| Net Pension Liability | 1% decrease       | Current Discount Rate (7.15%/7.00%) | 1% increase       |
|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
| CalPERS Safety (7.15%) | $ 566,960,947   | $ 403,365,994                       | $ 269,103,593     |
| CalPERS Miscellaneous (7.15%) | $ 24,752,377 | $ 15,749,126                        | $ 8,317,578       |
| SCERS Plan (7.00%)   | $ 58,307,195     | $ 46,987,869                        | $ 37,667,251      |

**G. PENSION PLAN FIDUCIARY NET POSITION**

Detailed information about each pension plan’s fiduciary net position is available in the separately issued CalPERS and SCERS financial reports which can be found online at [www.calpers.ca.gov/page/employers/actuarial-services/gasb](http://www.calpers.ca.gov/page/employers/actuarial-services/gasb) and [www.scers.org/actuarial-information](http://www.scers.org/actuarial-information).

## NOTE 6 – RETIREMENT PLANS (Continued)

### H. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
Metro Fire employees may defer a portion of their compensation under a Metro Fire sponsored Deferred Compensation Plan created in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 457. Under this Plan, participants are not taxed on the deferred portion of their compensation until distributed to them; distributions may be made only at termination, retirement, death or in an emergency defined by the Plan. The laws governing deferred compensation plan assets require plan assets to be held by a Trust for the exclusive benefit of plan participants and their beneficiaries. Since the assets held under these plans are not Metro Fire’s assets and are not subject to its control, they have been excluded from these financial statements.

## NOTE 7 – OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

### A. PLAN DESCRIPTION
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District Retiree Healthcare Plan (“Plan”) is a single-employer defined benefit healthcare plan administered by Metro Fire. The Plan provides healthcare benefits to eligible retirees and their dependents through CalPERS under the Public Employees’ Medical and Hospital Care Act (PEMHCA). This coverage requires the employee to satisfy the requirements for retirement: (a) attainment of age 50 (age 52, for miscellaneous employees who are new to PERS on or after January 1, 2013) with 5 years of State or public agency service or (b) an approved disability retirement.

### B. BENEFITS PROVIDED
Benefit provisions are established and may be amended through agreements and memorandums of understanding among Metro Fire, its non-represented employees, and the unions for represented Metro Fire employees. As a PEMHCA employer, Metro Fire is obligated to contribute toward the cost of retiree medical coverage for the retiree’s lifetime or until coverage is discontinued. Metro Fire has resolutions with CalPERS defining the level of contribution toward active and retiree medical plan premiums. Benefits fall into one of four categories:

1. For employees hired prior to December 1, 2011, the current resolutions provide that:
   a. While covered by a Basic or Combination plan, Metro Fire will contribute 92% of the medical premium for the retiree and his or her dependents, but not more than 92% of the premium for the 3rd highest Basic or Combination plan rate corresponding to the retiree’s coverage level, and
   b. When the retiree and all of his or her covered dependents are covered by Medicare plans, Metro Fire will contribute 100% of the medical premium, not to exceed 100% of the 3rd highest Supplemental plan rate corresponding to the retiree’s coverage level.

2. Employees hired on or after December 1, 2011 in general are covered by a “special” PEMHCA vesting resolution, which provides that Metro Fire will pay the benefit described in 1 above, multiplied by a vesting percentage with a minimum service of 5 years starting at 25% increasing by intervals of 5 years to those having 20 years of service.

3. Retirees who retain SCERS medical coverage receive a subsidy, increasing by 5% per year, based on the retiree’s years of service with Metro Fire. The benefit continues at 50% for surviving spouses of retirees.

4. Metro Fire also reimburses the monthly Medicare Part B premiums for former employees who retired from American River Fire District and their spouses.
<!-- Page 79 -->
![NOTE 7 – OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS (Continued)](https://www.example.com/image.png)

### NOTE 7 – OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS (Continued)

All retirees eligible for coverage under the district-sponsored medical plans (except those in 3. above) who opt out of CalPERS medical insurance will receive instead up to $300 per month toward the cost of outside coverage.

#### C. EMPLOYEES COVERED

Based on the most recent actuarial information available, the following employees were covered by the benefit terms of the Plan:

- Inactive or their beneficiaries currently receiving benefits: 739
- Inactive entitled to but not receiving benefits: 13
- Active: 665

**Total covered employees: 1,417**

#### D. CONTRIBUTIONS

The contribution requirements of the Plan participants and Metro Fire are established by and may be amended pursuant to agreements with its non-represented employees and the union for represented Metro Fire employees. Metro Fire prefunds its obligation by contributing to the California Employer’s Retiree Benefit Trust (CERBT) Fund, an irrevocable trust established to fund OPEB. CERBT is administered by CalPERS, and is managed by an appointed board not under the control of Metro Fire. CalPERS issues a publicly available financial report for the Plan that can be obtained at www.calpers.ca.gov/page/employers/benefit-programs/cerbt.

In accordance with its annual budget, Metro Fire contributes to CERBT an amount that, together with the payment of retiree medical premiums, will fund the explicit portion of the actuarially determined contribution and will fund the implicit subsidy liability on a pay-as-you-go basis. An “implicit subsidy” exists when the premiums charged for retiree coverage are lower than the expected retiree claims for that coverage. Pre-Medicare retirees able to continue medical coverage at the same premium rates as are charged for active employees creates this implicit benefit. Employees are not required to contribute to the Plan. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, Metro Fire’s contributions were as follows:

- Employer Cash Contributions to the trust: $4,981,191
- Employer Contributions in the form of Direct Benefit Payments (not reimbursed by the Trust): $10,491,102
- Estimated Implicit Subsidy: $3,329,178

**Total contributions: $18,801,471**

#### E. OPEB LIABILITY, OPEB EXPENSE, AND DEFERRED OUTFLOW/INFLOWS OF RESOURCES RELATED TO OPEB

Net OPEB Liability: Metro Fire’s net OPEB liability was measured as of June 30, 2019 and the total OPEB liability used to calculate the net OPEB liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of that date. Metro Fire’s net OPEB liability is measured as the Plan’s total OPEB liability, less the Plan’s fiduciary net position.

F. ASSUMPTIONS  
The total OPEB liabilities were determined using the following actuarial methods and assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement, unless otherwise specified:

- **Long-Term Return on Assets**: 7.05%
- **Discount Rate**: 7.05%
- **Inflation**: 2.50%
- **Payroll Growth**: 3.0% per year; since benefits do not depend on pay, this is used only to allocate the cost of benefits between service years.
- **Mortality**: MacLeod Watts Scale 2018 developed from a blending of data and methodologies found in (1) the Society of Actuaries Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2016 Report and (2) the demographic assumptions used in the 2016 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds, published in 2016.
- **Healthcare Trend**: 5.4% for 2021 with an ultimate rate of 4.0% for 2076 and later years developed using the Getzen Model 2019_b published by the Society of Actuaries.

The long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was determined using a building block method in which expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of OPEB plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return for time periods 1-10 years and 11-60 years by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. The target allocation and best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class are summarized in the following table:

| Asset Class                          | Target Allocation | Real Return Years 1-10 | Real Return Years 11-60 |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Global Equity                        | 59.00%            | 6.80%                   | 8.9%                     |
| Fixed Income                         | 25.00%            | 3.10%                   | 5.54%                    |
| Global Real Estate (REITs)          | 8.00%             | 5.50%                   | 7.42%                    |
| Treasury Inflation Protected Securities| 5.00%            | 2.25%                   | 4.38%                    |
| Commodities                          | 3.00%             | 3.50%                   | 5.79%                    |

**Changes in Assumptions**: The discount rate was changed from a split discount rate of 7.25% for the explicit subsidy liability and 3.62% for the implicit subsidy liability used to develop the combined total OPEB liability (single equivalent rate of 6.63%) as of June 30, 2018 to a single discount rate of 7.05% as of June 30, 2019. Other changes include a decrease in the inflation rate from 2.75% to 2.5%, a decrease in the payroll growth rate from 3.25% to 3.0%, and an update on the medical trend based on the Getzen model published by the Society of Actuaries.

**Sensitivity of the Net OPEB Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate**: The following presents the net OPEB liability of the District, as well as what the District's net OPEB liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1 percentage point lower or 1 percentage point higher than the current discount rate:

| Current Discount Rate | 1% decrease      | 1% increase      |
|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Net OPEB Liability    | $ 229,657,340    | $ 198,389,952    | $ 172,662,708    |

**NOTE 8 – RISK MANAGEMENT**  
Metro Fire is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts, theft of, damage to and destruction of assets, errors and omission, injuries to employees, and natural disasters. Metro Fire manages these risks through various full insurance policies and self-insurance combined with excess insurance policies. Metro Fire is self-insured for all losses from workers’ compensation claims from 2003, when it terminated its excess liability insurance coverage until 2009. Beginning in 2010, Metro Fire obtained excess commercial coverage for losses in excess of $3,000,000, for each claim up to the statutory limits. Claims expenditures and liabilities are reported when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated.

The liability for claims is based on historical cost and/or actuarial estimates of the amounts needed to pay prior and current year claims, and to allow the accrual of estimated incurred but not reported claims and incurred claims expense. Changes in Metro Fire’s claims liabilities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:

|                          | 2020        | 2019        |
|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses at beginning of fiscal year | $24,621,895 | $23,420,602 |
| Incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses: |             |             |
| Provision for insured events of current fiscal year | $5,109,000  | $4,194,000  |
| Decreases in provision for insured events of prior fiscal years | ($313,041)  | ($73,481)   |
| Total incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses | $4,795,959  | $4,120,519  |
| Payments: |             |             |
| Claim and claim adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of the current fiscal year | $801,734    | $511,881    |
| Claim and claim adjustment expenses attributable to insured events of the prior fiscal years | $2,300,338  | $2,407,345  |
| Total payments | $3,102,072  | $2,919,226  |
| Total unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses | $26,315,782 | $24,621,895 |

Metro Fire is a member of the Special District Risk Management Authority (SDRMA). The SDRMA is a risk-pooling self-insurance authority, created under the provisions of the California Government Code Sections 6500 et. seq. Its purpose is to provide a full risk management program for California local governments. Metro Fire pays an annual premium to SDRMA for general and auto liability, errors and omissions, property, boiler and machinery and employee dishonesty insurance coverage. Metro Fire’s annual premium is based on its pro-rata share of charges for the pooled risk, claims adjusting and legal costs, and administrative and other costs to operate the SDRMA. Aviation insurance continues to be covered through a commercial insurer.

Metro Fire’s coverage and corresponding deductibles are as follows:

| Coverage                          | Amount         | Deductible       |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| General liability                  | $ 10,000,000   | $ 500            |

# NOTE 9 – NET POSITION AND FUND BALANCES

## A. NET POSITION

The government-wide financial statements report net position. The following are the three categories:

- **Net investment in capital assets** – This category groups all capital assets into one component of net position reduced by accumulated depreciation and the outstanding balances of debt, net of unspent proceeds, which are attributable to the acquisition, construction or improvement of these assets.

- **Restricted net position** – This category presents external restrictions imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, laws or regulations of other governments and restrictions imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.

- **Unrestricted net position** – This category represents net position of Metro Fire not restricted for any project or other purpose.

## B. FUND BALANCES

In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report fund balances in the following categories:

- **Nonspendable Funds** – Fund balance should be reported as nonspendable when the amounts cannot be spent because they are either not in spendable form, or are legally or contractually required to be maintained intact. Nonspendable balances are not expected to be converted to cash within the next operating cycle, which consist of inventory, pre-paid items and other assets.

- **Restricted Funds** – Fund balance should be reported as restricted when constraints placed on the use of resources are either externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments, or imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.
  - **Capital acquisitions** – represents developer and impact fees to mitigate the impact of providing additional fire stations and fire equipment.
  - **Debt service** – represents the amount held by bond trustees for payment of bonds.
  - **Workers compensation claims** – represents the amount maintained in the checking account for the payment of workers compensation claims.
  - **Grant-approved expenditures** – represents amounts restricted for purposes enumerated in the grant agreements.
  - **Equipment purchases** – represents proceeds from financing restricted for specifically approved equipment.

- **Committed Funds** – Fund balance should be reported as committed when the amounts can only be used for specific purposes pursuant to constraints imposed by formal action (i.e. resolution) of Metro Fire’s highest level of decision-making authority, the Board of Directors. These amounts cannot be used for any other purpose unless the Board modifies or removes the fund balance commitment through another resolution.
  - **Capital acquisitions** – represents transfers from the general fund committed to the purchase of capital assets.
  - **Workers compensation claims** – represents the amount adopted by the Board for contingency reserves.

**CAFR 2019/20 | Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District**
<!-- Page 85 -->
# NOTE 9 – NET POSITION AND FUND BALANCES (Continued)

Pension bond retirement – represents the amounts set aside for the retirement of the pension bonds prior to their repricing at auction rates in 2025.

**Assigned Funds** – Fund balance should be reported as assigned when the amounts are constrained by the government’s intent to be used for specific purposes, but are neither restricted nor committed. Intent is expressed by the Board of Directors or the Fire Chief and may be changed at their discretion. Unlike commitments, assignments generally exist only temporarily.

**Unassigned Funds** – Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification of Metro Fire’s funds and includes all spendable amounts that have not been restricted, committed, or assigned to specific purposes. The General Fund is the only fund that reports a positive unassigned fund balance amount. In other governmental funds, if expenditures incurred for specific purposes exceeded the amounts restricted, committed, or assigned to those purposes, it may be necessary to report a negative unassigned fund balance.

Although the Board has established a contingency reserve for unanticipated or extraordinary expenditures equal to a minimum of 1.8 months of the General Fund Operating Expenditures, this reserve does not meet the definition of a committed fund balance.

The following are components of fund balances as of June 30, 2020:

|                     | General Fund | Capital Facilities Fund | Nonmajor Funds | Total        |
|---------------------|--------------|------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Nonspendable:**    |              |                        |                |              |

| Pension bond retirement | 4,668,935  | -                      | -              | 4,668,935    |
| **Total committed fund balance** | 8,668,935  | 1,866,152              | -              | $10,535,087  |
| **Unassigned**       | 43,683,135   | -                      | -              | 43,683,135   |

# NOTE 10 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

## A. CONSTRUCTION COMMITMENTS
Metro Fire has an active project for the building of a fire station currently in the design phase. At year-end, $406,314 has been spent-to-date with a remaining commitment with contractors of $243,795. As discussed in Note 1-C, the encumbrances and related appropriation lapse at the end of the year but are re-appropriated and become part of the subsequent year’s budget because performance under the executory contract is expected in the next year.

## B. ENCUMBRANCES
At year end, the amount of encumbrances expected to be honored upon performance by the vendor in the next year, excluding construction commitments discussed above, were as follows:

| Fund                     | Amount      |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| General Fund             | $ 635,226   |
| Capital Facilities Fund   | 2,424,297   |
| Nonmajor Funds           | 159,353     |
| **Total**               | **$ 3,218,876** |

## C. GRANTS
Metro Fire participates in various federal grant programs, the principal of which are subject to program compliance audits pursuant to the Single Audit Act as amended. Accordingly, Metro Fire’s compliance with applicable grant requirements will be established at a future date. The amount of expenditures which may be disallowed by the granting agencies cannot be determined at this time, although Metro Fire anticipates such amounts, if any, will be immaterial.

## D. LITIGATION
Metro Fire is a defendant in a number of lawsuits, which have arisen in the normal course of business. While substantial damages are alleged in some of these actions, their outcome cannot be predicted with certainty. In the opinion of Management and legal counsel, these actions, when finally adjudicated will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of Metro Fire.

## E. COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak is disrupting supply chains and affecting production and sales across a range of industries. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the District’s operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, and the impact on customers, employees, and vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact the financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.

# NOTE 11 – BORROWINGS
Metro Fire has borrowings available from the County of Sacramento equal to 85% of estimated tax revenues for July 1 to December 10 and 42.50% of estimated revenues for December 10 to April 27. These borrowings are permitted until the last Monday of April each year. The amount available as of December 10, 2019 and April 27, 2020 were $129,471,222 and $64,735,611, respectively. The interest rate charged is the rate earned by the County investment pool.

**CAFR 2019/20 | Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District**
<!-- Page 87 -->
![NOTE 11 – BORROWINGS (Continued)](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

The schedule below details the changes in short-term borrowings during the year ended June 30, 2020:

| Beginning Balance | Draws       | Repayments   | Ending Balance |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| $ -               | $ 89,022,747| $ (89,022,747)| $ -             |

This short-term borrowing serves as a dry-period financing for Metro Fire’s operations during the periods before property taxes are received in its accounts, generally in January and April of each year. These amounts are accounted for in the General Fund.

---

![NOTE 12 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

On June 11, 2020, Metro Fire entered into an ambulance service agreement with American Medical Response to provide 6 twelve-hour ambulances per day to augment Metro Fire’s emergency medical services for three years starting in July 1, 2020. The total cost of the three-year contract is $12,308,238.

On December 10, 2020, Metro Fire’s Board of Directors decided to move forward with the construction phase of a new Station 68 after completing the design of the station as mentioned in Note 10-A. To date, a total of $6,682,719 has been awarded to various contractors. The construction is expected to be completed within two years.

(a) As part of its withdrawal from the SCERS Plan, Metro Fire has contractually agreed to eliminate its accrued actuarial unfunded liability by making required contributions through fiscal year 2036/37. As a withdrawn member, SCERS calculates Metro Fire’s pension liabilities in an account separate from the rest of the active employers as contractually agreed. A separate study is done to determine Metro Fire’s TPL and FNP, the study uses assumptions based on the combined experience of the risk pool as a whole. As of the measurement date, there are no active employees contributing to the Plan.

### REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

#### NOTES TO REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION – PENSION PLANS

### Notes to Schedule of Changes in Net OPEB Liability

**CalPERS Plans.** There were no changes in actuarial assumptions used in determining the amounts reported in 2020 for CalPERS Plans. There were changes in the following actuarial assumptions in the prior years:
- From 2018 to 2019, the inflation rate was changed from 2.75% to 2.50%. Demographic assumptions were also changed in accordance to the CalPERS Experience Study and Review of Assumptions completed in December 2017. There were no changes in the discount rate.
- From 2017 to 2018, the discount rate was changed from 7.65% percent to 7.15%.
- From 2015 to 2016, the discount rate was changed from 7.5% net of administrative expenses to 7.65% without a reduction of administrative expenses.

**SCERS Plan.** There were no changes in actuarial assumptions used in determining the amounts reported in 2020 for the SCERS Plan. For prior years, from 2017 to 2018, the discount rate was changed from 7.5% to 7.0% while the inflation rate was changed from 3.25% to 3.0%. The payroll growth rate is based on the inflation rate plus 0.25%. Demographic assumptions were also changed during that year from using RP-2000 Mortality Tables to RP 2014 Mortality tables.

### Notes to Schedule of Employer Contributions to the Pension Plans

Below are the methods and assumptions used to calculate the contributions for the most recent year presented:

| **CalPERS Plans** | **SCERS Plans** |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Actuarial Cost Method** | Entry Age Normal Cost | Entry Age Actuarial Cost |
| **Amortization Method** | Level Percent of Payroll | Level Percent of Payroll |
| **Asset Valuation Method** | Market Value | Market Value |
| **Investment Rate of Return** | 7.25% | 7.00% |
| **Inflation** | 2.625% | 3.00% |
| **Payroll Growth** | Varies by entry age and service | 3.25% (includes inflation) |
| **Mortality Rate table** | Derived using CalPERS' membership data for all funds which includes 15 years of mortality improvements using the Society of Actuaries Scale 90% of scale MP 2016. | Derived using Headcount-Weighted RP-2014 Healthy Annuitant Mortality Table projected generationally with two-dimensional scale MP-2016. |
| **Post Retirement Benefit Increase** | The lesser of contract COLA or 2.5% until Purchasing Power Protection Allowance floor on purchasing power applies, 2.5% thereafter. | COLA up to 3.0% depending on retiree classification. |

**CalPERS Plans.** The following are the changes in methods and assumptions used to calculate contributions:
- From 2019 to 2020, the discount rate was changed from 7.375% to 7.25% while the inflation rate was changed from 2.75% to 2.625%. Demographic assumptions were also changed in accordance to the CalPERS Experience Study and Review of Assumptions completed in December 2017.
- From 2018 to 2019, the discount rate was changed from 7.5% to 7.375%.

# NOTES TO REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION – OPEB PLAN

## Notes to Schedule of Changes in Net OPEB Liability

From 2019 to 2020, the following were the changes in actuarial assumptions:

- Trust rate of return decreased 7.25% to 7.05%.
- Discount rate changed from a single equivalent discount rate of 6.63% to 7.05%.
- Assumed mortality, termination, and retirement rates were updated from those provided in the 2014 experience study report to those provided in the 2017 experience study report of CalPERS.
- Mortality rates were updated from MacLeod Watts Scale 2017 to MacLeod Watts Scale 2018.
- Inflation rate changed from 2.75% to 2.5%.
- Salary increase changed from 3.25% to 3.0%.
- The percentage of employees assumed to cover a dependent child in retirement was increased from 45% until the retiree reaches age 63 to 75% until the retiree reaches age 62.
- Excluded the excise tax for high cost retiree coverage from this valuation due to its December 2019 repeal.

From 2018 to 2019 the following were the changes used in actuarial assumptions:

- The discount rate was changed from blended rate of 4.7% used to develop the total OPEB liability to a single equivalent discount rate of 6.63% determined as follows:
  - 7.25% to calculate the explicit subsidy liability
  - 3.62% to calculate the implicit subsidy liability

## Notes to Schedule of Employer Contributions

Contribution rates are determined by an actuarial study conducted biennially. The contribution rates for 2020 and 2019 were derived from an actuarial study performed as of June 30, 2017 while the contribution rates for the 2018 were derived from an actuarial study as of July 1, 2015. Below are the methods and assumptions used to determine contribution rates for the most recent year:

- Long-Term Return on Assets: 7.25%
- Discount Rate: 7.25%
- Inflation: 2.75%
- Payroll Growth: 3.25% per year; since benefits do not depend on pay, this is used only to allocate the cost of benefits between service years.
- Mortality: 2014 CalPERS Experience Study; Improvement using MW Scale 2017
- Healthcare Trend: 7.5% for 2019 decreasing 0.5% per year to an ultimate rate of 5.0% for 2024 and later years.

There were no changes in actuarial assumptions used in determining the amounts reported in 2020. From 2018 to 2019, the discount rate was changed from a split rate of 7.25% for explicit subsidy and 4.0% for implicit subsidy to a single rate of 7.25%.

(a) In 2015, Metro Fire implemented GASB 68 which required the recognition of net pension liability and related deferrals in the Statement of Net Position instead of just providing a note disclosure. In 2018, GASB 75 was implemented which also required the recognition of the net OPEB liability and related deferrals. These two pronouncements required Metro Fire's net position to be restated which resulted to the large decreases in unrestricted net position in both years.

(a) The State Constitution requires property to be assessed at one hundred percent of the most recent purchase price, plus an increment of no more than two percent annually, plus any local overrides. These values are considered to be full market values.

(b) California local governments do not set their own direct tax rate. The State Constitution establishes the rate at 1% and allocates a portion of that amount, by an annual calculation, to all the taxing entities within a tax area.

Note: In 1978, California voters passed Proposition 13 which set the property tax rate at a 1.00% fixed amount. This 1.00% is shared by all taxing agencies within which the subject property resides. In addition to the 1.00% fixed amount, property owners are charged taxes as a percentage of assessed property values for the payment of any voter approved bonds. Overlapping rates are those of local and county governments that apply to property owners within Metro Fire. Not all overlapping rates apply to all Metro Fire property owners.

(a) California Health and Safety Code, Section 13937 sets the debt limit at 10%. The Code section was enacted when assessed valuations were based on 25% of full market value. This has since changed to 100% of full market value. Thus, the limit shown is 2.50% (one-fourth the limit of 10%) to account for the adjustment of showing assessed valuation at full market value.
