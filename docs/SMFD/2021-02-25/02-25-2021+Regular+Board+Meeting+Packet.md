The mission of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District is to provide professional and compassionate protection, education and service to our community.

The Governor has declared a State of Emergency to exist in California as a result of the threat of COVID-19 (aka the “Coronavirus”). The Governor issued Executive Order N-25-20 and N-29-20, which directs Californians to follow public health directives including canceling large gatherings. The Executive Order also allows local legislative bodies to hold meetings via conference calls while still satisfying state transparency requirements.

The Governor has also issued Executive Order N-33-20, prohibiting people from leaving their homes or places of residence except to access necessary supplies and services or to engage in specified critical infrastructure employment.

The Public's health and well-being are the top priority for the Board of Directors of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District and you are urged to take all appropriate health safety precautions. To facilitate this process, the meeting of the Board will be available via Zoom at the phone number listed above.

**DATE:** February 25, 2021  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Purchase Approval – Draft Commander 3000  

### TOPIC
Staff seeks Board approval for the purchase of a 2021 Draft Commander 3000 from Weis Fire & Safety Equipment, LLC.

### SUMMARY
In 2018 the District put out a request for information for a Mobile Fire Pump Training/Testing Unit (RFI 1015): only two of these types of apparatus are on the market. The Operations and Fleet Divisions evaluated both of these mobile pump testing/training units, The Draft Commander 3000 from Weis Fire & Safety, and the Pump Pod from Pump Pod USA. The District chose to purchase the Pump Pod as the unit was built for training and not testing, and that was what was needed at the time.

The District now needs a mobile testing unit and has chosen the Draft Commander 3000 from Weis Fire & Safety Equipment, LLC. They are the only vendor we have found that builds a dedicated portable fire pump testing unit, and they successfully demonstrated its capabilities in 2018.

### DISCUSSION
This piece of equipment will be located at the District's Fleet location to provide staff with the ability to perform apparatus pump tests at its primary repair location.

### FISCAL IMPACT
The total cost of the purchase for the Draft Commander 3000 is $112,041.68. The funds for this purchase are included in the FY 2020/21 Final Budget.

### RECOMMENDATION
Staff respectfully recommends the Board approve the purchase of the Draft Commander 3000 from Weis Fire & Safety Equipment, LLC.

**DATE:** February 25, 2021  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Notice of Award – RFP 20-11 Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD) Inspection Billing Services.  

**BACKGROUND**  
Ordinance 2015-02 establishing cost recovery for the Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD) was approved and adopted by the Board on June 23, 2016 detailing all cost recovery fees. Some cost recovery items include: fire and life safety inspections, false alarms, and weed abatement. The District provides fire and life safety inspections to State-mandated and high-hazard occupancies, responds to alarms later determined as false, and mitigates vegetation hazards with weed abatement. On average, CRRD generates 5,000-10,000 billable items per calendar year, depending on current staffing levels.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Staff issued Request for Proposal (RFP) 20-11 Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD) Inspection Billing Services on October 14, 2020 to solicit a qualified company to work with Metro Fire’s Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD) on the invoicing, recording, monitoring, and managing of inspection, false alarm, and weed abatement billing. A public proposal opening was conducted on November 13, 2020 and 2 proposals were received in response to the RFP. The Evaluation Committee reviewed and scored all proposals in accordance with the evaluation criteria outlined in the RFP. Final scoring results are as follows:  
- Wittman Enterprises 79.13%  
- Fire Recovery USA 64%  

Staff desires to issue a contract award to the highest ranked proposer, Wittman Enterprises.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
This award would authorize a 1 year contract with two optional 12-month renewals. The proposed cost for the requested services is a fee of 7% of net collected dollars, which is on average $44,657.69. Funds for this expense have been allocated in FY 21-22 budget.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends that the Board approve the contract award to Wittman Enterprises and authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to execute a professional services agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of RFP 20-11.

**SUBJECT:** FY 2019/20 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) and Accompanying Audit Reports  

**SUMMARY**  
The comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and the accompanying audit reports have been completed and are now ready for presentation to the Board for review and acceptance.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The Finance Division, with the assistance of other Divisions, annually prepares Metro Fire’s CAFR which is a thorough and detailed presentation of Metro Fire’s financial condition. This year’s CAFR will again be submitted to the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) for consideration in its Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting award program, and staff is confident that Metro Fire will be awarded the certificate for the seventh consecutive time.  

The CAFR has been audited by Metro Fire’s independent auditors, Richardson and Company, and has received a clean opinion. Along with the financial audit, the auditors performed an audit of Metro Fire’s compliance with grant laws and regulations and determined we have complied in all material respects. The auditors did not identify any material weakness in our internal controls.  

The following reports and letter are included in the Board packets and will be discussed by our independent auditors:  
- Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (with Independent Auditor's Report)  
- Compliance Report  
  - Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
  - Single Audit Report  
- Report on Appropriations Limit Testing

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS**

Board of Directors  
Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District  
Sacramento, California  

We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information, of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (Metro Fire), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2020, and the related notes to the financial statements which collectively comprise Metro Fire’s basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated January 22, 2021.

**Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Metro Fire’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Metro Fire’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Metro Fire’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

Board of Directors  
Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District  

**Compliance and Other Matters**  

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether Metro Fire’s financial statements are free of material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.  

**Purpose of this Report**  

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

We have audited the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District's (Metro Fire) compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of Metro Fire's major federal programs for year ended June 30, 2020. Metro Fire's major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.  

**Management’s Responsibility**  

Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs.  

**Auditor’s Responsibility**  

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Metro Fire’s major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Metro Fire’s compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of Metro Fire’s compliance.

**Opinion on Each Major Federal Program**

In our opinion, Metro Fire complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2020.

**Report on Internal Control Over Compliance**

Management of Metro Fire is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the type of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered Metro Fire's internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance.

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

**Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by the Uniform Guidance**

We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund and the aggregate remaining fund information of Metro Fire, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2020, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise Metro Fire's basic financial statements. We issued our report thereon dated January 22, 2021, which contained unmodified opinions on those financial statements. Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise Metro Fire's basic financial statements. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by Uniform Guidance and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally.

accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.  

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

**INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS’ REPORT ON AGREED-UPON PROCEDURES APPLIED TO APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT TESTING**

To the Board of Directors  
Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District  
Sacramento, California  

We have performed the procedures enumerated below to the accompanying calculation of the Appropriations Limit of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (the District) for the year ended June 30, 2020. These procedures, which were agreed to by the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District and the League of California Cities (as presented in the publication entitled Agreed-Upon Procedures applied to the Appropriations Limitation Prescribed by Article XIII-B of the California Constitution) were performed solely to assist the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District in meeting the requirements of Section 1.5 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution. The District’s management is responsible for the Appropriations Limit calculation. This agreed-upon procedures engagement was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The sufficiency of the procedures is solely the responsibility of those parties specified in this report. Consequently, we make no representation regarding the sufficiency of the procedures described below either for the purpose for which this report has been requested or for any other purpose.

The procedures performed and our findings were as follows:

1. We obtained the District’s calculation of the fiscal year 2019/2020 Appropriations Limit and compared the limit and annual adjustment factors included in the calculation to the limit and annual adjustment factors that were adopted by resolution of the Board of Directors.  
   **Finding:** No exceptions were noted as a result of our procedures.

2. We compared the methodology used to determine the cost of living adjustment component to Article XIII B, which states that the District may annually adjust the component for either the change in California per capita personal income or, the percentage change in the District’s assessed valuation which is attributable to non-residential new construction. We recalculated the factor based on the above information.  
   **Finding:** No exceptions were noted as a result of our procedures.

3. We compared the methodology used to determine the population adjustment component to Article XIII B which states that the District may annually choose to adjust the component for either the change in population in the County in which the District is located, or the change in population within the unincorporated area of the County in which the District is located. We recalculated the factor based on the above information.  
   **Finding:** No exceptions were noted as a result of our procedures.  

P25
<!-- Page 26 -->
![Board of Directors](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Board+of+Directors+Page+2)

4. We compared the prior year Appropriations Limit presented in the accompanying Appropriations Limit Calculation to the prior year Appropriations Limit adopted by the Board of Directors for the prior year.

   Finding: No exceptions were noted as a result of our procedures.

5. We recalculated the fiscal year 2019/2020 Appropriations Limit by multiplying the product of the two above factors by the prior year Appropriations limit.

   Finding: No exceptions were noted as a result of our procedures.

6. We compared the District’s budgeted and actual revenues to the computed Appropriations Limit for fiscal year 2019/2020.

   Finding: No exceptions were noted as a result of our procedures.

We were not engaged to, and did not perform an audit, the objective of which would be the expression of an opinion on the accompanying Appropriations Limit Calculation. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to you. No procedures have been performed with respect to the determination of the Appropriations Limit for the base year, as defined by Article XIII-B of the California Constitution.

This report is intended solely for the use of the Board of Directors and management of the District and should not be used by those who have not agreed to the procedures and taken responsibility for the sufficiency of the procedures for their purposes. However, this report is a matter of public record and its distribution is not limited.

**GOVERNANCE LETTER**

To the Board of Directors  
Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District  
Sacramento, California  

We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities and the major funds and aggregate remaining funds of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (the District), for the year ended June 30, 2020, and have issued our report thereon dated January 22, 2021. Professional standards require that we provide you with information about our responsibilities under generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards, as well as information related to the planned scope and timing of the audit. We communicated such information to you in our engagement letter dated February 24, 2017. Professional standards require that we provide you with the following information related to our audit.

**Our Responsibilities under U.S. Generally Accepted Auditing Standards, Government Auditing Standards and the Uniform Guidance**

As stated in our engagement letter dated February 24, 2017 our responsibility, as described by professional standards, is to express an opinion about whether the financial statements prepared by management with your oversight are fairly presented, in all material respects, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our audit of the financial statements does not relieve you or management of your responsibilities.

In planning and performing our audit, we considered the District’s internal control over financial reporting in order to determine our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements and not to provide assurance on the internal control over financial reporting. We also considered internal control over compliance with requirements that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program in order to determine our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on compliance and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance.

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial statements are free of material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit. Also in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, we examined, on a test basis, evidence about the District’s compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Compliance Supplement applicable to each of its major federal programs for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the District’s compliance with those requirements. While our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion, it does not provide a legal determination on the District’s compliance with those requirements.

P28
<!-- Page 29 -->
![Board of Directors Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Board+of+Directors+Page+2)

**Planned Scope and Timing of the Audit**

An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; therefore, our audit will involve judgment about the number of transactions to be examined and the areas to be tested.

Our audit includes obtaining an understanding of the entity and its environment, including internal control, sufficient to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements and to design the nature, timing, and extent of further audit procedures. Material misstatements may result from (1) errors, (2) fraudulent financial reporting, (3) misappropriation of assets, or (4) violations of laws or governmental regulations that are attributable to the entity or to acts by management or employees acting on behalf of the entity. We noted no internal control weaknesses during our audit.

We performed the audit according to the planned scope previously communicated to you in our engagement letter dated February 24, 2017.

**Qualitative Aspects of Accounting Practices**

Management is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies. The significant accounting policies used by the District are described in Note 1 to the financial statements. No new accounting policies were adopted, and the application of existing policies was not changed during the year. We noted no transactions entered into by the District during the year for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus. All significant transactions have been recognized in the financial statements in the proper period.

Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based on management’s knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about future events. Accounting estimates were used in the following areas:

1. **Inventory Valuations:** While the District has taken physical inventories to verify quantities, the dollar values assigned to the quantities, especially those assigned to the helicopter inventory, are estimated values.

2. **Depreciable Lives and Methods:** The depreciable lives and methods used for capital assets affects the amount of depreciation expense that is recorded and are based on the District’s estimate of the useful lives of the assets.

3. **Uncollectible Receivables:** The allowances for uncollectible ambulance accounts receivable are based on historical collection and write-off statistical data, applied to the accounts receivable balances at the fiscal year-end.

4. **Accrual of Revenue:** The District estimates revenue, including GEMT grant revenue, when the amounts are not received prior to the preparation of the financial statements. GEMT grant revenue is based on amounts received in prior years, if a funding agreement is expected to be reached.

5. **Workers Compensation Liability:** The self-insured workers compensation claims liability is based on an independent actuarial study, which is in turn based on assumptions about amounts that will be required to settle claims known and not yet known at the actuarial dates, plus related administrative costs.
<!-- Page 30 -->
Board of Directors  
Page 3  

6. OPEB Liability: The OPEB liability is based on an actuarial valuation, which utilizes assumptions including future employment, retirement rates and future costs of health care and health insurance.  

7. Pension Liability: The pension liability is based on an actuarial study performed by CalPERS, utilizing assumptions including future employment, retirement rates, mortality, salary increases and interest rates.  

We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates in determining that they are reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.  

Certain financial statement disclosures are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statement users. The most sensitive disclosures affecting the financial statements were:  

Pension Liability: The disclosure of the pension liability in Note 6 to the financial statements discusses the pension liability and related deferred inflows and outflows of resources that are reflected in the Statement of Net Position as well as the assumptions that were used to determine the amounts and other required disclosures. The District’s share of the unfunded pension liability at June 30, 2019, the most recent measurement date, was $466,102,989 which is reflected as a liability in the District’s financial statements as of June 30, 2020. As a result of the changes in the net pension liability and related deferred inflows and outflows, the District’s pension expense is $65,361,626 representing changes in the pension liability and related deferred inflows and outflows.  

Other Postemployment Benefits Liability: The disclosure of the other postemployment liability in Note 7 to the financial statements discusses the liability that is reflected in the Statement of Net Position as well as the assumptions that were used to determine the amounts and other required disclosures. The District’s share of the unfunded OPEB liability at June 30, 2019, the most recent measurement date, was $198,389,952 which is reflected as a liability in the District’s financial statements as of June 30, 2020. As a result of the recording of the net OPEB liability and related deferred inflows and outflows, the District’s OPEB expense is $5,332,849 to record changes in the net OPEB liability and deferred outflows and inflows.  

The financial statement disclosures are neutral, consistent and clear.  

Difficulties Encountered in Performing the Audit  

We encountered no difficulties in dealing with management in performing and completing our audit.  

Corrected and Uncorrected Misstatements  

Professional standards require us to accumulate all known and likely misstatements identified during the audit, other than those that are trivial, and communicate them to the appropriate level of management. There were no material misstatements noted during the audit.  

Disagreements with Management  

For purposes of this letter, professional standards define a disagreement with management as a matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction, concerning a financial accounting, reporting, or auditing matter that could be significant to the financial statements or the auditor’s report. We are pleased to report that no such disagreements arose during the course of our audit.  

Management Representations  

We have requested certain representations from management that are included in the management representation letter dated January 22, 2021.

**Management Consultations with Other Independent Accountants**

In some cases, management may decide to consult with other accountants about auditing and accounting matters, similar to obtaining a “second opinion” on certain situations. If a consultation involves application of an accounting principle to the District’s financial statements or a determination of the type of auditor’s opinion that may be expressed on those statements, our professional standards require the consulting accountant to check with us to determine that the consultant has all the relevant facts. To our knowledge, there were no such consultations with other accountants.

**Issues Discussed Prior to Retention of Independent Auditors**

We generally discuss a variety of matters, including the application of accounting principles and auditing standards, with management each year prior to retention as the District’s auditors. However, these discussions occurred in the normal course of our professional relationship and our responses were not a condition to our retention.

**Other Matters**

We applied certain limited procedures to Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Schedule of Changes in Net Pension Liability – CalPERS Safety Plan, Schedule of Plan’s Proportionate Share of Net Pension Liability, Schedule of Employer Contributions to the Pension Plan – CalPERS and SCERS Plans Schedule of Changes in Net OPEB Liability and Schedule of Employer Contributions to the OPEB Plan, which are required supplementary information (RSI) that supplements the basic financial statements. Our procedures consisted of inquiries of management regarding the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We did not audit the RSI and do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the RSI.

We were engaged to report on the budgetary comparison schedule for the Grant Fund, Capital Facilities Fund and Impact Fee Fund and combining non-major governmental fund schedules, which accompany the financial statements but are not RSI. With respect to this supplementary information, we made certain inquiries of management and evaluated the form, content, and methods of preparing the information to determine that the information complies with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the method of preparing it has not changed from the prior period, and the information is appropriate and complete in relation to our audit of the financial statements. We compared and reconciled the supplementary information to the underlying accounting records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves.

We were not engaged to report on Introductory and Statistical Sections, which accompany the financial statements but are not RSI. We did not audit or perform other procedures on this other information and we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on it.

This information is intended solely for the use of the Board of Directors and management of the District and is not intended to be, and should not be, used by anyone other than these specified parties.

**Did you know?**  
Metro Fire's roots can be traced all that way back to 1918 with Mather Field Fire Department that employed about 30 firefighters and served an area of 4 square miles. With the addition of new agencies and consolidations, Metro Fire was formed and now serves 359 square miles and employs over 500 firefighters.

**Message from the Fire Chief**

Dear Residents of Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District,

This past year we faced an adversary unlike any we’ve seen in the history of Metro Fire. The pandemic is sweeping through our community and has touched every aspect of our lives. In these uncertain times, we will strive to be a source of strength and stability. Whenever you dial 911, you can count on us to show up no matter the circumstances.

Our strength lies in the core values that Metro Fire is built on – professionalism, integrity, teamwork, and dedication to duty. These values are reflected in the service and dedication we provide to you every single day. One thing I have learned through it all is that if we carry on with the hope that tomorrow will be better and knowing that we are all in this together, then we can face any adversity.

Thank you for reviewing Metro Fire’s Community Annual Report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. This report will show you how effectively we used your tax dollars and how we operated during the pandemic. We welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions regarding the information in this report and about how Metro Fire is performing.

# AT A GLANCE

Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District was established on December 1, 2000 through the merger of the American River and Sacramento County Fire Protection Districts, which brought together 16 predecessor fire agencies. Metro Fire is governed by a nine-member Board of Directors duly elected by citizens from each of the nine geographical divisions in Metro Fire’s area of responsibility.

Today, Metro Fire is the largest fire agency in the County of Sacramento and one of the largest in the State. The combined District provides fire suppression and emergency medical services along with various other public safety and hazard mitigation community services to 757,000 residents in approximately 359 square miles that include two cities, most of the unincorporated area of Sacramento County, and a portion of Placer County. Within the boundaries of Metro Fire are wildland areas, single and multi-family residential units, commercial and light industrial occupancies, hotels, regional hospitals, institutional buildings, local airfields, numerous convalescent and assisted living facilities, equestrian areas, and open space areas including several major hiking trails. Numerous main interstate highways also traverse Metro Fire’s jurisdiction, along with the American River, a major recreation resource for area residents.

Metro Fire provides all-hazard emergency services to the communities it serves through 41 stations strategically located across its service area in order to rapidly and effectively respond to any emergency within its goal of 4-minute travel time.

**Did you know?**  
While Metro Fire primarily serves the County of Sacramento, it is often called upon to assist in state and national emergencies. Through cooperation with state and federal agencies, you may see fire engines and firefighters from different fire agencies at a wildfire or other disaster working under a unified command.

# PANDEMIC RESPONSE

With the adversity brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, Metro Fire acted quickly to execute a coordinated and methodical response to address the impacts of the virus on its operations and the community.

## Timely Communication
Communication plays a crucial role in any crisis, even more so when dealing with a hitherto unknown and highly infectious disease. At the outset of the pandemic, Metro Fire launched the Emergency Operations Team tasked with keeping personnel healthy and safe, and most of all providing consistent and timely information. Bulletins and newsletters were regularly sent out to all personnel to provide guidance on areas such as the use of protective equipment, disinfecting apparatus and fire stations, temperature checks, working from home, and other measures to prevent the spread. Suggestions from personnel were also elicited. The flow of information went both ways throughout the organization.

## Adaptability
Defined as the ability or willingness to change in order to suit different conditions, this is an essential survival skill, and in this period of uncertainty, there is a need to adapt faster and stay ahead of the situation.

Before the outbreak, Metro Fire had been working on a mobile health program that would address the needs of high utilizers of the health care system. As the pandemic began gripping the nation, the program was repurposed and deputized by the County to provide assessment and COVID-19 testing in areas with identified clusters of test-positive patients and at-risk populations. Metro Fire led a county-wide charge by deploying two Metro Fire units to screen for the virus, bring healthcare to the patient’s home, and follow-up after hospital discharge. These units were staffed by a firefighter-paramedic paired with an advanced provider such as a Physician’s Assistant or Doctor.

## Inter-Agency Cooperation
A coordinated effort is required to mount an effective response. Metro Fire’s Fire Chief, along with other fire chiefs, immediately met with Sacramento County Public Health to address risk exposures and quarantine recommendations for personnel exposed to the virus. Throughout the pandemic, a unified top-down approach was used to coordinate the efforts of each local fire agency in stopping the spread of the virus and caring for those already affected.

## Service to the Community
“Ben” was involved in a devastating vehicle accident, leaving him with a traumatic brain injury which required admission to a rehabilitation facility. Except there was one problem – to secure the one open spot, the facility required a COVID-19 test. This was hard to find since he didn’t meet the testing criteria. After running into many dead ends, his family reached out to Metro Fire for help. We were able to test Ben within hours, and with a negative test result the next day, he was accepted into the facility. We are always here to serve your needs any way we can.

## Support from the Community
We are thankful for the support of the Community, from donations of face shields to meals provided to our front line personnel. It really takes all of us to get through this adversity.

![LIFE SAVING GEAR](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=LIFE+SAVING+GEAR)

**a. Ambulance ≈ $215,000**  
Also known as a "medic", this apparatus is normally staffed with 2 firefighter/paramedics or EMT.

**b. Additional PPE**  
During this COVID-19 pandemic, masks, face shields and disposable gowns are added to the safety gear already worn by the paramedic.

**c. Blue Medic bag ≈ $1,000**  
This bag is essential and includes over 100 medical supplies that may be needed for Advanced Life Support (ALS).

**d. Automated Chest Compression device ≈ $13,400**  
Also known as a “Lucas device”, this provides continuous, uninterrupted chest compressions on a cardiac arrest patient, and allows the paramedic to tend to other patient needs.

**e. Cardiac Heart monitor ≈ $86,600**  
Also known as a “defibrillator”, this is used to restore a normal heartbeat by sending a shock (electric pulse) to the heart.

**f. Motorized Gurney ≈ $25,500**  
This gurney safely locks into the medic's floor, and expands and contracts the legs and wheels of the gurney by motor. This reduces the risk of back injuries to paramedics and ensures safe transport of the patient.

---

**Did you know?**  
Firefighters have a device attached to their SCBA pack called a PASS which stands for Personal Alert Safety System. It can be triggered manually, or if a firefighter becomes immobile for a certain amount of time, automatically. It emits a highly visible light and loud audio tones to pinpoint the firefighter's location.

| **Total Revenues**    | **$237,920** | **$235,257** |

---

**Where the Money Came From**  
Property tax revenue is the main source of Metro Fire's funding and provides support for its fire suppression activities. For every dollar paid by a resident in Metro Fire's jurisdiction, about 21.68 cents go to Metro Fire.

- **21.68% Metro Fire**
- **78.32% to Sac County and other agencies**

The average assessed value of a detached single-family residential home in Metro Fire's jurisdiction is $258,429, which means that a homeowner typically contributes about $560 per year in property taxes to Metro Fire.

During the most recent recession, annual property taxes declined from a peak of $129 million to $105 million in 2012/13. Since then, assessed property values experienced seven straight years of growth. In the current fiscal year, property taxes were at $160 million, an increase of close to 7% from last year.

While management expects to see modest growth in property taxes, it continues to find ways to lessen its fiscal dependency on property tax revenues. These efforts successfully yielded better cost recovery on its emergency medical services. As can be seen on the graph above, property taxes contributed 80% of total funding sources ten years ago compared to 67% today. Charges for services and other revenues now amount to $67 million in the current fiscal year.

**2020**  
**$237M**  
- **Property Taxes 67%**  
- **Charges for Services 28%**

![Where the Money Went](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Where+the+Money+Went)

**EXPENSES**

As a public safety provider, the majority of Metro Fire's operating expense relates to personnel costs, which comprise about 80% of total expenses. The 11% or $18.8 million increase is mainly due to an increase in the estimates for Metro Fire's obligation for post-retirement pension benefits.

The other significant expense is services and supplies which comprise about 14%. The $2.6 million increase is due to several factors including higher insurance costs, vehicle maintenance, dispatch fees, and the purchase of new fire equipment supplies and turnouts.

Metro Fire begins its budget process in Spring each year and adopts a preliminary budget in June, a final budget in September, and a mid-year adjustment. The overriding goals of each budget process is to optimize services to the greatest extent possible, ensuring that the ongoing all-risk fire, rescue and emergency medical needs of the citizens are met, and to provide adequate reserves for future contingencies.

The District’s reserve policy calls for a minimum of 15% of budgeted General Fund operating expenditures to be set aside to cover unexpected costs or revenue shortfalls.

# CAPITAL SPENDING

Investing in reliable firefighting apparatus is a crucial step in building a better fire service. Not only does each apparatus have to be maintained in the highest state of readiness to respond to emergencies, it must also take advantage of better technology that will allow efficient and safe operation.

Taking into account the operational needs, current fleet status, and available resources, Metro Fire invested in the following significant capital assets in the most recent year:

- **171 SCBA PACKS** ($2.7 million)  
  The self contained breathing apparatus provides breathable air to a firefighter while in areas filled with smoke, toxic gas or other contaminants immediately dangerous to life and health.

- **3 TYPE I ENGINES** ($2.1 million)  
  These engines hold 700 gallons of water and have a larger pump to provide higher water flows for fighting structure fires. These engines are the most common engines at Metro Fire with up to 36 in service daily wide.

- **2 WATER TENDERS** ($882,000)  
  Transporting more than 2,000 gallons of water, these are mainly used to fight fires in rural areas where there are no working fire hydrants within reach.

- **1 FIRE STATION** ($397,000 spent in FY2020)  
  Groundbreaking on new Station 68 located in the Anatolia area, within the City of Rancho Cordova.

In the upcoming year, the following are the significant planned acquisitions:

- **1 FIRE STATION** ($7 million)  
  Continued construction of the new Station 68 located in the Anatolia area, within the City of Rancho Cordova.

- **3 TYPE I ENGINES** ($2.1 million)

- **2 TYPE V ENGINES** ($420,000)  
  This is a smaller 4-seater off-road unit to fight brush fires. It has the ability to pump while moving and a water capacity of 400 gallons. It runs in tandem with a Type I fire engine. One Firefighter drives the Type V while the Captain and Engineer ride in the bigger Type I engine while going together on a call.

- **6 TYPE III AMBULANCES** ($1.3 million)  
  These smaller ambulances will be replacing the older, larger and more expensive models. These new units have increased fuel economy, longer service intervals, and a lower initial cost.

- **1 AIR UNIT** ($620,000)  
  This apparatus is designed to fill the new higher pressure SCBAs and carry rehabilitation equipment for firefighter recovery during fires.

# DEBT SERVICE

Metro Fire uses debt to spread the cost of larger purchases over time. Metro Fire’s debt policy requires that the maturity of a debt issue be consistent with the economic or useful life of the asset being financed, generally level annual debt service payments, and preferences for fixed interest rates and optional redemption at a reasonable call date. This policy prohibits the issuance of long-term debt to fund District operating costs.

## Future Debt Payments

![Future Debt Payments Chart](attachment)

- **Pension Bonds**
- **Capital Lease Financing**
- **Lease Revenue Bonds**

Metro Fire has three major debt types: pension bonds, lease revenue bonds, and capital equipment financing. Pension bond proceeds were used to reduce the unfunded actuarial liabilities of its pension plans. The lease revenue bonds were used to purchase the headquarters building, building improvements, and fire-fighting and computer equipment. Proceeds of capital equipment financing are used mainly for ongoing apparatus and equipment needs.

## AA

Metro Fire’s  
S&P Global Credit Rating  
Indicates an extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments on its pension bonds.
