# OPERATIONS REPORT – (Deputy Chief Mitchell)

1. **EMS Summit**
   - County LEMSA Medical Director Dr. Kann hosted the APOT Summit #2 here in our Boardroom on Thursday, October 3rd.
   - It was well attended by LEMSA Staff, County Supervisor Hume, EMS and Fire agencies, and hospital staff and administration.
   - Chief Rudnicki and EMS staff were recognized as leaders in the area of APOT reduction.
   - Multiple presentations done, highlighting what processes hospitals have implemented to positively impact wait time process and reduce wall times significantly towards the standard.
   - The County is still not at the standard of 20 minutes; however, there is an upcoming Board of Supervisors meeting in early November that will address this issue. The ask is for a large amount of attendance at this meeting to support Dr. Kann in keeping the standard at 20 minutes.

2. **Statewide Responses This Year**
   - Our members support our community through highly skilled and professional emergency response day in and day out. Responding when our local community calls is always our primary focus.
   - It is also important to note that in addition to the service delivery our members provide locally, we also answer the call when our neighbors throughout the state and country are in need.
   - This year, here is the support we have provided so far in 2024:
     - **Total Deployments:** 29
       - OEST1-7
       - OES T3-8
       - Preposition-1
       - FEMA-1
       - Single Resource/IMT Team-12
     - Responded to 25 different incidents in CA, 1 in OR, and 1 in FL
     - 130 single resource positions deployed
     - Average days deployed = 10
     - 12 deployments lasted 14 or more days.
     - And all of those members deployed are backfilled by those still here at home to ensure our stations are covered.

   - One final note. It is a little-known fact that when catastrophic wildfire incidents occur, well over 50% of the resources that respond to both state and federal incidents are provided by local government fire agencies like Metro Fire. We are the backbone of the system that provides emergency incident mitigation alongside our state and federal partners, and I'm extremely proud of Metro Fire and the role we play in the local, regional, statewide and federal system.

Tonight, we welcome one of our citizens, Mr. Brian Norwood who is joining us with his spouse, Jennifer to share an impactful story of how Metro Fire’s actions contributed to a lifesaving event.

**Adam A. House**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** December 12, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Revision of Board Policy  
Policy 01.003.08 - Family and Medical Leave  

**TOPIC**  
Adopt the proposed changes to the current 01.003.08 Board Policy regarding Family and Medical Leave.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Attached is the Family and Medical Leave Policy that was reviewed by the Policy Committee on November 14, 2024. The revisions to the policy include an expansion to the list of qualified persons under the California Family Rights Act (CFRA) to cover a "Designated Person". A Designated Person is identified as any individual related by blood or whose association with the employee is equivalent of a family relationship.  

While incorporating these revisions into the Family and Medical Leave Policy, the District was also undergoing a review of its Sick Leave Policy, 02.015.03 at the same time. There were extensive changes to the laws regarding sick leave that needed to be addressed within the District's Sick Leave policy. Because sick leave is also addressed within the Family and Medical Leave Policy, these updates needed to be incorporated into it as well. The original Family and Medical Leave Policy with the tracked changes is attached for your review and mirrors the updated information outlined within the Sick Leave Policy reviewed by the Policy Committee in May of this year.  

Additionally, at the beginning of 2024, SB-848 was introduced in California to provide employees with additional protected leave after a reproductive loss event. This Reproductive Loss Leave (RLL) can be utilized in addition to FMLA/CFRA protected leave and Pregnancy Disability Leave (PDL). The specific circumstances for requesting and utilizing Reproductive Loss Leave are outlined in the revised Family and Medical Leave Policy.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Recommend the Board of Directors approve the revisions to the Family and Medical Leave Policy.  

**Submitted By:**  
Melisa Maddux  
Chief Human Resources Officer  

**Approved By:**  
Michael Johnson  
Interim Deputy Chief, Administration

**Background**  
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) is required by law to comply with the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 and its additional treatment under the California Family Rights Act (CFRA), the National Defense Authorization Act of 2008 (NDAA), and the Pregnancy Disability Leave Act (PDL), and SB-848 Leave for Reproductive Loss (RLL). The FMLA/CFRA/PDL/RLL leaves are unpaid, and provide employment protection to qualified employees who take leave for qualified family or medical conditions.

**Purpose**  
To comply with the FMLA/CFRA/PDL/RLL, and to provide policy and procedure for employees to request such leave.

**Scope**  
This policy applies to all District employees.

**Definitions**  
1. **Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA):** United States federal law requiring covered employers to provide employees job-protected and unpaid leave for qualified medical and family reasons. Qualified medical and family reasons include: personal or family illness, family military leave, pregnancy, adoption, or the foster care placement of a child.

2. **California Family Rights Act (CFRA):** State law that was enacted from the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. The same qualifications and requirements apply, except that Domestic Partnerships and Designated Persons are recognized under CFRA, and not under FMLA. In order to claim CFRA for a domestic partner, a couple must have had previously filed a Declaration of Domestic Partnership with the California Secretary of State. A Designated Person is defined as any individual related by blood or whose association with the employee is equivalent of a family relationship. Reasons for leave are serious personal health issues, the care of a seriously ill child, sibling, parent, grandparent, grandchild, spouse, domestic partner, or designated person the care of a child, spouse, or parents with a serious health condition, or the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child. Additionally, leave to care for a grandparent, grandchild, sibling, parent-in-law, registered domestic partner, or "designated person" with a serious health condition is only available under the CFRA. A Designated Person is defined as any individual related by blood or whose association with the employee is equivalent of a family relationship.

**DATE:** December 12, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Vacancies on Deferred Compensation Committee  

**TOPIC**  
Two vacancies exist on the Deferred Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors appoints members to this Committee upon recommendation of the Committee.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The Board of Directors has approved a plan to provide employees an opportunity to participate in a voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan. Deferred Compensation, under the Internal Revenue Code 457, is a tax deferred supplemental retirement program that allows employees to contribute a portion of their salary to a retirement account, before federal and state taxes are deducted. The administrator of the Plan is a nine member committee appointed by the Board of Directors, comprised of employees, active and retired, who are participants in the Deferred Compensation Plan.  

The Deferred Compensation Committee is responsible for the administration of the Deferred Compensation Plan in accordance with rules and regulations of Internal Revenue Code 457. Committee members are charged with the maintenance and oversight of the Plan. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to, evaluation of services provided by the Third-Party Administrator and performance of Investment Providers in addition to remaining informed on regulations related to Internal Revenue Code 457.  

There are two vacancies on the committee due to the resignations of Retired Captain Randy Johnson and Captain Trevor Jamison. The committee voted unanimously to nominate Engineer Cardiff Schmitz and Human Resources Analyst Michelle Dehoney. The committee believes that Engineer Schmitz and Human Resources Analyst Dehoney are the best people to join the committee, from among a very good pool of qualified candidates applying for the position. The committee would also like to publicly acknowledge all of Mr. Johnson and Captain Jamison’s hard work on the committee over the years.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
The Deferred Compensation Committee recommends that the Board of Directors adopt a Resolution appointing Cardiff Schmitz and Michelle Dehoney to the Deferred Compensation Committee.
