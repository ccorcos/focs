that we are investing in our members' health and wellness and, for this particular screening, not only bring awareness about skin cancer but potentially lifesaving information.

With health and wellness as a priority for labor and management, I am happy to pass along that Chief Cole, Captain Votava, and I visited Phoenix Fire Department’s Health & Wellness Center last week. The visit went very well, and this collaboration will continue to be a priority for not only me but for the Board, Labor, and throughout the department. During our visit, we were able to tour the center during operating hours and have in-depth conversations with department leadership about their program and available resources, program successes and challenges, and future expansion. The information we obtained will be extremely valuable in future discussions about wellness services and cancer screening the District may offer, as well as other services to be explored.

## OPERATIONS REPORT – (Deputy Chief Mitchell)

1. **Shift Commander Spotlight**

   Assistant Chief Joe Fiorica in the Operations Branch assigned as the A Shift Commander. Tonight, I would like to highlight the level of professionalism and training that we expect from our members.

   On February 10th, Engine 110 and Medic 105 responded to a report of an unresponsive male. When Engine 110 arrived, they found an unresponsive male on the ground being assisted by three bystanders.

   I have the crew from Engine 110 here to introduce themselves and tell you a bit more about this incident.

   Engine 110 and the crew were only 1 part of this life-saving effort that resulted in a successful outcome for the patient. Medic 105 and three civilians also played key roles in the overall care of this patient. We will be recognizing their part in this success story as they are available.

2. **20 Year Pin Presentation**

   - Chief Rudnicki was presented with his 20-year pin.

### CRRD:
- On February 21st staff from CRRD & the FIU conducted a joint code enforcement inspection with the Sacramento Sheriff’s Office and Sacramento County Tax Collection & Licensing Division at a hair accessories business on Sky Pkwy in South Sacramento. The agencies were acting on a tip received by CRRD regarding illegal sale of fireworks from the business. Personnel arrived to find an assortment of fireworks with counterfeit safe and sane seals on offer at the front door to the store. The fireworks were confiscated and booked as evidence by the Sheriff’s Office. Correction notices were issued for a multitude of California Fire Code violations & business licensing issues, and local agencies will continue to work with the business owner to achieve compliance. CRRD will be working with our PIO on messaging to remind the community and business owners that in the unincorporated area of Sacramento County it is unlawful to possess, sell, use, display or discharge “safe and sane” fireworks outside of the time period beginning at 12:00 on June 28 and ending at 10:00 p.m. on July 5th. It is also unlawful for any person to sell “safe and sane” fireworks without a valid County business license authorizing such sales. Finally, California has a zero-tolerance policy for the sale and use of illegal fireworks. Anything that goes up in the air, travels or explodes is illegal and dangerous.
