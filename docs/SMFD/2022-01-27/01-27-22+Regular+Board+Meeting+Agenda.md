The mission of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District is to provide professional and compassionate protection, education and service to our community.

The Governor has declared a State of Emergency to exist in California as a result of the threat of COVID-19 (aka the “Coronavirus”). The Governor issued Executive Order N-25-20 and N-29-20, which directs Californians to follow public health directives including canceling large gatherings. Per the State of Emergency effective March 2, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District proclaimed that a local emergency exists, and authorized remote teleconference meetings from January 5, 2022 through February 4, 2022 pursuant to Brown Act provisions.

Additionally, on January 6, 2022, the Health Officer of the County of Sacramento ordered all public meetings in the County to occur virtually until further notice, and encouraged workplaces to conduct meetings remotely as business needs permit.
