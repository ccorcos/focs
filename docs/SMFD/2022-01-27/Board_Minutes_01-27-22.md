## ACTION SUMMARY MINUTES – REGULAR MEETING

### BOARD OF DIRECTORS  
SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN FIRE DISTRICT  
Thursday, January 27, 2022  
Remotely Via Zoom

---

### CALL TO ORDER
The meeting was called to order at 5:03 pm by President Saylors. Board members present: Clark, Goold, Jones, Kelly, Saylors, Sheetz, White, and Wood. Board members absent: Orzalli. Staff present: Chief Harms, General Counsel Lavra, and Clerk Penilla.

### PUBLIC COMMENT:
Vice President of Local 522, Matt Cole told a story of a seven year veteran with Local 1775 who came to Metro Fire as a lateral. He has a wife and two children and lives in the Sacramento area. He took a leap of faith coming to Metro Fire, and a 20% pay cut. He had a great on boarding experience and a wonderful crew. Once on line, he realized he was spending even less time with his family, sleeping more because he was more fatigued, and was becoming snappy with his wife and children when he was home. This lateral employee, which is Metro Fire’s target recruit, is returning to his previous agency. He decided he wanted his story to be different, and is going back. Right now, every division at Metro Fire is getting crushed. We need great people, just like this, to come to Metro Fire, but we also need our current employees to want to come to work and that takes us locking arms and working together.

REPORTS  
1. PRESIDENT’S REPORT—(President Saylors)  
   President Saylors, along with Directors White and Clark, and Executive Staff attended the public hearing at the Capital where they heard both sides related to the Ambulance Patient Offload Delays. The hearing experts were previous EMS employees who are aware of these existing problems and adhering to the laws surrounding offload delays. Many solutions were offered during the presentations and the link to watch the hearing is publically available.  

2. FIRE CHIEF'S REPORT—(Fire Chief Harms)  
   Chief Harms shared that many conversations are now taking place as a result of the wall-time news stories. We are taking these conversations as a win and moving forward.  

   On January 26th the Labor Management Collaboration Meeting took place via Zoom and was a very productive working meeting.  

   Chief Harms invited Deputy Chief Wagaman to share an update on facilities, specifically the recent stations that underwent a bathroom remodel. Facilities Manager, John Raeside, joined and shared details on the remodels at Stations 21, 41, and 53 which are now complete. Station 23 presents challenges due to age and the small footprint, as a temporary fix they will be purchasing a modular for two additional bathrooms and a shower.  

   Chief Harms also invited DC Bailey to report out on the compensation survey of unrepresented personnel. DC Bailey shared that Human Resources solicited bids from several firms, they chose the firm from Folsom which was also the lowest bid. The company anticipates the survey

will take approximately 160 hours, and will be complete in 6-8 weeks dependent upon COVID working conditions. DC Bailey is hopeful it will be completed in mid-late March.

Lastly, Chief Harris invited Firefighter Tim White to report on recruitment efforts. Firefighter White is now full time working days, and his primary focus is to identify and define pathways into the fire service, for example the pathway available through the paramedic program that was talked about earlier this evening. He is also working on the marketing presence at job fairs, having a recruitment website, and building out the mentorship program.

Chief Harris reminded everyone of the Fill the Boot, especially the Chief's Challenge which takes place on Saturday, February 5th from 9:00-10:00 a.m. at the corner of Greenback and Sunrise in Citrus Heights.

Director Kelly left the meeting at 9:41 PM.

**OPERATIONS’ REPORT – (DC Mitchell)**  
Deputy Chief Mitchell reported on the current COVID numbers, currently there are 55 members off, with 46 COVID positive cases. Of the 55 members off 47 are line personnel. This is a significant decrease from almost 120 members off just a short time ago. Trending in a promising direction, however we remain diligent and have limited District activities at least until February 7th to essential items only. As for our internal testing, our members have performed just under 3,000 tests since pandemic began. This is a huge value to our members, cooperators, and their families.

DC Mitchell shares we are working towards Telestaff returning to full functionality on February 7th with a phased in approach starting February 2nd. He is very proud of the collective effort to get us through this unexpected staffing program failure, and our member’s ability to adapt has been remarkable. As a reminder, a team fully rebuilt a google docs staffing program within hours of the failure that allowed us to continue operations and staffing procedures to provide service delivery and accountability for our stations and apparatus.

Lastly, DC Mitchell shared statistics since the last Board Meeting with 3,825 total incidents since which is approximately 273 calls per day. 70% were EMS related incidents, and 143 were fire incidents which is an average of 10 fires per day.

**3. SMFD – FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL 522 REPORT**  
Vice President of Local 522, Matt Cole shared that Engine 23 traveled down to Southern California for Firefighter Flagler’s service, and thanked the crew for representing labor and management.

He shared of several upcoming events, including the memorial service for Retired Captain Jeff Ramsdell on Friday, January 28, 2022 at Noon, and celebration of life for Retired Firefighter Roger Dyer on Sunday, February 20, 2022 at 2:00 p.m., Fill-the-Boot next weekend, and on Wednesday a retiree breakfast at the IHOP in Folsom.

VP Cole thanked the Board for sending an observer to the negotiations table.

Lastly, VP Cole shared several meeting he has attended, including the public hearing on wall-time, being sworn in for the Executive Board, Labor Management Collaboration meeting,
