Once the students have their state paramedic licenses, they can apply for the Sacramento County Accreditation Orientation which is next scheduled for February 7th. Chief Harms will have a full presentation on this program at the next Board Meeting.  

On January 12th we sent a video message to members, including an update on staffing and impacts to the District and its members due to COVID, update on TeleStaff, reminder for annual Donated Leave, and many other updates. We will make sure the Board receives a copy of this video as well.  

Lastly, Chief Harms thanked CFO O'Toole and the Finance Division for their continued excellent work. He also thanked professional staff and all members who are out on the streets. You are doing a tremendous job caring for people.  

OPERATIONS’ REPORT – (DC Mitchell)  
COVID Update  
Deputy Chief Mitchell gave a report on COVID. The recent spike has hit us hard, however our numbers are in alignment with partner agencies. As of tonight there are 97 total members off, 90 are line personnel, with 74 being COVID positive. There are about 30 line members per shift, so it is spread evenly throughout. These are the highest numbers since the start of the pandemic.  

To help stop the spread of this very contagious variant we continue to follow CDC, CDPH, SCPH, and SCEMSA direction and protocols, conducting only necessary station activities, utilizing best practices for cleaning and disinfecting all facilities within the District, using decon by foggers when defined benchmarks are reached that indicate a hot spot in the stations.  

Staffing Update  
We are continuing to brown out companies per the Emergency Staffing Plan. Shift Commanders are working with staffers to adapt to every situation, and we have close communication with Labor. We also worked with labor and will be moving up the engineer's exam to February

(currently 22 short). There are plans to meet with Labor on February 2nd to discuss 522's proposal to develop a plan for qualifying firefighters to work as engineers.

Additionally, lateral firefighters from 21-2 are finishing up their ride-along time to be counted as full staffing. Academy 22-1 will begin in late February and will include the 21 SAFER firefighter positions.

Lastly, an update on Telestaff that went down on December 11th, affecting almost all divisions especially, operations, payroll, and human resources. We quickly developed a plan to stand up google docs and has been very successful thus far. We are on a path for getting back with the vendor, current timeline is by the end of the month. The resiliency of our members through this unexpected added challenge is remarkable.

**Wall Time Update**  
Ambulance patient offload time (APOT) is an ongoing system wide issue that we have been dealing with for a number of years. It has been exacerbated by this recent COVID surge. We are working very closely with our partner fire and county agencies.

On January 3, SCEMSA deactivated hospital initiated Emergency Department ambulance diversion for emergency department (ED) over-crowding for a minimum of two weeks. SCEMSA is holding weekly calls on EMS system status and the deactivation of hospital initiated diversion for all interested stakeholders.

Fire Chiefs, Ops Chiefs, and EMS Chiefs continue to work on strategies to improve hospital bed delays, and the following actions have been taken:

- Developed and implanted an ambulance draw down plan County wide last year
- Stopped all ambulance move-ups in County system last year
- Regular meetings with SCEMSA, hospital executives, and Chiefs to update on situation status and collaborative mitigation actions

On 01/07/2022 the 9-1-1 system reached ambulance level 0 due to extended wall times across the county, the following actions were taken:

- SCEMSA Duty Officer contacted
- The same day we placed a resource request for medical cots in area EDs. Sac OES accessed the shelter cache & was able to provide 40 medical cots, 10 to each hospital (UCD, SMC, KHS, MSJ). Metro EMS Chief & SFD EMS Chief contacted Emergency Department Managers to facilitate delivery of the cots and gain buy in for their use in consolidating patients in the ER to get ambulances back into the system
- EMS24 and Battalion Chiefs are being deployed to area EDs to offer assistance getting hospital gurneys moved to the ED and to advocate for patient consolidation
- Metro Fire’s PIO engaged with local media outlets to discuss the EMS system impacts of hospital bed delays & educate the public on appropriate use of the ER and 911 system

Additionally, seven area hospitals submitted a request through the MHOAC for paramedics that will deploy to EDs to manage patients on hospital bed delay and act as nurse extenders. The state approved all resource requests, and medics will arrive next week. The county is building

out the medical surge plan and adding a total of 200 in-patient beds at 4 area hospitals. This is expected to be completed next week. Lastly, as President Saylors mentioned on January 19th, reps from all regional fire agencies will be attending a Senate Oversight Hearing on ambulance patient offload delays.

**Statistics**  
Since our last report on December 9, 2021 there have been a total of 10,843 total incidents, which is about 318 calls per day (up nearly 25%). 68% were EMS related incidents, and there were 255 fire incidents, an average of 7.5 calls per day.

3. **SMFD – FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL 522 REPORT** – (BC Matt Cole, Local 522 Vice President)  
Vice President Cole began with a moment of silence honoring Firefighter Jonathan Flagler of LA County, who passed away on January 6th after battling a house fire. He is survived by his wife and two children.

VP Cole welcomes the new mechanic Brandon Christian.

Plans for a fourth shift representative to be added for additional support are underway. He is glad the engineer’s test has been moved up, and reports there to be 38 people studying to take it. He also thanked DC Mitchell for his Operation Report and appreciates all the times it was mentioned that we are working with labor.

4. **COMMITTEE AND DELEGATE REPORTS**  
All Committee Meetings will be held at the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District Board Room,  
10545 Armstrong Avenue, Mather, California unless otherwise specified.

A. **Executive Committee** – (President Saylors)  
Report Out: January 13, 2022 at 5:30 PM  
President Saylors reports out the Executive Committee met earlier this evening and the only change being made was to the Finance and Audit Committee, Director Clark will now be the alternate.

B. **Communications Center JPA** – (DC Wagaman)  
Report Out: January 11, 2022 at 9:00 AM  
Deputy Chief Wagaman takes a moment to thank his Metro Fire family and the Board of Directors for their thoughts and prayers during a very difficult time in his life. It is humbling and truly special to be part of such an amazing organization.

DC Wagaman gave a report out from the recent Comms Center meeting, sharing that the new Executive Director will be Deputy Chief Troy Bair from Cosumnes Fire Department, pending the approval of his Board. Also, DC Wagaman will serve as chair, with DC Wilson from Folsom Fire serving as vice chair, for 2022.

**TODD HARMS**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** January 27, 2022  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Emergency Ambulance Surge Protection Agreement  

**TOPIC**  
Staff seeks the Board of Directors’ approval of an emergency ambulance surge protection agreement.  

**SUMMARY**  
In an effort to improve and maintain the number of ambulances available to respond in our 911 system, an emergency ambulance surge protection agreement is needed to provide additional ambulance response capability during times of acute surge in call volume. Sacramento’s emergency healthcare delivery system is experiencing unprecedented stress, driven by an Omicron COVID patient surge, higher non-COVID hospital census than at previous times during the pandemic, increasing ED overcrowding, staffing shortages, and significant COVID infections in the EMS and healthcare workforces.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The EMS system is experiencing increased call volume and an unprecedented rise in hospital bed delays, with corresponding increases in response times and Unit Hour Utilization (UHU) for our ambulances. In recent weeks we have been activating all of our in-service reserve medics, exhausting additional surge coverage from American Medical Response (AMR), and requested mutual aid resources from local private ambulance companies because all of our surge capacity was engaged on incidents.  

Projections from Sacramento County Public Health (SCPH) and Sacramento County Emergency Medical Services Agency (SCEMSA) are that the current surge will continue for several weeks. Prolonged ambulance patient offload times are drastically impacting our ability to keep medic units available in the system. Since January 8, 2022 at 1100 hours, The Sacramento Regional Fire & EMS Communication Center has been operating at Level 2 of the Medic Draw Down Plan (15 medics in the system) and not dispatching medic units to Alpha, Omega or Bravo level or staging calls. Advanced Life Support (ALS) first responder units are dispatched and determine the need for a medic unit after arrival on scene.

**SUBJECT:** 0 Watt Avenue, North Highlands (Watt/Myrtle) – Easements  
**APN:** 240-0660-010 and 240-0660-011  

---

**BACKGROUND**  
The County of Sacramento (County) is moving forward with approved plans for the Watt Avenue Complete Street Improvements Project (Project). The project will widen the roadway to accommodate new bike lanes, new separated or attached sidewalk, bus turnouts, and a landscaped median from I-80 to Roseville Road. The Project also includes traffic signal modifications, signal interconnect, ADA improvements and a new rubberized asphalt concrete (AC) overlay. A new concrete path and crosswalk will also be installed to connect Watt Avenue to Orange Grove Avenue.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The County desires to acquire an Easement for Public Roadway and Public Utilities, Easement for Public Utilities and Public Facilities, and Easement for Temporary Construction across a portion of real property owned by the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) located at 0 Watt Avenue, North Highlands, California, 95660 (Property) which is required for the Project. The required Property is approximately a 286-ft portion of the Watt Avenue frontage, totaling approximately 3,375 sf. The County completed a third party appraisal of the County’s interest in the Property and has submitted an offer to the District.  

Staff has evaluated the County’s offer and its impact on the District’s operational and financial needs and has determined that it is in the best interest of the District to accept the County’s offer and approve the request. Since the Property is vacant, the District does not anticipate any operational impact.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The County has offered $54,000 for its interest in the District’s Property.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends that the Board approve the attached Resolution to grant the requested Easement for Public Roadway and Public Utilities, Easement for Public Utilities and Public Facilities, and Easement for Temporary Construction.

1. **Accepted Delivery of Easements and TCE**  
   County shall not accept delivery of the Easements and the TCE until such time as the Easements are recorded in the Official Records of the County of Sacramento, California. County shall pay all costs of escrow and recording fees incurred in this transaction. The TCE shall not be recorded.

2. **Purchase Price and Escrow**  
   County shall place into Escrow the sum of $54,000.00, (hereinafter referred to as "Purchase Price"), for the Easements and the TCE, which the parties agree includes all improvements, damages, and severance. The escrow agent shall deliver the Purchase Price to Owner when title to the Easements vests in the County free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, assessments, easements, and leases (recorded and/or unrecorded), and taxes as indicated on the Escrow Instructions.

3. **Payment of Mortgage or Deed of Trust**  
   Upon demand by any mortgagee under a mortgage or beneficiary under a deed of trust or lien holder with a lien recorded against the Owner’s property, made in writing to County prior to the close of Escrow, County may make payable to the mortgagee, beneficiary or lien holder entitled thereunder, an amount not to exceed the Purchase Price under this Agreement.

   Owner agrees that County and its authorized agents or contractors may enter upon the Owner’s land described herein for purposes of performing activities related to and incidental to the construction of the Project, inclusive of the right to remove and dispose of any improvements, prior to the Owner receiving the Purchase Price.

9. RE-CONSTRUCTION OF OWNER’S REMAINDER PROPERTY.  
County and its authorized agents and contractors are hereby granted permission to enter onto Owner’s remainder property to reconstruct Owner’s driveways, walkways, and appurtenant areas as necessary to conform to Project improvements. The cost of such re-construction of the Owner’s remainder property shall be borne by County. Owner is responsible for the reconstruction of all landscape areas, including regrading and replanting any affected lawn and landscaped areas and repair and/or replacement of irrigation systems for which Owner has been compensated.

10. LEASE WARRANTY.  
Owner warrants there are no oral or written leases on any portion of the Property exceeding a period of one month, excepting that/those made known to the County as of the date of this Agreement.

11. COUNTY’S USE AND LIABILITY.  
County agrees to release Owner from any liability arising from the County exercising its rights under this Agreement. Furthermore, County agrees to assume responsibility for any damages to Owner’s property, other than the above mentioned landscaped areas, caused by reason of the County’s use of the Easements and TCE under this Agreement and will, at County’s option, either repair or pay for such damage.

12. GOVERNING LAW/SEVERABILITY.  
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California. If any provision in this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force without being impaired.

13. PUBLIC PURPOSE.  
Both Owner and County agree that County requires the Easements and TCE, which is not now appropriated to a public use, for the Project and County can acquire the Property through the exercise of the power of eminent domain. Both Owner and County recognize the expense, time, effort and risk to both Owner and County in failing to resolve a dispute over compensation for the Easements and TCE by eminent domain litigation; and therefore the parties agree that the compensation set forth herein is in compromise and settlement in lieu of such litigation.

**TODD HARMS**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** January 27, 2022  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Notice of Award – Stryker (AFG20 Automated Chest Compression Devices)  

**BACKGROUND**  
On September 23, 2021, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District’s (District) Board of Directors accepted a FY2020 Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) award in the amount of $3,299,995 for the replacement of 90 cardiac monitor/defibrillators that are obsolete and beyond their useful and serviceable life. Subsequently, the District received approval of an award amendment to add the replacement of 12 automatic chest compression devices to the award’s scope of work. This amendment was made possible through cost savings realized on the purchase of the cardiac monitor/defibrillators.

**DISCUSSION**  
In an effort to maximize cost savings, the District intends to utilize a master cooperative purchasing agreement administered by the Savvik Buying Group through a host public agency. The Savvik Buying Group is a non-profit organization that serves the public safety sector by contracting for public safety equipment, supplies, and services through a full and fair competitive bidding or quotation process, ensuring the best pricing on quality products and services. As a member of the Savvik Buying Group, the District is able to utilize contracts that have been competitively bid through this process and obtain the contracted pricing discounts. Utilizing these types of contracts saves the District time and money, while still meeting all competitive bidding requirements.

On August 19, 2021, host public agency Eagle County Health Service District issued a Request for Bid (RFB) for Resuscitation Devices (PSAI RFB #2021-06) and received responses from four vendors for automatic chest compression devices. A public bid opening was conducted and an evaluation was completed of all responses. The bid was awarded to all four vendors and competitive pricing is available to members of the Savvik Buying Group for all four products.

The District currently deploys Stryker’s LUCAS 2 Chest Compression System and the EMS Division has identified Stryker’s LUCAS 3 Chest Compression System as its desired replacement unit, of the four products available. The choice to stay with Stryker’s LUCAS unit is based on identified cost savings and operational efficiencies. District personnel are already trained on the proper use and care of Stryker’s LUCAS unit, which will save training time and result in faster deployment of the new units. Stryker also offers a trade-in credit for existing units, further reducing the cost per unit. Additionally, the District already has an existing inventory of peripheral supplies and accessories that are compatible with the desired unit, saving the District the cost of replacing that inventory of supplies.

# FISCAL IMPACT
The total cost for the automatic chest compression device replacement project is $177,131, which is included in the recently amended Fiscal Year 2021/22 Final Budget.

# RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends the Board approve the purchase of 12 LUCAS 3 Chest Compression Systems from Stryker, by utilizing a master cooperative purchasing agreement (RFB #2021-06) administered by the Savvik Buying Group.

It should be noted that Longyear & Lavra, LLP changed firm name to remove Attorney O'Dea, as he is now retired. Additionally, the Miller & Owen Firm has merged with another firm under a new name. Miller & Owen, nor the newly merged firm, has not been used for several years, and is therefore being removed from the list of current firms. These changes are reflected on the resolution currently presented for approval.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Staff anticipates significant cost savings and continued administrative efficiency by extending the Multiple Award Schedule for legal services.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff respectfully recommends the Board adopt the attached Resolution.
