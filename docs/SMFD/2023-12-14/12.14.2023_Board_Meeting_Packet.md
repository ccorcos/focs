OPERATIONS REPORT – (Deputy Chief Mitchell)  
1. Squad 61 Update  
   - Happy to report that we continue towards reaching our goal of opening an additional first responder, Squad 61, on or before November 15th.  
   - This will allow us to continue expand upon the great work that Squad 24 has done in proving the concept and the value to our community.  
   - We are also working on developing the plan for further expansion of this program, as well as a number of other programs (i.e. BLS ambulances, Telemedicine, and MIH), in alignment with the Board’s strategic plan. Finishing the Standard of Cover is a key component of this process, which allows us to make data driven, responsible, and sustainable decisions for service delivery that benefit our members and the community we serve.  

2. Wildland Season  
   - Due to weather, we've been experiencing, the long term outlooks and forecasts, and fuel moistures, Metro Fire and all of our partners in the County will be transitioning out of peak wildland season at 0800 on November 1st. The dozer will move to a call when needed status, as will Air Operations when the division returns to an available status.  
   - Dispatch levels will move to a decreased winter response.  

3. CERT Update  
   - CERT basic ends this Saturday, we have 26 students that will complete the course, and are looking forward to adding all 26 participants to our CERT ranks. Advanced CERT training will take place over the coming months.

- This group will take us to approximately 45 members, and is the largest group we've seen since COVID.

4. Crew Highlight
- Back on October 13th, our members received a unique request through Joe Pick of the Burn Institute. He asked if we had the ability to offer some help to a FF from Bend, Oregon. This FF was traveling in an RV with his wife to Sacramento to be with his mother. She had been admitted to the UCD Medical Center with severe traumatic injuries following a vehicle accident that took his father’s life.
- I’m proud to report that the crew at Station 62 were contacted that day and happily stepped up to the plate.
- When the FF and his wife arrived at 62, the crew fed them dinner and provided transportation to UCD to get him there to see his mother prior to visiting hours ending.
- Although they are not present this evening, I am incredibly proud and honored to recognize E62 Captain Mike Rowan (CB), Eng. Chris Botto, and FF Ryan McClain and M62 FF Alexander Pibl and FF Wayne Horton for their kindness and compassion. And a big thank you to BC Chris Vestal and AC Joe Fiorica for their support of the plan.
- This event highlights the great men and women we have, and reinforces their dedication to serve others and the camaraderie that is the fabric of Metro Fire and the fire service as a whole.

d. On Tuesday of this week, Battalion Chief Scott Perryman and Dr. Kann made a joint presentation to the County Board of Supervisors to provide an update on activities and accomplishments regarding Ambulance Patient Offload Time and Metro Fire’s Mobile Integrated Healthcare program.

ADMINISTRATIVE REPORT – (PIO Parker Wilbourn for Deputy Chief Bailey)

COMMUNITY RELATIONS DIVISION
- Community Relations would like to thank the Executive Staff, Operations, CERT, Logistics, and everyone else that played a part in the successful Open House at Firehouse 109 last weekend. It was well received by the community, even on a cloudy Sunday.

- Community Relations assisted in coordinating today’s memorial service for Ret. Capt. Bob Bruce, and we’re working on Ret. Logistics Tech Gary Lascelles memorial which is scheduled for 11/15 at 11:00am at Sacramento Memorial Lawn.

- We’re continuing to trickle out community education in regards to pre-hospital care and getting patients “The right care, at the right place at the right time.” This has been an ongoing campaign with our local health care systems for over a year now. CBS 13 aired a segment last night, and we’ve done multiple recently on the solutions we’re providing as an agency to combat overcrowding in our emergency rooms.

- Next week is Crash Responder Safety Week, reminding drivers to slow down and move over near traffic incidents and work zones to prevent serious injuries and deaths on California’s roadway as a Statewide Call to Action. Chief House will be speaking alongside the heads of CalTrans, California Office of Traffic Safety, California Highway Patrol, National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, and California Tow Truck Association at a Press Conference on Monday, 11/13 at 10:00am at the Traffic Management Center in Rancho Cordova.

- Metro Fire ran a public-education campaign competition during Fire Prevention Week in efforts to encourage students in the community to practice safety skills. Students were asked to send in photos of themselves with their designs, while practicing these skills for a chance to win a ride to school in one of our engines. We had 2 winners; both will be driven to Dudley Elementary school on E26 on 11/17 at 9:00am. We will have media there for the event.

- We’re coordinating with Sac Fire and Cal OES for a safe cooking demonstration on 11/21 ahead of Thanksgiving and the holidays.

## SUPPORT SERVICES REPORT (Deputy Chief Tyler Wagaman)

Tonight, I will keep my support report brief as we have experienced several unexpected absences within the support services branch, primarily due to pre scheduled vacations and unscheduled illnesses. Nevertheless, on behalf of the Support Services branch, I want to assure you that exceptional work is still being carried out throughout the district to support the vital services we provide to our community each and every day.

On the facilities front, I am pleased to announce that the roofing projects at Station 114, 29, and our leased property at 2101 Hurley are progressing well and are nearing completion.

Turning our attention to the communications division, while they took a short break from installing equipment on new apparatus, they have redirected their focus towards mobile repairs and preventive maintenance on various forms of communication equipment. Among these, our portable and mobile radios, despite being state-of-the-art, require frequent reprogramming to ensure seamless communication interoperability and accurate frequency calibration. Our dedicated communicate team manages and maintenance hundreds of these radios throughout the district, ensuring they are in optimal working condition and perform in the most challenging conditions.

Lastly, I would like to highlight the exceptional work being done at our dispatch center. Recently, I had the opportunity to stand in for Assistant Chief Greene at the last SRFECC board meeting. While the agenda may have been light, the continual work taking place at the dispatch center has been anything but. This is a testament to the strong leadership and the highly capable forward-thinking staff we have. This forward thinking continues to bring to light the use of new technologies, and I strongly believe that the center must continue down this path in order to effectively handle the ever-increasing call volume we face. Like Delphini, the smart response technology voice to text transcription software that Assistant Chief Greene spoke to during him previous report out. Kudos Chief Executive Director Freeman and his staff for these advancements.

This concludes my report for tonight. I am now open to any questions you may have.

3. SMFD – FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL 522 REPORT (Sean Scollard for Vice President Matt Cole)

Sean Scollard thanked the members for their outpouring of support of Gary Lascellas over the last two weeks. Also, the support today at the Memorial Service today for Retired Captain Bob Bruce. Thank you to the CERT team for your hard work and volunteer hours.

BOARD MEMBER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS

Director Wood expressed gratitude to the Crew over at Station 109 for the Open House and all the CERT members. Director Wood expressed gratitude to Chris Allen at Station 109 for his phenomenal representation of Metro Fire at the Open House.

Director Goold thanked everyone for the reports this evening. Would like to see Chief Law's presentation on the website. Would like to see us apply for a Grant for our CERT members.

Director Rice thanked Chief House for his leadership and every member of Metro Fire that attended the California Firefighter Memorial. Beautiful tribute to Bob Bruce today and his son confirmed what we all knew that he was a wonderful man. Yvonne de la Pena with California Firefighter JAC notified Bob’s family that the Cal-JAC Education Building will be named after Captain Bob Bruce. Congratulations to the CERT members for your dedication. Reading assignment: City of Los Angeles Fire Department Historical Archive website and read the Battalion Chief After Action Report from the time of the Northridge Earthquake; also, on the same website look up The Proud Bird Fire and read the “A Full Measure of Devotion: Above and Beyond the Call of Duty”. They are both worth a read.

President Clark thanked everyone for the presentations and the CERT members, you are fantastic.

A moment of silence was held for Retired Captain Bob Bruce and (Ret.) Logistics Technician Gary Lascelles.

**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** December 14, 2023  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Sale of Real Property – Oak Avenue, Orangevale  

**TOPIC**  
Approval requested for final disposition of surplus property located on Oak Avenue in Orangevale, California (APNs 213-0014-038 and 213-0014-039).  

**BACKGROUND**  
On January 12, 2023, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District's (District) Board of Directors approved Resolution 2023-004 declaring certain real property (Property), located on Oak Avenue in Orangevale (APNs 213-0014-038 and 213-0014-039), as surplus property and authorizing the initiation of the disposition process. The District completed the Notice of Availability process in accordance with the Surplus Land Act procedures and subsequently retained a real estate broker to list the Property in the Multiple Listing Service with a listing price of $475,000.  

**DISCUSSION**  
One offer for the property was received in August 2023, and the District began negotiations with the offeror on the terms of the sale. This offer was eventually cancelled by the offeror. Subsequently, a second offer was received from a different party in September 2023 and the District began negotiations on the terms of the sale. The final terms of the sale are as follows:  

| Purchase Price | Deposit | Loan to Value | Contingencies | Closing |
|----------------|---------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| $370,000      | $5,000  | None - CASH   | None           | 21 Days |

Although the offer received is below the listing price, it is still within the range of value suggested by our brokerage team. Staff believes that accepting the offer is in the best interest of the District in consideration of current market conditions and the unique characteristics of the Property.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The District will receive the proceeds from the sale of the Property less the broker's commission (5%) and the closing costs.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends that the Board adopt the Resolution to authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to affect the sale of the Property to the offeror.

**SUBJECT:** New Board Policy – Standards of Cover Policy  

**TOPIC**  
Review and adopt new Board Policy: Standards of Cover Policy (Board Policy 01.021.01).  

**DISCUSSION**  
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District's (District) Standards of Cover (SOC) is a comprehensive tool used to evaluate the District's performance as it relates to the District's adopted service delivery standards and objectives, in order to meet the needs of the community and mitigate identified risks. The SOC provides an in-depth analysis of key performance metrics as a basis for data-driven decision making pertaining to service delivery improvements.

This policy defines the essential elements of the Standards of Cover (SOC) and the process by which it is developed and updated, including the identification of key performance metrics and the adoption of updated response standards and service level objectives that consider industry best practices. This policy also outlines the process for the preparation of a Service Delivery Plan, which includes the methods by which service delivery projects will be evaluated and prioritized.

This policy also outlines the process for the preparation of a Service Delivery Plan, which includes the methods by which service delivery projects will be evaluated and prioritized.

### Scope
This policy is applicable to all District personnel involved in service delivery and service delivery planning.

### Definitions
1. **Critical Tasks:** All necessary actions which must be completed to successfully and fully mitigate a particular incident.
2. **Effective Response Force:** The appropriate number and mix of resources and personnel needed to satisfy all critical tasks for a particular incident.
3. **Key Performance Metrics:** The metrics by which performance can be measured to evaluate whether or not the District's adopted standards, goals and objectives are being met.
4. **Reliability:** The percentage of time that a first due apparatus was the first arriver on scene within their own first due area.
5. **Response Standard:** The appropriate level of service required to meet the needs of the community based on population density and other risk factors.

6. **Service Delivery:** The services provided by the District in accordance with the District's enabling act (Health & Safety Code §13800, et seq.) including fire protection services, rescue services, emergency medical services, hazardous materials response services, ambulance services, and other services relating to the protection of lives and property.

7. **Service Level Objectives:** The targeted response time and effective response force required to properly perform the critical tasks necessary to effectively mitigate the risk.

8. **Time on Task (TOT):** The percentage of time a unit is actually providing response vs. is available in quarters, training, out of service, resting, etc.

9. **Workload:** A category of performance indication which serves to evaluate how “busy” particular units and fire stations are. The District recognizes Time on Task and Reliability as major workload indicators.

**Policy**

1. **Standards of Cover**
   a. It is the policy of the District to prepare a Standards of Cover (SOC) that outlines the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the District in order to better understand:
   
   i. The communities the District serves and the fundamental services it provides to protect life and property in the face of complex risks.
   
   ii. District performance and workload, especially as it pertains to call volumes, response times, time on task, and reliability.
   
   iii. Anticipated growth and demographic changes within the District and how those changes may impact service delivery.
   
   b. In consideration of the aforementioned topics, the SOC evaluates service delivery and serves as a vessel to carry out strategic planning efforts, as directed by the Board.
   
   c. The SOC shall be prepared annually and data shall be updated as follows:
   
   i. Demographic and economic data: updated every five (5) years.
   
   ii. Key performance metrics: updated annually.
   
   iii. Growth areas and progression of development: updated annually.

2. **Response Standards, Service Level Objectives, and Key Performance Metrics**
   a. The District shall adopt response standards, service level objectives, and key performance metrics in order to measure performance and desired outcomes.
   
   i. **Response Standards:** Response standards shall define different levels of service required based on population density and other risk factors.

ii. **Service Level Objectives:** Service level objectives shall set targeted response times and effective response force based on adopted response standards and shall include benchmark performance statements that describe the level of service required for each risk class and type.

iii. **Key Performance Metrics:** Key performance metrics shall define the data points by which performance will be measured in accordance with adopted response standards and service level objectives.

### 3. Service Delivery Plan

a. Based on the findings and recommendations of the SOC, a Service Delivery Plan (SDP) shall be prepared on an annual basis in collaboration with internal and external stakeholders, which shall outline proposed changes to current deployment. The SDP will:

i. Outline changes to deployment required to fill gaps and alleviate inadequacies identified within the SOC.

ii. Identify service delivery alternatives in consideration of financial and personnel constraints.

iii. Use prioritization and ranking in order to determine project feasibility and desirability.

iv. Facilitate strategic planning efforts by determining personnel and equipment needs, which will be reflected in financial management budgeting and modeling.

v. Reflect data-driven solutions to demonstrated service delivery challenges.

### Procedures

1. **SOC Development and Organization**

a. The development of the SOC is a coordinated effort across the District overseen and administered by the Planning and Development Division. Planning and Development solicits information across all branches of the District during SOC development to ensure accuracy and consistency. The SOC is organized into seven (7) major sections, outlined as follows:

i. **Section 1:** Community Baseline – Provides an overview of the District, the communities it serves, and the services it provides.

ii. **Section 2:** Risk Assessment – Identifies risks throughout the District and breaks down risks for each Battalion and Station.

iii. **Section 3:** Risk Categories & Critical Task Capabilities – Classifies and groups risks faced by the District together based on community and District impacts, critical tasks, and effective response force requirements.

iv. Section 4: Standards, Goals & Objectives – Reviews existing response standards, performance goals, and service level objectives, and recommends changes as necessary.

v. Section 5: Service Delivery Analysis – Conducts a response standard analysis, deployment study, gap analysis, and growth analysis throughout the District and provides a framework to plan for new service.

vi. Section 6: Performance Evaluation – Evaluates key performance metrics to measure against adopted standards, goals and objectives.

vii. Section 7: Overall Evaluation & Recommendations – Summarizes major findings, recommendations, and the needed maintenance of effort for continuous improvement.

2. Maintenance of Effort  
a. The SOC maintenance of effort (MOE) is the process by which the SOC will be updated annually to ensure that all data and information is accurate and up-to-date. While all information within the SOC should be verified for accuracy each year, special attention should be given to:  
   i. Adding unit and incident data from the most recent calendar year to performance data models.  
   ii. Tracking buildout and absorption in District growth areas.

b. Proposed revisions to adopted response standards, service level objectives and key performance metrics that are recommended in the annual SOC update shall be subject to Board approval and formally adopted by Board resolution.

c. The MOE also includes the ongoing effort to better understand service delivery challenges for continuous improvement. The District shall utilize working groups to collaborate on service delivery studies, defining key performance metrics and integrating data wherever possible. Such studies shall be based on findings and recommendations outlined in the annual SOC.

3. SDP Development and Prioritization  
a. The SDP shall be constructed from the major findings of the SOC. Whereas the SOC helps to identify deployment gaps and performance inadequacies within the District, the SDP seeks to “fill” these gaps with resources in order to improve service delivery. All proposed changes in the SDP will be rigorously studied in order to fully understand impacts to the District. The District will utilize pilot studies and white-paper reports to evaluate, summarize, and disseminate data from SDP projects.

b. Projects in the SDP will be prioritized and ranked such that feasible, desired, cost-effective projects with maximized benefits are implemented. SDP project prioritization will consider the following:

10545 Armstrong Ave., Suite 200 · Mather, CA 95655 · Phone (916) 859-4300 · Fax (916) 859-3702  

**DATE:** December 14, 2023  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Contract Amendment with Amentum Services Inc. for Aircraft Maintenance Services  

**TOPIC**  
Staff seeks approval to enter into a contract amendment with Amentum Services Inc. for aircraft maintenance services.  

**SUMMARY**  
In order to maintain consistent availability of aircraft for emergency response, and meet the increased maintenance demands with the addition of a third aircraft to the fleet, the contract with Amentum Services Inc. requires modification to permit the hiring of a higher qualified mechanic to fill the second mechanic position.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Metro Fire contracts with Amentum Services Inc. for maintenance of the District's helicopters. With the build-up of Copter 3 nearing completion, Metro Fire will have three (3) in service aircraft starting in early 2024. With the increase in fleet size, the day-to-day maintenance demand will also increase. In order to meet this demand, Metro Fire seeks to amend the contract for maintenance with Amentum Services Inc. to have the second authorized mechanic position in the contract changed from an Apprentice Mechanic to a second Lead Mechanic position.  

Metro Fire currently has one (1) Lead Mechanic and one (1) Apprentice Mechanic position. The addition of a second Lead Mechanic, replacing the Apprentice Mechanic position will increase the maintenance work force capabilities within the Air Operations Division, enabling the proper servicing of three (3) helicopters to meet the demands of the current service delivery model. The contract amendment will also adjust the pay scales of the Lead Mechanic positions to a level that is more competitive within the Northern California helicopter maintenance industry, allowing for enhanced recruitment practices. Metro Fire currently is at the low end of the competitive pay scale, which has made recruitment and retention of mechanics difficult. The current Apprentice Mechanic position has been either empty or filled for very short periods of time over the last two (2) years. The last three (3) Apprentice Mechanics have left to go work for other maintenance services providers.

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The current cost of both the Lead Mechanic and Apprentice Mechanic positions for the current budget year FY23/24 is $331,364, with no overtime.  

The cost of new contract amendment, with both Lead Mechanic positions filled at the enhanced, industry competitive Lead Mechanic rate is $396,988 with no overtime.  

- The Amentum Services Inc. contract cost will increase by $65,624 a year, which is absorbed in the current contracted budgeted amount of $425,000, with a $28,012 available to cover overtime costs.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board authorize the Fire Chief to execute the contract amendment for Aircraft Maintenance Services with Amentum Services Inc.

**DATE:** December 14, 2023  
**TO:** Board of Directors  

**SUBJECT:** Contract Award - Owner Advisor (Zinfandel Phase 3 Buildout Project)  

**TOPIC**  
Request to approve a contract award to Benham Design, LLC to serve as Owner Advisor in support of the District's design-build best value procurement for the Zinfandel Phase 3 Buildout project.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District's (District) Board of Directors has adopted Resolution 2023-065 which determined that it was in the best interest of the District to use the design-build construction delivery method for the Zinfandel Phase 3 Buildout project (Project).  

**DISCUSSION**  
On November 3, 2023, the District issued Request for Proposals (RFP) 23-08 to solicit proposals from qualified design and/or engineering firms to provide owner advisor services in support of the District's pre-award activities for the best value procurement of a design-build entity for the Project. Engaging an owner advisor is recognized by the Design Build Institute of America as a best practice for design-build projects. The Owner Advisor will be responsible for facilitating the selection of the design-build entity using a best value procurement, including the preparation of the District's solicitation documents, design criteria documents, and design-build agreement, as well as providing technical assistance to the District during the final design-build entity selection phase in order to ensure District needs are met.  

The District received two proposals in response to RFP 23-08 which were reviewed and scored by an evaluation panel. Benham Design, LLC was the highest scoring proposer.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The cost of the proposed services is $357,500 and is included in the Project budget. This contract price is based on a rate of 2.75% of the approved Project budget. Should the Board approve an increase to the project budget prior to contract issuance, the contract price would be adjusted at a rate of 2.5% of the increase, in accordance with industry standards.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board adopt a resolution to approve a contract award to Benham Design, LLC and authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to execute and administer an agreement materially similar to the attached agreement.

Erin Castleberry, Administrative Analyst

**DATE:** December 14, 2023  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Board Adoption - Response Standards and Service Level Objectives  

**TOPIC**  
Staff recommendation for Board of Directors (Board) to adopt the Response Standards and Service Level Objectives.  

**BACKGROUND**  
Following the completion of a Standards of Cover study in 2009, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District's (District) Board of Directors (Board) adopted Fire Unit Deployment Performance Measures (Board Policy 01.011.01) which set response standards and service level objectives to guide and evaluate District service delivery.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The 2020 Board Strategic Plan outlined the need for an updated Standards of Cover (SOC) study to better evaluate District service delivery and performance. As part of that process, a new Standards of Cover Policy (Board Policy 01.021.01) has been adopted which defines the essential elements of the SOC, the process by which it is developed, and the outcomes to be expected. The new policy, which replaces the 2009 policy, outlines in Section 2a that updated response standards, service level objectives, and key performance metrics should be adopted in order to measure performance and desired outcomes, in accordance with the findings and recommendations of the annual SOC update.  

The 2023 SOC study recommended the adoption of new response standards and service level objectives to more adequately evaluate diverse, evolving risks to better serve the growing populations that are experiencing them. The proposed Response Standards and Service Level Objectives are attached in Attachment 1.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board approve the attached resolution to adopt the Response Standards and Service Level Objectives.

# Response Standards and Service Level Objectives

## Response Standard Considerations
Response standards determine the appropriate level of service to be provided to the community by the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District). Service level can be described as the expected response time and the resources required to perform the critical tasks necessary to effectively mitigate the incident. Service levels can vary based on population, density, land use, incident history, identified risks and special hazards.

## Proposed Response Standards
The District recommends the following response standards to guide service level, which are considered best practices by the Center for Public Safety Excellence and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).

| **Dense Urban** | **Urban** | **Suburban** | **Rural** |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Population density greater than 3,000 people per square mile | Population density between 1,000-3,000 people per square mile | Populations density between 500-1,000 people per square mile | Population density less than 500 people per square mile |

In addition to the above four standards, development trends suggest that there may be pockets in dense urban areas that eventually exceed 10,000 people per square mile as buildout occurs. Recognizing that densities at that level poses additional risks and challenges to emergency response, future consideration should be made on whether to include an even higher response standard for these areas which would be considered “metropolitan” in nature.

## Service Level Objective Considerations
As previously defined, service level is described as the expected response time and the resources required to perform the critical tasks necessary to effectively mitigate the incident. As such, considerations for setting service level objectives primarily revolve around response time considerations and risk considerations.

### Response Time
Response time is measured as the length of time from when a call is dispatched to when personnel arrive on scene. Response time is measured to include both the first arriving unit as well as when effective response force (ERF) is achieved, and includes dispatch time (time from alarm to notification), turnout time (time from notification to enroute), and travel time (time from enroute to on scene).

### Risk
Different types of incidents pose varying levels of risk and ERF needs, which should be considered when setting service level objectives. NFPA 1710 recommends that service level objectives are set for each major service component (fire suppression, EMS, and special operations) with consideration given to level of risk. The District recognizes fire suppression and EMS, and further breaks special operations into Technical Rescue and Hazardous Materials (HazMat) risk categories.

## Proposed Service Level Objectives
As previously discussed, NFPA 1710 recommends that service level objectives be set for all incident types in accordance with risk categories.

**Response Time**  
The recommended benchmark performance statements below reflect the District's existing objectives for a dispatch time of 01:00 (one minute) and a turnout time of 02:00 (two minutes).

Recommended travel times are shown in the table below. The recommendations retain existing objectives for first-due and ERF travel times by response standard, and add additional travel time objectives for varying risk class and category, as well as for an additional response standard (dense urban) which was not recognized in previous District Standards.

EMS Response  
EMS Low 1  
EMS Low 1 incidents are primarily interfacility transfers and Mobile Integrated Health (MIH) program calls which, by nature, are not emergent and do not require emergency response. As such, no benchmark performance statement is recommended for adoption at this time. As the MIH program grows, a future recommendation may be considered for appropriate benchmark performance measurement.

**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** December 14, 2023  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Amendment to Board Resolution affecting Senior Safety Management and Safety Management Employees  

**TOPIC**  
Approval of Amendment to Resolution establishing compensation and benefits for Senior Safety Management and Safety Management Employees.  

**SUMMARY**  
On December 8, 2022, the Board of Directors voted and approved Resolution 2022-104, which defined the compensation and benefits package to be provided to Senior Safety Management Employees, which included Chief Deputy, Deputy Chiefs, Assistant Chiefs, Chief Pilots and Fire Marshal. The Resolution was approved at a time generally corresponding with, but after the approval of new labor Memorandums of Understanding with Local 522 and represented employee classifications of the District. The Resolution defines compensation, wage increases, vacation leave, bereavement leave, sick leave, other leaves, as well as health and retirement benefits. Now before the Board is an amendment to reduce paid administrative leave hours and elimination of Medicare Reimbursement Cost Recovery Program IGT Incentives.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Included in the compensation and benefit provisions for the positions covered under the Resolution are 80 hours for day assignment employees and 112 hours for shift assignment employees of paid administrative leave annually, and Medicare Reimbursement Cost Recovery Program IGT incentives. Before the Board for consideration is the elimination of Medicare Reimbursement Cost Recovery Program IGT Incentives and modification of allowances for administrative leave.  

1. **ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE**  
Regarding administrative leave, the current Resolution provides paid administrative leave as follows:  
- Employees assigned to a 40 hour per week “day” assignment shall receive 80 hours of administrative leave each January 1st.  
- Employees assigned to a 56 hour per week “shift” assignment shall receive 112 hours of administrative leave each January 1st.  

Employees hired or promoted after January 1st shall have their accrual prorated for that year. Employees are able to accrue hours in an Administrative leave bank, subject to maximum level, and any hours remaining as of December 31 are rolled into the next year, reducing the January.  

**P80**
<!-- Page 81 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

1 allotment so the maximum accrual will not be exceeded. Additionally, any remaining accruals are not subject to buy back, and at termination and retirement are paid off at the employees total hourly rate.

By way of the proposed amended resolution, Administrative leave is reduced by 50%. All other terms would remain the same.

The Fire Chief submits this proposal and recommends that this adjustment in leave hours be approved by the Board. This reduction in hours will result in a financial savings to the District, and bring into line the overall compensation package for Senior Safety Management and Safety Management Employees to a more reasonable level, while, at the same time, providing an appropriate level of paid time off, considering their exempt status under State and Federal Labor laws.

2. MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT COST RECOVERY PROGRAM IGT INCENTIVES RECOMMENDATION

At the time of approval of the current Resolution, the District had recently concluded, and finalized a labor Memorandum of Understanding with the Local 522 involving the represented classes of District employees. One benefit aspect of that agreement provided the potential for represented employees to receive cash incentives in the event that actual total revenue from all of the Medicare reimbursement cost recovery programs exceeded the 2022/2023 final budgeted reimbursement. The payment amount is based upon a sliding scale related to increases in the Medicare reimbursement. At the time of approval of the subject Resolution, the Board provided this same incentive to Senior Safety and Safety Management Staff.

The new amended Resolution would eliminate this incentive program for the covered positions. Administration believes that cost savings can be directed to other needs of the district. The elimination would further establish a more reasonable overall compensation package as the District moves forward into a potentially uncertain economic environment.

FISCAL IMPACT

Based upon the current number of employees in the subject classifications, the Administrative Leave Savings is $59,540.00 and the Medicare Reimbursement Savings is $27,000.00. The combined annual savings are $79,203.00.

RECOMMENDATION

Recommend the Board adopt the amended Resolution.

G. At the employee’s option, upon service retirement or disability retirement, the District will compensate up to forty percent (40%) of the employee’s accumulated “A” Bank sick leave.  
The employee must notify the District no later than 30 days from their employment separation of their intention to be paid for sick leave.
