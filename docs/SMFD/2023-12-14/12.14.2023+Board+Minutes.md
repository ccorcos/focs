6. Miscellaneous  
It is with a heavy heart that I pass along that (Ret.) Firefighter Bernie Necker passed away on November 17th. Bernie retired from Metro Fire in 2006.

**OPERATIONS REPORT** – (Deputy Chief Mitchell)

1. **Decon 110**
   - In service 11/27/23, staffed with one FF – six month pilot program
   - Close collaboration and support from 522
   - Will respond to the scene of working fires at discretion of the incident commander
   - Will collect contaminated PPE
   - In addition to current StormStick usage
   - Plan to add more robust decontamination bags next spring

2. **EMS Team Introduction**
   - AC Rudnicki introduced EMS team members Adam Blitz, Jim Ellis, Eric Mattei, Chris Kellogg, and Eric Sacht.

3. **Commendation**
   - AC Fiorica will present commendation to BC Pittman  
   
   **Pittman Commendation**  
   Back on April 16th a vehicle accident with entrapment occurred on Highway 50 at Aerojet Road. Captain, now BC, Pittman was working an overtime shift at Engine 61 and he and his crew were on their way to Station 65 to complete some training when Captain Pittman heard Truck 23 get dispatched to the accident. Being aware of the extended response time for the closest available Truck for this incident he made contact with the Incident Commander and inquired about responding with Truck 65. The truck was in quarters but unstaffed as the truck crew was already on a water rescue incident. The Incident Commander approved Captain Pittman’s plan so Engine 61 responded to Station 65 and staffed the Truck and responded to the incident. Captain Pittman’s decision had a significant positive impact on the response time to get the needed tools and equipment to this incident. Captain Pittman demonstrated outside of the box thinking and his decision is in line with the following pillars of the Metro Way: service delivery, adaptable, strong communications, and individual initiative.
