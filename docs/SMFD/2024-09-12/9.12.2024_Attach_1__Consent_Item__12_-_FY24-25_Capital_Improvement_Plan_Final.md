**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

September 12, 2024  

TO: Board of Directors, Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District  
FROM: Adam A. House, Fire Chief  
RE: Five-Year Capital Improvement Program Plan, Fiscal Years 2024/25 through FY 2028/29  

I am pleased to submit the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Plan for fiscal year (FY) 2024/2025, with projects funded through FY 2028/29, to the District Board of Directors. This version updates the CIP Plan approved with the FY 2024/25 Preliminary Budget and ties to the FY 2024/25 Final Budget.

The purpose of the CIP is to facilitate capital planning and coordinate financing and scheduling of major capital projects. All capital projects presented in this CIP Plan have been carefully developed and evaluated in accordance with the District’s CIP Policy. The CIP Plan was prepared in accordance with standards established by the California Society of Municipal Finance Officers and follows generally accepted accounting principles. The 18 new recommended capital projects and 9 carryover projects total $52.4 million, with $51.8 million budgeted in FY 2024/25, and the remainder to be budgeted later in the five-year plan.

The focus of the FY 2024/25 CIP Plan, the District’s third plan to the Board, is to address the most critical capital needs, with special emphasis on those projects that contribute to the District’s ability to maintain existing levels of service. Critical projects include construction of a new fire station in Battalion 9, acquisition of a future fire station site in Rancho Cordova, replacement of critical engines and ambulances, and continued development of the District’s Zinfandel First Responder Training Facility in Rancho Cordova. Approximately 27% of the FY 2024/25 spending will come from the Special Projects Fund for the Zinfandel project, 38% from the Capital Facilities Fund, 5% provided by the General Fund, and 30% from the Development Impact Fee Fund, with less than 1% provided by the Leased Properties Fund.

The District’s major revenue sources for capital projects are property taxes (approximately 57% of total revenues), followed by charges for services (28%), with the balance comprised of miscellaneous income (15%). Revenues forecasted in this plan are estimates only and subject to unexpected changes in the local economy and property tax revenues.

The District continues to face a significant backlog of deferred maintenance and capital projects, totaling more than $181 million. Several of these capital and maintenance projects are planned over the next five years, with $51.8 million funded in FY 2024/25. The District is also exploring long-term financing options and new revenue sources to fund fire station construction.

### CONCLUSION  

In FY 2024/25 the District will enter what is expected to be a multiyear period of lower revenue growth, affecting the District’s capacity to invest in infrastructure plans. The District’s main revenue source, property tax, is expected to decline from a 5.7% annual growth rate in FY 2023/24, to 4.8% in FY 2024/25, followed by four years of growth rates at or below 4% annually. Elevated interest rates are expected to continue to suppress new and resale home sales, the most significant factor in property tax growth. The cost of goods also continues to challenge the District, with lingering slowdowns in vehicle production and inflationary pressures on supplies, ranging from fuel to electronics.  

With slower property tax growth and rising labor, services, and supplies expenses, the District faces ongoing challenges to long-term capital project development funding over the CIP period. Deferred maintenance and unfunded capital projects will accrue rapidly over the next two decades, including an anticipated 14 stations in new development areas and approximately 13 stations in infill areas. If population growth and service call trends continue, the District will not be able to meet service needs in those communities without additional stations and support.  

The capital projects contained in this plan meet the strategic plan goal set by the Board in 2020 to develop a comprehensive five-year capital improvement plan for the acquisition and maintenance of real property,

apparatus, and professional equipment. The CIP Plan proposed for fiscal years 2024/25 through 2028/29 is the result of a team effort of both District staff and the Board of Directors.

Finally, I am pleased to share that the District’s FY 2023/24 CIP Plan was again awarded the California Society of Municipal Finance Officers’ Capital Budgeting Award, a prestigious award recognizing the overall quality, completeness, and readability of the District’s capital plan. The District was one of just 21 special districts and cities in California to receive this award. The certificate of award can be found in Appendix F. I would like to thank the Board for their leadership and direction in building this CIP Plan, as well as my team, in particular Erin Castleberry, Jeff Frye, Ron Empedrad, Tara Maeller, and Dave O’Toole for their exemplary dedication in preparing this CIP Plan.

Respectfully submitted,

Adam A. House

# CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM PLAN
## OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY

### PURPOSE OF THE CIP

The purpose of the District’s Capital Improvement Program is to organize, facilitate, and memorialize capital needs and goals in order to efficiently and transparently develop and support the physical infrastructure of the District. The CIP incorporates and is consistent with District master plans, Board of Directors’ goals, and other long-range plans of the District, and serves as a planning tool that coordinates the financing and scheduling of capital projects. It is the policy of the District to prepare a Capital Improvement Program (CIP) that outlines the capital needs of the District that:

- Respond to the changing needs of the District
- Demonstrate excellence in quality and value
- Enable members to carry out their duties in an efficient and customer-focused manner
- Provide a healthy, safe, secure, productive, and equitable work environment in order to promote efficient service delivery

The District accomplishes this purpose through the development of an annual plan, which identifies and plans for the funding of capital projects in order to ensure timely acquisition and replacement of needed facilities, improvements, apparatus, and equipment. Since many capital projects take more than one fiscal year to complete, developing a five-year plan allows the District and Board to improve fiscal forecasting and anticipate upcoming infrastructure needs and improvements. The CIP Plan is updated annually and includes the adoption of the five-year CIP, as well as the annual CIP Budget, which is adopted as part of the District’s annual Preliminary Budget and Final Budget.

For purposes of this CIP Policy, and in accordance with the District’s Capital Improvement Program Policy, a capital project is defined as:

Any expenditure for facilities, improvements, apparatus, or equipment with a cost greater than $50,000 and an expected useful life of at least one year. These projects include apparatus and equipment acquisition and replacement; improvements to District facilities; and the construction or rehabilitation of District properties and facilities including feasibility studies, land acquisition, architecture and engineering, and other associated planning costs.

The five-year CIP Plan and the annual CIP Budget are distinct documents prepared in concert and updated annually to reflect fiscal and policy changes. The two documents are distinguished by the characteristics outlined below.

### FIVE-YEAR CIP PLAN

- Describes the long-term financial need for capital projects, including funding sources
- Establishes project priorities and serves as a planning document or blueprint for the District’s investment in capital infrastructure and equipment
- Provides a breakdown of anticipated project costs and phasing
- Does not appropriate money; the annual budget process will include spending authority for capital projects via the CIP Budget

# CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM PLAN  
## OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY  

### ANNUAL CIP BUDGET  
- Identifies funds to be appropriated in the upcoming fiscal year to implement the first year of the five-year CIP Plan  
- Identifies which capital projects have been recommended for funding in the upcoming fiscal year  
- Funding may be appropriated for a phase or phases of a major, multi-year project  
- May include a recommendation to incur new indebtedness  
- Is adopted as part of the District’s Preliminary Budget and Final Budget  

### PLAN DEVELOPMENT  
The CIP is used as a tool to help ensure the District’s long and short-term capital investments are made in the context of careful consideration of the District’s needs, as well as the resources available to fund projects. The CIP Plan is a compilation of projects intended to implement various long-range plans as outlined below.  

### STANDARDS OF COVER  
The Standards of Cover is a planning document which establishes a written procedure to determine the distribution and concentration of fixed and mobile resources. The process includes establishing service level objectives, risk assessments, distribution, and concentration measures. The data is collected for deployment analyses and performance is measured. The results of deployment analyses are used to assist Metro Fire in its mid to long term planning efforts to provide levels of service that meet the all-risk defense standards it deems necessary to reduce the risks to human life and property damage. As a result, the Standards of Cover is used to anticipate the expansion or relocation of fire stations to accommodate the apparatus and crew needed to deliver service.  

### GROWTH PLAN  
The Growth Plan summarizes the expected population growth within Metro Fire’s service area over a 40-year horizon. The Growth Plan is similar to the Standards of Cover in process except service plans are developed from planning information, proposed traffic circulation data, and population models. The information is used to create deployment models that, along with the Standards of Cover, determine the need, location, and timing for new fire stations to accommodate future service delivery needs.  

### FACILITY CONDITION ASSESSMENT  
In 2018, Metro Fire retained a third-party consultant to conduct a District-wide Facility Condition Assessment (FCA) that evaluated existing conditions at 38 fire stations and 4 support facilities. FCAs are used to locate and evaluate materials and building system defects that might significantly affect the value of the property, and to identify any significant deferred maintenance issues and existing deficiencies which affect the ongoing operations of the facilities.  

In every FCA the recommended replacement, repair, or other corrective action is assigned a Plan Type. The Plan Type is used to categorize and prioritize projects which have the greatest significance. The Plan Types are listed in order of importance:

- **Safety** – An observed or reported unsafe condition that, if left unaddressed, could result in injury; a system or component that presents a potential liability risk.
- **Performance/Integrity** – Component or system has failed, is almost failing, performs unreliably, does not perform as intended, and/or poses a risk to overall system stability.
- **Accessibility** – Does not meet ADA, UFAS, and/or other accessibility requirements.
- **Environmental** – Improvements to air or water quality, including removal of hazardous materials from the building or site.
- **Modernization/Adaptation** – Conditions, systems, or spaces that need to be upgraded in appearance or function to meet current standards, facility usage, or Metro Fire’s current or future operational needs.
- **Lifecycle/Renewal** – Any component or system in which future repair or replacement is anticipated beyond the next several years and/or is of minimal substantial early-term consequence.

## APPARATUS AND EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT SCHEDULE

The Apparatus and Equipment Replacement Schedule is a mid-term planning document which uses NFPA replacement standards, industry guidelines, and years of experience in operating and maintaining vehicles and equipment. The goal of the Replacement Schedule is to use data such as estimated age, useful life, remaining useful life, replacement cost, downtime, availability of replacement parts, and annual maintenance cost to anticipate the most economically beneficial time to replace apparatus and equipment.

Not all of Metro Fire’s equipment meets the criteria of a capital purchase. However, when these items are purchased in bulk or are not routine in nature, the acquisition of the equipment or supplies may require a significant capital outlay. As such, these capital expenditures should be planned, and are therefore considered capital projects for the purpose of inclusion in the CIP Plan.

## PROJECT PRIORITIZATION & RANKING

The prioritization of capital projects is absolutely necessary given the limited availability of financial and human resources. Criteria for prioritizing and ranking projects are established to help provide structure and objectivity to the evaluation of projects. In determining the priority of a proposed project, key management team members evaluate projects for urgency, funding availability, feasibility, alignment with the strategic plan, statutory and regulatory considerations, and impact on service delivery. Other considerations include impact on operating costs, secondary financial impacts, management and oversight implications, and impact on constituents and stakeholders.

Projects are evaluated both by their priority score and their ranking. Priority score is the result of a scoring rubric that determines whether a project is High Priority (Priority 1), Medium Priority (Priority 2), or Low Priority (Priority 3). Project rank describes a project’s priority in relation to all other project requests submitted for the year. The methodology for both priority and rank are described below.

## CIP PRIORITY METHODOLOGY

Priority is assigned to a project based on the following factors: alignment with the District’s strategic planning documents, mandated activity and operating expense reduction, and impact on service delivery.

The exact scoring methodology is as follows:
- **Strategic Alignment** – Is the project aligned with one of Metro Fire’s strategic plans (Standards of Cover, FCA, Growth Plan, A/E Replacement Schedule)?
  - 5 points – Project is aligned with multiple strategic plans.
  - 3 points – Project is aligned with one strategic plan.
  - 1 point – Project is not aligned with a strategic plan.

- **Priority Type** – Is the project required to meet legal, compliance, or regulatory mandates? Will the project reduce operating expenses?
  - 5 points – Project will address mandates and reduce operating expenses.
  - 3 points – Project will address mandates or reduce operating expenses.
  - 1 point – Project will not address mandates or reduce operating expenses.

- **Service Delivery** – Will the project directly improve service delivery?
  - 5 points – Project directly improves service delivery.
  - 3 points – Project indirectly improves service delivery.
  - 1 point – Project does not directly or indirectly improve service delivery.

Projects are given a High Priority “1” status with a score of 13 or more. Projects are given a Medium Priority “2” status with a score between 9 and 13. Projects are given a Low Priority “3” status with a score of less than 9.

## CIP PLAN RANK METHODOLOGY

A project’s rank as it relates to other project requests is determined by evaluating a variety of factors including designated priority, project readiness, whether or not the District has the capacity to complete all or a portion of the project within the upcoming fiscal year, impact to operations, and alignment with District goals and objectives for the coming year. Other considerations may include impact on operating costs, secondary financial impacts, management and oversight implications, and impact to constituents and stakeholders.

For FY 2024/25, projects that supported the District’s ability to maintain existing levels of essential services received higher tier ranking as compared to new initiatives or projects that could be deferred.

## PROCESS

A capital project may be submitted for consideration by any member of Metro Fire through the completion of the Capital Project Initiative Form (CPIF). CPIFs document the project description, timeline, procurement type, funding amount, funding source, operational impact, project justification, relevant ties to other projects, and other supporting information. A complete CPIF includes:

- Supporting fiscal documentation including but not limited to feasibility studies, cost estimates, and or vendor quotes consistent with Metro Fire’s procurement procedures.
- Signature of the applicable division manager and the CIP Administrator.

## FILLING OUT THE CPIF

The CPIF is designed to provide basic project information to decision makers throughout the process. In this section, guidance is provided in how to complete the form. This guidance is not exhaustive, but intended to provide clarity where the applicant may have questions:
- **Project #** - The project number will be assigned by the CIP Administrator once the project submittal is deemed complete. The CIP Administrator will add the project to the inventory and use the Project # for tracking purposes.
- **Priority** - To determine the priority of the project, the project proponent should consider the three criteria (Strategic Alignment, Plan Type, and Service Delivery) discussed in the Prioritization section of this document and score the project accordingly. Priority “1” projects are those with a score of 13 points or more; Priority “2” projects are those with a score between 9 and 13 points; and Priority “3” projects are those with a score less than 9 points.
- **Project Description** – A brief narrative about the project.
- **Strategic Alignment** – This is the nexus between the project and the District’s strategic master planning documents. Select all that apply.
- **Capital Plan** – A project may use funding from multiple sources. Input the anticipated required dollars from each fund (in thousands).
- **Procurement Process and Timeline** – A brief description of the anticipated procurement procedures and timeline for the project.
- **Project Budget** – Outline of requested project budget by fiscal year(s) and any previously approved allocations for the project.
- **Additional Project Information** – describes impact and any relationships to other capital projects.

## PROJECT VERIFICATION

Completed CPIFs are routed to the division manager who will review the submittal to make sure the proposed project is consistent with divisional priorities and goals. If approved, the division manager will submit the project to the CIP Administrator for review. The CIP Administrator will review the PIF for completeness and may request additional information as necessary for evaluation of the project.

## PROJECT EVALUATION AND RANKING

Capital project requests are evaluated on an annual basis in accordance with the District’s CIP Policy. Projects are first reviewed by the CIP Committee, made up of representatives from the Finance, Planning and Development, and Purchasing divisions. The committee reviews each request and ranks it using the ranking methodology previously described.

# CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM PLAN  
## OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY  

### EXECUTIVE REVIEW AND FUNDING RECOMMENDATION  
The ranked CIP Summary is then reviewed by the Fire Chief, Deputy Chiefs, and Chief Financial Officer in conjunction with the preliminary budget review process. The Fire Chief may recommend to fund, partially fund, or not fund any given project based on the established criteria and considerations.  

### PLAN ADOPTION  
Based on the recommendations of the Fire Chief, the CIP, including both the five-year CIP Plan and the one-year CIP Budget, is presented to the Board for adoption on or before June 30 and in concurrence with the preliminary budget adoption process. Once the CIP Budget is approved, budgeted funds are restricted for their intended use.  

### FIVE-YEAR CIP PLAN SUMMARY  
The five-year CIP Plan represents the District’s known and anticipated capital needs over the next five years. There are 56 capital projects identified in the five-year CIP totaling $181,645,365, including 14 Priority 1 projects, 35 Priority 2 projects, and 7 Priority 3 projects.

# CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM PLAN  
## FINANCING PLAN  

## CAPITAL BUDGET OVERVIEW  

The CIP Plan represents the District's comprehensive public infrastructure plan, and is used to identify capital project needs and plan for the financing of these needs in a manner that assures the most responsible and efficient use of District resources. The District operates on a fiscal year basis that begins on July 1 of each year, and ends the following year on June 30. The development of the annual CIP Budget is a cooperative and coordinated effort across all divisions and is incorporated into the annual Budget Calendar (Appendix B).  

The annual CIP Plan development process begins each year with instructions, training, and a fiscal condition update to help budget officers prepare their capital project requests and budgets. The CIP Plan is coordinated by the Planning and Development Division, while the budget elements are overseen by the Finance Division. The CIP Budget reflects the total planned expenditures for approved capital projects over the five-year plan period, and includes a one-year appropriation for approved capital projects. The CIP Budget is reviewed annually to ensure any necessary changes to project costs are captured appropriately.  

Public hearings are conducted on the annual CIP Budget to review all appropriations and sources of financing. Appropriations are then adopted through the passage of a resolution. The CIP Budget represents the maximum authorized expenditures for the year and cannot legally be exceeded except by subsequent amendments of the budget by the Board of Directors. Any amendments to the total level of net appropriations for a fund or transfers between funds must be approved by the Board of Directors. Capital project appropriations shall remain in effect until the project is completed or until modified in a subsequently adopted budget. The CIP Plan is presented to the Board of Directors in June alongside the District’s Preliminary Budget, and a final updated version is adopted in September alongside the District’s Final Budget.  

## CAPITAL EXPENDITURES & APPROPRIATIONS  

Capital project appropriations are budgeted in the year the District obligates the funding, which may not always coincide with when actual costs are expended, depending on the project duration. Proposed appropriations are based on current year dollars using best estimates from a variety of sources including quotes and previous expenditures for similar projects, among others. Expected project costs for future years include adjustments for inflationary factors such as the Consumer Price and Construction Cost Indexes.  

## CAPITAL REVENUE SOURCES  

The District’s budget is made up of 7 different funds, each with its own purpose and specific revenue source(s). Capital projects may be funded through any one or combination of the different funds. When funding is insufficient to fund all project proposals, the Finance Division and the Planning and Development Division collaborate with division managers to reprioritize individual projects to future fiscal years, reevaluate funding needs, and identify any alternative funding sources. This includes reviewing various state or federal grant programs normally available to special districts and fire districts and identifying eligible projects. On large-scale projects that can be used by other local agencies, the District considers funding partnerships.

## FINANCING PLAN  

### General Fund (A Fund)  
The General Fund is the District’s main operating fund and, in addition to paying for ongoing costs associated with capital projects, is typically used for equipment or supply acquisition and facility improvements that are not considered major improvements or capital assets. The General Fund’s main revenue sources are property taxes and fees collected for ground emergency medical transports.  

### Capital Facilities Fund (D Fund)  
The Capital Facilities Fund is used to account for general operating transfers to fund capital purchases. The majority of CIP projects will be budgeted from the Capital Facilities Fund, and monies from other funds will be transferred to the Capital Facilities Fund for expenditure during the fiscal year. Besides transfers from other funds, the Capital Facilities Fund’s main revenue source is proceeds from a combination of lease revenue bond issues and capital lease financing.  

### Grant Fund (G Fund)  
The Grant Fund is used to account for various types of grants awarded to the District, with its primary revenue source being grant funding. Fund balance is restricted for purposes authorized in the grant awards. For the purposes of the CIP, if a proposed project is not selected for funding due to cost or availability, the District may pursue grant funding opportunities. If an award is made, the funds are accounted for and administered in the Grant Fund. When possible, the District identifies and pursues grants to minimize the use of District funds.  

### Development Impact Fee Fund (I Fund)  
The Development Impact Fee Fund accounts for proceeds derived from development impact fees paid by developers to support the facilities and equipment required to serve the planned community. Fees are collected at the time building permits are issued. The fund balance is restricted for use on capital outlay relating to acquisition of land, construction of future fire stations, and acquisition of apparatus and equipment.  

### Leased Properties Fund (L Fund)  
The Leased Properties Fund is used to account for revenues and expenditures for the District’s leased properties. The primary source of revenues in the Leased Properties Fund is rental payments. A portion of these revenues are retained to fund capital maintenance and replacement projects of leased facilities.  

### Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) Fund (M Fund)  
The Intergovernmental Transfers Fund, or IGT Fund, accounts for revenue generated by the payments made to the District for the care and ambulance transport of the uninsured and certain persons covered by MediCal.  

### Special Project Fund (S Fund)  
The Special Project Fund was established to account for restricted funding designated for large-scale capital projects. Currently, the Special Project Fund accounts for sequester funds allocated by the State of California in 2022 for the Zinfandel First Responder Training Facility Phase 3 Buildout.

# CAPITAL BUDGET REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS

The District’s primary revenue source is property tax, which generated $203.3 million, or 57.6% of all District revenue in FY 2023/24, and is expected to increase by $9.8 million in FY 2024/25. Over the five-year period of this CIP Plan the District’s property tax income is expect to grow at a slower but more consistent four percent annually. EMS revenues, which are generated through the provision of medical services and transport, are expected to increase at a slower rate: approximately two percent per year.

The District’s top General Fund revenue sources in FY 2024/25 are as shown on the following chart.

### FY 2024/25 General Fund Revenue Sources

- **Taxes**: $213,129,632
- **Charges for Services**: $67,652,329
- **Operating Transfers**: $4,610,000
- **Intergovernmental**: $2,463,981
- **Others**: $21,574,983

The greatest revenue risk to the District is operating transfers in, which are mainly subventions from the State and Federal government for ambulance transport of Medi-Cal and uninsured patients. These programs could be reduced or eliminated by the either government at any time—resulting in a 7.0% revenue loss and a substantial impact on operations and capital projects.

Regional economic factors, such as a downturn in the local economy, sustained high interest rates, wage depression, and unemployment will affect the housing and commercial real estate market and could have significant impact on property tax income and consequently District operations and capital projects.

Current economic conditions point to a stable and slowly growing local economy. Unemployment in the Sacramento region is expected to stay low: the regional unemployment rate averaged 3.5% in May 2024, according to the most recent data from the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The District’s property tax consultant, HdL Coren and Cone, shared that the median home price in Sacramento County in the second quarter of 2024 was $515,000—up 0.1% from a year earlier.

The FY 2024/25 CIP Plan is incorporated into the FY 2024/25 Final Budget, which continues to support services, maintenance, infrastructure, facilities, and personnel, consistent with the priorities of the Board of Directors.

The CIP Budget for FY 2024/25 includes funding from five sources: General Fund, Capital Facilities Fund, Development Impact Fee Fund, Leased Properties Fund, and Special Projects Fund. The Finance Division and the Executive Team reviewed ranked projects and determined the effect on Fund Balances/Net Assets to ensure availability of funds to complete each project. Available fund balance and capital revenue sources were calculated by Finance Division, with input from the respective divisions.

**APPENDIX A: BUDGETARY BASIS OF ACCOUNTING**

The accounting policies of the District conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The accounts of the District are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered a separate accounting entity. Fund accounting segregates funds according to their purpose and is used to aid management in demonstrating compliance with finance-related legal and contractual provisions. All governmental funds (i.e., General Fund, Capital Financing, and IGT Funds) are accounted for on the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this method, revenues are recognized in the accounting period in which they become both measurable and available to finance expenditures of the current period. Revenues are recorded when received in cash, except those revenues subject to accrual (generally 60 days after year-end) are recognized when due. Expenditures are recorded in the accounting period when the liability is incurred. Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recognized when earned, while expenses are recognized when they are incurred.

Expenditures are controlled at the fund level for all budgeted divisions within the District, the level at which expenditures may not legally exceed appropriations. The budgets are adopted on a basis consistent with GAAP and in accordance with standards established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), California Society of Municipal Finance Officers (CSMFO) and Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA).

The District follows a predictable annual budgeting process, with a preliminary budget adopted by July 1, a final budget adopted by October 1, and a midyear budget, which updates all revenues and expenditures adopted in the final budget, by March 15 of the following calendar year.

**Project #:** 25-08  
**Project Title:** Copter 2 Hoist Upgrade  
**Project Type:** Apparatus & Equipment Acquisition  
**Project Location:** Station 115  
**Project Year(s):** 2025-2026  
**Priority:** 3  
**Division:** Air Operations  

---

### Project Description:  
Upgrade of the Rescue Hoist on Copter 2 to match Copters 1 and 3. The current hoist is an early model that lacks safety features and has different operational features that change crew actions and coordination during high risk missions. Fleet standardization is a long term goal as laid out in the Metro Fire Air Operations vision statement signed by the former Fire Chief.  

### Strategic Alignment  
| A/E Replacement Schedule | ☐ A – General Fund | $140 |  
| Facility Condition Assessment | ☐ D – Capital Facilities Fund | $260 |  
| Standards of Cover | ☐ G – Grant Fund | $ |  
| Growth Plan | ☐ I – Impact Fee Fund | $ |  
| Special Project | ☒ L – Leased Facilities Fund | $ |  

### Procurement Process/Timeline Description:  
The manufacturer of the Hoist we use is the only source to obtain the item. Installation costs are well below the need for an RFB. Therefore the part would be sole sourced and the installation would go to the lowest quote that meets our needs. From the time of PO approval to completed install would span 2 fiscal years or roughly 20 months.

**Project Type:** Facilities Repair/Replacement  
**Project Location:** District-Wide  
**Division:** Facilities  

---

### Project Description:  
This project represents the total scope of outstanding deferred facilities lifecycle replacement items (items that are beyond expected life), as reported in a 2018 Facilities Condition Assessment.  

At a minimum, funding is requested in FY24/25 for HQ roof rehabilitation to extend the life of the roof and replacement of existing carpet with LVT flooring at Stations 108, 53, and 31 in order to reduce contaminant exposure.  

---

### Procurement Process/Timeline Description:  
Staff intends to parcel the scope by trade (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, etc.) and utilize the formal bidding process to complete each scope. All deferred maintenance items should be complete within 12 months.  

Per CUPCCAA procedures and the District's purchasing policy, the HQ roof rehab will require a formal bidding process and the flooring replacements would require an informal bidding process. Completion is anticipated in FY24/25.

## METRO FIRE CAPITAL PROJECT INITIATION FORM  

**Project #:** 25-13  
**Project Type:** Firefighting Foam Replacement  
**Project Year(s):** 2025  
**Priority:** 2  
**Project Type:** Miscellaneous  
**Project Location:** District-Wide  
**Division:** Special Ops  

### Project Description:  
The FAA has been directed through the Omnibus Spending Bill to transition firefighting foam away from fluorinated firefighting foam or foam containing PFAS. California State SB 1044 and AB 756 also dictate the replacement of all firefighting foams containing PFAS. The FAA direction for airports is September 2024 (4 totes). The SB 1044 requirements have several different dates with options for a waiver, so timing is unclear on the remaining 4 totes. This project would replace all PFAS containing foams (8 totes) in Metro Fire. Additionally, the replacement of products containing PFAS will reduce exposure of our members to known carcinogens.  

### Procurement Process/Timeline Description:  
Once a specification is identified, procurement will be limited by product availability only. Project timeline would be early 2025 budget year to meet FAA Airport requirements. By meeting the September timeline, we would be able to coordinate the disposal of old foam with Sacramento County Department of Airports, saving us potentially thousands of dollars in disposal costs.

**Project #:** 25-20  
**Project Title:** Hose and Nozzle Replacement  
**Project Type:** Apparatus & Equipment Replacement  
**Project Location:** District-Wide  
**Project Year(s):** 2025  
**Priority:** 2  
**Division:** Operations  

---

### Project Description:  
The Operations Division proposes a 3-year phased replacement of hose and nozzles for frontline and reserve engines as well as some additional for stock. A significant portion of hose is beyond its serviceable life and accurate tracking is unable to be completed due to serial numbers being abraded from the hose. Existing nozzles are also nearing end of life and should be replaced alongside the hose for operational efficiency. This request reflects the year 1 proposed costs of the phased replacement plan.  

---

### Procurement Process/Timeline Description:  
Specifications for the new equipment are already complete. The purchase would be done under a cooperative purchasing agreement that would be approved by the Purchasing Agent. Time from purchase to receipt of the items is approximately 26 weeks.

| Does this project contribute to the completion of another capital project, either underway or planned? If yes, please explain below. |     | X  |
| Will this project impact operations during completion (i.e. displacement, service interruption, etc.)? If yes, please explain below. | X   |    |
| Will require apparatus to be out of service for the swap out of hose. As apparatus are outfitted with new hose and nozzles a coordination plan will be developed that includes Logistics, Fleet, Operations, and Training. |     |    |
| Is additional information required to confirm scope and/or specifications before the project can be implemented? If yes, please explain below. |     | X  |

**Once completed, what is the anticipated operational impact and ongoing operating cost of the project?**  
The anticipated operational impact will be improved fire flows from the new hose and greater maneuverability. The new hose will have a better mechanism to track the hose cradle to grave allowing for the opportunity to identify trends and to assist with future budgeting.  

This will be year one of a three-year phase in replacement to avoid all hose “timing out” at the same time. Ongoing operating costs following the completion of all three phases will be an ongoing purchase of hose to avoid having to make large purchases in the future. There is a potential cost savings based on reduced replacement and repair costs due to older hose being removed from service and new hose being placed into service. The new hose is lighter than the existing hose and could ultimately reduce injuries which reduces Worker’s Compensation expenses. The new nozzles have a decreased nozzle reaction which should decrease FF fatigue and better stream shape allowing more water to hit the target area.

**Project #:** 25-23  
**Project Title:** Station Cellular Conversion  
**Project Type:** Miscellaneous  
**Project Location:** District-Wide  
**Project Year(s):** 2025  
**Priority:** 3  
**Division:** IT  

### Project Description:  
This project proposes converting 37 existing Comcast and AT&T circuits (from HQ to fire stations) to cellular in order to save money and provide a better uptime as our current circuits experience outages during storms and routine maintenance from the provider.  

Current annual cost for existing circuits is $247,704 ($6,000.7,348/station). One-time project conversion cost is $184,260 ($4,800/station) with an estimated total annual operating cost of $17,760 ($480/station). **Budget for existing circuits can be used to fully fund this project, and would result in a net savings for every converted station.**  

### Procurement Process/Timeline Description:  
Cellular survey and testing to identify the carrier should be complete by July. Equipment will be procured through a registered deal with the manufacturer during July. Installation will begin ASAP following equipment procurement in order to maximize savings, and should be complete within 3 months.

**Project Description:**  
L3 MDCs have reached end of life and are no longer supported. Over the last three fiscal years, Panasonic Toughbooks have been incrementally phased in to replace the MDC Fleet. We are at the point where the remaining L3 MDCs need to be removed from service. IT is moving forward with funding the replacement MDCs during FY25 through a Panasonic purchasing agreement. This MDC hardware (docking stations and power supplies) is required for the MDCs to function. Not purchasing this hardware will leave MDCs on the shelf until this hardware can be purchased.

**Procurement Process/Timeline Description:**  
The required budget for this project falls within the threshold and will follow the Informal Bid process. As soon as this project is funded, quotes will be obtained from various vendors in the July/August timeframe. Depending on supply chain, equipment should be delivered within three to four months of ordering. After equipment delivery, Communications Division will replace hardware and MDCs over the span of six months ensuring all MDCs replaced by end of 24/25 fiscal year.

**Project #:** 25-28  
**Project Title:** SCBA Bone Conduction Speakers  
**Project Year(s):** 2025  
**Priority:** 2  
**Project Type:** Apparatus & Equipment Replacement  
**Project Location:** District-Wide  
**Division:** Communications  

---

**Project Description:**  
Metro Fire received new SCBAs in 2021 that have not gone into service yet. These SCBAs came with Blue Tooth Radio Direct Interface (RDI) which allows a first responder to talk on the radio through a mic inside the SCBA mask. The bone conduction speaker portion of the RDI was not purchased during initial SCBA procurement. Utilizing RDI without bone conduction is not safe because, 1) There is no notification to the first responder if the radio becomes disconnected from the SCBA Mask and 2) The radio loud speaker is located on the chest strap making it difficult to hear radio transmissions. This project would add bone conduction to each SCBA mask to enable the user to receive notifications and hear radio transmissions regardless of surrounding noise. This will create safer conditions for first responders while in IDLH environments. Operations will not approve the use of RDI without the use of bone conduction.  

**Procurement Process/Timeline Description:**  
The budget for this project requires a formal bid process be followed unless purchasing through a contract. As soon as this project is funded, quotes will be obtained from various vendors in the July/August 2024 timeframe. Depending on supply chain, equipment should be delivered within three to four months of ordering. After equipment delivery, Communications Division will coordinate installation of devices with Safety.

# METRO FIRE CAPITAL PROJECT INITIATION FORM

**Project #:** 25-30  
**Project Title:** Station 42 Relocation  
**Project Type:** New Construction  
**Project Location:** Watt/Myrtle  
**Project Year(s):** 2025-2027  
**Priority:** 1  
**Division:** Planning/Dev  

## Project Description:
Station 42 was built in 1962. Call volume and operational needs dictate that this station needs to add capacity and be relocated to a more operationally efficient location. Metro Fire conducted a deployment study in the early 2000’s that indicated the station should be relocated to the south to improve response times. In 2003, Metro Fire purchased a 5-acre site in North Highlands at Watt and Myrtle intended for the relocation of Station 42. The 2023 Standards of Cover validated the need for putting this station in service.

## Procurement Process/Timeline Description:
Total project timeline is estimated at 3 years, including 1 year design time and 2 years construction. All procurement types are anticipated for project completion including formal bidding for design and construction, sole source for some design and construction elements, and a combination of informal and formal bidding for furniture, fixtures, and equipment.

**Project Year(s):** 2025  
**Priority:** 2  
**Project Type:** Apparatus & Equipment Replacement  
**Project Location:** Station 52  
**Division:** Training  

### Project Description:  
The proposed project would replace the two-story burn prop at Station 52. After several hundred burns in the downstairs chamber, there is a significant amount of warping to the chamber. The chamber welds have detached in several places exposing the interior thermal insulation and the stability of the container is beginning to degrade. All the wear and tear of the chamber is due to its high-volume use over the last seven years, providing both mandated and functional job training for all line personnel. The manufacturer has confirmed that the prop needs to be replaced to continue providing mandated training for firefighter academies, while still providing them a safe learning environment. The fees include full replacement and installation of the 40' burn prop.  

### Procurement Process/Timeline Description:  
This project will require a formal bidding process and is anticipated to be completed in FY24/25.

**Additional Project Information**  
| Yes | No |  
|-----|----|  
| Is this project a repeat request of a previously unfunded project? | X | ☐ |  
| Does this project contribute to the completion of another capital project, either underway or planned? If yes, please explain below. | ☐ | X |

**Once completed, what is the anticipated operational impact and ongoing operating cost of the project?**  
Anticipated operational impact and costs depend on the amount of training we are able to conduct within the District. Without replacing the prop, the ability to do live fire training for the members and the Academy will not be able to be done after 2025. Even with patch work and fixing the current prop, the life expectancy and safety of the prop are diminishing. If we do not have a live fire component in the Academy our ALA status may be affected as well as our ability to provide all the necessary courses/evaluations for recruits to obtain their Firefighter 1 certificate.

**Project #:** 25-41

**Project Type:** Personal Protective Equipment Acquisition  
**Project Location:** District-Wide  
**Project Year(s):** 2025  
**Priority:** 3  
**Division:** Safety  

---

### Project Description:  
Currently Metro Fire has 3 different wildland specs from the original dual layer garments that were purchased over 10 years ago to the original Cal Fire spec. Now the single layer pant and next gen Cal Fire coats lead to differing levels of protection and inconsistencies in design and fit. The oldest garments cannot be repaired and need to be replaced.  

This project would replace the remaining 950 dual layer pants with the current single layer pant specification to ensure all personnel are in the same spec.

**Project Type:** Apparatus & Equipment Replacement  
**Project Location:** District-Wide  
**Project Year(s):** 2025  
**Priority:** 2  
**Division:** Communications  

---

### Project Description:
Replacement of all District 800 MHz and VHF portable radios with single multi-band portable radios. Current 800 MHz and VHF portable radios are beyond expected life and have been discontinued by the manufacturer. Radio inventories have dropped from radios not being able to be repaired due to obsolete parts. Replacement radios will be newer models capable of transmitting on both 800 MHz and VHF frequencies, eliminating the need for two separate radios. Replacement radios will ensure communications remain intact on incidents and while in IDLH situations.

### Procurement Process/Timeline Description:
As soon as this project is funded, PO would be issued July/August 2024. Motorola has the contract with Sacramento County. Equipment should be delivered within four-six months of ordering. After equipment delivery, Communications Division would coordinate training and replacement with operations to take place before the end of 24/25 fiscal year.

## BOARD POLICY

**POLICY TITLE:** Capital Improvement Program Policy  
**OVERSIGHT:** Administration  
**POLICY NUMBER:** 01.019.01  
**EFFECTIVE DATE:** 03/22/22  
**REVIEW DATE:** 03/22/22  

### Background
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District's (District) Capital Improvement Program (CIP) organizes, facilitates, and memorializes capital needs and goals in order to efficiently and transparently develop and support the physical infrastructure of the District. Rigorous and methodical evaluation of facility, apparatus, and equipment needs and financing options will ensure that existing and future capital needs are met, in compliance with the District’s strategic plan and financial resources.

### Purpose
This policy defines the process to identify and plan for funding of capital projects in order to ensure timely acquisition and replacement of needed capital assets, improvements, and facilities.

### Scope
This policy is applicable to all District personnel involved in planning for the District's capital needs.

### Definitions
1. **Capital Project:** Any expenditure for facilities, improvements, apparatus, or equipment with a cost greater than $50,000 and an expected useful life of at least one year. These projects include apparatus and equipment acquisition and replacement; improvements to District facilities; and the construction or rehabilitation of District properties and facilities including feasibility studies, land acquisition, architecture and engineering, and other associated planning costs.

2. **Capital Facilities Fund:** A separate accounting for budgeting and reporting purposes used to track expenditures for capital outlay not associated with new development.

3. **Capital Improvement Program (CIP):** A multi-year program and plan that identifies capital projects necessary for the implementation of the District’s various long-range plans including the Standards of Cover, Growth Plan, Facility Condition Assessment, and Apparatus and Equipment Replacement Schedule. The CIP includes a five-year projection, including a one-year funding recommendation, and financing options.

4. **Development Impact Fee CIP Reserves:** Reserves accumulated for the purchase of infrastructure to support new or expanding development. These reserves include funding from Development Impact Fees and General Fund transfers.

**Capital Improvement Plan Policy**  
01.019.01  
03/22/2022  

5. **General Fund:** For budgeting and reporting purposes, Metro Fire records all transactions in the General Fund that are not specifically accounted for in any other fund. The other funds include the Capital Facilities Fund, the Leased Properties Fund, the Grant Fund, the Development Impact Fees Fund, and the Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) Fund.

6. **Grant Fund:** For budgeting and reporting purposes, Metro Fire records all grant related revenue and expenditures in the Grant Fund, in accordance with Federal grant rules and regulations.

7. **Leased Properties Fund:** For budgeting and reporting purposes, Metro Fire records all transactions for real property owned by the District but leased to other entities in the Leased Properties Fund.

**Policy**  
1. **Capital Needs and Plans**  
   a. It is the policy of the District to prepare a Capital Improvement Program (CIP) that outlines capital needs of the District that:  
      i. Are responsive to the changing needs of the District  
      ii. Demonstrate excellence in quality and value  
      iii. Enable District staff to carry out their duties in an efficient and customer-focused manner  
      iv. Provide a healthy, safe, secure, productive, and equitable environment for our employees in order to promote efficient service delivery.  
   b. The CIP incorporates and is consistent with District master plans, Board of Director's goals, and other long-range plans of the District. Capital projects may be funded from capital improvement funds, development impact fees, grant funding, or debt financing, with operational costs funded by the General Fund.  
   c. Since capital projects may span multiple fiscal years, the CIP details anticipated annual capital expenditures for a five-year period. This allows the District's Board of Directors to regularly revisit the plan and project progress, and better anticipate future needs.  

2. **CIP Updates**  
   a. The CIP is updated annually, and a one-year CIP budget is included in the District's annual budget. The remaining four years of the five-year CIP provide a look-ahead of capital projects, including anticipated costs and funding sources. The recommendation to incur new indebtedness may be included in the annual CIP budget, and requires approval by the Board of Directors.

**Procedures**  
1. **Plan Development**

1. **Development of the CIP**  
   a. The development of the CIP is a coordinated effort across the District, with the capital project planning process overseen by the Planning and Development Division and the finance and budget process elements overseen by the Finance Division. Plan development includes the following:  
      i. Divisions submit capital project requests by submitting Capital Project Initiation Forms to the CIP administrator in the Planning and Development Division.  
      ii. Capital Project Initiation Forms document the project description, timeline, procurement type, funding amount, funding source, impact on operations, any relevant ties to other projects, project justification, and related supporting information.  
      iii. The CIP administrator compiles all submitted requests and works with the Finance Division to package the requests into the draft CIP.  

2. **Capital Project Evaluation and Prioritization**  
   a. Capital project requests will be evaluated and prioritized as follows:  
      i. The CIP Committee (Committee), made up of representatives from the Finance, Planning and Development, and Purchasing divisions, reviews all proposed capital projects submitted for the upcoming fiscal year.  
      ii. The Committee determines whether or not the District has the capacity to complete all or a portion of each proposed project within the upcoming fiscal year; whether or not each proposed project is ready for execution in the upcoming fiscal year; and determines a ranking for each proposed project according to the District's goals and objectives.  
      iii. Primary evaluation criteria for capital projects includes alignment with strategic plans, statutory and regulatory considerations, and impact on service delivery.  
      iv. Other considerations may include impact on operating costs, secondary financial impacts, management and oversight implications, and impact on constituents and stakeholders.  
      v. After evaluation, the CIP Committee submits a proposed CIP, including a one-year CIP budget, to the Fire Chief for consideration in conjunction with the preliminary budget review process.  

3. **Plan Adoption and CIP Budget Approval**  
   a. The proposed CIP is reviewed annually by the Fire Chief, Deputy Chiefs, and Chief Financial Officer as part of the preliminary budget review process.  
   b. The Fire Chief may recommend to fund, partially fund, or not fund any given project based the criteria and considerations outlined in Section 2.
