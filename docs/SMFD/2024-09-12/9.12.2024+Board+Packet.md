# OPERATIONS REPORT – (Deputy Chief Mitchell)

## Squad 53 Implementation
- Our call volume has grown exponentially over time, resulting in our members and apparatus becoming busier and busier.
- One way we have been able to adapt to the growth in demand for services is through implementation of the squad response model, and we have seen great success with this model.
- Fortunately, through consistent exploration of budget efficiencies and the work of multiple divisions, we have been able to find innovative and fiscally responsible ways to support our members in the field. This has resulted in our ability to deploy a 4th squad unit.
- I’m happy to announce to the Board tonight that through collaboration with a number of folks, Operations has determined that Squad 53 will be implemented as our 4th squad unit on or before September 4, 2024 as an additional first responder.
- We are not done. We still need more resources in the streets. We look forward to continuing adapting to the needs of our community, and pursuing innovative ways of delivering service to the public through the right resource, with the right capabilities, at the right time.

**DATE:** 09-12-2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Purchase Approval – Purchase of FLIR K65 Thermal Imagers from W.S. Darley & Co. Using Sourcewell Cooperative Contract #020124-WSD  

**TOPIC**  
Staff requests Board approval for the purchase of FLIR K65 Thermal Imaging Cameras (Imagers) and accessories from W.S. Darley & Co. using Sourcewell contract #020124-WSD. These Imagers are part of a 2-year plan to replace the aging ISG/INFRASYS Elite XR imagers that were purchased through a grant in 2012.  

**BACKGROUND**  
Currently the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) supplies captains and truck members with ISG/INFRASYS Elite XR imagers and Seek Reveal FirePROs for all riding positions. After conducting a review of both current imagers, it was determined that the District was in need of a larger, more rugged NFPA-certified imager designed explicitly as a decision-making tool. The needed imager would give a company officer essential thermal information to assist in making tactical decisions for their crews.  

To determine which imager would best meet the needs of the District, the District’s Safety Division, in conjunction with the District’s Purchasing Division, issued a Request for Information (RFI) for an NFPA-certified thermal imager. Five imager manufacturers responded to the RFI: Bullard Safety, Seek Thermal, Teledyne FLIR, Avon Protection, and MSA Safety Sales, LLC. As a part of the evaluation process, each interested proposer was required to present their proposed imager to a group of evaluators. The evaluators included members of the District’s Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Team. Each proposer was allowed 60 minutes to present their proposed imager and answer questions from the evaluators. Based upon presentation scores, three manufacturers were invited to continue in the evaluation process and participate in field-trials; those manufacturers were Seek Thermal, Bullard Safety, and Teledyne FLIR.  

Seek Thermal, Bullard Safety, and Teledyne FLIR were asked to provide three of their proposed imagers for live-fire testing. All imagers were issued to evaluators three weeks prior to live-fire testing for familiarization in the field before live-fire testing. Evaluators could use the imagers in the field and during training and give other members exposure during drills and other activities. Live-fire testing took place at Station 52 on September 27, 2023. The Training Division, in addition to the reserve firefighters and the Fire Behavior Cadre  

**Serving Sacramento and Placer Counties**  
P11
<!-- Page 12 -->
![Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+2)

were asked to participate. The evaluators were broken up into groups, with members of each group simultaneously evaluating each Imager in the same environment. To better recreate the changing environments within a structure fire, the evaluation team designed a course of activities based upon multiple conditions and tactics to take place inside the live-fire training Dräger Phase 5 Prop. The FLIR K65 imager received the highest score in field-trial evaluations.

## DISCUSSION

The PPE Team recommends that the District purchase the FLIR K65 to replace the District's current Imagers. Each Imager comes with a standard warranty and free in-service training by a FLIR factory representative. An enhanced warranty is available for an additional $1,800 per Imager, however, the PPE Team does not foresee the cost to repair damaged Imagers exceeding the cost of the enhanced warranty and has therefore decided to decline the enhanced warranty at this time. Budgeted funds in the Fiscal Year (FY) 24/25 Final Budget would replace Imagers on front-line RIC engines and trucks, Imagers used in the Training Division, and Imagers used for fire academies. These funds would also be used to build a stock of imagers and accessories in the Safety Division. Funds will be requested in FY 25/26 to outfit the remaining engines within the District's fleet.

Sourcewell cooperative agreement #020124-WSD will be utilized to purchase these Imagers. Sourcewell is a state of Minnesota local government unit and service cooperative that facilitates competitive public solicitations and contract award processes for the benefit of its 50,000+ participating entities across the United States and Canada. Cooperative purchasing provides participating agencies increased administrative efficiencies and the power of combined purchasing volume that results in overall cost savings. Purchasing has reviewed the documents from Sourcewell in relation to contract #020124-WSD and has confirmed the District may utilize this cooperative agreement.

## FISCAL IMPACT

The proposed cost for the FLIR K65 imagers is $225,358.73. This cost is included in the District FY 2024/2025 Final Budget.

## RECOMMENDATION

Staff Recommends that the Board authorize the purchase of FLIR K65 thermal imaging cameras and accessories from W.S. Darley & Co. using Sourcewell contract #020124-WSD.

**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** September 12, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Adopt Resolution: Reimbursement For Tax Exempt Debt  

**TOPIC**  
Staff recommends adoption of the attached reimbursement resolution to reimburse the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District ("District") for funds that have been or may be expended prior to issuing tax-exempt debt. The recommended action is in anticipation of the District entering into a capital lease transaction to fund the purchase of budgeted capital expenditures.  

**DISCUSSION**  
In order to legally reimburse expenditures made prior to the issuance of tax-exempt debt, a reimbursement resolution must be in place pursuant to U.S. Treasury regulation Section 1.150-2. Adoption of a reimbursement resolution does not bind the District to issuing future debt. Instead, a reimbursement resolution allows the District to use its own funds for capital expenditures and later repay itself from the financing proceeds.  

Purchases made after the reimbursement resolution adoption and those made no more than 60 days prior to adoption are eligible for reimbursement. Staff anticipates the recommendation to finance not more than $15,300,000 of capital purchases in accordance with the Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and the FY 2024/25 Final Budget. The capital purchases expected to be financed and received in the current fiscal year includes medical equipment, storage appliance replacements, squad vehicles, ambulances, ambulance remounts, ambulance replacements, a Type I engine replacement, a Type III engine replacement, a ladder truck and a fleet service truck.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Adoption of the resolution will allow reimbursement of qualified District expenditures up to $15,300,000. These purchases are included in the District's FY 2024/25 Final Budget.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends adoption of the attached reimbursement resolution.

**DATE:** September 12, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  

**SUBJECT:** Consider Approving Resolution to Utilize Sacramento Area Council of Governments Cooperative Purchasing Agreements for Fuels  

**TOPIC**  
Staff requests approval to utilize the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) cooperative agreement with Hunt & Sons LLC. for the purchase of automotive fuels.  

**BACKGROUND**  
To ensure continuous service delivery, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District has an ongoing need to purchase various types of fuels for the District's various types of vehicles and apparatus. Since 2019, the District has been utilizing SACOG’s current cooperative purchasing agreement for fuels and lubricants. This agreement expired on August 30, 2024.  

**DISCUSSION**  
On May 7, 2024, SACOG issued a new Request for Proposals (RFP) to procure automotive fuel and lubricants. This RFP was designed as a cooperative purchasing agreement where SACOG will be administering the agreement for government agencies within the Sacramento Region. Additionally, the District was listed in the RFP as one of 40 participating agencies.  

On August 8, 2024, SACOG informed the District that they will be awarding an agreement for all fuel products to Hunt and Sons, LLC and an agreement to Hunt & Sons, Inc for lubricants and propane as a result of their RFP. The agreements will be for a period of three years with the option to negotiate for an additional two years. On August 26, 2024, the District received notice from SACOG that their contracts had been fully executed by the vendors.  

Utilizing the cooperative purchasing procurement method provides participating agencies increased administrative efficiencies and the power of combined purchasing volume that results in overall cost savings.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
$1,415,000 for automotive fuels is already included in the District’s FY 2024/2025 Final Budget.  

**Serving Sacramento and Placer Counties**

Contract #: CT250004

California Government Code Section 1090 prohibits public officials from having an economic interest in their agencies' contracts.

Fire Chief  

**DATE:** September 12, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Resolution Adopting the Fiscal Year 2024/25 Appropriations Limit Schedule  

**TOPIC**  
A resolution has been prepared establishing an appropriation limit for Fiscal Year 2024/25 in the amount of $452,663,227. Staff recommends approval of the proposed resolution.  

**SUMMARY**  
State law requires that every government entity in California prepare calculations each fiscal year of the entity's maximum allowed appropriations. The formula used to make these calculations involves adjusting the entity's previous "Gann limit" by incorporating changes to population and per capita income. These factors are provided by the State Department of Finance. A governmental entity is not permitted to spend more than its calculated Gann limit.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Based upon staff calculations, the District's Gann limit for FY 2024/25 is $452,663,227 which represents an increase of $14,587,908 when compared to the FY 2023/24 Gann limit of $438,075,319. This increase is due to a 3.62% increase in per capita income statewide, slightly offset by 0.28% average decrease in the population of the cities and unincorporated area within the District. Calculation details can be found in the attached schedule.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
There is no fiscal impact. The District's FY 2024/25 proposed operating budget subject to the limit is well below the $452,663,227 set by the Gann limit.

**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** September 12, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Purchase Approval – Personal Protective Equipment  

**TOPIC**  
Staff requests approval from the Board of Directors for the purchase of structural firefighting turnouts for Fire Academy Class 24-2 from Municipal Emergency Services, Inc. (MES) utilizing Sourcewell cooperative contract #010424-MES. Additionally, staff seeks Board approval for the continued utilization of this contract for future turnout purchases.  

**BACKGROUND**  
In 2022, the Board approved the purchase of turnouts from MES for recruit Academy class 22-1 using Sourcewell contract #032620-MES. That cooperative contract has expired, however, earlier this year, Sourcewell issued a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for Firefighting Personal Protective Equipment. As a result of this RFP, MES was awarded contract #010424-MES. This current contract will expire March 27, 2028.  

**DISCUSSION**  
In an effort to maintain compliance with NFPA 1851 standards, the Safety Division wishes to utilize Sourcewell contract #010424-MES to fulfill the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District’s (District) ongoing need to purchase replacement turnouts for those that are beyond repair or have reached their 10-year lifespan, in addition to the turnouts that will be needed for future fire academies. Sourcewell is a State of Minnesota local government unit and service cooperative that facilitates competitive public solicitations and contract award processes for the benefit of its 50,000+ participating entities across the United States and Canada. Cooperative purchasing provides participating agencies increased administrative efficiencies and the power of combined purchasing volume that results in overall cost savings. Purchasing has reviewed the documents from Sourcewell in relation to agreement #010424 and has confirmed the District may utilize this cooperative agreement.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The proposed cost for the Academy 24-2 structural firefighting turnouts is $221,027.75. This cost is included in the District FY 2024/2025 Final Budget, however, the District will receive an approximate savings of $18,000 if this order is placed at the same time as the District’s purchase of the MMP Fire-Dex TEGCEN51 garments that was previously approved at the August 8, 2024 Board meeting.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Serving Sacramento and Placer Counties  
P94
<!-- Page 95 -->
![Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/986x768.png?text=Page+2)

Staff recommends that the Board authorize the current purchase of structural firefighting turnouts from MES using Sourcewell contract #010424-MES, in addition to authorizing the continued utilization of this contract for future purchases until the contract expires or is terminated. Future purchases will be contingent upon the Board approving the appropriation of funds in the budget for such purchases.

**DATE:** September 12, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** ARFF Agreement – McClellan Business Park, LLC  

**TOPIC**  
Request to authorize the execution of a new agreement with McClellan Business Park, LLC for aircraft rescue and firefighting services at McClellan Airport.  

**BACKGROUND**  
Since 2000, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) has provided aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) services at McClellan Airport (MCC), to support the needs of a United States Coast Guard (USCG) Air Station located at MCC. The current agreement to provide ARFF services was approved by the Board of Directors on August 11, 2022. The agreement is between the District and McClellan Business Park, LLC (MBP), in performance of an agreement between MBP and the USCG for airfield operations and management services and ARFF services. The term of the District's current agreement with MBP will expire on September 15, 2024.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The USCG and MBP have recently executed a new agreement for airfield operations, management, and ARFF services (2024 AIRSTA Agreement), with a one-year term effective September 16, 2024, and two one-year options to extend. MBP desires to continue subcontracting ARFF services to the District in performance of their new agreement with the USCG.  

The District and MBP have negotiated a new ARFF agreement that remains materially similar to past agreements, while addressing certain terms related to minimum staffing requirements as well as the transition to PFAS-free firefighting foam.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The District's total anticipated cost to provide ARFF services in performance of the agreement is $4,425,017 in year one, $4,374,356 in year two, and $4,530,785 in year three. The proposed agreement reflects a 100% reimbursement of this cost, including one-time costs in year one associated with the transition to PFAS-free firefighting foam to meet federal and state mandates.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board adopt a resolution to delegate authority to the Fire Chief or his designee to execute and administer an agreement with McClellan Business Park, LLC for providing aircraft rescue and firefighting services at McClellan Airport.

B. The Sacramento Regional Fire/EMS Communications Center (SRFECC) will continue to provide dispatch services in accordance with their existing jurisdiction and normal operations.

6. FURNISHED EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES

A. The PWS section 3.0 (Government Furnished Property) provides that the Government (USCG) will furnish one (1) 2001 Model P150 ARFF vehicle, 4x4, 1500 gallon Emergency One Titan, VIN #4ENBAA8X110003122. The PWS, incorporated herein as Exhibit "B", provides that Contractor will be responsible for maintenance, repair and inspection of the furnished vehicle and at the end of the term of the contract will return it to the Government in good working order. The PWS obligates the Contractor to furnish all other equipment with the exception of the ARFF unit provided by Government.

B. It is expressly understood and agreed that METRO FIRE's ability to perform under the Government PWS is contingent upon METRO FIRE providing one operationally ready ARFF vehicle, described in paragraph A above, both equipped with automated turrets. In order to maintain operational readiness, the Government shall promptly replace any furnished vehicle that has reached the end of its useful life in accordance with Section 23 of the USCG Safety and Environmental Health Manual (COMDTINST M5100.47D).

C. The Contractor will reimburse METRO FIRE for the disposal and replacement of Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) to meet State and Federal regulations pertaining to the use of foam that is free from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

D. Fire Station 114 is comprised of Building 1074 and Building 636 (Building 636 is used for storage). Under a separate agreement, the County of Sacramento provides Fire Station 114 for use by METRO FIRE. METRO FIRE's performance under the PWS is contingent upon continued use of Fire Station 114.

**9. INDEMNIFICATION**

To the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Parties (MBP and Metro Fire) shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless each of the other Parties, their respective governing boards, officers, directors, officials, employees, and authorized volunteers and agents (collectively Indemnified Parties), from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, damages, and all expenses and costs incidental thereto (collectively Claims), including cost of defense, settlement, arbitration, and reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from injuries to or death of persons, including but not limited to employees of either Party hereto, and damage to or destruction of property, or loss of use or reduction in value thereof, including but not limited to the property of either Party hereto, arising out of, pertaining to, or resulting from the alleged or actual acts or omissions of their respective governing boards, officers, directors, officials, employees, volunteers, agents, or contractors.

It is the intention of the Parties that the provisions of this indemnity obligation be interpreted to impose on each Party responsibility to the other for the acts and omissions of their governing boards, officers, directors, officials, employees, authorized volunteers and agents, or contractors. It is also the intention of the Parties that, where comparative fault is determined to have been contributory, principles of comparative fault will be followed and each Party shall bear the proportionate cost of any Claims attributable to the fault of that Party, its governing board, officers, directors, officials, employees, volunteers, agents, or contractors.

The right to defense and indemnity under this Section arises upon occurrence of an event giving rise to a Claim and, thereafter, upon tender in writing to the indemnifying party. The indemnifying party shall defend the Indemnified Party with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled, on its own behalf, and at the expense of the indemnifying party, to assume control of its defense or the defense of any Indemnified Party in any legal action, with counsel reasonably selected by it. Should the Indemnified Party elect to initially assume control of its defense, or the defense of any Indemnified Party, it does so without prejudice to its right to subsequently request that the indemnifying party thereafter assume control of the defense and pay all attorneys' fees and costs incurred thereby.

This indemnity obligation shall not be limited by the types and amounts of insurance or self-insurance maintained by the Parties.

Nothing in this indemnity obligation shall be construed to create any duty to, any standard of care with reference to, or any liability or obligation, contractual or otherwise, to any third party.

Page 4 of 74  
P102
<!-- Page 103 -->
The provisions of this indemnity obligation shall survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement.

10. INSURANCE OR SELF-INSURANCE  
Each party, at its sole cost and expense, shall carry insurance - or self-insure - its activities in connection with this Agreement, and obtain, keep in force and maintain, insurance or equivalent programs of self-insurance, for general liability, workers compensation, property, professional liability, cyber liability and business automobile liability with policy or contracts limits of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence and three million dollars ($3,000,000.00) in the aggregate. Each party agrees to provide the other thirty (30) days' advance written notice of any cancellation, termination or lapse of any of the insurance or self-insurance coverages. Failure to maintain insurance as required in this Agreement is a material breach of contract and may be grounds for termination of the Agreement.

11. TERMINATION  
A. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days written notice of the substantial failure of performance or material breach of this Agreement by the other party, provided such terminating party first transmits written notice of intent to terminate to the party failing to perform and allows such party a reasonable opportunity to cure or correct said failure of performance.  
B. MBP may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice served upon METRO FIRE in the event that USCG terminates the 2024 AIRSTA Agreement with MBP, or said Agreement otherwise expires or is cancelled pursuant to the terms of that Agreement. Notice shall be deemed served on the date of mailing.

12. ENTIRE AGREEMENT  
This Agreement, all exhibits attached hereto, all other terms or provisions incorporated herein by reference, and any notices issued in accordance with the terms hereto constitute the entire Agreement and understanding between MBP and METRO FIRE as to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior negotiations, representations, or agreements, whether written or oral. This agreement shall be interpreted as having been drafted by both parties.

13. AMENDMENTS  
This Agreement may be amended only by written instrument, signed by both MBP and METRO FIRE as authorized by action of their respective governing boards, if applicable.

14. DUPLICATE COUNTERPARTS  
This Agreement may be executed in duplicate counterparts. The Agreement shall be deemed executed when it has been signed by both parties.  

Page 5 of 74  
P103
<!-- Page 104 -->
15. CHOICE OF LAW/VENUE  
This Agreement shall be enforced and/or interpreted pursuant to the laws of the State of California. Any action involving enforcement, interpretation, or breach of this Agreement shall be venued in the Superior Court for the County of Sacramento, State of California.

16. ASSIGNMENT  
Neither party shall voluntarily or by operation of law assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement without the other party’s written consent.

17. SEVERABILITY  
If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable.

It is applicable during the event of a continuing resolution to fund government operations enacted by Congress until the regular appropriation is enacted. It would be applicable in this event during the base or any subsequent option years. In addition, written notice will provided in specific contract modifications.

(a) Contract line item(s) listed below are incrementally funded or fully funded as shown in the below table. For these item(s), the sum of $ * of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. This funding table will be updated in each contract action that provides additional funds, if any. (Amounts below will be added by each incremental funding modification when issued)

(d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a), the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.

(e) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a).

(f) The termination provisions of paragraphs (h) through (i) do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled "Default" or "Termination for Cause." The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a). This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded.

(g) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government" or paragraph (l) entitled "Termination for the Government's Convenience" of the clause at FAR 52.212-4, "Commercial Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items."

basic safeguarding of covered contractor information systems shall include, at a minimum, the following security controls:
(i) Limit information system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of authorized users, or devices (including other information systems).
(ii) Limit information system access to the types of transactions and functions that authorized users are permitted to execute.
(iii) Verify and control/limit connections to and use of external information systems.
(iv) Control information posted or processed on publicly accessible information systems.

(v) Identify information system users, processes acting on behalf of users, or devices.
(vi) Authenticate (or verify) the identities of those users, processes, or devices, as a prerequisite to allowing access to organizational information systems.
(vii) Sanitize or destroy information system media containing Federal Contract Information before disposal or release for reuse.
(viii) Limit physical access to organizational information systems, equipment, and the respective operating environments to authorized individuals.
(ix) Escort visitors and monitor visitor activity; maintain audit logs of physical access; and control and manage physical access devices.
(x) Monitor, control, and protect organizational communications (i.e., information transmitted or received by organizational information systems) at the external boundaries and key internal boundaries of the information systems.
(xi) Implement subnetwork for publicly accessible system components that are physically or logically separated from internal networks.
(xii) Identify, report, and correct information and information system flaws in a timely manner.
(xiii) Provide protection from malicious code at appropriate locations within organizational information systems.
(xiv) Update malicious code protection mechanisms when new releases are available.
(xv) Perform periodic scans of the information system and real-time scans of files from external sources as files are downloaded, opened, or executed.

(2) Other requirements. This clause does not relieve the Contractor of any other specific safeguarding requirements specified by Federal agencies and departments relating to covered contractor information systems generally or other Federal safeguarding requirements for controlled unclassified information (CUI) as established by Executive Order 13556.

(b) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in subcontracts under this contract (including subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services, other than commercially available off-the-shelf items), in which the subcontractor may have Federal contract information residing in or transiting through its information system.

(19) Mission Partner Identity, Credential and Access Management (MP ICAM)

(a) "Contractor employee" means an employee of a firm, or an individual, under contract or subcontract to the Coast Guard to provide services who also requires one or more of the

Page 17 of 27

Page 33 of 74

P131
<!-- Page 132 -->
![Page 34 of 74](https://via.placeholder.com/768x986.png?text=Page+34+of+74)

following:

(1) Physical access to multiple Coast Guard facilities or multiple federally controlled facilities on behalf of the Coast Guard on a recurring basis (a minimum of two (2) times per week and/or eight (8) times per month) for a period of six (6) months or more.

(2) Remote access, via logon, to Coast Guard network using Coast Guard-approved remote access procedures.

(3) Both physical access to Coast Guard facility and logical access, via logon, to Coast Guard networks on-site or remotely. Access to the Coast Guard network must require the use of a computer with government-controlled configuration or use of Coast Guard-approved remote access procedure in accordance with the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guide.

(b) Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12 mandates a federal standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for federal employees and contractor employees. The Common Access Card (CAC) is a personal identification card for the Department of Defense (DoD)/Uniformed Services and complies with HSPD-12. The Coast Guard has instituted the CAC as its HSPD-12 compliant personal identification card for contractor and subcontractor employees who are required to access a Coast Guard, DOD, or other federally-controlled computer information system and/or facility, or need public key infrastructure (PKI) authentication to perform their contractual duties. The Mission Partner Identity, Credential and Access Management (MP ICAM) (or successor system thereto) is the automated application process for obtaining a CAC.

(c) Contractor and subcontractor employees working pursuant to this contract who are required to access a Coast Guard, DOD, or other federally-controlled computer information system and/or facility, or need PKI authentication to perform their contractual duties must use MP ICAM (or successor system thereto) to obtain a CAC.

(d) The COR or Alternate COR (ACOR) is the MP ICAM Mission Partner Affiliation Sponsor (MPAS) (or successor system corresponding role thereto) and initiates contractor accounts in the MP ICAM (or successor system thereto), approving, returning, or rejecting CAC applications (as applicable), re-verifying assigned contractors every six months, revoking contractor and employee eligibility for a CAC.

(e) The MPAS ensures that contractor personnel satisfy the security requirements for CAC issuance prior to creating the CAC application in MP ICAM (or successor system thereto). Current investigative requirements must be verified according to Commandant Instruction 5500.18. The initial CAC issuance requires a favorably adjudicated Tier 1 investigation (equivalent or higher) or a Tier 1 background investigation (B) (equivalent or higher) package that has been successfully scheduled with the investigative service provider (ISP) and a FBI fingerprint check with favorable results. The MPAS and Sponsor (or successor system corresponding role) or other appropriate federal government representative must coordinate with the unit BI Verifier (Command Security Officer / Mission Partner Affiliation Sponsor Manager) or the U.S. Coast Guard Security (SECGEN) to confirm the appropriate investigation has been favorably adjudicated or scheduled at the ISP with favorable FBI fingerprint results.

(f) The COR or contracting officer (KO) provides such forms to, or requests such information

Page 18 of 27

<!-- Page 133 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x986.png?text=Document+Image)  
from, contractor employees that may be necessary for obtaining a CAC via the MP ICAM (or successor system thereto). The Contractor submits completed forms and information as directed by the COR or KO. Contractors are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information submitted and for any liability resulting from the government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete information.  
Contractor employees who are declined via the MP ICAM (or successor system thereto) are ineligible to perform work under this contract.  
When an employee with a CAC is no longer performing work under this contract, the employee must return the CAC to the COR/MPAS (or successor system corresponding role thereto) or KO on the same day the employee stops working.  
The contractor must insert this requirement in all subcontracts when a subcontractor's employee is required to access a Coast Guard, DoD, or other federally-controlled computer information system and/or facility, or need PKI authentication to perform contractual duties.

1.0 GENERAL

1.1 Mission. The Air Station Sacramento is a fixed wing aviation unit that performs a wide range of Coast Guard missions for the Eleventh Coast Guard District and Pacific Area Commands. The unit performs missions from the west coast of the United States to areas west of Canada and south along the Eastern Pacific to South America. The Air Station maintains a 24-hour immediate response capability, with a “ready” crew on duty at all times.

1.2 Scope. This Performance Work Statement (PWS) is for Airfield Services to be provided to the United States Coast Guard (hereafter called Coast Guard) at McClellan or its successor named airfield (hereafter called Airfield) and to the Coast Guard located at Coast Guard Air Station Sacramento (AIRSTA Sacramento). This requirement is made up of two major components: the first is Airfield Operation and Management services to include runways, taxiways, control ramps and aircraft parking areas, navigational aids to support Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Operations, Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS); and other airfield services such as airfield inspections and checks; an operations manual; an emergency plan; ground vehicles control; obstruction handling; wildlife hazard management; airport condition reporting; identifying, marking and reporting construction and other unserviceable areas. For this portion of the contract the Coast Guard reimburses only a portion of the Contractor’s cost which they receive along with the reimbursement from the other airport tenants.

The second major component is for Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) services, which include training and staffing in accordance with COMDTINST M5100.47D (series) and National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 403 standards, provisions of ARFF vehicle maintenance, repair, equipment, emergency communication systems, and environmental spill response, in accordance with NFPA 412 and 414 standards. This portion of the contract represents over 85% of the total contract cost.

The Contractor is responsible for the management, supervision, personnel, equipment, tools, materials, parts, maintenance repair, training, transportation, all written deliverables and all other items and services necessary to perform the above functions described in this PWS except as specified in Section 3 as Government-furnished property. The Contractor shall also maintain the airport facilities to the standards outlined herein. The Contractor Quality Control Plan (QCP) shall provide for the highest level of service delivery performance. The Contractor shall use the PWS, all exhibits and applicable documents identified in paragraph 6.0 as well as the approved QCP to accomplish the functions and tasks generated for optimal contract performance. The Contractor shall perform the requirements of the PWS in a professional manner.

2.0 CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1 Contractor Qualifications. The Contractor and any Subcontractor firms providing airfield maintenance and operations services shall have substantial relevant experience in the operation of an airfield.

**2.2 Phase In/Phase Out.**  
The Contractor shall provide a phase-in/phase-out plan within 10 days prior to contract start date. The phase-in/phase-out plan shall describe actions, plans and procedures to ensure (1) a smooth transition from contract award to full operational status and (2) a smooth transition from contract performance in the current term to performance, perhaps by a different contractor, in another term. The phase-out portion of the plan shall be updated 30 days prior to completion of the contract. The phase-out portion shall include provisions for completion of appropriate Contractor responsibilities should there be a contract termination proceeding.

**2.2.1 PHASE-IN.** The Contractor shall assume total responsibility for all operations required by the contract as of the first day of the contract period. Therefore, as of the contract start date, the Contractor shall provide a workforce fully qualified and capable of performing all work required under this contract, as well as all equipment, tools, materials and supplies to ensure capability of performing contract requirements. Beginning 30 calendar days prior to the contract start date, the Contractor will be permitted to observe any operations of the Government and incumbent Contractor. These observations include but are not limited to those pertaining to office procedures and operations, repair/maintenance operations, and any other operations deemed necessary by the incoming Contractor that will enable his personnel to become both knowledgeable and familiar with their assigned areas of responsibility. The Contractor shall ensure, during phase-in activities, that: he shall not interfere with productivity; he shall coordinate all visits in advance and arrange to be accompanied by a Government employee previously designated for that purpose; he shall confine his activities to those which can only take place prior to the contract period. Discussions with Government or Contractor’s employees while they are on duty shall be coordinated by the designated Government representative. During this phase-in period, the Contractor has no responsibility for the services required in this contract.

**2.2.2 PHASE-OUT PERIOD.** The Contractor shall present a detailed plan for any phase-out period, regardless of precipitating reasons. The plan shall include procedures for minimizing impact on performance in compliance with standards in the contract. The plan shall also (1) present procedures for retaining the required staffing level (including key personnel) necessary to provide complete contractual support through expiration of the contract and (2) describe in detail how responsibility and accountability will be relinquished for all Government-provided items. Beginning 30 calendar days immediately prior to the end of the contract period, the Contractor will be required to allow personnel from the Government and/or from a successor Contractor to observe daily operations covered under this contract. During this “phase-out” period the Contractor will remain totally responsible for the services required in this contract. The Contractor shall not defer any needed repairs or maintenance for the purpose of avoiding responsibility to the successor contractor. The Contractor shall coordinate activities with the incoming Contractor to effect a smooth and orderly transition at the end of the contract period. The Contractor shall remove all Contractor-owned equipment, tools, parts and belongings from the Government-provided facilities by midnight on the last day of the contract. The Contractor shall provide on-the-job familiarization for the incoming Contractor as required.

**2.3 Post-Award Conference.** As soon as possible after the contract start date, the Contractor shall meet in conference with the Contracting Officer and other authorized representative(s) of the Government to discuss the contract and its requirements.

In June 2023, Congressman Ami Bera visited the Zinfandel site to hear more about the project, and ultimately endorsed the project as one of his community project requests for Fiscal Year 2024.  

**DISCUSSION**  
On March 9, 2024, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024 was signed into law by the President of the United States (Public Law No. 118-42), which appropriated $1,000,000 for the Zinfandel First Responder Training Facility Emergency Vehicle Operations Course through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). On August 27, 2024, the District received a notice of award from HUD through the FY 2024 Economic Development Initiative – Community Project Funding (CPF) grant program totaling $1,000,000 for the Zinfandel First Responder Training Facility Emergency Vehicle Operations Course, with a period of performance through August 31, 2032.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Grant funding in the amount of $1,000,000 has been added to the FY 2024/25 Final Budget. There is no match requirement.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends adoption of the attached resolution accepting the FY24 Economic Development Initiative – Community Project Funding Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and requests that the Board authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to execute all required documents for the administration of the grant award.

**SUBJECT:** Opioid Remediation Activities Agreement – County of Sacramento  

**TOPIC**  
Request to authorize the execution of an agreement with Sacramento County Department of Health Services (DHS) to provide opioid remediation activities.  

**BACKGROUND**  
In response to the opioid epidemic, state, local, and tribal governments brought several lawsuits against pharmaceutical and drug distribution companies. On July 21, 2021, a $26 billion settlement offer was made by opioid manufacturer Janssen Pharmaceuticals and distributors, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, and Cardinal Health to resolve their liabilities in over 3,000 opioid crisis-related lawsuits nationwide, including with the State of California. The County of Sacramento was able to secure a portion of these settlement funds from the State for local opioid remediation activities.  

**DISCUSSION**  
On August 11, 2023, the County of Sacramento Department of Health Services (DHS), Division of Behavioral Health Services issued Request for Proposals (RFP) SUPT/067 to solicit qualified organizations to develop and implement opioid remediation activities, utilizing funding allocated from the State of California's opioid crisis-related settlement funds.  

On October 3, 2023, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) submitted a proposal to provide opioid remediation activities in response to RFP SUPT/067, and a contract award was subsequently approved by the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors on February 6, 2024 (Resolution #2024-0085). Since then, the County and the District have been working to finalize the agreement.  

The proposed scope of work includes targeted public education as well as direct services to individuals with opioid use disorders, with a term ending on June 30, 2026. Public education efforts will be coordinated between the District's Community Relations and Mobile Integrated Health (MIH) teams and will include prevention-focused social media campaigns for the general population and youth specific programming. Direct services are to be provided by the District's MIH team include linkage to treatment services, expansion of medication-assisted treatment, and implementation of a naloxone (Narcan) leave behind program.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The District's total anticipated cost to provide the proposed services is $1,100,000. The proposed agreement reflects a 100% reimbursement of this cost.

XXIX. TERMINATION  
A. Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the other party. Notice shall be deemed served on the date of mailing.

B.

In no event, however, shall COUNTY pay CONTRACTOR an amount which exceeds a pro rata portion of the Agreement total based on the portion of the Agreement term that has elapsed on the effective date of the termination.

If such post-Agreement audit finds that the actual cost of any service furnished hereunder are higher than the payments made by COUNTY for that service, then the difference will not be paid to CONTRACTOR.

F. In the event of termination of this Agreement prior to specified duration or in the event of non-renewal of contract services between CONTRACTOR and COUNTY, CONTRACTOR shall, within thirty (30) days of termination of this Agreement, declare to COUNTY any and all accounts receivables and assign to COUNTY billings of all clients and/or payers for services rendered clients for which claims have been or are being made to COUNTY for reimbursement.
