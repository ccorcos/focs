![READER’S GUIDE TO THE BUDGET](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=READER%E2%80%99S+GUIDE+TO+THE+BUDGET)

This guide is intended to help the reader understand the information in this budget report and how it is organized.

The budget report serves two distinct purposes. First, to present to the Board of Directors and the public a clear picture of the services which the District provides, the cost of those services, and the policies underlying the financial decisions. Second, to provide the District’s management with an accurate financial operating plan. The sections in this report are described below.

**CHIEF’S MESSAGE AND INTRODUCTION**  
The Fire Chief’s Budget Message provides an overview of the District’s budget, discussion of budgeted revenues and expenditures by fund, explanation of staffing changes, and a financial forecast. Major changes affecting the budget are examined fund by fund. The Fire Chief’s message also offers a comparative view with a similarly-sized agency, along with budget risks and issues.

The remainder of the introduction section provides background on the District, including the Board of Directors, strategic plan, key personnel, history, and services.

**ALL FUNDS SUMMARIES**  
This section provides a comprehensive overview of the FY 2024/25 budget for all funds. It includes tables showing combined revenues and expenditures for all of the District’s funds. Schedules of fund balance and debt service payments can also be found in this section.

**FUND ACTIVITY**  
This section includes fund-by-fund descriptions of revenues, expenditures, and transfers. The first fund, the General Fund, accounts for the operations of the District. The revenues and expenditures of the General Fund are represented on schedules to indicate the major revenue sources and uses for FY 2024/25. This section provides highlights of the General Fund, an overview of the assumptions used to develop the FY 2024/25 revenue budget, schedules of revenue sources, and changes in salaries and employee benefits and services and supplies.

Other funds included in this section are the Capital Facilities Fund, Grants Fund, Development Impact Fees Fund, Leased Properties Fund, Intergovernmental Transfer Fund and Special Projects Fund.

# FIRE CHIEF’S MESSAGE

To the Board of Directors of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District:

On behalf of the men and women of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, I am pleased to present this Fiscal Year 2024/25 Final Budget report to the Metro Fire community and Board of Directors. This budget has been constructed in conformance with the Board’s financial management and capital asset strategic plan objectives, and in the message that follows I will describe the expected fiscal condition the District through June 30, 2025, and identify external and structural risks to our long-term fiscal health.

## BUDGET SUMMARY

In FY 2024/25 the District’s budget will reach $381.3 in total fund expenditures, including $309.3 million General Fund, while revenues will reach $329.8 million overall, including $287.9 million General Fund. Since the Preliminary Budget was adopted by the Board on June 13, 2024, revenues have increased by $7.0 million, while expenditures have increased by $6.1 million. The revenue increase was mainly attributable to updated property tax revenues ($2.9 million), charges for services ($2.2 million), and local agency reimbursements ($1.8 million), while the expenditure changes were mainly due to increases in compensation ($2.0 million) and services and supplies ($4 million).

The District’s overall fiscal condition will diminish relative to the prior fiscal year, with General Fund expenditures and transfers out exceeding revenues and transfers in by $5.9 million. This one-year dip was anticipated: the long-term General Fund forecast included in the prior fiscal year projected a reserve transfer of $5.2 million General Fund in FY 2024/25, mainly due to growing labor costs coupled with slowing property tax growth.

A combination of persistently high inflation and five deferred interest rate cuts (which would spur home sale activity) negatively impacted the District’s bottom line. Growth rates for property tax (the District’s largest revenue source) continue to climb, albeit at a rate 40 percent lower than two years prior. Metro Fire is not alone in encountering economic headwinds: this year the City of Sacramento and the State of California faced projected budget deficits of $66 million and $47 million, respectively.

Projected expenses are expected to continue a multiyear climb. Expenditures from all funds will increase 22 percent from FY 2023/24 to FY 2024/25—without addressing most items on a lengthy infrastructure project list. The infrastructure need includes a capital project list of nearly $202 million and a deferred maintenance backlog of more than $80 million. Annual retirement-related expenses have grown rapidly as well: 49 percent over the last five years, with a 16 percent spike in FY 2024/25.

The proposed budget differs from the prior year with a shift in priority towards fully staffing suppression units. The FY 2024/25 Final Budget fully funds all positions and includes funding for four training academies: two firefighter academies and two Metro Medic Program academies.

![Budget Discussion](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Budget+Discussion)

The District is sufficiently funded for current spending levels, but lacks the financial resources to address long-term liabilities and capital priorities.

Consistent with regional and statewide economic trends, the District faces more years with modest revenue growth. Property tax revenue growth is expected to continue at a slower rate than FY 2023/24 due to lower home sale volumes. Those impacts are seen in FY 2024/25 with 4.8 percent property tax revenue growth, 1.2 percent lower than FY 2023/24, and long-term projections at or below 4 percent through FY 2028/29. The cost of goods is another persistent challenge for the District, with lingering slowdowns in vehicle supply chains and inflationary pressures on materials, ranging from fuel to electronics.

Through careful monitoring of services and supplies expenses, shifting focus to new sources of capital investment income (including a proposed General Obligation bond measure), and one-time borrowing from the General Fund reserve, the District will be manage the fiscal challenge of FY 2024/25 and be positioned for a gradual increase in reserves over the next four years.

The FY 2024/25 Final Budget includes a $51.9 million investment as part of a five-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Plan, the District’s third CIP Plan. The District’s CIP developed in accordance with the CIP Policy approved by the Board of Directors in February 2022 and followed a detailed process of evaluation and comparison to reach a final selection of 27 projects.

With the Board of Directors’ approval of this FY 2024/25 Final Budget plan, the District’s focus will be achieving planned service levels using all available sources of funding; ensuring ongoing all-risk fire, rescue and emergency medical needs of the District are met; and building necessary reserves for fiscal contingencies.

## BUDGET DISCUSSION

The FY 2024/25 Final Budget is described below by all funds and individual funds, followed by a district budget comparison and risks and issues.

### ALL FUNDS

The Final Budget includes appropriated expenditures from all seven funds of $381.3 million and revenues of $329.8 million, with the difference closed by capital financing and fund balance transfers.

Property taxes are expected to yield the majority of District revenues, about 65 percent. Based on estimated property values as of July 1, 2024, assessed property value growth will yield a $9.8 million increase in property tax revenues from FY 2023/24. The District’s second largest revenue source is charges for services (e.g., emergency medical services, plan inspections), which at $106.0 million comprises 32 percent of all District revenues in FY 2024/25.

Labor costs will make up 69 percent of all District expenses across all funds, at $262.0 million, followed by services and supplies (15 percent, $59.1 million), capital outlay (13 percent, $49.7 million), and taxes and fees (3 percent, $10.4 million).

# GENERAL FUND

The FY 2024/25 Final Budget includes $287.9 million in General Fund revenues, a $13.2 million (4.8 percent) increase relative to FY 2023/24, and $309.3 million in expenditures, a $28.6 million (10.1 percent) increase in expenditures.

After accounting for a transfer in from the Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) Fund of $22.8 million and transfers out to the Capital Facilities and Grants Funds of $6.0 million, the FY 2024/25 General Fund budget results in revenues and financing sources $5.9 million less than expenditures. This shortfall will be covered by a reduction to the General Fund reserve.

**General Fund Revenue**  
Major General Fund revenue sources and trends are shown in this chart and described below. Including the $22.8 million transfer in from the IGT Fund, total General Fund financing sources are projected to reach $303.4 million.

The chart below shows historical General Fund revenues and other financing sources since FY 2013/14. Fiscal Year 2024/25 is expected to yield the twelfth consecutive year of property tax revenue growth and fourteenth consecutive year of total revenue growth.

The primary factors contributing to this revenue increase in FY 2024/25 are:

**Property Taxes**  
Estimated FY 2024/25 property tax revenues of $213.1 million account for approximately 75 percent of total General Fund revenue sources excluding transfers. Property tax revenues are expected to grow 4.8 percent over FY 2023/24.

**Medic and CRRD Cost Recovery**  
Medic cost (EMS) income of $50.4 million represents an increase of approximately 1.9 percent over the FY 2023/24 income of $49.5 million. The expected increase is a result of modest growth in ambulance transport activity and a consumer price index (CPI) adjustment.

The FY 2024/25 Final Budget reflects Community Risk Reduction Division fees, including operational permits, plan reviews, new construction inspections, general fire and life safety inspections, and other miscellaneous services, which are expected to generate $5.9 million in FY 2024/25. This will be an increase of nearly 19 percent from the prior year, mainly attributable to an update to fee schedules.

**General Fund Expenditures**  
General Fund expenditures of $309.3 million represent a $28.6 million increase over FY 2023/24 expenditures. Including the $6.0 million in transfers to other funds, overall General Fund expenditures reach $315.3 million, as shown on this chart.

**Labor**  
The District’s labor costs, which includes all compensation, benefits, and medical costs, total $260.4 million, a $21.0 million (9.9 percent) increase from FY 2023/24.

The following table displays the growth of labor costs as a share of General Fund revenues and transfers in since FY 2017/18. Labor costs will increase as a share of General Fund revenues—including net transfers from the IGT fund—from 81.0 percent in FY 2023/24 to 84.1 percent in FY 2024/25.

![General Fund and Labor Cost Share, 2017/18 - 2024/25](attachment)

**COMPENSATION**

The largest factor contributing to the increase in General Fund labor expenses is wages, which are expected to grow by nearly $9.2 million (11.9 percent) above FY 2023/24 wages, mainly due to the addition of new staff through academies, the expiration of the SAFER grant, and wage growth.

The second greatest compensation cost is constant staffing, which at $27.4 million is approximately $700,000 more than the prior year. Notwithstanding the filling of almost all suppression positions, which typically reduces overtime costs, constant staffing is expected to remain high due to continued elevated use of leaves of all kinds, including workers’ compensation, vacation, and sick leave.

**POSITION CHANGES**

The FY 2024/25 budget includes one position change:

| Position              | Division                     | Change                                   |
|----------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Executive Assistant   | Office of the Fire Chief     | Convert to Administrative Support Officer III |

Additionally, a pool of up to 10 percent of all firefighters (24 total) and all paramedics and EMTs (6 total) is anticipated to be established, resulting from academy graduations and staff separations.

All existing positions are budgeted as filled and any savings from unfilled positions will be recognized in the Midyear Budget.

## BENEFITS

In FY 2024/25 retirement benefits, including CalPERS retirement costs, pension bond payments, and residual payments to the Sacramento County Employees’ Retirement System will increase by $8.0 million (12.5 percent) from FY 2023/24 to $72.2 million.

Payments for the CalPERS Safety Plan will increase by $8.3 million (16.5 percent), to approximately $58.6 million. This increase is mainly attributable to increases in the required unfunded liability contribution and incorporates the substantial market losses reported by PERS in July 2022 (approximately $5.5 million), and the cost of additional employees ($1.5 million).

# INTERGOVERNMENTAL TRANSFER (IGT) FUND

The District receives Intergovernmental Transfers (IGTs) through the State of California to recover costs associated with the District’s transport of the uninsured and Medi-Cal managed care program beneficiaries. There are now two IGT programs where the State uses medical transport provider funds to secure matching federal funds targeted for recovering these types of patient transports. The two IGT programs are the Voluntary Rate Range Program (VRRP), which funds services for Medi-Cal patients and the uninsured, and the Public Provider Ground Emergency Medical Transport (PPEMT) program, which provides partial reimbursement for the transport of mainly State Medi-Cal program beneficiaries.

The expenditures and revenues associated with these programs are tracked in a separate fund in order to provide greater transparency, and the net revenue generated is transferred to the General Fund to fund District costs to provide healthcare-related services.

<!-- Page 19 -->
It is anticipated that VRRP payments covering activity between January and December 2022 will be paid during FY 2024/25. A total of $7.0 million is expected to be transferred to the State in order to receive approximately $15.4 million, a net VRRP (i.e., IGT Fund) revenue of $8.6 million.

The PPGEMT program was established by AB 1705 (Bonta, 2019) and became effective on January 1, 2023. Revenues from the new PPGEMT program in FY 2024/25 are expected to reach $20.0 million, which are offset by a $6.2 million PPGEMT payment to the State, for a net revenue gain of $13.8 million.

**CAPITAL FACILITIES FUND**

The Capital Facilities Fund accounts for the costs of acquiring and financing capital assets, defined as assets with an individual cost of $5,000 or more and a useful life of at least one year. Capital expenditures include the cost of land, buildings, equipment, and other related improvements. Capital assets are typically funded by transfers from the General Fund, issuance of capital leases, and occasional sale of District assets.

Budgeted expenditures for FY 2024/25 total $26.1 million from the Capital Facilities Fund. A total of $20.4 million is allocated for capital outlay, including $15.2 million in projects financed through capital leases and $5.7 million transfer from the General Fund for capital expenditures and debt service payments.

A large portion of capital projects are also captured under the District’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Plan budget, which covers capital asset projects valued over $50,000. The District’s CIP plan covers fiscal years 2024/25 through 2028/29. Divisions are invited each spring to submit projects for the CIP and projects are then selected for the CIP by reviewing project initiation forms, which are then ranked by an executive scoring team. The Board conducts a final project review and makes a final selection based on funds available.

Major nonrecurring capital outlay purchases planned for FY 2024/25 include the following. With the exception of five-year financing costs for apparatus, there is no anticipated ongoing cost associated with these items.
- Ladder truck replacement, $1.8 million
- Four new ambulance replacements, $1.2 million
- Five Type I engine replacements: $5.8 million
- Four Type III engine replacements: 2.2 million
- Technology storage appliance replacements, $254,000

**GRANTS FUND**

The FY 2024/25 Final Fund budget anticipates Grants Fund revenues of $1.8 million and expenditures of $1.9 million, with the balance covered by carryover revenues. As additional grants are awarded and accepted, grant revenues and expenditures will be reflected through budget revisions. The anticipated end-of-year fund balance relates to grant funding awarded for use in subsequent years.

# DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES FUND

Annual development impact fee (DIF) revenue of $3.0 million is budgeted for FY 2024/25. DIF revenue is restricted to costs related to new fire stations and equipment needed to mitigate the impacts of new development. During FY 2024/25, the District expects to combine DIF with existing fund balances and $2.7 million in capital lease revenue to expend $15.2 million for the preliminary phases of construction for a new Vineyard Springs fire station and land acquisition for a new Grant Line 220 fire station.

# LEASED PROPERTIES FUND

The District leases property not required for current operations and accounts for the revenues and expenditures associated with leased property in the Leased Properties Fund. Total lease revenue for FY 2024/25 is expected to be $1.2 million and expenses associated with the leased property are anticipated to be $788,000. The Leased Properties Fund is expected to gain $400,000 and end the fiscal year with a balance of $1.9 million.

# SPECIAL PROJECTS FUND

In FY 2022/23 the District was allocated $13 million by the State of California to facilitate the construction of the Zinfandel Training Center. Interest income and transfers from the Capital Facilities Fund has increased the balance in this account to $14.3 million, most of which will be spent in FY 2025/25. The projected ending balance is $169,000, and this fund will be dissolved after all funds have been depleted.

# DISTRICT COMPARISON

The District is the seventh-largest local fire agency in California and, as a special district commissioned mainly to provide fire suppression and emergency transport for 16 communities and 2 counties, has few comparable fire service agencies. One comparative model is the Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA), which serves 24 communities and 1.89 million persons across 587 square miles, compared to the District’s 720,000 persons across 359 square miles.

The most recent adopted OCFA budget for FY 2023/24 shows the total OCFA General Operating Fund budget to be $494.0 million, compared to District’s $287.2 million General Fund budget over the same period. On a per capita basis, the OCFA general operating budget equates to a $261, compared to $392 for the District, a difference of $131.

District revenue sources are somewhat similar to OCFA. Property taxes made up 75 percent of District revenues in FY 2022/23, compared to 63 percent for the OCFA. Charges for services made up 21.6 percent of total District revenues in FY 2022/23, compared to 22.8 percent for the OCFA.

# RISKS AND ISSUES

Through financial planning and forecasting the District has identified risks and issues to be addressed to ensure the District’s long-term fiscal health. As explained below, the Final Budget for FY 2024/25 reflects continued focus on addressing the risks and issues.

## Unfunded Liabilities for Pensions and Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB)
The FY 2024/25 budget reflects an increase of $8.8 million (16.6 percent) to CalPERS to fund the District’s Safety and Miscellaneous pension plans. CalPERS’ poor market performance in the 2022/23 plan year resulted in this sizeable contribution increase. However, market performance improved the following year, suggesting smaller contribution increases to come in FY 2025/26. Nevertheless, the District should consider supplemental prefunding to offset its pension debt obligations.

The FY 2024/25 budget also reflects a $4.0 million payment to the Sacramento County Employees’ Retirement System in accordance with a funding agreement to address the unfunded pension liability associated with a predecessor fire agency. Under this agreement, the District will make annual payments through approximately FY 2036/37, depending on actuarial adjustments.

The District has been pre-funding its OPEB retiree medical obligations since 2013 and the FY 2024/25 budget reflects contributions of $4.2 million, about $100,000 less than the FY 2023/24 contribution. This contribution will fund the explicit subsidy liability, budgeted as a combination of retiree medical premium payments and contributions to the California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust (CERBT) Fund. After eleven years the unfunded liability is approximately 26 percent funded.

## Unfunded Capital Projects and Vehicle Replacements and Maintenance
Capital project needs far exceed current and forecasted District revenues. The District’s latest CIP Plan identifies approximately $202 million in capital projects. Additionally, the District’s most recent Facility Condition Assessment identified the need for over $80 million of repairs to existing fire stations and facilities over the next 20 years, as well as approximately $50 million of modernization costs for these facilities. With information gleaned from the CIP Plan, the District will prioritize projects and consider financing tools such as long-term financing and new revenue options.

As new development occurs within the District boundaries, costs associated with constructing, equipping, and supporting new fire stations will also grow. FY 2024/25 capital outlay spending also includes $12.5 million associated with the construction of a new Vineyard Springs Station and land acquisition for a Grant Line 220 station.

Finally, while the FY 2024/25 budget includes $18.0 million for the replacement of apparatus and other vehicles, anticipated station growth and anticipated replacement timelines, coupled with rising costs and multi-year procurement schedules, suggest that vehicle replacement will be a growing financial concern.

## Uncertainty in the Federal Emergency Medical Transport Revenue Programs
Through the two IGT programs, PPGEMT and VRRP, the District will receive additional federal funding netting approximately $22.8 million for transporting Medi-Cal managed care beneficiaries.

and the uninsured. Revenues from the PPGE-MT program appear to be reaching a consistent monthly pace, but the timing to recover approximately $3 million in overdue payments remains uncertain.

The VRRP program is dependent on health provider participation who may opt out at any time (one of the five providers opted out of the program for FY 2024/25). Additionally, the VRRP continues to operate without statutory direction and the State of California may also opt to end participation, eliminating a critical $9 million net annual revenue source. The District will identify ways to allocate VRRP revenues to one-time costs rather than ongoing expenses.

**RECOMMENDATION**

Staff’s recommendation to the Board of Directors is to approve the FY 2024/25 Final Budget and the resolutions directing its implementation.

# STRATEGIC PLAN

## DISTRICT STRATEGIC PLAN

The District’s strategic plan was established in February 2020 and to this day guides the organization at the strategic, budget, and tactical operations level. The strategic plan reflects the District’s mission, to provide professional and compassionate protection, education and service to our community, and core values of integrity, professionalism, teamwork, and dedication to duty.

The District’s strategic plan was created with direction from the Board and input from District employees and key external stakeholders. During the strategic plan development process the District identified five key strategy areas: members, capital assets, service delivery, financial management, and external engagement. Each strategic plan project initiatives and performance measures. The strategic plan is reviewed quarterly, thereby providing a focused, regular and transparent approach to monitoring progress.

Strategic plan projects and performance measures are identified in the following table. Many of the division-level goals reference these strategic plan projects and performance measures.

# FIRE CHIEF

## Adam A. House

![Adam A. House](image_url)

Fire Chief Adam A. House was sworn in as Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District’s seventh Fire Chief on August 10, 2023. He holds the distinction of being the first Fire Chief to serve continuously as a member of Metro Fire since its inception in 2000.

Chief House has accumulated an impressive 36-year tenure in public service, which includes four years in the United States Army as a Firefighter. Following active duty, he continued his fire service career in 1991 as a Firefighter in Yuma, Arizona, and eventually promoted to the rank of Captain. In 2000, he joined Metro Fire, ascending the ranks from Firefighter to Captain, Battalion Chief, and ultimately Assistant Chief. He was instrumental in establishing the Metro Fire Special Operations Division, specifically the Type 1 Hazardous Materials program, where he served as the initial Program Manager. Furthermore, Chief House has played pivotal roles in Firefighter recruitment, and the Fire Academy where he served as a Drill Master.

As a Chief Officer at Metro Fire, Chief House served as the Division Manager within the Training, Health & Safety Division with direct oversight of the Training Academy, task level and promotional opportunities and training, special operations training, and the physical and mental wellbeing of the membership. Additionally, he contributed as a member of the FEMA Urban Search & Rescue Task Force 7, California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (CAL OES) Task Force 9, and the Type 3 Sacramento Regional Incident Management Team (SRIMT), deploying numerous times to major devastating incidents throughout California.

A Sacramento area native, Chief House proudly graduated from Cordova High School in 1987, and currently resides within the community of Sloughhouse. He met his wife Gia in middle school, and they recently celebrated 30 years of marriage together. They are proud parents of two grown children, their son Joshua and daughter Taylor.

# DISTRICT HISTORY & PROFILE

## History

The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) is the result of consolidations among 16 smaller fire departments in the Sacramento region that, over five decades, merged to create what would become a California special district.

# BUDGETARY FUND STRUCTURE

## BUDGETARY FUND STRUCTURE

The FY 2024/25 Budget includes appropriations for the following District budgetary funds:
- General Fund
- Capital Facilities Fund
- Leased Properties Fund
- Grants Fund
- Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) Fund
- Development Impact Fees Fund
- Special Projects Fund

For purposes of the District’s financial statements, activities of the IGT Fund and Leased Properties Fund are combined with those of the General Fund.

## Fund Descriptions

The **General Fund** is the general operating fund of the District. It is used to account for all financial resources except those required or designated by the Board of Directors to be accounted for in another fund.

The **Capital Facilities Fund** is a capital projects fund used to account for the acquisition and construction of the District’s capital assets. It is primarily funded by capital lease financing and general fund operating transfers.

The District leases property not required for current operations and accounts for the revenues and expenditures associated with leased property in the **Leased Properties Fund**.

The **Grants Fund** is a special revenue fund used to account for the proceeds of federal and state grants that are legally restricted to expenditures for specific purposes.

The **Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) Fund** is used to account for the revenues and expenses associated with the District’s participation in Medi-Cal IGTs.

## The Development Impact Fees Fund

The **Development Impact Fees Fund** is a capital projects fund used to account for all resources received from development impact fees. It is used for the construction or acquisition of future fire stations and acquisition of apparatus to serve new developments.

## The Special Projects Fund

The **Special Projects Fund** was established to sequester funds allocated by the State of California in 2022 for the construction of the Zinfandel Training Facility.

## Fund and Division Relationships and Interfund Transfers

The District’s operating budget covers several governmental funds, including the General Fund which is the District’s main operating fund. The General Fund's relationship with other funds is summarized below:
- **Capital Facilities Fund** - this fund's main funding source comes from financing revenues and any deficiency is covered by operating transfers from the General Fund.
- **Grants Fund** - main funding source are federal grants with General Fund providing matching operating transfers as required.
- **The IGT Fund** - captures all revenues and expenditures from the IGT and PP-GEMT Programs and any excess of revenues over expenditures are transferred to the General Fund to offset the General Fund cost of providing health care services.
- **The Leased Properties Fund, Development Impact Funds, and Special Projects Funds** were designed to operate independently, with little or no funding from the General Fund.

The District's Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) budget derives its funding from the General Fund, the Capital Facilities Fund and the Development Impact Fee Fund.

The table below is provided in order to graphically depict the department and fund relationships within the organization. The General Fund is monitored by all staff and provides the main funding source for each Division's operating costs. All other funds are monitored by one or more divisions, as shown below.

![BUDGETARY FRAMEWORK & CALENDAR](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=BUDGETARY+FRAMEWORK+%26+CALENDAR)

**BASIS OF BUDGETING**  
The modified accrual basis of budgeting is used for all funds. This basis is the same as the modified accrual basis of accounting used in the District’s audited governmental fund financial statements. Under this basis, revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the District considers all revenues, except property taxes, to be available if they are collected within 90 days of the end of the current fiscal period.

Expenditure-driven grants are recognized as revenue when the qualifying expenditures have been incurred and all other eligibility requirements have been met, and the amount is received during the period or within the availability period for this revenue source. All other revenue items are considered to be measurable and available only when cash is received by the District.

Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and workers’ compensation claims, are recorded only when payment is due. General capital asset acquisitions are reported as expenditures in governmental funds. Issuance of long-term debt and acquisitions under capital leases are reported as other financing sources.

**BALANCED BUDGET**  
The District defines a balanced budget in accordance with its Financial Planning and Budget policy: An annual budget in which operating revenues and any one-time revenues are greater than or equal to ongoing operating expenditures. With operating and one-time revenues of approximately $303.4 million and operating expenditures of $309.3 million the FY 2024/25 Final Budget does not meet that criteria without a transfer from the General Fund reserve.

**BASIS FOR KEY REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS**  
**Property Taxes**  
In general, property tax revenues are estimated based on assessed values of properties within the District’s jurisdiction. For FY2024/25, the estimate starts with a base of FY2023/24 actual assessed values of real property. Adjustments are then made for the following items:

1. A CPI up to a maximum of two percent is applied to this base amount.  
2. Proposition 8 parcel values are first either increased, decreased, or projected flat.  

65
<!-- Page 72 -->
![Image](https://metrofire.ca.gov/transparency)

depending on median sale price changes and then added,  
3. Transfer of ownership assessed value change based on known 2023 transfers are also added.  

This will result in an estimated real property value to which we make minor additions (e.g., personal property values) to come up with the estimated net taxable value. The net taxable value is then multiplied by the one percent tax rate and adjusted for estimated delinquencies based on historical averages to come up with the Final budgeted property tax revenue.  

**EMS Revenues**  
EMS “medic” revenues are estimated starting with last year’s budgeted EMS revenues, or actual revenues if already available, and increased by CPI and the estimated increase in the number of medical transports using actual trends identified during the prior fiscal year.  

**LEVEL OF BUDGET CONTROL**  
The District’s appropriated budget is prepared by fund, division, and object level. The legal level of budgetary control is at the fund level and then the object level. Each fund has its own budget for the following items: 1) salaries and benefits, 2) services and supplies, 3) capital outlay, and 4) debt service and other expenditures. The Board must approve amendments or transfers of appropriations between funds or objects.  

Appropriations in all budgeted funds will lapse at the end of the fiscal year even if they have related encumbrances. Encumbrances are commitments related to unperformed (executory) contracts for goods or services (i.e., purchase orders, contracts, and commitments). Encumbrance accounting is utilized to the extent necessary to assure effective budgetary control and accountability and to facilitate effective cash planning and control. While all appropriations and encumbrances lapse at year-end, valid outstanding encumbrances (those for which performance under the executory contract is expected in the next year) are re-appropriated and become part of the subsequent year’s budget.  

Actual costs are reported in bi-monthly fiscal reports to the Board of Directors so that the public may see how costs compare to projections and assess the fiscal health of the District.  

The District uses an allocated cost methodology for budgeting and financial reporting. The preliminary, final, and midyear budgets identify estimated division costs and allocate central service costs (e.g., subscriptions, conferences, recognition events, insurance, memberships, utilities, lease-revenue bond payments, and assessments) to a central “Non-Divisional” division where such costs can be centrally tracked separate from divisional expenses. NDI costs are examined during the budget process to ensure only District-wide costs are included and Divisions retain responsibility for costs they incur.  

**KEY FINANCIAL POLICIES**  
Financial policies adopted by the Board of Directors are summarized below and can be found on this web page: https://metrofire.ca.gov/transparency.  

**Financial Planning and Budget Policy**  
The District’s Financial Planning and Budget Policy memorializes the District’s major budget-related processes, including the District’s definition of a balanced budget, the process for developing a balanced budget, the process for developing...

Preliminary, Final, and Midyear Budgets, use of one-time revenues, timing to recognize prior year expenditures and revenues after fiscal year end, direction for spending excess revenues after the 15 percent reserve threshold has been met, and the calculation for the General Fund reserve.

**Capital Asset Policy**  
The District’s Capital Asset Policy defines capital assets as land, buildings, equipment, and other related improvements with an individual cost of $5,000 or more and a useful life of at least one year. The policy establishes a capital asset accounting system that provides guidelines for the accountability and financial and physical control of capital assets, consistent and uniform procedures and transactions for accounting of capital assets, and compliance with funding entity requirements for grant-funded assets. Board approval is required for budgeted capital asset acquisitions and for disposal of capital assets. This policy also requires a biennial inventory of all capital assets.

**Capital Improvement Program Policy**  
The District’s Capital Improvement Program Policy organizes, facilitates, and memorializes capital needs and goals in order to efficiently and transparently develop and support the physical infrastructure of the District. Rigorous and methodical evaluation of facility, apparatus, and equipment needs and financing options ensures that existing and future capital needs are met, in compliance with the District’s strategic plan and financial resources.

The development of the CIP is a coordinated effort across the District, with the capital project planning process overseen by the Planning and Development Division and the finance and budget process elements overseen by the Finance Division.

![Debt Obligation](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Debt+Obligation)

Debt Obligation | Maturity Date | Principal & Interest Total (Through Maturity)

Pension Obligation Bonds | 5/15/2030 | $31,355,668
Lease Revenue Bonds | 5/15/2042 | $10,008,758
Apparatus and Equipment Leases | 6/28/2028 | $16,251,165

The District’s most recent bond rating was AA- (Standard and Poor), for a lease revenue bond issuance in 2011.

**BUDGET PROCESS**

The District’s budget cycle follows Chapter 7 of the California Health and Safety Code, which describes the timing for the preliminary and final District budgets, and stipulates public notice and transparency measures to provide ample opportunity to comment on the budget. The District’s fiscal year starts on July 1 and ends on June 30. Altogether the District notices, holds public hearings, and solicits comment on three budgets each fiscal year.
- On or before June 30: Adoption of the Preliminary Budget for the following fiscal year
- On or before October 1: Adoption of the Final Budget for the current fiscal year
- After December 31: Adoption of the Midyear Budget for the current fiscal year

Amendments to a Board-approved budget involving either funds or objects (salaries and benefits, services and supplies, capital outlay, and debt service or other expenditures) must be approved by the Board of Directors.

**Preliminary Budget**

Preliminary Budget development begins in March for the following fiscal year’s budget. District budget officers attend a budget kick-off meeting, at which time information regarding the long-term financial outlook and expected funding levels is shared. Divisional budget requests are then
<!-- Page 75 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

submitted for changes in position count or classification, overtime, services and supplies, and capital outlay. The Finance Division is responsible for preparing revenue estimates, and compiling and preparing the expenditure budgets based on submitted requests.

Budget requests are reviewed by budget officers and the compiled budget requests are then reviewed by executive staff. Executive staff consider organizational priorities and funding constraints in order to determine the budget that will ultimately be recommended to the Board. The Preliminary Budget is first presented to the Finance and Audit Committee for informational purposes and then to the Board of Directors for approval. The public are invited to provide comment beforehand and participate in the hearings.

Final Budget  
The Final Budget process begins in July, after the close of the previous fiscal year. Any requests for expenditure changes are submitted by budget officers and revenue estimates are updated based on newly-available information. Typical final budget changes include re-budgeting of items not actually expended in the previous fiscal year and adjustment of property tax estimates based on assessed values released by the County Assessor. The Final Budget is typically presented to the Finance and Audit Committee in August and recommended to the Board for adoption in September. The public are invited to provide comment beforehand and participate in the hearings.

Midyear Budget  
Throughout the year, budget officers monitor actual expenditures compared to budget on a monthly basis. The Finance and Audit committee receives bimonthly reports of revenue and expenditure activity compared to budgeted amounts. Additionally, following the close of a fiscal quarter, a formal District-wide budget review is undertaken in which budget officers update estimates of annual spending for each budget account.

The 2nd quarter review serves as the basis for the District’s Midyear Budget changes, which are based on actual results through December 31. The Midyear Budget process typically begins in January, with a presentation to the Finance and Audit Committee in February and Board adoption in March. The public are invited to provide comment beforehand and participate in the hearings.

![LONG-RANGE FINANCIAL PLAN & OUTLOOK](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=LONG-RANGE+FINANCIAL+PLAN+%26+OUTLOOK)

LONG-RANGE FINANCIAL PLANNING & ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

As a part of the District’s strategic planning efforts, long-range financial trends are analyzed to identify financial risks and develop plans to address them. Identified risks include the escalating costs of pension and other postemployment benefits, rising costs of equipment replacement and facility maintenance due to deferred investment, and potential reductions to IGT funding.

With regard to pension and other postemployment benefits, the District’s practice is to annually fund the actuarially determined contribution amounts for pension and the amount associated with the explicit subsidy liability for other post-employment benefits. Funding at these contribution levels is intended to ensure the long-term sustainability of these benefits.

To address equipment and facility needs, the District has developed a vehicle replacement plan, a District-wide facility condition assessment, and recently initiated a Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Plan. Each of these efforts will inform the level of capital outlay and facility maintenance spending required to support current and anticipated service level needs.

In order to mitigate any impact of reduced IGT funding levels in the future, the District is evaluating all opportunities to achieve full cost recovery for emergency medical services, including supporting advocacy efforts to maximize reimbursements for Medi-Cal services.

Economic Outlook

The District’s economic outlook is shaped mainly by property tax trends. Comprising approximately 75 percent of total revenues, real estate market trends have a direct impact on District operations. The District has enjoyed twelve straight years of property tax growth since the Great Recession and, while continued growth is expected, the rate of that growth has begun to slow substantially.

The single biggest factor affecting property tax revenue are home sales. Portions of the District have seen rapid growth in new homes; however, demand and resales have slowed with persistently elevated interest rates. While Proposition 13 limits growth in assessed value to 2 percent per year unless the property is reassessed, the most recent Sacramento County Assessor’s report (July 2023) documented assessed values that led to nearly 5.2 percent growth in property taxes across the County in 2023/24. The District contracts with HdL Coren and Cone for property tax analysis and projections, who estimate 4.8 percent growth in property tax revenues for the District in FY 2024/25.

According to HdL Coren and Cone, the median home price in Sacramento County in the first quarter of 2024 was $494,000—up slightly from $490,000 a year earlier. According to the California Association of Realtors, Sacramento region housing affordability has declined to where now 26 percent of households can afford the median price home. The primary driver for this affordability level is the interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, which are being held at an elevated level to cool inflation.

Revenue levels for funds other than the General Fund are forecast to remain stable. The Special Projects Fund, with a balance of $13.8 million, is expected to be liquidated in FY 2024/25 with construction underway for the Zinfandel Training Center project.

![Medic (EMS) Fees 2015/16 - 2024/25 (estimated) ($ in millions)](attachment://image2.png)

The second-most consequential revenue driver for the District is Emergency Medical Services fees. The District expects modest EMS revenue growth of approximately 5 percent, mainly attributable to staffing increases generating more medical transports, with $49.7 million anticipated.

**DIVISION BACKGROUND:**
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District is an independent special district governed by a nine-member Board of Directors. Each Board Member is elected by represented divisions from within Metro Fire’s jurisdictional boundaries to serve alternating four-year terms of office. The Board of Directors establishes policy for the organization and is directly accountable to the public.

The Board carries out its fiduciary duty by establishing the vision, mission, values, and strategic goals that will ensure the District meets its obligations to the public. It is responsible for adopting the District’s annual budget and exercises its fiscal oversight duties by reviewing bi-monthly financial statements and the annual independent audit. The Board is responsible for the governance of the District and the appointment of the Fire Chief to carry out the day-to-day administration of the policies and budget set by the Board.

**RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS:**
- In May 2023 the Board of Directors hosted a strategic planning workshop to review and provide an update on the progress in meeting the desired outcomes of the District’s 2020 Strategic Plan.
- The Board completed a recruitment process for the Fire Chief and facilitated his transition to success in the chief executive role.
- In April 2024 four Directors attended the 52nd Annual Capitol-to-Capitol learning and advocacy conference in Washington, DC. The four directors worked with the public safety team to promote the capital region and represented Metro Fire in meetings with Federal representatives.

**BUDGET DISCUSSION:**
In an effort to ensure delivery of the highest level of service to the public, the Board is focused on maintaining a fiscally conservative budget. To that end, an audit is conducted to ensure ongoing fiscal accountability to the District. Travel budgets are carefully managed to improve public outreach, enhance communications, and foster cooperation with and other local agencies. In November 2024, a general election for seats in divisions 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8 will be held and related election expenditures are included in the FY 2024/25 budget.

**GOALS FOR UPCOMING YEAR:**
- By September 30, 2024, the Board will deliver a balanced budget that maintains the District’s high level of service currently provided to the community.
- Additionally, with the Strategic Plan in its fourth year of implementation, the Board will continue to work with the Fire Chief to ensure all FY 2024/25 strategic objectives are met.

The team consists of an administrative PIO, and three shift PIOs that operate in a relief capacity. The Public Information Officer team utilizes their practical experience in fireground operations, emergency medicine, and district and community knowledge to effectively communicate with the appropriate audience.

The Community Relations Division (CRD) has three professional staff members who ensure consistency in the division's operations. The Community Relations Coordinator collaborates with the PIO to create and coordinate the district's communications, outreach and engagement strategy. The two Community Relations Specialists implement the communication and outreach plan through social media, newsletters, marketing materials, and community events.

(Strategic Goal External Engagement 1a, 2a)

To help facilitate the department in the event of a funeral, Community Relations staff and members of Metro Fire, developed a funeral protocol to standardize how Metro Fire respond when it comes to honoring the memory of a fallen member. The protocol defines what to do from the initial notification to burial, and maintains consistency while ensuring fiscal compliance. (Strategic Goal External Engagement 1a, 2a)

In partnership with the Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD), and other local agencies, the Division expanded its approach to inform the community about the importance of reducing the effects of illegal or improper fireworks use. The group designed and placed large decals on

# HEALTH & WELLNESS

## DIVISION BACKGROUND:
Metro Fire's Health and Wellness Division is responsible for providing all members with the opportunity to maintain an appropriate level of wellness throughout their career. By addressing the physical, nutritional, and mental components of wellness our goal is to empower the membership with the tools to be pro-active in their own health decisions. In staying in line with Metro’s Wellness Strategic Plan, we have aggressively gone after providing more early detection and therapy options to our members as well as preventative education. The focus of the program is a continued drive towards offering more robust wellness physicals, specific screening events throughout the year, as well as partnering with our HR Division to help streamline the workers comp process and provide more support to our injured personnel.

## RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
- Introduced VO2max Fitness assessments to our members to help evaluate cardiovascular health

With more of an emphasis on early detection and to meet the concerns of our membership, this year’s budget includes a significant increase for the funding of a more robust wellness medicals program for our suppression personnel that will include more cancer detection ability as well as a more in-depth cardiovascular evaluation through advanced blood testing. This year’s fitness budget will address the unavoidable need to replace a number of treadmills that have timed out (no parts available due to age) and workout benches in need of replacement due to old age as well. Continued funding for the replacement line will not only help cover the need to replace aging equipment but will also cover the fact that there has been a continued increase in product cost and shipping of roughly 15 percent. Funding for the wellness portion of this budget will continue to open up opportunities to deliver more in the arena of rest and recovery in the form of wellness treatments through contracted work with vetted providers. The benefits of such programs are expected to impact our members health knowledge and overall well-being with the result being happy and healthy members on the job.

## GOALS FOR UPCOMING YEAR:
The Health and Wellness Division’s goals for the upcoming year conform to the strategic plan goal to improve service delivery. (Strategic Plan: Service Delivery 1a). Specifically, the Division will by June 30, 2025:

| $71,757,149 | $18,726,075         | $6,208,425            | $-              | $96,691,649    | 25.4%             |

The Non-Divisional Item (NDI) budget represents costs that are incurred by the District as a whole and are not exclusively associated with a single division. These costs include training, insurance, pension bond debt service, other post-employment benefits (OPEB), supplemental reimbursements to retirees, and various other payments.

**BUDGET DISCUSSION:**
The Non-Divisional Item budget includes $3.6 million for insurance, representing auto liability premiums, property and liability insurance, cyber-liability insurance, and related expenses.

Additionally, pension bond debt service and sinking fund payments totaling $6.5 million are included in Non-Divisional expenditures. In accordance with the District’s plan to retire the pension bonds at the earliest date allowed, a $20.2 million final payment for the Series B is scheduled in FY 2025-26. The funding for these disbursements will come from committed fund balance accumulated since FY 2005/06.

NDI also budgets a $4.0 million payment to Sacramento County Employees’ Retirement System (SCERS). These payments reduce an unfunded liability for District retirees and employees formerly employed by predecessor agencies that participated in SCERS.

Also included in the budget are expenditures costs for the District’s headquarters expenditures such as utilities, janitorial services, and landscape maintenance.

Finally, Inter-Governmental Transfer (IGT) fees amounting to $12 million are reflected in NDI expenditures. These fees are paid to the State of California to secure federal matching funds to be used to offset the cost of providing emergency services to the uninsured and Medi-Cal managed care beneficiaries. These IGT funds will yield approximately $34.8 million in new funding, for a net income of $22.9 million.

The Non-Divisional Item budget is an unstaffed, allocated-cost budget so no goals and performance measures are established.

**DIVISION BACKGROUND:**  
The Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD) provides new construction, code enforcement, public education, and fire investigation services to the unincorporated portions of Sacramento County, City of Citrus Heights, and City of Rancho Cordova communities. The CRRD New Construction and Code Enforcement team is responsible for inspecting existing buildings and properties for fire code violations, issuing permits, assisting fire suppression personnel, responding to code violation complaints, reviewing and approving licensed care facilities, reviewing plans for all construction projects and fire protection systems, as well as conducting the testing and inspections for those projects. In addition, Fire Inspectors are responsible for special event inspection requests (e.g., carnivals and fairs), fireworks booth inspections and public fireworks displays.

The CRRD Fire Investigation Unit (FIU) investigates unidentified fire causes, the causes of fires resulting in serious bodily injury or death, and suspected arson related incidents that occur within the District. Metro Fire is one of the few agencies in the region with a full-time FIU staffed by peace officers.

**RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS:**  
During the last fiscal year, the Community Risk Reduction Division accomplished the following:
- Assisted with the implementation of the revised fee schedule in Ordinance 2023-02
- Continued the performance period for the Fire Prevention and Safety Grant by completing three smoke alarm blitzes
- Completed a promotional exam for Supervising Fire Inspector
- Completed recruitment for the new Fire Inspector I position
- Assumed Chair responsibilities for the Sacramento Regional Fire Chiefs Association Community Risk Reduction Committee
- Led the Sacramento Regional Fireworks Taskforce
- Assisted Sacramento County with amending the fireworks ordinance
- Analyzed the false alarm mitigation program and revised internal processes to improve efficiencies
- Updated job descriptions for Plan Intake Specialist, Fire Inspector I, and Supervising Fire Investigator
- Continued comprehensive review of all policies and procedures for CRRD and the FIU

**BUDGET DISCUSSION:**  
In FY2023/24, the Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD) continued to fill authorized positions for Fire Inspector I, Office Technicians, and Administrative Specialist. The division provided a comprehensive training program for all new positions and has achieved the goal of completing all plan reviews in-house.

2023 was a challenging year for the FIU. While the overall caseload decreased to 354 cases, 82.5 percent of them were fire origin and cause investigations, consistent with prior years. Bolstering staffing in the FIU is an urgent public safety issue, as well as a health and wellness issue for investigators and suppression personnel alike.

An important, but frequently overlooked element of fire investigations is loss analysis. Determining why fires occur, what can be done to prevent them, how their impacts can be lessened, and predicting human behavior once fires occur are all key elements of CRRD’s ongoing community risk assessment process.

**GOALS FOR UPCOMING YEAR:**  
The Community Risk Reduction Division has the following goals for completion by June 30, 2024.
<!-- Page 139 -->
- Add three Fire Investigator II positions to the PAD (Strategic Plan: Members 4b & CRD Strategic Plan 3c)
- Add a new job classification for Plans Examiner (Strategic Plan: Members 2a)
- Implement electronic evidence tracking system for the FIU (Strategic Plan: Sustainability 3b)
- Support businesses and community members with fire and life safety initiatives. (Strategic Plan: External Engagement 1a)

**PERFORMANCE MEASURES/OBJECTIVES:**
- In accordance with Strategic Plan Goal for Members (4b), and Strategic Plan Goal CRD Strategic Plan (3c) the department will measure performance against goals through a staffing level in the FIU that meets U.S. Fire Administration recommendation for fire investigator staffing levels, one investigator per 100,000 population or 60 to 80 cases.
- In accordance with Strategic Plan Goal Financial Management, Current Revenue Maintenance (2A), the Division will reduce the amount of overtime utilized for technical plan review.
- Fire and Life Safety Inspections. In accordance with Strategic Plan: External Engagement 1a goal, the Division will complete 100 percent of the fire and life safety inspections in State-mandated occupancies.
