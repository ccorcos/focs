   Chief Harms ended his report by sharing information about new Thermal Imaging Cameras (TICs) coming to Metro Fire thanks to the work of Director Orzalli. Sometime ago, Chief Harms was sharing the new technology in TICs, and Director Orzalli with his work through the Public Safety Foundation, including generous donations from Supervisor Frost, and BC Rudnicki through a presentation to UASI, have helped raise $160,000 which will provide a new TIC for each riding position at Metro Fire. Thank you and congratulations on working together to get this accomplished.

# OPERATIONS REPORT

Assistant Chief Greene shared the Operations report, focusing on two main areas: State Wildland Fires and COVID-19. Currently Metro Fire is deployed to a few small fires within California, and a few members are staging in the Redding area. There are two fires in the early phases and we anticipate deploying our Type 3 Teams soon.
