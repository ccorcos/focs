The Governor has also issued Executive Order N-33-20, prohibiting people from leaving their homes or places of residence except to access necessary supplies and services or to engage in specified critical infrastructure employment.

Chief Harms asked Deputy Chief Casentini to follow up on a request from Director Gould during a previous Board Meeting. DC Casentini shared information about the COVID-19 support available to families through Metro Peer Support and the work Jeff Wells does within that group. Additionally, DC Casentini is working to have increased resources available through the existing Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Director Goold recommends we reach out virtually, as in-person communication is challenging during these times.  

OPERATIONS REPORT  
Deputy Chief Bridge briefly touches on COVID-19 and reiterates the positive work Jeff Wells and Local 522 are doing to make sure everyone is healthy. Currently, there are 12 members in quarantine awaiting two negative tests. Per the County Public Health, employees must receive a negative test, then wait 48-96 hours until being tested again, with the ability to return to work after receiving negative results from the second test. DC Bridge assures the Board there is a plan in place should Metro Fire reach emergency staffing levels, and Metro Fire has been supporting neighboring agencies who have reached emergency staffing levels.  

DC Bridge reported on a recent type 3 strike team deployment to the Mineral Fire in the Shasta area where the team laid hose line, and stayed in isolation as best they could. This team was reassigned to the Hog Fire in Susanville. Additionally, a type 1 strike team was recently dispatched to the Hog Fire, they are currently staying in a hotel in Sparks, NV. In total, there are 14 members deployed on strike teams.  

DC Bridge thanked FF Watts for organizing the auto extrication training that took place at the Zinfandel Training Center. 46 members were able to participate in the training, and he also thanked CERT and logistics for their support. Metro Fire participated in another live fire training on Sylvan Avenue in Citrus Heights, he thanked the church for donating the building.  

Lastly, call volume has returned to the regular 250 to 300 calls per day.

**Date:** August 13, 2020  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Todd Harms, Fire Chief  
**SUBJECT:** Sacramento Mobile Integrated Healthcare Pilot Project – MOU Approval  

---

**TOPIC**  
Staff is seeking Board authorization to approve the Memorandum of Understanding for the Sacramento Mobile Integrated Healthcare (SacMIH) Pilot Project.  

**BACKGROUND**  
Everyday across the Sacramento region, Metro Fire is on the frontline of patient care answering 911 calls. While some calls to 911 are truly life threatening emergencies requiring quick thinking, treatment to stabilize a patient, and transport to an Emergency Department (ED), it is well documented that many 911 calls are not life threatening emergencies.  

That is not to say our patients are not sick or suffering, rather they are individuals with chronic illnesses or non-emergent injuries who do not have anywhere else to turn for care. In 2019 Metro Fire responded to 97,369 incidents, the majority of which were requests for medical aid, resulting in 52,477 patient transports to an ED. Approximately 40% of the transports did not require an advanced life support (ALS) level of care. Consequently, the EMS transport system and EDs in Sacramento County are increasingly and consistently strained.  

A presentation of the Sacramento Mobile Integrated Healthcare (SacMIH) Pilot Project was made to the Board of Directors on October 10, 2019, in which the Board approved staff to move forward with the project. Staff has worked with the Hospital Council of Northern and Central California (the “Council”) and the Healthcare Foundation of Northern and Central California (the “Foundation”) to develop the attached Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).

**DISCUSSION**

Since 2016, the Council has convened health stakeholders in Sacramento County to develop innovative ways of providing medical services in the community that will more appropriately address the root causes of patient health challenges, improve patient case management, and maximize the capacity of the EMS transport system. SacMIH seeks to apply proven best practices that provide definitive care to patients in a more expeditious and comprehensive manner.

In coalition with four local healthcare systems (Dignity Health, Sutter Health, UC Davis, and Kaiser Permanente) and local fire departments (Metro Fire and Sacramento Fire Department), the Council held discussions to promote the mobile integrated health model. The pilot project will pair a Physician Assistant or Nurse Practitioner with a firefighter/paramedic to operate a Community Care Response Unit (CCRU) and address the health needs of patients with records of high utilization of emergency healthcare services. Combining advanced level care and EMS capabilities in the same field-unit results in timely patient care while reducing stress on area EDs and decreasing healthcare costs.

To optimize SacMIH, the same coalition has come together to create the Sacramento Health Information Partnership (SHIP). Working under the guidance of the California Association and Health Information Exchanges (CAHIE), SHIP is a focused approach to improve interoperability and enable the exchange of health information among providers throughout the Sacramento region. This approach will enable meaningful data gathering and analysis to measure the effectiveness of SacMIH at a relatively low cost.

SacMIH is currently a one year pilot project designed to prove the patient care success and cost effectiveness of the mobile integrated health model. The project is explained in detail in Attachment A. The objectives of the program are to:

- Improve continuity of care for high utilizers of EMS and ED services;
- Reduce unnecessary EMS transports and ED visits;
- Reduce hospital readmissions;
- Reduce healthcare expenditures;
- Expedite appropriate care for patients calling 911; and

**FISCAL IMPACT**

The agreement is between Healthcare Foundation of Northern & Central California, the Hospital Council of Northern & Central California, and Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District. Year 1 funding of $735,000 is itemized in detail below. Additional funding may come available at a later date. The Council is committed to helping Metro Fire develop sustainable revenue through research and advocacy.

**Hospital Council**  
**Northern & Central California**  

**Improving Patient Care in Sacramento**  
*Through Mobile Integrated Healthcare and Health Information Exchange*  

**October 2019**  

**BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT**  

Since 2016, the Hospital Council – Northern and Central California has convened health stakeholders in Sacramento County to develop innovative ways of providing emergency medical services (EMS) that will more appropriately address the root causes of patient health challenges, improve patient case management and maximize the capacity of the system to meet patient demand. **Sacramento Mobile Integrated Healthcare (SacMIH)** adapts proven best practices that have provided definitive care to patients in a more expeditious and comprehensive manner. The partners participating in SacMIH have conducted extensive coalition building, research and discussion to refine the program. In the process, many ancillary healthcare stakeholders have expressed encouragement for the approach. With the approval of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (Metro Fire) Board of Directors SacMIH will be ready to initiate patient care in early 2020.  

To optimize SacMIH, the same coalition has come together to create the **Sacramento Health Information Partnership (SHIP)**. Working under the guidance of the California Association and Health Information Exchanges (CAHIE), SHIP is a focused approach to improve interoperability and enable the exchange of health information among providers throughout the Sacramento region. SHIP is leveraging existing data use agreements, national standards for interoperability and investments in electronic systems. It is creating a privacy-protected pathway to exchange patient health information without the need to invest in a separate technology platform or stand up a burdensome governance structure. This approach will also enable meaningful data gathering and analysis to measure the effectiveness of SacMIH at a relatively low cost.  

Although Metro Fire will operate SacMIH, local health systems have contributed the start-up funding to get the initiative off the ground for the first year. Dignity Health, Sutter Health, UC Davis Health and Kaiser Permanente committed Year 1 funding of $1.47 million for SacMIH in October 2017. Together, the partners will seek to secure sustainable sources of funding to maintain the program thereafter.  

**Attachment A**

![BACKGROUND](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=BACKGROUND)

**BACKGROUND**

In coalition with the four major health systems in the Sacramento Region (Dignity Health, Kaiser Permanente, Sutter Health and UC Davis Health) and local EMS agencies (Metro Fire and Sacramento Fire Department), the Hospital Council has convened discussions to promote the mobile integrated health model developed in Mesa, Arizona. The model pairs an advanced level provider with a paramedic to address the health needs of patients with a record of high utilization of healthcare services. Working under the guidance of a medical director, a nurse practitioner or physician assistant has a scope of practice sufficient to treat patients in the field and connect them to community providers (i.e. primary care provider, outpatient clinic, write prescriptions for local pharmacy, etc.). Meanwhile, if during a patient encounter it is determined that emergency care is needed, the paramedic in the crew will take the lead in initiating established EMS protocols and requesting resources for patient transport. Combining advanced level care and EMS capabilities in the same field unit results in timely patient care while reducing stress on area EDs and compressing health care costs.

**OUTCOMES IN OTHER COMMUNITIES**

SacMIH is patterned on two successful programs. The Mesa Model merited a multi-year, $12.5 million Innovation Grant from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and was successfully adopted by Anaheim Fire and Rescue in Orange County, California. During the first two and a half years Mesa operated its program, it made 1,250 patient contacts. Of those, 40 percent of patients encountered were diverted from the ED. In Anaheim’s first year, 479 patients were served. And, 58 percent of patients encountered were diverted from the ED.

The model better achieves the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Triple Aim – improving the patient experience of care (including quality and satisfaction); improving the health of populations; and reducing the per capita cost of health care. ED diversion means patients received care more immediately without the wait often experienced by low-acuity patients who present at the ED. It preserves pre-hospital and hospital emergency services capacity for true emergencies. In Sacramento, it is expected to eventually reduce ambulance patient offload times (“wall times”), decompress EDs and improve care coordination for patients. Not only has the Mesa Model resulted in reduced costs to health care institutions, but it also reduces health care costs for patients who would otherwise be obligated to pay for a share of the ambulance transport and ED bills.

More recently, the Cities of Los Angeles and Beverley Hills initiated similar programs. Although Sacramento was at the cutting edge of developing mobile integrated healthcare in California when it started the work in 2016, other communities have progressed further in the meantime.

**SACRAMENTO MOBILE INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE**

SacMIH is a three-year pilot project designed to prove the patient care success and cost effectiveness of the model in the capital region. At build-out, SacMIH will consist of two mobile units serving physical and behavioral health respectively. The objectives of the program are to:

**Attachment A**  
P27
<!-- Page 28 -->
- Improve continuity of care for high utilizers of EMS and ED services;
- Reduce unnecessary EMS transports and ED visits;
- Reduce hospital readmissions;
- Reduce health care expenditures;
- Expedite appropriate care for patients calling 911; and
- Provide appropriate care for behavioral health patients encountering 911 services;

Phase 1 will launch the Community Care Response Unit (CCRU) – the pairing of an advanced practitioner and a paramedic to serve those with a history of extraordinarily high utilization of EMS. If necessary, this unit would assess behavioral health needs and connect the patient to appropriate services (i.e. county behavioral health urgent care center, substance abuse service, Whole Person Care program, etc.). Metro Fire will consult with the partnering health systems to identify the highest utilizers of ambulance and emergency department services. Using this data, the CCRU will focus proactive attention on those patients so that they learn to access the right level of care in the right setting to better manage chronic and other non-emergent health needs. Project proponents expect that it will address the underlying health concerns in a more comprehensive way by connecting patients with a more appropriate level of care and improved education in self-care. This, in turn, will preserve pre-hospital and hospital EMS capacity and control costs.

Phase 2 consists of dispatching the CCRU to non-emergent patients calling 911. The CCRU could make six to eight patient contacts per day, because a crew may spend an hour or two with each patient rather than the typical 15- to 30-minute response and ED transport that Metro Fire units perform currently. When the CCRU is not responding to a low-acuity call routed through the 911 dispatch system, it would make proactive follow up with high utilizers. Although the medical director for the Sacramento County Emergency Medical Services Agency has expressed concerns about any such changes to the 911 dispatch system, the SacMIH coalition reached agreement with him and the senior Sacramento County staff and Board of Supervisors in 2018 that it will only advance to Phase 2 after Phase 1 shows itself to be successful and after additional consultation.

It is important to note that the City of Sacramento Fire Department (Sacramento Fire) played an integral part in the development of SacMIH from 2016 until early 2019. It was always the plan that while Metro Fire would operate the CCRU, Sacramento Fire would operate a Behavioral Health Response Unit (BHRU). The BHRU would serve behavioral health patients, whose high utilization of EMS and ED resources also place great strain on the system. It would pair a behavioral health worker with a paramedic to respond to medically-cleared persons in crisis. Ideally, the CCRU and BHRU would work in concert. For example, in the case of encountering a patient who needs care in a behavioral health facility, the CCRU could medically clear the patient in the field, then the BHRU would address the behavioral health needs – all without transporting the patient to an ED.

Due to the challenge of coordinating the work across so many partner organizations, the coalition decided to focus on helping Metro Fire stand up the CCRU first. After it is operational, the coalition plans to reengage Sacramento Fire to activate the BHRU.

Program decisions such as the days and hours of operation of the CCRU will be made by Metro Fire. The geographic scope of the program will be countywide, with the unit positioned in "hot spots" – areas where utilization of the service will have greatest effect – using Metro Fire and hospital patient data. The anticipated implementation date for the SacMIH program is early 2020. The pilot phase is expected to last thirty-six months.

The flow charts below contrasts the existing EMS system with Phase 2 and 3 of the proposed SacMIH model.

### Patient Experience in Current EMS System
- **911 Activation**
  - Fire-Paramedics, arrive: patient needs wound repair
- **Ambulance transports patient to ED for wound repair**
- **Wound repair is done. ED doctor orders a behavioral evaluation (from an outside agency)**
- **Patient is having suicidal ideation and refuses getting mental health assistance**
  - Crisis counselor writes an involuntary petition for the patient because the patient needs a behavioral health facility in-patient visit
- **Psychiatric center receives petition, when a bed is available, a pick up order is written for the patient**
- **Law enforcement or an ambulance picks patient up from hospital**
- **Patient is transported by law enforcement or ambulance to mental health facility where patient care is transferred**
- **Definitive Care (Average 2-3 days)**

### Patient Experience in Sacramento Mobile Integrated Healthcare
- **911 Activation (e.g. 1:00 pm)**
  - Fire Department and CCRU arrive, patient has self-inflicted cuts that require stitches
- **CCRU personnel repair patient's wound, give a tetanus shot and a prescription for an antibiotic**
- **BHRU performs a mental health assessment and patient is transported to appropriate treating facility**
- **Definitive Care 2:45 pm (1 hour 45 min)**

**ROLE OF MEDI-CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS**

Beginning in December 2016, the coalition has met with representatives of the Medi-Cal Managed Care plans serving Sacramento to promote SacMIH. From the outset, the health plans have expressed enthusiasm for the program. Moving forward, all parties intend to maximize the care coordination capacity of the plans to help SacMIH mesh with other appropriate wrap-around services.

**SACRAMENTO HEALTH INFORMATION PARTNERSHIP**

The same parties which are collaborating to launch SacMIH have also worked diligently since 2016 to create a data system to support it, known as SHIP. The system will help manage patient care across providers and track patient outcomes. Providers on the CCRU and BHRU will be able to connect with health system records to offer better care in the field and connect patients to the most appropriate resources.

The coalition has devised a way to accomplish health information exchange (HIE) by enhancing the interoperability of existing the electronic health record (EHR) systems of the hospitals and electronic patient care record (EPCR) systems of the ambulance providers. SHIP will do this by basing data exchange on national standards used by the largest HIE networks, many of which the local health systems already support. What is missing is a connective technology that links EHRs and EPCRs. The SHIP Steering Committee interviewed four different technology vendors to determine which could best help accomplish this. In the end, only one appears to have the capability needed – ImageTrend, using its partner, Kno2. It is the vendor used by Metro Fire and CalEMSA among many other EMS providers.

The SacMIH units’ EPCR system will access patient data managed by the hospitals’ EHR through a federated query. This means that it will contact each EHR system, and each system will respond with any relevant patient data. The systems never relinquish control of the patient data and there is no need to pay a third party to manage the information systems.

SHIP is using SacMIH as its initial use case to create a viable HIE. Once operational, it can be expanded to include other providers and operate in additional jurisdictions. Conversations with Sacramento County Public Health, Sierra-Sacramento Valley Medical Society, federally qualified health centers, physician groups and other stakeholders have developed wide support for this HIE plan. It is a relatively low-cost, low-barrier-to-entry approach that will finally accomplish HIE in the capital region.

SHIP is evolving concurrently and in conjunction with SacMIH, however, it is also depending on SacMIH to begin operations in order to build the interoperable HIE.

Specifically for the initial SacMIH use case, SHIP intends to leverage the California Data Use and Reciprocal Support Agreement (CalDURSA), onto which all SacMIH participants (except for Kaiser Permanente) have already signed. The CalDURSA is a multi-party data sharing agreement that establishes common policies, procedures, and operational practices for trusted statewide health information sharing in California. This will allow for trusted exchange of information to support SacMIH.

As it evolves, SHIP is also considering onboarding to the California Trusted Exchange Network (CTEN), which is an existing framework that combines the CalDURSA, a common set of policies and procedures, and a lightweight technical infrastructure. The CTEN has already established a trusted environment for safe and secure sharing of health information across the state. In fact, CAHIE’s other initiative – the Patient Unified Lookup System for Emergencies (PULSE) operates as a participant in the CTEN. It was first deployed for use in the fires that ravaged Northern and Southern California in 2017. Already, several SacMIH participants have or are independently onboarding to the CTEN: the California Emergency Medical Services Authority is already a participant, UC Davis is in the testing phase and Sutter Health is in the beginning phase of onboarding. Participating in the CTEN will allow SHIP to dive into analyzing the effectiveness of SacMIH, and will provide the necessary framework for other use cases, once it is ready to expand to them.

**FINANCE & GOVERNANCE**

Dignity Health, Sutter Health, UC Davis Health, and Kaiser Permanente committed Year 1 funding of $1,472,180 for SacMIH in October 2017. The Healthcare Foundation of Northern and Central California has so far collected $1,104,135 of the funds. It is in the process of developing a MOU transferring all assets, liabilities and responsibilities to Metro Fire. It will contain provisions so that Metro Fire will use the money for the purposes stated herein, continue consulting with the Hospital Council periodically to further build out the program, and report to the funding partners. This MOU will be presented to the Metro Fire Board of Directors in the near future for their approval.

While the health systems do not plan to supply more than Year 1 funding, the Hospital Council is committed to helping Metro Fire develop sustainable revenue through research and advocacy. Opportunities for mobile integrated healthcare programs to perform cost recovery already exist and are maturing. As this approach proves cost-effective in more and more jurisdictions, payors will create the means to support it.

**THE TIME IS NOW**

SacMIH has progressed at an orderly, conservative and methodical pace in order to build a sustainable program. The principal partnering organizations, as well as several other health care stakeholders, understand how it will fit into the care continuum. There is widespread support for the concept. The model has already proven itself in multiple jurisdictions. Four years of intensive collaboration have prepared the way for success. The time is now to get SacMIH operating in the community.

**TODD HARMS**  
Fire Chief  

**TO:** Board of Directors  
**DATE:** August 13, 2020  
**SUBJECT:** Extending the Medical Coverage Benefit Program for SCERS Annuitants  

---

**TOPIC**  
In the absence of SCERS (Sacramento County Employees’ Retirement System) ability to subsidize its annuitants’ medical benefit premiums, should the District continue to provide a subsidy for the premiums of former North Highlands and Florin Fire District employees or their beneficiaries?  

**SUMMARY**  
On July 9, 2015, the District adopted Resolution 2015-68 extending the District funding for the annuitant medical coverage benefits program for former employees retired under SCERS through July 1, 2020, and it is time to evaluate the adequacy of its medical coverage subsidy. If the proposed Resolution is not adopted, a total of 14 former North Highlands and Florin Fire District employees, or their beneficiaries, would have their current SCERS medical benefit premium subsidy stopped as of July 1, 2020.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
For the District to continue to fund the medical coverage subsidy for its SCERS annuitants during Fiscal Year 2020/21 would be an impact of $63,665, with a 5% cost of living adjustment (COLA) annually thereafter beginning on July 1, 2021.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Recommend the Board adopt the attached resolution with the proposed medical benefit premium subsidy at the established monthly amount as indicated on Exhibit “A”.
