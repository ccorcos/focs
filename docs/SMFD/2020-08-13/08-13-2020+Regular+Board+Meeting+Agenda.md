The mission of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District is to provide professional and compassionate protection, education and service to our community.

The Governor has declared a State of Emergency to exist in California as a result of the threat of COVID-19 (aka the “Coronavirus”). The Governor issued Executive Order N-25-20 and N-29-20, which directs Californians to follow public health directives including canceling large gatherings. The Executive Order also allows local legislative bodies to hold meetings via conference calls while still satisfying state transparency requirements.

The Governor has also issued Executive Order N-33-20, prohibiting people from leaving their homes or places of residence except to access necessary supplies and services or to engage in specified critical infrastructure employment.

The Public's health and well-being are the top priority for the Board of Directors of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District and you are urged to take all appropriate health safety precautions. To facilitate this process, the meeting of the Board will be available via Zoom at the phone number listed above. If you prefer viewing the meeting via the Zoom Application, please contact Board Clerk Penilla via email at the address listed below.

Note: The meeting is being held solely by remote means and will be made accessible to members of the public seeking to attend and address the Board solely through the phone number set forth above, except that members of the public seeking to attend and to address the Board who require reasonable accommodations to access the meeting, based on disability or other reasons, should contact the following person at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of a Regular meeting to make arrangements for such reasonable accommodations:
