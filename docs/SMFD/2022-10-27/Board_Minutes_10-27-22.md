10/20 Sac County Fire Chiefs Association meeting

10/20, Lowe's support for First Responders for National First Responders Week Donation event. Lowe’s made a gracious donations of tools and supplies to Metro Fire to show their support and appreciation for the work our members do every day.

**OPERATIONS’ REPORT**  
Deputy Chief Mitchell shared there have been 4,011 total incidents since our last report on October 13, 2022; an average of 286.5 calls per day. With 134 fire incidents responded to, an average of 9.5 calls per day.

DC Mitchell shared some CERT Airshow statistics. There were many hours put into the airshow this year, specifically 428 volunteer hours. They treated 31 patients which is much lower when compared to years past.

Lastly, on October 24th, at 0904 hours, BC5, E25, M25, E27, and TR26 responded for a reported vehicle into a house on Roseville Rd near Whyte Av, near the border of Sacramento and Placer County. Responding crews were updated en route by Dispatch that law enforcement was on scene, reporting multiple patients, along with CPR in progress on a pediatric patient. Captain John Squaglia on E25 arrived and began management of the scene with his crew. Captain Rich Rubiales on E27 established command, confirming multiple critical patients and declared a Multi Casualty Incident, requesting 3 more medics and 1 additional truck company. Battalion Chief Scott Perryman arrived and assumed Roseville Road Command, working with EMS 24/Captain Shannon Chamberlin to setup communication with UC Davis for patient notification and hospital destinations. Within 7 minutes of arriving on scene, Firefighter/Paramedic Aleksey Shahk on M25 had the pediatric patient assessed, packaged, and began transport to the Emergency Department. En route to the hospital, M25's crew was able to get pulses back on the pediatric patient. Within 20 minutes of our crews arriving on scene, all 4 patients were transported to local hospitals.

Our crews received several compliments and positive feedback from law enforcement and the area hospitals receiving patients. In particular, early declaration of an MCI, early notification to UC Davis, and frequent updates with detailed information, were positive remarks provided as part of our official MCI critique. This is a direct testament to the strong work and professional attitude of the Metro Fire members that responded to this incident.
