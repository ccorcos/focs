Retirement  
Congratulations to Engineer Doug Boan on his retirement on October 7, 2022.  

Congratulations to EMS System Technician Marcy Mateo on her retirement on October 10, 2022.  

Meetings/Conferences  
9/19-9/23 NFPA Urban Fire Forum: Ambulance Patient Offload Time (APOT). There has been much attention given to what we have done in California, and the presentations discussed that progress.  

9/26, Sac Fire / Metro Fire: Fire Chiefs and DCs Meeting – Met with new Fire Chief Costamagna, and President Saylors and I attended his swearing-in ceremony. Congratulations to him and it was great meeting with him and his team and continuing those meetings.  

9/28, Labor Management Collaboration Meeting (LMCM) – Had our monthly meeting where we discussed about ten items and a number of carry-over that was cleared off.  

9/30, 22nd Annual Public Safety & Community Appreciation Luncheon where the topic was: raising awareness on fentanyl related deaths. There was much discussion of changing that from a fentanyl overdose to a fentanyl poisoning. Director Walt White was a member of the panel representing law enforcement, first responders and family members who discussed the importance of narcan and the importance of reversing the poisoning.  

Participated in meetings with Rancho Cordova, where we continued to discuss fentanyl and the affect it had on our community, and had lunch with the Citrus Heights Police Chief. During the Rancho Cordova 2X2 we talked about the City Manager announcing his retirement, so it was great to wish him well.  

OPERATIONS' REPORT  
We have run 6,809 total incidents since our last report on September 22, 2022; an average of 290 calls per day. 188 fire incidents were responded to, average of 9 calls per day.  

On Tuesday 10/11, 8 Metro Members were in attendance at the Mercy San Juan EMS Run Review. This is an educational opportunity for Pre-Hospital and Hospital care providers to review specific incidents that occurred recently and that offer an educational competent or lessons learned. Several cases were reviewed, allowing our members to get a better understanding of the Hospital and our members can work more efficiently together during the radio report and pass over to the ED staff. M23 and 6 members from Academy Class 22-1 attended. The annual holiday run review will take place on December 14th.  

On October 1st and in coordination with the Staffing Team and Labor, we started a new callback staffing procedure to assist in daily staffing management. Although it is very early on and there are other factors to consider, we have seen a significant decrease in mandatory callbacks this month. However, we will need to gather more information over a longer period of time before making a final determination on the effectiveness of the procedure.  

On October 8th, at 0500, E24 and AMR801 were dispatched for a possible overdose. Enroute, Fire Dispatch updated that there were 3 patients on scene, two of them unresponsive with chest compressions being performed by bystanders. E24 added S24, M109, and M23 to the incident.

as well. On scene, crews managed three patients suffering from effects of a possible fentanyl overdose. E24 company officer, Captain Stephen Perry, managed what would be described as a chaotic scene, with three separate critical patients. E24 and S24’s crew maintained care of the two patients under CPR, and assisted with treatment enroute to the hospital. Great job by all the members involved for maintaining composure, professionalism and high levels of patient care during a difficult incident.

3. SMFD – FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL 522 REPORT  
Matt Cole, Local 522 Vice President congratulated Marcie and Doug on their retirements they will be missed, and welcomes Allisyn.

They have had multiple service delivery meetings with several items discussed including deployment, how to increase services, and an added first responder on Squad 24 and impact they had. He confirmed the labor management meeting was productive and discussed benefits for members, community, and the organization. Negotiations have been productive, the Board will hear more about that in closed session. So far, the call back changes are seeing positive results. Wishes everyone the best of luck to those taking the engineer test this week. After this engineer test they hope to have the rank fully staffed, which will be the first time in a long time.

VP Cole attended a few events, including the star six golf tournament and legends of golf tournament to benefit the United Way. He also attended District Attorney Shubert’s annual luncheon. It was an important discussion for our community and he urges everyone to visit onepillcankillsac.com and watch the various videos.

**BOARD MEMBER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS**  
Director Jones thanked senior staff for helping her get caught up from while she was traveling.

He emphasized the importance of taking care of our members.

**DATE:**  
October 27, 2022  

**TO:**  
Board of Directors  

**SUBJECT:**  
Notice of Award – RFP 22-04 Fire Station Architecture and Engineering Services  

**BACKGROUND**  
In 2004, the District purchased property located 8101 Bradshaw Road in Sacramento as the intended site of a future fire station. Development and population in the area, combined with increasing call volume for nearby stations has triggered the need to move forward at this time with the design and construction of a new fire station at the site.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Staff issued Request for Proposal (RFP) 22-04 Fire Station Architecture and Engineering Services on September 6, 2022 to the five (5) firms included on the District's existing Architecture and Engineering Services Multiple Award Schedule. A public proposal opening was conducted on September 27, 2022 and two (2) proposals were received in response to the RFP. The Evaluation Committee reviewed and scored the proposals based on the following criteria: proposed work plan and demonstrated understanding of the District's need; relevant past performance; experience and qualifications of the proposed project team; proposed cost and anticipated value brought to the District; and conformance to the submittal requirements. Final weighted scores for the proposals are as follows:  

- COAR Design Group (Score: 82.5)  
- LCA Architects (Score: 76.17)  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The proposed cost for the design contract is $999,635. Funding for the station design was approved in the District's FY22/23 Capital Improvement Plan and is currently budgeted in the District's approved FY22/23 Final Budget (Development Impact Fee Fund).  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends that the Board authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to execute and administer an agreement materially similar to the draft attached with the highest ranked proposer or second highest ranked proposer, should an agreement not be reached with the former.

DISTRICT requested revisions to the plans and/or technical specifications that modify or otherwise change the scope of the project will be considered Extra Services and will be subject to fee negotiation with DESIGN CONTRACTOR prior to the commencement of such work.

22. **CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS COMPLETION**  
Construction document drawings and technical specifications shall not be considered complete unless approved by the DISTRICT and until the local building official with jurisdiction over the Project has approved them.

k. Discover and inform the District of any design permits required, including permits for approval of the design work either on or off site for the Project.  
l. A detailed room-by-room tabulation of both the gross and net floor areas.  
m. Detailed construction cost estimate that provides a breakdown of costs for each major area of construction work. The estimate shall separate the Project's building costs from site and utilities costs. All estimates will include individual item unit costs for materials, labor, and equipment. Sales tax, subcontractor's mark-ups, general contractor's mark-ups, overhead and profit shall be listed separately. All cost estimates shall be priced out at the current market conditions prevailing at the time of the estimate.  

4. Construction Documents  
a. Final contract drawings, calculations, and technical specifications at 75%, 90%, and 100% progress, organized by discipline and sufficient in detail to describe the requirements for construction by public works contract for the Project, including any requested alternates for the Project.
