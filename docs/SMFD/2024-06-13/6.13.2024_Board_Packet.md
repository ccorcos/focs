**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** June 13, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Disclosure of material expenditure – Insurance Broker Services – USI Insurance Services – $50,000  

**TOPIC**  
Disclosure of material expenditure to purchase insurance brokerage services for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025.  

**SUMMARY**  
Staff will be expending funds to purchase Insurance Brokerage Services. The expenditure will be payable to USI in the amount of $50,000 for insurance brokerage services.  

**DISCUSSION**  
USI Insurance Service provides Insurance Brokerage Services. Services include risk management, marketing, day-to-day consulting on servicing of insurance, claims services and risk engineering services. For the fiscal year 2024/2025, USI brokered the District's commercial insurance package.

**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** June 13, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Disclosure of material expenditure – Excess Workers’ Compensation Insurance – Safety National Casualty Corporation – $506,933.00.  

**TOPIC**  
Disclosure of material expenditure to purchase Excess Workers’ Compensation Insurance for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025.  

**SUMMARY**  
The expenditure will be payable to Safety National Casualty Corporation in the amount of $506,933.00.  

**DISCUSSION**  
USI Insurance Services provided the District's insurance brokerage services this year and managed the marketing of the District’s Excess Workers’ Compensation Liability Insurance. This type of coverage provides the District additional insurance coverage in the event of a catastrophic workers’ compensation loss that could occur in excess of our self-insured retention (the portion the District would pay before the insurance pays). For these quotes, self-insured retentions of $4.0 million, per occurrence, were selected, consistent with limits chosen last year. Several carriers were contacted during marketing. The other companies that were solicited, Midwest Employers, Star Insurance, and Arch Insurance either declined due to the nature of the exposure or no longer write standalone fire districts or they couldn't be competitive with Safety National. The District’s rate is decreasing by 5%, however, our premium is increasing due to payroll being estimated at 12% higher than FY23/24. Should our payroll be lower than expected, the difference in funds will be returned to the District.  

Safety National Casualty Corporation with a self-insured retention of $4.0 million was chosen as the carrier and is the recommendation of USI Insurance Services to carry the District’s Excess Workers’ Compensation Insurance needs.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The fiscal impact is $506,933.00. Funds sufficient to meet this obligation are budgeted in the Preliminary Budget for 2024/2025.

**DATE:** June 13, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**FROM:** Ty Bailey, Deputy Chief - Administration  
**SUBJECT:** Contract for Employee Assistance Program (EAP) – Concern  

**TOPIC**  
Staff requests the Board of Director’s approval to enter into a one-year contract with Concern Employee Assistance Program, doing business as Concern, for Employee Assistance Program (EAP) services effective July 1, 2024 without a competitive solicitation process.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) values the health and wellbeing of its members and is committed to providing support to members who may be experiencing personal, health, or work-related issues. Providing EAP services is one way in which the District may assist members cope with a variety of life-events, including events unique to the first-responder culture. As a benefit to our employees, the District currently offers EAP services through Concern. This program provides employees and eligible family members referrals to licensed, professional therapists/counselors. Included in this benefit are 8 (eight) free counseling sessions per person, per issue, per 12-month period for each employee and each eligible family member. Family members include the employee’s spouse/domestic partner and dependent children up to age 26.  

The EAP services cover a wide range of issues including:  
- Stress, depression, anxiety  
- Major life changes  
- Grief and loss  
- Relationships  
- Communication issues  
- Substance abuse  
- Emotional wellbeing  
- Job stress, work conflicts

![Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+2)

**DISCUSSION**

Over the last several years, the District’s Peer Support Team has worked to educate members on the services available through our EAP and have connected members with these essential resources when they need it most. Last year, the District's prior EAP provider, MHN, announced that they were leaving the EAP market, thus causing the District to unexpectedly find a replacement EAP provider. To ensure members had continuous access to EAP services, the District entered into a 1-year agreement with Concern. Concern has a first responder specialty panel of counselors to assist with the unique needs of our members and their families. The Peer Support Team has had a positive experience working with Concern over the last year and has a desire to continue with their services.

The District’s Purchasing and Contracting policy states that purchases may be allowed without competitive bidding when the branch Deputy Chief and Purchasing Agent determine that making of a purchase is reasonably necessary for the conduct of District business. The Peer Support team and members were faced with learning to navigate a new EAP last year. Continuing service with Concern for another year will help ensure members will continue to have access to clinicians that may be currently assisting them and prevent possible disruptions in care.

**FISCAL IMPACT**

The estimated annual cost of 1 year contract with Concern will be $116,948.40. The cost is $14.64 per first responder employee per month and $4.75 for non-first responders per month. This cost is budgeted as part of the Benefit package that the District offers to the employees.

**RECOMMENDATION**

Staff recommends that the Board of Directors authorize the Fire Chief or designee to execute a one-year contract with Concern without a competitive RFP process, effective July 1, 2024.

**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** June 13, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Zinfandel Phase 3 Buildout – Project Authorization & Contract Award  

**TOPIC**  
Request to authorize the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) Zinfandel First Responder Training Facility Phase 3 Buildout Project to proceed as described below.  

**BACKGROUND**  
On February 23, 2023, the Board of Directors (Board) adopted Resolution 2023-009 which amended the District's FY 2022/23 Capital Improvement Plan to include the funding of the Zinfandel First Responder Training Facility Phase 3 Buildout Project. On October 12, 2023, the Board adopted Resolution 2023-065 which determined that it was in the best interest of the District to use the design-build construction delivery method for the project using a two-step best value procurement process and delegated authority to the Fire Chief or his designee to effectuate the project. The District subsequently adopted resolutions which approved a contract award to Benham Design, LLC for owner advisor services for the project (2023-078), established a prequalified short-list of design build entities eligible to compete for the project (2024-002), and authorized the issuance of Request for Proposals (RFP) 24-02 for the best value procurement of design-build services (2024-006) based on an estimated project budget of $17 million.  

**DISCUSSION**  
RFP 24-02 was issued on February 9, 2024 to solicit proposals from the District's three prequalified short-listed design-build entities. During the eleven-week competition process, the District conducted three proprietary pre-submission conferences with each proposer to answer questions and provide feedback on the proposers' design concepts. The competition process closed on April 26, 2024 with proposals submitted by Diede Construction, Inc. and Roebbelen Contracting, Inc. Swinerton Builders withdrew from the competition and did not submit a proposal.  

The District conducted a technical review of both submitted proposals and scored them in accordance with the selection criteria approved by the Board and outlined in the RFP. Diede Construction, Inc. submitted the highest scoring proposal, which was determined by the District's internal selection board to offer the best value to the District. As previously approved by the Board and outlined in the RFP, Roebbelen Contracting, Inc. is eligible to receive a competition stipend in consideration of its work to prepare the design documents required to submit its proposal.  

In addition to the design-build contract, the District has also recognized its need for additional owner advisor services through project completion, in order to ensure project success. In consideration of this need, staff has negotiated an amendment to the existing owner advisor agreement with Benham Design, LLC to extend the term of the agreement and provide additional services through project completion, for an additional fee of $325,000.

Fire Chief  

**DATE:** June 13, 2024  

**TO:** Board of Directors  

**FROM:** Mark Jones, Logistics Manager – Support Services Branch  

**SUBJECT:** Contract Award Recommendation – Janitorial Cleaning and Maintenance Services  

**TOPIC**  
Staff requests the Board of Directors approve a contract award to PRIDE Industries One Inc for janitorial cleaning and maintenance services.  

**BACKGROUND**  
To ensure clean and sanitary conditions are maintained at the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District or Metro Fire) administrative facilities, the District requires contracted janitorial cleaning and maintenance services. The provision of such services is also required per the contracts held between the District and the District's two lessees that occupy District owned facilities.  

**DISCUSSION**  
On March 26, 2024, the District's Purchasing Division issued Request for Proposals (RFP) 24-03 to solicit proposals from qualified and experienced firms to provide the highest level of janitorial cleaning and maintenance services for the following locations:  

- Metro Fire Headquarters, 1st and 2nd Floors 10545 Armstrong Ave., Mather, CA  
- Metro Fire Logistics Division 3012 Gold Canal Dr., Rancho Cordova, CA  
- Metro Fire Training Division 3121 Gold Canal Dr., Rancho Cordova, CA  
- Sacramento County Sheriff's Department 2101 Hurley Way, Sacramento, CA  
- Metro Fire Communications Division 4427 Dudley Blvd., McClellan Park, CA  
- Metro Fire Fleet Division 4425 Dudley Blvd, McClellan Park, CA  

Interested firms were required to attend a mandatory pre-submittal job-walk on April 2nd, 2024 to familiarize themselves with each facility in need of the janitorial services described within the RFP. Firms with attendees that did not attend the job-walk in its entirety were not permitted to submit a proposal. Representatives from seven janitorial firms attended the job-walk. Of these seven firms, four were eligible to submit a proposal as three firms’ representatives did not attend the complete job-walk.  

Metro Fire received three proposals through the OpenGov online portal from the following firms:  

- City Wide Property Services, Inc  
- Universal Building Services & Supply Co.  
- PRIDE Industries One Inc  

**Serving Sacramento and Placer Counties**  
P36
<!-- Page 37 -->
By submitting an RFP, proposers certified that they will meet any and all Displaced Janitor Opportunity Act requirements contained in the California Labor Code, Sections 1060-1065. Additionally, it was verified that all proposers were registered with the Labor Commissioner's Office as janitorial service providers as required by the Property Services Workers Protection Act.

Proposals were reviewed and scored by an evaluation panel using the following criteria:
- Qualifications and Experience with Providing Services of Similar Size, Scope, and Complexity
- Program Understanding & Methodology
- Past Performance
- Conformance to Specified RFP Format
- Fee Proposal

PRIDE Industries One Inc was the highest scoring proposer.

**FISCAL IMPACT**

The cost of the contract for all six locations will be $222,552 for the first year, with an average of a 3.5% increase per year for the remainder of the contract. Prior to the proposal submissions, funds were allocated in the preliminary budget for janitorial services in the amount of $213,000. Final budget will reflect the total amount of the contract.

**RECOMMENDATION**

Staff recommends that the Board adopt a resolution to approve a contract award to PRIDE Industries One Inc and authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to negotiate and execute a professional services agreement materially similar to the attached agreement. The contract will be in effect for three years from the date of agreement with the option to extend for two additional one-year terms.

Employees removed from conducting work on District property shall be prohibited from performing any work at any District property moving forward.

A. **Criminal Background Check**  
Since the work required herein may require entry into secured County facilities, the District will require the Contractor to conduct a criminal background check on all employees who may be assigned to perform on the contract, including those hired during the course of the contract. Such background check shall be conducted at the Contractor’s expense and shall be coordinated with the California Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of the Attorney General, Fingerprint Submissions (DOJ Live-scan).

Any person or persons not acceptable to the District shall be prohibited from working on the contract. Certain “infractions” in the background investigation may be grounds for disqualification. On-site employees shall not have a criminal history and/or currently be on parole or probation. Contractor shall obtain written permission from employees prior to releasing background check results to the District.

Janitorial staff will be provided with badges/keys that will enable entry into District facilities. Should a staff member lose their badge/keys, the Contractor shall immediately notify the District’s Facilities Manager. Keys shall not be duplicated. All badges and keys shall be returned to the District upon completion or termination of the contract before final payment will be released. If it is determined that the Contractor has not followed the safekeeping practices for keys, access control, District materials, or property outlined in this RFP, the District is authorized to make needed improvements at the expense of the Contractor (ex. the Contractor shall be responsible for any costs associated with rekeying or recoding locks if all keys and badges are not returned to the District).

Contractor shall ensure facilities are locked and secured before leaving areas that were locked prior to their entry and upon leaving a facility should they be the last individual to leave. Leaving building entrance doors unlocked or propped open is unacceptable. Contractor may be required to learn how to operate District security alarm systems. Costs associated with response to a false alarm may be deducted from the Contractor’s payment. Contractor shall certify all employees have been trained on emergency and safety procedures at District facilities. If an irregularity is discovered while conducting janitorial duties, Contractor shall immediately notify the District. Irregularities shall include, but are not limited to vandalism, broken glass, leaks, defective fixtures, unstable furniture, electrical hazards, or doors left unlocked. Janitorial staff shall not open desk drawers or cabinets, move or read material on desks, nor use District office equipment. The removal or tampering of District supplies or equipment is prohibited, and the District may seek prosecution of those in violation.

**F. Work Performance**  
The District’s Facilities Manager or their designee will conduct regular quality inspections of the work performed by the Contractor. The District shall be the sole judge of quality of the work provided by the Contractor. If deficiencies are discovered, the District will notify the Contractor’s designated point of contact to take immediate and appropriate action to achieve adherence to the expectations specified within this RFP. Substandard or unsatisfactory work performance shall be corrected at the Contractor’s expense. Payment will not be rendered until satisfactory corrections have been made. If the Contractor fails to perform the duties as  

**Page 23 of 26**  
**P61**
<!-- Page 62 -->
specified within this RFP, it is agreed and understood that the District will only pay for service actually received. If substandard or unsatisfactory work is not corrected, the District will cancel the contract for non-performance and award to another contractor.
