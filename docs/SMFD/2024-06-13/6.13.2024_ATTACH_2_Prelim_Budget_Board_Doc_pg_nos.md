**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

June 13, 2024  

TO: Board of Directors, Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District  
FROM: Adam House, Fire Chief  
RE: Preliminary Budget for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2025  

**BUDGET SUMMARY**  

On behalf of the men and women of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, I am pleased to present this Fiscal Year (FY) 2024/25 Preliminary Budget report. In this report I will describe the expected fiscal condition through June 30, 2025, and identify external and structural risks to the District’s long-term fiscal health.

The District’s fiscal condition will diminish in FY 2024/25 relative to the prior fiscal year, with General Fund expenditures and transfers out exceeding revenues and transfers in by $6.8 million. This trend was largely anticipated: the long-term General Fund forecast included in the prior fiscal year projected a reserve transfer of $5.2 million General Fund in FY 2024/25, mainly due to growing labor costs coupled with slowing property tax growth.

A combination of persistently high inflation and five deferred interest rate cuts (which would spur home sale activity) are negatively affecting the District’s bottom line. While property tax growth continues, it’s at a rate 30-40% less than recent years. Metro Fire is not alone in encountering stiff economic headwinds: the City of Sacramento and the State of California are facing budget deficits of $66 million and $70 billion, respectively.

Projected expenses are expected to continue a multiyear climb, with modest increases in FY 2024/25. Expenditures from all funds are expected to increase 4 percent from FY 2023/24 to FY 2024/25, and a large infrastructure project list will not be fully addressed. The infrastructure need includes a capital projects list of nearly $202 million and documented a deferred maintenance backlog of more than $80 million. Annual retirement-related expenses have grown rapidly as well: 49 percent over the last five years, with a 14 percent spike in FY 2024/25.

The District’s main revenue source, property tax, is expected to continue to grow, and the Public Provider Ground Emergency Medical Transport (PPGEMT) program will provide substantial ongoing revenues to the District.

The proposed budget meets service level needs and fully funds positions, with funding for four training academies: two firefighter academies and two Metro Medic Program academies.

District is sufficiently funded for current spending levels, but lacks the financial resources to address long-term liabilities and capital priorities.

Consistent with regional and statewide economic trends, the District faces more years with modest revenue growth. Property tax revenue growth is expected to continue at a slower rate than FY 2023/24 due to lower home sale volumes. Those impacts are seen in FY 2024/25 with 3.7 percent property tax revenue growth, nearly 2 percent lower than FY 2023/24, and long-term projections are at or below 4 percent through FY 2028/29. The cost of goods is another persistent challenge for the District, with lingering slowdowns in vehicle supply chains and inflationary pressures on supplies, ranging from fuel to electronics.

The FY 2024/25 Preliminary Budget includes a $51.2 million investment as part of a five-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Plan, the District’s third CIP Plan. The District’s CIP developed in accordance with the CIP Policy approved by the Board of Directors in February 2022 and followed a detailed process of evaluation and comparison to reach a final selection of 27 projects.

With the Board of Directors’ approval of this FY 2024/25 Preliminary Budget plan, the District’s focus will be achieving planned service levels using all available sources of funding; ensuring ongoing all-risk fire, rescue and emergency medical needs of the District are met; and building necessary reserves for fiscal contingencies.

## BUDGET DISCUSSION

The FY 2024/25 Preliminary Budget is described below by all funds and individual funds, followed by a district budget comparison and risks and issues.

### ALL FUNDS

The Preliminary Budget includes appropriated expenditures from all seven funds of $374.0 million and revenues of $322.1 million, with the difference closed by capital financing and fund balance transfers.

Property taxes are expected to yield the majority of District revenues, about 65 percent. Based on estimated property values as of July 1, 2024, assessed property value growth will yield a $7.5 million increase in property tax revenues from FY 2023/24 to FY 2024/25. The District’s second largest revenue source is charges for services (e.g., emergency medical services, plan inspections), which at $103.3 million comprises 32 percent of all District revenues in FY 2024/25.

Labor costs will make up 69.4 percent of all District expenses across all funds, at $259.4 million, followed by services and supplies (14.8 percent, $55.1 million), capital outlay (13.1 percent, $49.1 million), and taxes and fees (2.8 percent, $10.3 million).

### GENERAL FUND

The FY 2024/25 Preliminary Budget includes $280.8 million in General Fund revenues, a $8.6 million (3.2 percent) increase relative to FY 2023/24, and $304.4 million in expenditures, a $17.2 million (6.0 percent) increase in expenditures.

![General Fund Revenue: Property Tax and Other Revenues](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=General+Fund+Revenue:+Property+Tax+and+Other+Revenues)

After accounting for a transfer in from the Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) Fund of $22.8 million and transfers out to the Capital Facilities and Grants Funds of $6.0 million, the FY 2024/25 General Fund budget results in revenues and financing sources approximately $6.8 million less than expenditures. This shortfall will be covered by a reduction to the General Fund reserve.

**General Fund Revenue**  
Major General Fund revenue sources and trends are described below. Including the $22.8 million transfer in from the IGT Fund, total General Fund financing sources are projected to reach $303.7 million.

The chart below shows historical General Fund revenues and other financing sources since FY 2013/14. Fiscal Year 2024/25 is expected to yield the twelfth consecutive year of property tax revenue growth and fourteenth consecutive year of total revenue growth.

The primary factors contributing to this revenue increase in FY 2024/25 are:

**Property Taxes**  
Estimated FY 2024/25 property tax revenues of $210.4 million account for approximately 75 percent of total General Fund revenue sources excluding transfers. Property tax revenues are expected to grow 3.7 percent over FY 2023/24.

**Medic and CRRD Cost Recovery**  
Medic cost (EMS) income of $49.7 million represent an increase of approximately 4.9 percent over the FY 2023/24 Midyear Budget estimate of $47.4 million. The expected increase is a result of modest growth in ambulance transport activity and CPI adjustment.

The FY 2024/25 Preliminary Budget reflects Community Risk Reduction Division fees, including operational permits, plan reviews, new construction inspections, general fire and life safety inspections, and other miscellaneous services, which are expected to generate $4.8 million in FY 2024/25.

**General Fund Expenditures**  
General Fund expenditures of $304.5 million represent a $17.2 million increase over FY 2023/24 expenditures. Including the $6.0 million in transfers to other funds, overall General Fund expenditures reach $310.5 million.

**Labor**  
The District’s labor costs, which includes all compensation, benefits, and medical costs, total $257.8 million, a $15.6 million (6.5 percent) increase relative to FY 2023/24.

The following table displays the growth of labor costs as a share of General Fund revenues and transfers in since FY 2017/18. Labor costs will increase as a share of General Fund revenues—including net transfers from the IGT fund—from 81.7 percent in FY 2023/24 to 84.9 percent in FY 2024/25.

**General Fund and Labor Cost Share, 2017/18 - 2024/25**

**COMPENSATION**  
The largest factor contributing to the increase in General Fund labor expenses is wages, which are expected to grow by nearly $8.8 million (11.4 percent) above FY 2023/24 wages, mainly due to the addition of new staff through academies, the expiration of the SAFER grant, and wage growth.

The second greatest compensation cost is constant staffing, which at $26.4 million is not largely changed from the FY 2023/24 Midyear figure. Notwithstanding the filling of almost all suppression positions, which typically reduces overtime costs, constant staffing is expected to remain high due to continued elevated use of leaves of all kinds, including workers’ compensation, vacation, and sick leave.

The following table compares staffing levels, by division, between FY 2023/24 and FY 2024/25.

## BENEFITS

In FY 2024/25 retirement benefits, including CalPERS retirement costs, pension bond payments, and residual payments to the Sacramento County Employees’ Retirement System will increase by $5.9 million (8.9 percent) from FY 2023/24 to $72.1 million.

Payments for the CalPERS Safety Plan will increase by $7.2 million (14.0 percent) relative to FY 2023/24, to approximately $58.6 million. This increase is mainly attributable to increases in the required unfunded liability contribution and incorporates the substantial market losses reported by PERS in July 2022 (approximately $5.5 million), and the cost of additional employees ($1.5 million).

![Medical benefit expenses, including employee and retiree medical care, vision, and dental, are collectively expected to increase 6.9 percent relative to FY 2023/24, from $33.6 million to $35.8 million. Workers’ compensation claim costs are anticipated to decline relative to the Midyear Budget. Based on recent cost trends, budgeted expenditures are $4.3 million, a 32.5 percent decline from FY 2023/24 Midyear Budget. If needed, unanticipated settlement costs may be paid from the Workers’ Compensation Reserve Fund or redirection of other funds. Services and Supplies The General Fund services and supplies budget totals $42.3 million, a $850,000 (2.0 percent) increase from the prior year. Changes from FY 2023/24 include: • $596,000 increase for the District’s liability and property insurance premiums • $344,000 increase in fire equipment servicing • $418,000 increase in Dispatch services, mainly related to a new contract for Dispatch employees. • $606,000 decrease in medical equipment servicing, mainly related to the prior year replacement of gurneys and power loader equipment. Taxes, Licenses, Assessments, Debt Service & Contributions This expenditure category includes the assessment paid to the County for property tax administration and General Fund debt service payments and other assessments and fees. FY 2024/25 expenditures for this category are budgeted at $4.4 million, a $731,000 increase relative to FY 2023/24, mainly due to increased contributions towards a new county-wide property tax system. General Fund Reserves The amount of General Fund Reserves is expected to be $34.7 million on June 30, 2025. As a percentage of net budgeted expenditures, this represents an 11.3 percent reserve. This amount is a $6.8 million decline from the FY 2023/24 reserve and reflects a forecasted reserve decline: the FY 2023/24 Final Budget forecast a FY 2024/25 reserve half a percent higher, at 11.8 percent. The reserve decline is mainly attributable to slowing property tax growth, employee contract commitments, and financial market conditions. The reserve calculation will be updated in the FY 2024/25 Final Budget, and any new General Fund revenues or cost savings recognized from FY 2023/24 will improve the District’s reserve level. As specified in the District’s reserve policy, any unassigned fund balance remaining at fiscal year-end will be classified as General Fund reserves and included in the reserve amount. General Fund Forecast The following table provides an updated five-year forecast (FY 2024/25 + four fiscal years) of General Fund revenues, expenditures, and transfers. This forecast is intended to be used to inform decisions that would commit the District to new expenditures over the life of the forecast. Incorporated into this forecast are all known revenue trends (e.g., property tax, EMS revenues, and transfers in), and expenditure trends (e.g., health care expense, retirement, wages, benefits, services and supplies). The District relies on HdL Coren and Cone, a property tax consultant to local agencies across California, to estimate property tax trends. Serving Sacramento and Placer Counties - 7 -**

**INTERGOVERNMENTAL TRANSFER (IGT) FUND**

The District receives Intergovernmental Transfers (IGTs) through the State of California to recover costs associated with the District’s transport of the uninsured and Medi-Cal managed care program beneficiaries. There are now two IGT programs where the State uses medical transport provider funds to secure matching federal funds targeted for recovering these types of patient transports. The two IGT programs are the Voluntary Rate Range Program (VRRP), which funds services for Medi-Cal patients and the uninsured, and the Public Provider Ground Emergency Medical Transport (PPEGMT) program, which provides partial reimbursement for the transport of mainly State Medi-Cal program beneficiaries.

The expenditures and revenues associated with these programs are tracked in a separate fund in order to provide greater transparency, and the net revenue generated is transferred to the General Fund to fund District costs to provide healthcare-related services.

It is anticipated that VRRP payments covering activity between January and December 2022 will be paid during FY 2024/25. A total of $5.8 million is expected to be transferred to the State in order to receive approximately $14.8 million, a net VRRP (i.e., IGT Fund) revenue of $9.0 million.

The PPGEMT program was established by AB 1705 (Bonta, 2019) and became effective on January 1, 2023. Revenues from the new PPGEMT program in FY 2024/25 are expected to reach $20.0 million, which are offset by a $6.2 million PPGEMT payment to the State, for a net revenue gain of $13.8 million.

**CAPITAL FACILITIES FUND**

The Capital Facilities Fund accounts for the costs of acquiring and financing capital assets, defined as assets with an individual cost of $5,000 or more and a useful life of at least one year. Capital expenditures include the cost of land, buildings, equipment, and other related improvements. Capital assets are typically funded by transfers from the General Fund, issuance of capital leases, and occasional sale of District assets.

Budgeted expenditures for FY 2024/25 total $25.6 million in the Capital Facilities Fund. A total of $19.9 million is allocated for capital outlay, including $14.7 million in projects financed through capital leases and $5.7 million transfer from the General Fund for capital expenditures and debt service payments.

A large portion of capital projects are also captured under the District’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Plan budget, which covers capital asset projects valued over $50,000. The District’s CIP plan covers fiscal years 2024/25 through 2028/29. Divisions are invited each spring to submit projects for the CIP and projects are then selected for the CIP by reviewing project initiation forms, which are then ranked by an executive scoring team. The Board conducts a final project review and makes a final selection based on funds available.

Major capital outlay purchases planned for FY 2024/25 include:
- Ladder truck replacement, $1.7 million
- Four new ambulance replacements, $1.2 million
- Five Type I engine replacements: $5.4 million
- Four Type III engine replacements: 2.2 million
- Technology storage appliance replacements, $415,000

**GRANTS FUND**

The FY 2024/25 Preliminary Budget anticipates Grants Fund revenues of $2.0 million and expenditures of $1.8 million, with $1.6 million of that spending related to the final funding for the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grant program. When those funds expire the 21 positions funded under SAFER will be funded from the General Fund. As additional

grants are awarded and accepted, grant revenues and expenditures will be reflected through budget revisions.

## DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES FUND

Annual development impact fee (DIF) revenue of $3.0 million is budgeted for FY 2024/25. DIF revenue is restricted to costs related to new fire stations and equipment needed to mitigate the impacts of new development. During FY 2024/25, the District expects to combine DIF with existing fund balances and $2.7 million in capital lease revenue to expend $15.2 million for the preliminary phases of construction for a new Vineyard Springs fire station and land acquisition for a new Grant Line 220 fire station.

## LEASED PROPERTIES FUND

The District leases property not required for current operations and accounts for the revenues and expenditures associated with leased property in the Leased Properties Fund. Total lease revenue for FY 2024/25 is expected to be $1.2 million and expenses associated with the leased property are anticipated to be $783,000. The Leased Properties Fund is expected to gain $400,000 and end the fiscal year with a balance of $1.9 million.

## DISTRICT COMPARISON

The District is the seventh-largest local fire agency in California and, as a special district commissioned mainly to provide fire suppression and emergency transport for 16 communities and 2 counties, has few comparable fire service agencies. One comparative model is the Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA), which serves 24 communities and 1.89 million persons across 587 square miles, compared to the District’s 720,000 persons across 359 square miles.

The most recent adopted OCFA budget for FY 2023/24 shows the total OCFA General Operating Fund budget to be $494.0 million, compared to District’s $287.2 million General Fund budget over the same period. On a per capita basis, the OCFA general operating budget equates to a $261, compared to $392 for the District, a difference of $131.

District revenue sources are somewhat similar to OCFA. Property taxes made up 75 percent of District revenues in FY 2022/23, compared to 63 percent for the OCFA. Charges for services made up 21.6 percent of total District revenues in FY 2022/23, compared to 22.8 percent for the OCFA.

## RISKS AND ISSUES

Through financial planning and forecasting the District has identified risks and issues that must be addressed to ensure the District’s long-term fiscal health. As explained below, the Preliminary Budget for FY 2024/25 reflects continued focus on addressing the risks and issues.

![Unfunded Liabilities for Pensions and Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB)](https://example.com/image.png)

**Unfunded Liabilities for Pensions and Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB)**  
The FY 2024/25 budget reflects an increase of $7.6 million (8.4 percent) to CalPERS to fund the District’s Safety and Miscellaneous pension plans. CalPERS’ poor market performance in the 2021/22 plan year resulted in this sizeable contribution increase. However, market performance improved the following year, suggesting smaller contribution increases to come in FY 2025/26.

The FY 2024/25 budget also reflects a $4.0 million payment to the Sacramento County Employees’ Retirement System in accordance with a funding agreement to address the unfunded pension liability associated with a predecessor fire agency. Under this agreement, the District will make annual payments through approximately FY 2036/37, depending on actuarial adjustments.

The District has been pre-funding its OPEB retiree medical obligations since 2013 and the FY 2024/25 budget reflects contributions of $4.2 million, about $100,000 less than the FY 2023/24 contribution. This contribution will fund the explicit subsidy liability, budgeted as a combination of retiree medical premium payments and contributions to the California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust (CERBT) Fund. After eleven years the unfunded liability is approximately 26 percent funded.

**Unfunded Capital Projects and Vehicle Replacements and Maintenance**  
Capital project needs far exceed current and forecasted District revenues. The District’s latest CIP Plan identifies approximately $202 million in capital projects. Additionally, the District’s most recent Facility Condition Assessment identified the need for over $80 million of repairs to existing fire stations and facilities over the next 20 years, as well as approximately $50 million of modernization costs for these facilities. With information gleaned from the CIP Plan, the District will prioritize projects and consider financing tools such as long-term financing and new revenue options.

As new development occurs within the District boundaries, costs associated with constructing, equipping, and supporting new fire stations will also grow. FY 2024/25 capital outlay spending also includes $12.5 million associated with the construction of a new Vineyard Springs Station and land acquisition for a Grant Line 220 station.

Finally, while the FY 2024/25 budget includes $18.0 million for the replacement of apparatus and other vehicles, anticipated station growth and anticipated replacement timelines, coupled with rising costs and multi-year procurement schedules, suggest vehicle replacement will be a growing financial concern.

**Uncertainty in the Federal Emergency Medical Transport Revenue Programs**  
Through the two IGT programs, PPGEMT and VRRP, the District will receive additional federal funding netting approximately $22.8 million for transporting Medi-Cal managed care beneficiaries and the uninsured. Revenues from the PPGEMT program appear to be reaching a consistent monthly pace, but the timing to recover approximately $3 million in overdue payments remains uncertain.

The VRRP program is dependent on health provider participation who may opt out at any time (one of the five providers opted out of the program for FY 2024/25). Additionally, the VRRP continues to operate without statutory direction and the State of California may also opt to end.

participation, eliminating a critical $9 million net annual revenue source. The District will identify ways to allocate VRRP revenues to one-time costs rather than ongoing expenses.

# RECOMMENDATION

Staff’s recommendation to the Board of Directors is to approve the FY 2024/25 Preliminary Budget and the resolutions directing its implementation.

**BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK**

<!-- Page 53 -->
# BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK

## BUDGETARY FUND STRUCTURE

The FY 2024/25 Preliminary Budget includes appropriations for the following District budgetary funds:
- General Fund
- Capital Facilities Fund
- Leased Properties Fund
- Grants Fund
- Development Impact Fees Fund
- Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) Fund
- Special Projects Fund

For purposes of the District’s financial statements, activities of the IGT Fund and Leased Properties Fund are combined with those of the General Fund.

## FUND DESCRIPTIONS

The **General Fund** is the general operating fund of the District. It is used to account for all financial resources except those required or designated by the Board of Directors to be accounted for in another fund.

The **Capital Facilities Fund** is a capital projects fund used to account for the acquisition and construction of the District’s capital assets. It is primarily funded by capital lease financing and general fund operating transfers.

The District leases property not required for current operations and accounts for the revenues and expenditures associated with leased property in the **Leased Properties Fund**.

The **Grants Fund** is a special revenue fund used to account for the proceeds of federal and state grants that are legally restricted to expenditures for specific purposes.

The **Development Impact Fees Fund** is a capital projects fund used to account for all resources received from development impact fees. It is used for the construction or acquisition of future fire stations and acquisition of apparatus to serve new developments.

The **Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) Fund** is used to account for the revenues and expenses associated with the District’s participation in Medi-Cal IGTs.

The **Special Projects Fund** was established to sequester funds allocated by the State of California in 2022 for the construction of the Zinfandel Training Facility.

## FUND AND DIVISION RELATIONSHIPS AND INTERFUND TRANSFERS

The district’s operating budget covers several governmental funds, including the General Fund which is the district’s main operating fund. The General Fund's relationship with other funds is summarized below:
- **Capital Facilities Fund** - this fund's main funding source comes from financing revenues and any deficiency is covered by operating transfers from the General Fund.
- **Grants Fund** - main funding source are federal grants with General Fund providing matching operating transfers as required.

- 51 -
<!-- Page 54 -->
![BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK](https://example.com/image.png)

- The IGT Fund - captures all revenues and expenditures from the IGT and PP-GEMT Programs and any excess of revenues over expenditures are transferred to the General Fund to offset the General Fund cost of providing health care services.
- The Leased Properties Fund, Development Impact Funds, and Special Projects Funds were designed to operate independently, with little or no funding from the General Fund.

The District's Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) budget derives its funding from the General Fund, the Capital Facilities Fund and the Development Impact Fee Fund.

The table below is provided in order to graphically depict the department and fund relationships within the organization. The General Fund is monitored by all staff and provides the main funding source for each Division's operating costs. All other funds are monitored by one or more divisions, as shown below.

| FUND                           | DIVISIONS RESPONSIBLE                       |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| General fund                   | All divisions                              |
| Capital Facilities Fund        | Finance, Economic Development, Facilities, Fleet |
| Leased Properties Fund         | Economic Development, Facilities           |
| Grants Fund                    | Finance, Economic Development              |
| Development impact Fees Fund   | Finance, Economic Development              |
| Intergovernmental Transfers Fund| Finance, Emergency Medical Services        |
| Special Projects Fund          | Economic Development, Training             |
| Pension Obligation Bond Fund    | Finance                                   |

**BASIS OF BUDGETING**

The modified accrual basis of budgeting is used for all funds. This basis is the same as the modified accrual basis of accounting used in the District’s audited governmental fund financial statements. Under this basis, revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the District considers all revenues, except property taxes, to be available if they are collected within 90 days of the end of the current fiscal period.

Property taxes are recognized if received within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Property taxes, charges for services, intergovernmental revenues, rental income, and investment earnings associated with the current fiscal period are all considered to be susceptible to accrual.

Expenditure-driven grants are recognized as revenue when the qualifying expenditures have been incurred and all other eligibility requirements have been met, and the amount is received during the period or within the availability period for this revenue source. All other revenue items are considered to be measurable and available only when cash is received by the District.

Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and workers’ compensation claims, are recorded only when payment is due. General capital asset acquisitions are reported as expenditures in governmental funds. Issuance of long-term debt and acquisitions under capital leases are reported as other financing sources.

# BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK

## BALANCED BUDGET
The District defines a balanced budget in accordance with its Financial Planning and Budget policy: **An annual budget in which operating revenues and any one-time revenues are greater than or equal to ongoing operating expenditures.** With operating and one-time revenues of approximately $303.7 million and operating expenditures of $304.5 million the FY 2024/25 Preliminary Budget does not meet that criteria without a transfer from the General Fund reserve.

## BASIS FOR KEY REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS

### Property Taxes
In general, property tax revenues are estimated based on assessed values of properties within the District’s jurisdiction. For FY2024/25, the estimate starts with a base of FY2023/24 actual assessed values of real property. Adjustments are then made for the following items:

- A CPI up to a maximum of two percent is applied to this base amount,
- Proposition 8 parcel values are first either increased, decreased, or projected flat depending on median sale price changes and then added,
- Transfer of ownership assessed value change based on known 2023 transfers are also added.

This will result in an estimated real property value to which we make minor additions (e.g., personal property values) to come up with the estimated net taxable value. The net taxable value is then multiplied by the one percent tax rate and adjusted for estimated delinquencies based on historical averages to come up with the final budgeted property tax revenue.

### EMS Revenues
EMS “medic” revenues are estimated starting with last year’s budgeted EMS revenues, or actual revenues if already available, and increased by CPI and the estimated increase in the number of medical transports using actual trends identified during the prior fiscal year.

## LEVEL OF BUDGET CONTROL
The District’s appropriated budget is prepared by fund, division, and object level. The legal level of budgetary control is at the fund level and then the object level. Each fund has its own budget for the following items: 1) salaries and benefits, 2) services and supplies, 3) capital outlay, and 4) debt service and other expenditures. The Board must approve amendments or transfers of appropriations between funds or objects.

Appropriations in all budgeted funds will lapse at the end of the fiscal year even if they have related encumbrances. Encumbrances are commitments related to unperformed (executory) contracts for goods or services (i.e., purchase orders, contracts, and commitments). Encumbrance accounting is utilized to the extent necessary to assure effective budgetary control and accountability and to facilitate effective cash planning and control. While all appropriations and encumbrances lapse at year-end, valid outstanding encumbrances (those for which performance under the executory contract is expected in the next year) are re-appropriated and become part of the subsequent year’s budget.

Actual costs are reported in bimonthly fiscal reports to the Board of Directors so that the public may see how costs compare to projections and assess the fiscal health of the District.

![BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK](https://metrofire.ca.gov/transparency)

The District uses an allocated cost methodology for budgeting and financial reporting. The preliminary, final, and midyear budgets identify estimated division costs and allocate central service costs (e.g., subscriptions, conferences, recognition events, insurance, memberships, utilities, lease-revenue bond payments, and assessments) to a central “Non-Divisional” division where such costs can be centrally tracked separate from divisional expenses. NDI costs are examined during the budget process to ensure only District-wide costs are included and Divisions retain responsibility for costs they incur.

**KEY FINANCIAL POLICIES**

Financial policies adopted by the Board of Directors are summarized below and can be found on this web page: [https://metrofire.ca.gov/transparency](https://metrofire.ca.gov/transparency).

**Financial Planning and Budget Policy**  
The District’s Financial Planning and Budget Policy memorializes the District’s major budget-related processes, including the District’s definition of a balanced budget, the process for developing the Preliminary, Final, and Midyear Budgets, use of one-time revenues, timing to recognize prior year expenditures and revenues after fiscal year end, direction for spending excess revenues after the 15 percent reserve threshold has been met, and the calculation for the General Fund reserve.

**Capital Asset Policy**  
The District’s Capital Asset Policy defines capital assets as land, buildings, equipment, and other related improvements with an individual cost of $5,000 or more and a useful life of at least one year. The policy establishes a capital asset accounting system that provides guidelines for the accountability and financial and physical control of capital assets, consistent and uniform procedures and transactions for accounting of capital assets, and compliance with funding entity requirements for grant-funded assets. Board approval is required for budgeted capital asset acquisitions and for disposal of capital assets. This policy also requires a biennial inventory of all capital assets.

**Capital Improvement Program Policy**  
The District’s Capital Improvement Program Policy organizes, facilitates, and memorializes capital needs and goals in order to efficiently and transparently develop and support the physical infrastructure of the District. Rigorous and methodical evaluation of facility, apparatus, and equipment needs and financing options ensures that existing and future capital needs are met, in compliance with the District’s strategic plan and financial resources. The development of the CIP is a coordinated effort across the District, with the capital planning process overseen by the Planning and Development Division and the finance and budget process elements overseen by the Finance Division.

**Debt Management Policy**  
The District’s Debt Management Policy sets forth written guidelines for the issuance, structuring, and administration of debt issued to finance District expenditures. This policy prohibits the issuance of long-term debt to fund District operating costs, as well as the use of any derivative products. Debt structuring provisions include a requirement that the maturity of a debt issue be consistent with the economic or useful life of the asset being financed, generally level annual debt services payments, and preferences for fixed interest rates and optional redemption at a reasonable call date.

**Pension Funding Bonds Early Payoff Policy**  
The Pension Funding Bonds Early Payoff Policy establishes the framework for ensuring that the District’s Pension Obligation Bonds are paid off in a manner designed to minimize interest costs and provides a mechanism for paying off the bonds at the earliest possible dates. This policy requires annual deposits with the Pension Bond.

**Trustee such that these amounts, together with investment earnings, will be sufficient to retire the Series 2004B Bonds on their call date of November 19, 2025.**

### Reserve Funding Policy
The Reserve Funding Policy establishes minimum and maximum target reserve levels as follows:

| DESCRIPTION                                   | MINIMUM                          | MAXIMUM                          |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **UNASSIGNED FUND BALANCE**                   |                                  |                                  |
| 1) Operating Reserves¹                        | 1.8 months (15 percent)         | 6 months (50 percent)           |
| **COMMITTED FUND BALANCE**                    |                                  |                                  |
| 2) Self-Insurance Reserves¹                   | Short-term liability             | Total liability                  |
| 3) Compensated Absence Reserves¹              | Amount expected to be paid in next 12 months | Total obligation owed to all employees |
| 4) Capital Replacement Reserves²               | Annual depreciation              | Accumulated depreciation         |

### LEGAL DEBT LIMIT
California Health and Safety Code Section 13937 establishes the District’s legal debt limit at 10 percent of the assessed value of all taxable property within the District. However, this code section was enacted when assessed valuations were based on 25 percent of full market value. To account for an adjustment of valuations based on full market value, the District’s debt limit is calculated at 2.50 percent of total assessed value within the District. As of June 30, 2022, the District’s bonded debt limit was $2,093,955,159. Outstanding applicable debt as of the same date was $21,518,673, for a legal debt margin of $2,072,436,486.

![BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=BUDGETARY+AND+FINANCIAL+FRAMEWORK)

**Current Debt Obligations**  
The District has three outstanding General Fund debt obligations: two General Fund bonds and debt for apparatus and equipment leases. The District issued pension obligation bonds in 2004 to fund the unfunded portion of the District’s pension liability and thereby smooth out and prevent spikes in annual pension costs. Lease revenue bonds were first issued in 2011 to facilitate the purchase of a headquarters office building and new apparatus. The amount of principal and interest payments remaining for all outstanding debt are shown below.

| Debt Obligation                  | Maturity Date | Principal & Interest Total (Through Maturity) |
|----------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Pension Obligation Bonds          | 5/15/2030     | $31,355,668                                    |
| Lease Revenue Bonds              | 5/15/2042     | $10,008,758                                    |
| Apparatus and Equipment Leases    | 6/28/2028     | $16,251,165                                    |

The District’s most recent bond rating was AA- (Standard and Poor), for a lease revenue bond issuance in 2011.

**BUDGET PROCESS**  
The District’s budget cycle follows Chapter 7 of the California Health and Safety Code, which describes the timing for the preliminary and final District budgets, and stipulates public notice and other transparency measures to provide ample opportunity to comment on the budget. The District’s fiscal year starts on July 1 and ends on June 30. Altogether the District notices, holds public hearings, and solicits comment on three budgets each fiscal year.
- On or before June 30th: Adoption of the Preliminary Budget for the following fiscal year
- On or before October 1st: Adoption of the Final Budget for the current fiscal year
- After December 31st: Adoption of the Midyear Budget for the current fiscal year

Amendments to a Board-approved budget involving either funds or objects (salaries and benefits, services and supplies, capital outlay, and debt service or other expenditures) must be approved by the Board of Directors.

**Preliminary Budget**  
Preliminary Budget development begins in March for the following fiscal year’s budget. District budget officers attend a budget kick-off meeting, at which time information regarding the long-term financial outlook and expected funding levels is shared. Divisional budget requests are then submitted for changes in position count or classification, overtime, services and supplies, and capital outlay. The Finance Division is responsible for preparing revenue estimates, and compiling and preparing the expenditure budgets based on submitted requests.

Budget requests are reviewed by budget officers and the compiled budget requests are then reviewed by executive staff. Executive staff consider organizational priorities and funding constraints in order to determine the budget that will ultimately be recommended to the Board. The Preliminary Budget is first presented to the Finance and Audit Committee for informational purposes and then to the Board of Directors for approval. The public are invited to provide comment beforehand and participate in the hearings.

# BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK

## Final Budget
The Final Budget process begins in July, after the close of the previous fiscal year. Any requests for expenditure changes are submitted by budget officers and revenue estimates are updated based on newly-available information. Typical final budget changes include re-budgeting of items not actually expended in the previous fiscal year and adjustment of property tax estimates based on assessed values released by the County Assessor. The Final Budget is typically presented to the Finance and Audit Committee in August and recommended to the Board for adoption in September. The public are invited to provide comment beforehand and participate in the hearings.

## Midyear Budget
Throughout the year, budget officers monitor actual expenditures compared to budget on a monthly basis. The Finance and Audit Committee receives bimonthly reports of revenue and expenditure activity compared to budgeted amounts. Additionally, following the close of a fiscal quarter, a formal District-wide budget review is undertaken in which budget officers update estimates of annual spending for each budget account.

The 2nd quarter review serves as the basis for the District’s Midyear Budget changes, which are based on actual results through December 31. The Midyear Budget process typically begins in January, with a presentation to the Finance and Audit Committee in February and Board adoption in March. The public are invited to provide comment beforehand and participate in the hearings.

# DISTRICT STRATEGIC PLAN

The District’s strategic plan was established in February 2020 and to this day guides the organization at the strategic, budget, and tactical operations level. The strategic plan reflects the District’s mission, to provide professional and compassionate protection, education and service to our community, and core values of integrity, professionalism, teamwork, and dedication to duty.

The District’s strategic plan was created with direction from the Board and input from District employees and key external stakeholders. During the strategic plan development process the District identified five key strategy areas: members, capital assets, service delivery, financial management, and external engagement. Each strategy area was assigned initiatives, projects, and outcomes. The strategic plan is reviewed quarterly, which is intended to provide a focused, regular and transparent approach to monitoring progress.

## LONG-RANGE FINANCIAL PLANNING

As part of the District’s strategic planning efforts, long-range financial trends are analyzed to identify financial challenges and develop plans to address them. Identified challenges include the escalating costs of pension and other postemployment benefits, rising costs of equipment replacement and facility maintenance due to deferred investment, and potential reductions to IGT funding.

With regard to pension and other postemployment benefits, the District’s practice is to annually fund the actuarially determined contribution amounts for pension and the amount associated with the explicit subsidy liability for other post-employment benefits. Funding at these contribution levels is intended to ensure the long-term sustainability of these benefits.

To address equipment and facility needs, the District has developed a vehicle replacement plan, a District-wide facility condition assessment, and recently issued its first Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Plan. Each of these efforts will inform the level of capital outlay and facility maintenance spending required to support current and anticipated service level needs.

In order to mitigate any impact of reduced IGT funding levels in the future, the District is evaluating all opportunities to achieve full cost recovery for emergency medical services, including supporting efforts to maximize reimbursements for Medi-Cal services.

# ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

The District’s economic outlook is shaped mainly by property tax trends. Comprising approximately 75 percent of total revenues, real estate market trends have a direct impact on the District operations. The District has enjoyed twelve straight years of property tax growth since the Great Recession and, while continued growth is expected, the rate of that growth has begun to slow substantially.

The single biggest factor affecting property tax revenue are home sales. Portions of the District have seen rapid growth in new homes, however demand and resales have slowed with persistently elevated interest rates. While Proposition 13 limits growth in assessed value to 2 percent per year unless the property is reassessed, the most recent Sacramento County Assessor’s report (July 2023) documented assessed values that led to nearly 5.8 percent growth in property taxes across the County in 2023/24. The District contracts with HdL Coren and Cone for property tax analysis and projections, who estimate 3.7 percent growth in property tax revenues for the District in FY 2024/25.

According to HdL Coren and Cone, the median home price in Sacramento County in the first quarter of 2024 was $494,000—up slightly from $490,000 a year earlier. According to the California Association of Realtors, Sacramento region housing affordability has declined to where now 26 percent of households can afford the median price home. The primary driver for this affordability level is the interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, which are being held at an elevated level to cool inflation.

Revenue levels for funds other than the General Fund are forecast to remain stable. The Special Projects Fund-Zinfandel Training Site, with a balance of $13.8 million, is expected to be liquidated in FY 2024/25 with construction underway for that project.

The following table documents property tax growth in since FY 2015/16. The red column denotes property tax revenues and the black line represents the annual year-over-year growth rate.

| Annual Property Tax Revenues  |
|-------------------------------|
| 2015/16 | $125 million        |
| 2016/17 | $132 million        |
| 2017/18 | $141 million        |
| 2018/19 | $149 million        |
| 2019/20 | $159 million        |
| 2020/21 | $167 million        |
| 2021/22 | $175 million        |
| 2022/23 | $192 million        |
| 2023/24 | $203 million        |
| 2024/25 | $210 million        |

The second-most consequential revenue driver for the District is Emergency Medical Services fees. The District expects modest EMS revenue growth of approximately 5 percent, mainly attributable to staffing increases generating more medical transports, with $49.7 million anticipated.

# COMMUNITY RELATIONS DIVISION

## DIVISION BACKGROUND:
The Community Relations Division (COR) strives to build and maintain relationships and trust between the Department and the diverse communities in Metro Fire’s jurisdiction while leveraging best practices in community outreach, traditional and social media collaboration, and community engagement to gain long term benefits in terms of community support, loyalty and fostering goodwill. The division currently consists of the Public Information Officer (PIO) team, a Community Relations Coordinator (CRC), and two Community Relations Specialists (CRS).

The PIO team provides incident coverage and serves as the direct 24/7 point of contact for media and public inquiries. The team consists of an administrative PIO, and three shift PIOs that operate in a relief capacity. The Public Information Officer team utilizes their practical experience in fireground operations, emergency medicine, and district and community knowledge to effectively communicate with the appropriate audience.

The Community Relations Division (CRD) has three professional staff members who ensure consistency in the division's operations. The Community Relations Coordinator collaborates with the PIO to create and coordinate the district's communications, outreach and engagement strategy. The two Community Relations Specialists implement the communication and outreach plan through social media, newsletters, marketing materials, and community events.

## RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
The Community Relations Division coordinated almost 400 events and promotions in FY2023/24, reaching well over 100,000 community members. Examples include; Fire Camp, the Rancho Cordova STAR program, FFBI Fill the Boot and associated safety fair, Cancer Awareness Engine campaign events, three firehouse open houses, almost 70 school visits, and many more. (Strategic Goal External Engagement 1a, 2a, 3a)

Metro Fire was recently awarded a Fire Prevention and Life Safety grant, which supports fire and life safety home safety checks and education. During the event, Metro Fire offered free smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors, distributed nightlights, and provided fire extinguisher training to hundreds of residents. (Strategic Goal External Engagement 1a, 2a)

![HEALTH AND WELLNESS](https://example.com/image.png)

**DIVISION BACKGROUND:**
Metro Fire’s Health and Wellness Division is responsible for providing all members with the opportunity to maintain an appropriate level of wellness throughout their career. By addressing the physical, nutritional, and mental components of wellness our goal is to empower the membership with the tools to be pro-active in their own health decisions. In staying in line with Metro’s Wellness Strategic Plan, we have aggressively gone after providing more early detection and therapy options to our members as well as preventative education. The focus of the program is a continued drive towards offering more robust wellness physicals, specific screening events throughout the year, as well as partnering with our HR Division to help streamline the workers comp process and provide more support to our injured personnel.

**RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS:**
- Introduced VO2m Fitness assessments to our members to help evaluate cardiovascular health
- Completed daily morning PT for one Fire Suppression and two MMP academies
- Provided online as well as written fitness programs for both our Line and Day Staff members
- Added mobility training for professional staff as well as “Walks with Coach”
- Able to provide blood screening to another 100 of our members
- Provided Skin Cancer Screenings to over 150 of our members which resulted in 18 referrals for further testing and four diagnosed melanomas
- Helped facilitate cancer awareness education to the district through the Firefighter Cancer Support Network
- Provided Esophageal Cancer Screenings for our at-risk members

**BUDGET DISCUSSION:**
With more of an emphasis on early detection and to meet the concerns of our membership, this year’s budget includes a significant increase for the funding of a more robust wellness medicals program for our suppression personnel that will include more cancer detection ability as well as a more in-depth cardiovascular evaluation through advanced blood testing. This year’s fitness budget will address the unavoidable need to replace a number of treadmills that have timed out (no parts available due to age) and workout benches in need of replacement due to old age as well. Continued funding for the replacement line will not only help cover the need to replace aging equipment but will also cover the fact that there has been a continued increase in product cost and shipping of roughly 15 percent. Funding for the wellness portion of this budget will continue to open up opportunities to deliver more in the arena of rest and recovery in the form of wellness treatments through contracted work with vetted providers. The benefits of such programs are expected to impact our members health knowledge and overall well-being with the result being happy and healthy members on the job.

**GOALS FOR UPCOMING YEAR:**
The Health and Wellness Division’s goals for the upcoming year conform to the strategic plan goal to improve service delivery. (Strategic Plan: Service Delivery 1a). Specifically, the Division will by June 30, 2025:

| Labor Costs      | Services & Supplies | Taxes, Licenses, etc. | Capital Outlay | Division Total | % of Total Budget |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| $ 71,705,149     | $ 16,863,455        | $ 6,208,425           | $ -            | $ 94,777,029   | 25.4%             |

The Non-Divisional Item (NDI) budget represents costs that are incurred by the District as a whole and are not exclusively associated with a single division. These costs include training, insurance, pension bond debt service, other post-employment benefits (OPEB), supplemental reimbursements to retirees, and various other payments.

**BUDGET DISCUSSION:**
The Non-Divisional Items budget includes $3.6 million for insurance, representing auto liability premiums, property and liability insurance, cyber-liability insurance, and related expenses.

Additionally, pension bond debt service and sinking fund payments totaling $6.5 million are included in Non-Divisional expenditures. In accordance with the District’s plan to retire the pension bonds at the earliest date allowed, a $20.2 million final payment for the Series B is scheduled in FY 2025-26. The funding for these disbursements will come from committed fund balance accumulated since FY 2005/06.

NDI also budgets a $4.0 million payment to Sacramento County Employees’ Retirement System (SCERS). These payments reduce an unfunded liability for District retirees and employees formerly employed by predecessor agencies that participated in SCERS.

Also included in the budget are expenditures costs for the District’s headquarters expenditures such as utilities, janitorial services, and landscape maintenance.

Finally, Inter-Governmental Transfer (IGT) fees amounting to $12 million are reflected in NDI expenditures. These fees are paid to the State of California to secure federal matching funds to be used to offset the cost of providing emergency services to the uninsured and Medi-Cal managed care beneficiaries. These IGT funds will yield approximately $34.8 million in new funding, for a net income of $22.9 million.

The Non-Divisional Item budget is an unstaffed, allocated-cost budget so no goals and performance measures are established.

![COMMUNITY RISK REDUCTION DIVISION](https://example.com/image.png)

# COMMUNITY RISK REDUCTION DIVISION

## DIVISION BACKGROUND:
The Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD) provides new construction, code enforcement, public education, and fire investigation services to the unincorporated portions of Sacramento County, City of Citrus Heights, and City of Rancho Cordova communities. The CRRD New Construction and Code Enforcement team is responsible for inspecting existing buildings and properties for fire code violations, issuing permits, assisting fire suppression personnel, responding to code violation complaints, reviewing and approving licensed care facilities, reviewing plans for all construction projects and fire protection systems, as well as conducting the testing and inspections for those projects. In addition, Fire Inspectors are responsible for special event inspection requests (e.g., carnivals and fairs), fireworks booth inspections and public fireworks displays.

The CRRD Fire Investigation Unit (FIU) investigates unidentified fire causes, the causes of fires resulting in serious bodily injury or death, and suspected arson related incidents that occur within the District. Metro Fire is one of the five agencies in the region with a full-time FIU staffed by peace officers.

## RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
During the last fiscal year, the Community Risk Reduction Division accomplished the following:
- Assisted with the implementation of the revised fee schedule in Ordinance 2023-02
- Continued the performance period for the Fire Prevention and Safety Grant by completing three smoke alarm blitzes
- Completed a promotional exam for Supervising Fire Inspector
- Completed recruitment for the new Fire Inspector I position
- Assumed Chair responsibilities for the Sacramento Regional Fire Chiefs Association Community Risk Reduction Committee
- Led the Sacramento Regional Fireworks Taskforce
- Assisted Sacramento County with amending the fireworks ordinance
- Analyzed the false alarm mitigation program and revised internal processes to improve efficiencies
- Updated job descriptions for Plan Intake Specialist, Fire Inspector I, and Supervising Fire Investigator
- Continued comprehensive review of all policies and procedures for CRRD and the FIU

## BUDGET DISCUSSION:
In FY2023/24, the Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD) continued to fill authorized positions for Fire Inspector I, Office Technicians, and Administrative Specialist. The division provided a comprehensive training program for all new positions and has achieved the goal of completing all plan reviews in-house.

2023 was a challenging year for the FIU. While the overall caseload decreased to 354 cases, 82.5 percent of them were fire origin and cause investigations, consistent with prior years. Bolstering staffing in the FIU is an urgent public safety issue, as well as a health and wellness issue for investigators and suppression personnel alike.

An important, but frequently overlooked element of fire investigations is loss analysis. Determining why fires occur, what can be done to prevent them, how their impacts can be lessened, and predicting human behavior once fires occur are all key elements of CRRD’s ongoing community risk assessment process.

The mission of the Logistics Division is to support the district in all daily operations with excellent customer service and timely purchases for the priority of service delivery.

## RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
The Division completed a medic inventory standardization on each in-service medic, including the labeling and installing of removeable plastic bins for all supplies carried in each medic. This allows for easy access to supplies and, when transitioning into another medic, it reduces swap over time from over two hours to less than one hour. This allows the medics to get back in service.

## BUDGET DISCUSSION:
The Logistics’ budget reflects the all funding necessary to acquire services, supplies, and manage programs for all District divisions and fire stations. It also provides funding for training opportunities for staff.

## GOALS FOR UPCOMING YEAR:
The Logistics Division’s goals for the upcoming fiscal year conform to the strategic plan goal to improve service delivery. (Strategic Plan: Service Delivery 1a). Specifically, by June 30, 2025 the Division intends to:
- Achieve full staffing in the Logistics Division
- Continue to work on the CRRD plan scanning project
- Test and repair all ladder inventory in the logistics warehouse and on all district apparatus
- Test all hose inventory in the logistics warehouse
- Continue to find efficiencies in all Logistics processes

## PERFORMANCE MEASURES:
- Consistent maximization of inventory storage inside the logistics warehouse.
- Retrieval and delivery of critical stored items. For example, during a 12-month period between FY 2022/23 and FY 2023/24, Logistics staff pulled and delivered over 250,000 individual items from the warehouse and delivered to the fire stations and administration buildings.
