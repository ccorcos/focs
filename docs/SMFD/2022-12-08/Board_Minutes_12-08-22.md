# REPORTS

## 1. PRESIDENT'S REPORT—(President Saylors)
The 2023 Cap-to-Cap program is taking place April 21st through April 26th. Please review your calendars and let Board Clerk Penilla know if you are interested in attending. This event fills up quickly, so we will reserve spots early in 2023.

## 2. FIRE CHIEF'S REPORT—(Chief Harms)
Director Rice joined at 6:31pm during the Chief's Report.

Chief Harms shares his experience as Fire Chief from the past six years. He and his wife Katie took the risky path to come to Metro Fire and they are very happy they did. He also thanked his long-time friends who were in the audience. Chief Harms is looking forward to returning to Arizona and spending time with his grandkids. This has been a highlight in his career, and he thanked the membership for their service and commitment to Metro Fire, and the support staff who keep this organization moving forward.

### OPERATIONS' REPORT
Deputy Chief Mitchell congratulated the newest Board Members, Director White, and Chief Harms for his leadership over the last six years. He shared that we responded to 8,949 total incidents since our last report on November 10, 2022; an average of 319 calls per day. Of those, 275 were fire incidents, an average of just under 10 calls per day.

As for medic draw down and surge contract he reported we have seen a steep rise in call volume and transports in the last two weeks related to flu, colds, RSV, COVID. We were at draw down 74 times which is measured by how many times EMS24 was notified by dispatch. For example, on last week we were notified 17 times, and one time we were at 100% draw down with 0 medics in the system for a few minutes. We have requested surge coverage eight times in the last two weeks. Fills were two (2) once, one (1) five times, and zero (0) once. We have found so far that in times of drawdown, the surge companies are in the same situation with call volume and wall times, which diminishes the availability of their units. We have been, and continue to be committed to supporting our members while collaborating with our regional partners to address these issues in the short term.

As for recent training, all 3 shifts were involved in the regional rescue drill this week involving the heavy rescue companies from Metro, Sac City, Cosumnes, Folsom, West Sac and Roseville. The scenario was a level 3 RIC deployment at a commercial fire with a structural collapse and 2 Firefighters trapped. Crews had to breach a concrete wall and navigate a debris’ field to reach the victims then extricate. The scenario took approximately three hours to complete. The drill was hosted by Sac City, and our members performed extremely well while demonstrating high levels of proficiency. Great job!

Lastly, Chief Mitchell shared about a recent EMS incident where outcome was very favorable thanks to the responding crew.
