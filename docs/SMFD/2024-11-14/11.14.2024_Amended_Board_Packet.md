   - With member health and wellness as a top priority, Peer Support Program Manager Captain Manfredi, Coach Gallagher, and I attended last week's annual Fire Service Psychology Association conference in Washington, D.C. This was the first time that Metro Fire had attended this conference, and that was primarily attributed to the personal invite I received from DCs Fire and EMS Chief, John Donnelly. *Metro Fire was the only fire department from the West Coast in attendance at the conference.*

   The conference served as a networking opportunity to join fire service leaders, psychologists, clinicians, and other peer support team members in sharing information that is assisting in developing fire service psychology, education on current liability, safety trends, latest research, and best practices as it relates to bridging the gap between professional psychology and the fire service.

   - On Monday, October 7, several members attended and participated in the Fallen Brother statue replacement event at the new memorial site at Capitol Park. Thank you to the Ca Fire Foundation for coordinating and including us in this event.

# CRRD:
- Deputy Fire Marshall Amy Nygren spoke on Fire Prevention week observed each year during the week of Oct. 9th. This year, Oct. 6 – 12. It was established to commemorate the tragic 1871 Great Chicago Fire. The fire burned for three days and killed more than 250 people, left 100,000 homeless, destroyed more than 17,400 structures and burned more than 2,000 acres.

In a fire, mere seconds can mean the difference between a safe escape and a tragedy. This year’s Fire Prevention Week campaign is “Smoke alarms: Make them work for you!”. This campaign strives to educate everyone about the importance of having working smoke alarms in the home. It is important that smoke alarms are installed in every bedroom, outside each sleeping area, and on every level of the home. Test your smoke alarms at least once a month and make sure everyone knows the sound of the alarm and how to respond. Replace all smoke alarms when they are 10 years old from the date of manufacture or when they stop responding when testing.

- At last night’s City of Citrus Heights Council Meeting, Deputy Fire Marshall Nygren, on behalf of Metro Fire, received a proclamation proclaiming Oct. 6-10th as “Fire Prevention Week”.

## BOARD POLICY

**OVERSIGHT:** Administration  
**POLICY NUMBER:** 01.001.03  
**EFFECTIVE DATE:** 03/02/2009  
**REVIEW DATE:** 10/10/2024  

### Background
The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) prohibits discrimination and harassment based on the following characteristics: race, color, religion, religious creed (including religious dress and grooming practices), national origin, ancestry, citizenship, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions), gender, gender identity, gender expression, age (40 years and over), sexual orientation, veteran or military status, domestic violence victim status, political affiliation, or any other classification prohibited by California state or federal law.

It is the policy of the District that all facilities, programs and services be accessible to and usable by disabled individuals, unless providing access results in an undue hardship to the District or causes a fundamental alteration of the programs or services.

The District complies with Federal civil rights laws and is committed to providing its programs and services without discrimination in accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin (including language), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination based on disability, Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, which prohibits discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities, Age Discrimination Act of 1975, which prohibits discrimination based on age, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security regulations 6 C.F.R Part 19, which prohibits discrimination based on religion in social service programs, The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), which requires covered employers to provide “reasonable accommodation” to a qualified employee’s or applicant’s known limitations related to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. The District is committed to nondiscrimination in the provision of its programs and activities to program beneficiaries.

### Purpose
To ensure that all employees and the public are treated in accordance with the District’s mission and values of non-discrimination, and to ensure compliance with all applicable Federal and California statutes and local regulations.

### Scope
This policy applies to all District employees and/or individuals in any District workplace or worksite location, and all employment related decisions. This policy also applies to program participants, customers, clients, consumers, and members of the public. The Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that no business (public or private) serving the public can discriminate based on a customer's national origin, sex, religion, color or race.

2. **Confidentiality:** This policy applies to the identity of the applicant in all oral or written communications, including all files and documents submitted by an applicant as part of the application process.

3. **Discrimination:** The unequal treatment of an employee or applicant in any aspect of employment, based solely or in part on the employee’s or applicant’s protected characteristic, including their perceived protected characteristic. Discrimination includes unequal treatment based upon the employee’s or applicant’s association with a member of a protected class. Discrimination may include but is not necessarily limited to: hostile or demeaning behavior towards applicants or employees because of their protected characteristic; allowing the applicant’s or employee’s protected characteristic to be a factor in hiring, promotion, compensation or other employment related decisions unless otherwise permitted by applicable law, and providing unwarranted assistance or withholding work-related assistance, cooperation, and/or information to applicants or employees because of their characteristic.

4. **Essential Job Functions:** Those job tasks that are fundamental and primary to the position, such as the reason the position exists is to perform that function.

5. **Harassment:** Unwelcome disrespectful or unprofessional conduct, including disrespectful or unprofessional conduct based on any of the protected characteristics. Harassment can be verbal (such as slurs, jokes, insults, epithets, gestures, or teasing) visual (such as the posting or distribution of offensive posters, symbols, cartoons, drawings, computer displays, or emails), or physical conduct (such as physically threatening another person, blocking someone’s way, or making physical contact in an unwelcome manner).

6. **Impairment:** Any physiological, mental, or psychological disorder or condition which substantially limits "major life activities," such as walking, seeing, speaking, hearing, breathing, learning, or working. Examples range from obvious impairments such as orthopedic and muscular disorders requiring wheelchairs or other equipment to perhaps less obvious impairments such as cancer, heart disease, epilepsy, diabetes, alcoholism, learning disorders, communicable diseases, and psychoses.

7. **Limited English Proficiency (LEP):** Persons who do not speak English as their primary language and who have limited ability to read, speak, write, or understand English.

8. **Meaningful Access:** Meaningful access is the provision of language assistance services that results in accurate, timely, and effective communication at no cost to the person who is LEP. For individuals who are LEP, meaningful access.

While not requiring that each existing facility be accessible, the standard, known as "program accessibility," must be provided by methods including alteration of existing facilities, acquisition or construction of additional facilities, relocation of a service or program to an accessible facility, or provision of services at alternate sites.

12. **Retaliation:** Any adverse employment action taken against an applicant or employee because that person engaged in activity protected under this policy or reasonably thought to be protected under this policy.

![Non-Discrimination Policy](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Non-Discrimination+Policy)

Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that no business (public or private) serving the public can discriminate based on a customer's national origin, sex, religion, color or race.

**Definitions**

1. **Age Discrimination:** Taking adverse action, whether employment or otherwise, toward any individual age forty (40) and over, when that action is based solely on age.

2. **Confidentiality:** This policy applies to the identity of the applicant in all oral or written communications, including all files and documents submitted by an applicant as part of the application process.

3. **Discrimination:** The unequal treatment of an employee or applicant in any aspect of employment based solely or in part on the employee's or applicant's protected characteristic, including their perceived protected characteristic. Discrimination may include, but is not necessarily limited to: hostile or demeaning behavior towards applicants or employees because of their protected characteristic; allowing the applicant's or employee's protected characteristic to be a factor in hiring, promotion, compensation or other employment related decisions unless otherwise permitted by applicable law, and providing unwanted assistance or withholding work-related assistance, cooperation and/or information to applicants or employees because of their characteristic.

4. **Essential Job Functions:** Those job tasks that are fundamental and primary to the position, such as the reason the position exists is to perform that function.

5. **Harassment:** Unwelcome disrespectful or unprofessional conduct based on any of the protected characteristics. Harassment can be verbal (such as slurs, jokes, insults, epithets, gestures, or teasing) visual (such as the posting or distribution of offensive posters, symbols, cartoons, drawings, computer displays, or emails), or physical conduct (such as physically threatening another person, blocking someone's way, or making physical contact in an unwelcome manner).

6. **Impairment:** Any physiological, mental, or psychological disorder or condition which substantially limits "major life activities," such as walking, seeing, speaking, hearing, breathing, learning, or working. Examples range from obvious impairments such as orthopedic and muscular disorders requiring wheelchairs or other equipment to perhaps less obvious impairments such as cancer, heart disease, epilepsy, diabetes, alcoholism, learning disorders, communicable diseases, and psychoses.

7. **Limited English Proficiency (LEP):** Persons who do not speak English as their primary language and who have limited ability to read, speak, write, or understand English.

10/10/2024  

8. **Meaningful Access:** Meaningful access is the provision of language assistance services that results in accurate, timely, and effective communication at no cost to the person who is LEP. For individuals who are LEP, meaningful access denotes access that is not significantly restricted, delayed, or inferior as compared to programs or activities provided to English proficient individuals.

9. **Qualified Individuals with Disabilities:** An individual is considered a person with a disability if they have: 1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; or 2) having a record of such impairment; or 3) being regarded as having such impairment. Major life activities include, but are not limited to, functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.

10. **Protected Class Characteristics:** In California, discrimination based on the following protected classes is prohibited: race, religion, color, citizenship, national or ethnic origin, ancestry, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, lactation or related medical conditions), gender, gender identity, gender expression, gender transition, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability (including having a history of a disability or being regarded as being disabled), medical condition (cancer-related or genetic characteristics), predisposing genetic information (including family medical history), marital status, age (at least 40 years of age), veteran or military status.

11. **Reasonable Accommodation(s):** The act of providing rational means to enable individuals with disabilities to meet the needs of the workplace. This may include, but is not limited to, making reasonable modifications in policies, practices, and procedures; furnishing, at no charge, to the qualified individuals with disabilities, auxiliary aids and services, which are not limited to equipment, devices, materials in alternative formats, and qualified interpreters or readers; and making each service, program, or activity, when viewed in its entirety, readily accessible to and usable by qualified individuals with disabilities requesting accommodations. While not requiring that each existing facility be accessible, the standard, known as "program accessibility," must be provided by methods including alteration of existing facilities, acquisition or construction of additional facilities, relocation of a service or program to an accessible facility, or provision of services at alternate sites.

12. **Retaliation:** Any adverse employment action taken against an applicant or employee because that person engaged in activity protected under this policy or reasonably thought to be protected under this policy. Protected activities may include, but are not limited to, reporting or assisting in reporting suspected violations of this policy and/or cooperating in investigation or proceedings arising out of a violation of this policy.

**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** November 14, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Contract Award – Construction Management Services  

**TOPIC**  
Request to approve a contract award to Kitchell/CEM, Inc. to provide construction management services for the Vineyard Springs Fire Station project.  

**BACKGROUND**  
In 2022, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) initiated the Vineyard Springs Fire Station project (Project) for the design and construction of a new fire station located at 8101 Bradshaw Road in Sacramento. The Project is currently moving through the County of Sacramento's planning application process and the design phase is nearly complete.  

**DISCUSSION**  
On October 4, 2024, the District issued Request for Proposals (RFP) 24-06 to solicit proposals from qualified firms to provide construction management services in support of the Project, which is being delivered through a design-bid-build process. The scope of services generally includes both pre-construction phase and construction phase activities including constructability review, cost estimating, bidding process support, construction administration, labor compliance monitoring, and project closeout and warranty support.  

The District received seven (7) responsive proposals, which were reviewed and scored by an evaluation panel. Kitchell/CEM, Inc. was the highest scoring proposer.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The cost of the proposed services is $705,560 and is included in the total Project budget approved in the FY 2024/25 Final Budget.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board adopt a resolution to approve a contract award to Kitchell/CEM, Inc. and authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to negotiate, execute and administer an agreement materially similar to the attached agreement. Staff further recommends that the Board authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to negotiate, execute and administer an agreement with the next highest ranked proposer if, after having bargained in good faith, the District is unable to conclude a final agreement with the highest ranked proposer within 10 calendar days.

**DATE:** November 14, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** A resolution adjusting the employer's contribution under the Public Employees' Medical and Hospital Care Act  

**TOPIC**  
Board authorization to adopt resolutions for the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) to establish employer's contribution of 92% of the employee's and retiree's health premium at the third highest plan in CalPERS Region 1.  

**DISCUSSION**  
At the regular board meeting on April 25, 2013 the Board of Directors adopted the resolution establishing the employer's contribution of 92% of the employee's and retiree's health plan at the District cap.

**DATE:** November 14, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** 2024 Response Standards and Service Level Objectives  

**TOPIC**  
Staff recommendation for Board of Directors (Board) to adopt the 2024 Response Standards and Service Level Objectives.  

**BACKGROUND**  
Following the completion of the Standards of Cover (SOC) study in 2023, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District’s (District) Board of Directors (Board) adopted the Standards of Cover Policy (Board Policy 01.021.01) and the Response Standards and Service Level Objectives (Board Resolution 23-079). Board Policy 01.021.01 outlines the development and outcomes of the SOC, while Board Resolution 23-079 sets response standards and service level objectives to guide and evaluate District service delivery based on SOC findings.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Board Policy 01.021.01 outlines in Section 2a that updated response standards, service level objectives, and key performance metrics should be adopted in order to measure performance and desired outcomes, in accordance with the findings and recommendations of the annual SOC update. The annual SOC update monitors and reports on annual performance trends and provides a framework for operational improvements. As such, the annual SOC update may recommend changes to adopted response standards and service level objectives in order to ensure the continuous improvement of performance and service delivery year over year.  

The 2024 SOC study recommended the adoption of updated response standards and service level objectives to more adequately evaluate diverse, evolving risks to better serve the growing populations that are experiencing them. The proposed 2024 Response Standards and Service Level Objectives are attached in Attachment 1.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board approve the attached resolution to adopt the 2024 Response Standards and Service Level Objectives.

# 2024 Response Standards and Service Level Objectives

## Response Standard Considerations
Response standards determine the appropriate level of service to be provided to the community by the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District). Service level can be described as the expected response time and the resources required to perform the critical tasks necessary to effectively mitigate the incident. Service levels can vary based on population, density, land use, incident history, identified risks and special hazards.

## Proposed Response Standards
In addition to the four existing standards (Dense Urban, Urban, Suburban, and Rural), development trends identified in the 2022 Standards of Cover study have proven to be true, as there are now pockets in dense urban areas that exceed 10,000 people per square mile.

Recognizing that densities at that level pose additional risks and challenges to emergency response, consideration should be made to adopt an even higher response standard for these areas which would be considered "metropolitan" in nature. The District recommends the following response standards to guide service level, which continue to build upon best practices established by the Center for Public Safety Excellence and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA):

| Metropolitan | Dense Urban | Urban | Suburban | Rural |
|--------------|-------------|-------|----------|-------|
| Population density greater than 10,000 people per square mile | Population density between 3,000-10,000 people per square mile | Population density between 1,000-3,000 people per square mile | Population density between 500-1,000 people per square mile | Population density less than 500 people per square mile |

## Service Level Objective Considerations
As previously defined, service level is described as the expected response time and the resources required to perform the critical tasks necessary to effectively mitigate the incident. As such, considerations for setting service level objectives primarily revolve around response time considerations and risk considerations.

### Response Time
Response time is measured as the length of time from when a call is dispatched to when personnel arrive on scene. Response time is measured to include both the first arriving unit as well as when effective response force (ERF) is achieved, and includes dispatch time (time from alarm to notification), turnout time (time from notification to enroute), and travel time (time from enroute to on scene).

### Risk
Different types of incidents pose varying levels of risk and ERF needs, which should be considered when setting service level objectives. NFPA 1710 recommends that service level objectives are set for each major service component (fire suppression, EMS, and special operations) with consideration given to level of risk. The District recognizes fire suppression and EMS, and further breaks special operations into Technical Rescue and Hazardous Materials (HazMat) risk categories.

## Proposed Service Level Objectives
As previously discussed, NFPA 1710 recommends that service level objectives be set for all incident types in accordance with risk categories.

**Response Standards and Service Level Objectives**

In 2023, changes made to ERF requirements for some incident types resulted in the elimination of the Rescue Moderate 3 risk category and the addition of the Rescue High 3 category. In addition, population increases in some dense urban areas have resulted in densities that now exceed 10,000 per square mile. Revised service level objectives are proposed below in consideration of these changes.

**Response Time**  
New proposed response time objectives are shown in the table below. First arrival travel time objectives have been added for all risk types. ERF travel times have been removed for risk types with no ERF requirements. The response time objective for Rescue Moderate 3 was removed and Rescue High 3 has been added. Response time objectives for a metropolitan response standard have been added for all risk categories and is consistent with response time objectives for urban/dense urban response.

| Risk Class/ Category | ERF Dispatch Time | Turnout | First Arrival Travel Time | ERF Travel Time | Total Response Time |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------|--------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
