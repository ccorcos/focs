2. FIRE CHIEF'S REPORT — (Chief House)

Good evening, President Goold, Directors, Colleagues, and Members of the Public.

At Metro Fire, we are deeply committed to prioritizing the health and wellness of our personnel, with cancer prevention emerging as a paramount focus area. In light of this commitment, I am eager to report to you this evening;

**Health & Wellness (Cancer)**  
Over the course of this week, Metro Fire hosted the Firefighters Cancer Support Network for several information-packed 2-hour sessions in which best practices to minimize the risk of cancer on the fireground, at the station, and at home were discussed. Emphasis was placed on the following areas:  
1. How to minimize off-duty exposure  
2. How to prevent/handle fireground exposures  
3. Station setup and cleaning practices  
4. Understanding the role of wellness in cancer prevention  
5. How to receive support for those dealing with cancer  

As of this afternoon, 224 Metro Fire members have attended this opportunity, and four more sessions will be offered over the next two days.

**Establishment of Metro Fire Cancer Task Force**  
Additionally, Metro Fire is in the process of establishing the Metro Fire Cancer Task Force.

This initiative will bring together various disciplines involved in cancer prevention, including education, research, prevention, and detection, under the leadership of the Office of the Fire Chief, managed by BC Tony Peck. By uniting these efforts, we aim to enhance our current work while minimizing duplication of efforts.

The task force will comprise members from both suppression and non-suppression roles who possess the desire and passion to contribute to this critical endeavor. President Goold suggested putting a spouse of a cancer victim on the task force.

Members who attended the Firefighters Cancer Support Network Training this week received a brief introduction to the Task Force. An official inaugural meeting for all interested members will follow soon.

**New Hires**  
Please join us in welcoming:  
• Robyn Anderson, hired for the position of Grant Specialist in the Finance Division, effective May 15. Robyn came to the podium and provided a brief personal history to the Board.

**Other**  
In alignment with the District’s Members Initiative, on May 15-16, Battalion Chief Matt Cole, Captain Pete Votava, Captain Bret Randle and I toured the Wellness Centers at Denver Fire and South Metro Fire Rescue. This visit was similar to the one we made to the Phoenix Fire Department in February of this year. We will continue to tour health and wellness centers.

OPERATIONS REPORT – (Deputy Chief Mitchell)  
Shift Commander Kiley Keeley I spoke about the training that B13 did and how he coordinated with state parks, CERT, PIO, dispatch, copter 2, and others to get his whole battalion through in one day.

Thanked the Board as Squad 102 went into service and without your support, I don’t think that would have.

**BOARD MEMBER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS**  
Director Saylors – Big thanks to Engine 111, B Shift for getting Old Betsy to the Rio Linda Farm and Tractor Day. Director Saylors requested that the Executive Committee consider that her District borders Placer County and we often go into Placer County and put out fires, she would like to take the Committee with doing a unit history utilization of every fire and medical aid that we go in Placer County whether we are dispatched or our crews self-dispatch because we don’t have mutual aid or automatic aid agreements with any agencies in Placer County. Also, would like to take a look at getting the gate/fence removed on Locust Road so that we can get into our District. Since Wildland season has begun, I would like us to keep track of how much time we spend putting out fires in Placer County, not just in our section of Placer County.

Director Jones gave a shout out to the Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD) and the EMS Division for responding to questions from the community. Also, to the Finance Division for always being available to discuss any matters that come up.

Director Rice thanked Firefighter Derrick Sheetz for inviting me to be the master of ceremonies for the last two academies and congratulations to the latest graduating class.

Director Wood thank you to E61 for coming out to the preschool in Rancho Cordova, the kids were thrilled to have there. Reminder that The Firefighters Burn Institute Luau on the Links will take place on Saturday, June 29, 2024 at Haggin Oaks and tickets are on sale now, please go to [https://ffburn.org/](https://ffburn.org/).

President Goold welcomed the new staff member Robyn Anderson, hired for the position of Grant Specialist, with your years of experience it sounds like you are the ideal candidate to be in that position. During Capital-to-Capital in April, Chief Mitchell gave a Wildland Fire presentation which scared me, please be careful out there when you work in those horrible environments.

**DATE:** June 27, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Disclosure of material expenditure – Aviation Liability Insurance – Chubb Insurance Group – $185,187.00.  

**TOPIC**  
Disclosure of material expenditure to purchase aviation liability insurance for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025.  

**SUMMARY**  
Staff will be expending funds to purchase aviation liability insurance. The expenditure will be payable to Chubb Insurance Group in the amount of $185,187.00 for the aviation policy.  

**DISCUSSION**  
USI Insurance Services provided the District's insurance brokerage services this year and managed the marketing of the District's aviation liability insurance. The aviation liability insurance package for the upcoming fiscal year includes coverage for three flying helicopters and one grounded helicopter.  

The aviation policy premium has increased from FY 23/24, as the market conditions are dictating higher premiums for almost all insurance services and one of the District's previously grounded helicopters has been put into service as of June 2024. We will be insuring three flying helicopters each valued at $1,500,000, and one grounded helicopter valued at $350,000. The flying helicopters carry $10,000,000 of liability, and the grounded helicopter carries $1,000,000 of liability.  

The insurance requested includes any pilot approved by Metro Fire’s Chief Pilot or designee and covers all uses in connection with the operations of Metro Fire including mutual aid agreements. Many carriers were solicited to provide a quote for the District’s Aviation Insurance and all except Chubb Insurance Group declined. Chubb Insurance Group is the carrier recommended by USI to carry the District's aviation liability insurance needs.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The fiscal impact is $185,187.00. Funds sufficient to meet this obligation are budgeted in the Preliminary Budget for FY 2024/2025.

**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** June 27, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  

**SUBJECT:** Disclosure of material expenditure – General/Property/Liability Commercial Insurance – Fire Agencies Insurance Risk Authority (FAIRA) for the FY 24/25 in the amount of $2,831,190.00  

**TOPIC**  
Staff requests the Board of Director’s approval to purchase commercial insurance for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025.  

**SUMMARY**  
Staff will be expending funds to purchase General / Property and Liability commercial insurance. The expenditure will be payable to Fire Agencies Insurance Risk Authority (FAIRA), in the amount of $2,831,190.00.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The District’s commercial insurance incorporates the following areas of coverage: property, automobile, and general liability. This is an all-encompassing package and provides coverage of risk in several areas including employment practices, employment benefits, and management liability. The District entered into a 3-year contract with Fire Agencies Insurance Risk Authority (FAIRA) during FY 23/24 and they are the current carrier for the District’s insurance needs.  

The insurance renewal premium for FY 24/25 with FAIRA is $2,831,190.00. This is an increase of 25% from FY 23/24 due to the market conditions dictating higher premiums for insurance services, and due to a variety of other factors including; an increase of wildfires across California, as well as unstable political climate and increased litigation across the state. To put this 25% increase in perspective, in FY 22/23, the District paid SDRMA $3,673,681 for commercial insurance. For FY 23/24, the District’s renewal with FAIRA was $2,264,952, which was a significant saving compared to SDRMA’s projected premium of $4,592,101.  

USI Insurance Services (District’s brokerage) is recommending that the District continues to use FAIRA as the commercial insurance provider for FY 24/25.

**DATE:** June 27, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Special Fire Tax – Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta Area  

**TOPIC**  
Board action is required in order to authorize Sacramento County to collect the District's Special Fire Tax in the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta area for fiscal year 2024/25.

**BACKGROUND**  
Under provisions of the California Constitution, the residents of the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta area approved in November 2000, by more than a two-to-one margin, a special tax to help pay for the fire protection, prevention and training services in their community. The Special Fire Tax, initiated to replace the Fire Suppression Assessment Fee in place in the area since 1986, was capped at a maximum of $100 per parcel.

**DISCUSSION**  
The County Assessor cannot levy nor collect the District's Special Fire Tax in the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta area without formal annual authorization from the District. To have the Special Fire Tax placed on the tax rolls, the Board must adopt a resolution authorizing the County Assessor to make the levy.

The District has contracted with local agency financial consulting company NBS to assist with the administration of the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta Special Fire Tax, and they have estimated that the tax will generate $347,700 in revenues for fiscal year 2024/25.

![Board of Directors](https://via.placeholder.com/768x987.png?text=Board+of+Directors+June+27%2C+2024+Page+2)

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Absent formal authorization from the District's Board, the County Assessor cannot levy the Special Fire Tax in the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta area. Failure to assess the fee will result to a loss of revenues of approximately $347,700 to fund fire protection services in that area.

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends adoption of the resolution authorizing the County Assessor to incorporate the $100 per parcel Special Fire Tax for the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta area with the 2024/25 Sacramento County property tax levy.

WHEREAS, the electorate of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District passed a Special Tax for fire operating expenses in the Sloughhouse/Rancho Murieta Area; and  

WHEREAS, the Special Tax authorization is adopted pursuant to Article XIII C, Section 2(d) of the California Constitution; and

Fire Chief  

**DATE:** June 27, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** California Fire Foundation Grant Opportunity  

**TOPIC**  
Request to authorize staff to apply for the California Fire Foundation Grant.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The California Fire Foundation (CFF) is a statewide nonprofit charitable organization formed in 1987. CFF has several mandates to advance stated objectives which include survivor assistance projects and community initiatives. To that end, CFF has a competitive grant program whereby it offers grant funding to fire departments, firefighter associations, nonprofit organizations and tribal entities which submit projects that meet the specified guidelines and align with CFF’s focus areas.  
This year the focus areas are:  
- Vegetation Mitigation & Fuels Reduction  
- Education, Planning and/or Community Outreach Campaigns  
- Personal Protective Equipment  
- Specialized Firefighting Equipment  

**DISCUSSION**  
The Community Relations Division (Community Relations) has initiated a project to produce video content as a part of its digital education series. By securing additional funding Community Relations could produce more video content specifically targeting under-resourced and historically marginalized communities (additional scope). The additional scope is consistent with CFF’s focus area Education, Planning and/or Community Outreach Campaigns.  

CFF’s process requires applicants to upload a letter from the governing body to authorize the receipt of these grant funds. Typically, staff would ask the Board of Directors to formally accept a grant funds after the notice of award was received. Therefore, due to this stipulation, staff is requesting a letter from the Board of Directors as required.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Community Relations intends to request $25,000 in grant funding from CFF. The requested funding would offset the cost of the additional scope.

![Affirmative Defenses](https://via.placeholder.com/768x988.png?text=Affirmative+Defenses)

# Affirmative Defenses

- Are there situations when a work injury is not covered under workers' compensation?
  - Yes. The California Labor Code includes a number of situations that are excluded from workers' compensation coverage. These "Affirmative Defenses" are as follows:
    - Independent Contractor
    - Intoxication
    - Self-Inflicted Injury
    - Initial Aggressor
    - Post-Termination
    - Going and Coming Rule
    - Horseplay
    - Recreational Activity from a Voluntary Act
    - In the commission of a felony or misdemeanor

<!-- Page 40 -->
![Presumptions](https://via.placeholder.com/768x987.png?text=Presumptions)

- **Burden of Proof**
  - In a normal case of industrial injury, the employee has the burden of proof to show that an injury/disability arose out of and in the course of employment (Labor Code §§3600, 3202.5): 
    a. The employee must meet his burden by a "preponderance of the evidence." 
    b. "Preponderance of the evidence" is defined as evidence which weighed with that opposed to it, has more convincing force and the greater probability of truth.

- **What is a Presumption?**
  - a. Simply put, a presumption is an assumption of fact that the law requires to be made from another fact or group of facts formed in the case (Evidence Code §600 (a)). These statutorily enacted facts can either be "conclusive", meaning that you cannot dispute them, or they are "rebuttable", which means that you can produce evidence to overcome what you are told you must assume to be true. 
  - b. The presumptions we are dealing with in these statutes are rebuttable.

- **Why do we have Presumptions?**
  - a. To provide additional compensation to certain public employees who provide vital and hazardous services by easing their burden of proof – it is a benefit to them, conferred by the legislature, to which other employees are not entitled. 
  - b. This additional compensation is delivered by easing the burden of proof that the employee has to show and, in fact, actually shifts this burden of proof to the employer to disprove the statutorily enacted fact.

# SB 1127
SB 1127 (Chapter 835, Statutes of 2022) was signed into law by Governor Newsom on September 29, 2022. The passage of SB 1127 reduces time periods a claim administrator/employer has to deny liability for workers' compensation claims for certain injuries, increases the time specified that employees can access temporary disability benefits for work-related cancer injuries, and most importantly imposes a penalty for alleged unreasonably rejected claims.

## Reduced Time Periods
- This bill requires that for presumptive injuries, covered under Labor Code Sections 3212 to 3212.85 and 3212.9 to 3213.2 be considered compensable if the claim is not denied within 75-days after the claim form is filed. This bill does not reduce the period to deny liability of claims for ALL injuries, rather only those covered in the listed sections. Those code sections govern the peace officer and firefighters' presumptions for specified injuries. The time period has been reduced from 90-days to 75-days. The presumptions continue to be rebuttable, whereas employers can still demonstrate the injury did not arise out of employment by other evidence or exposure is not reasonably linked to the disabling injury. Because this presumption is limited to certain injuries (Cancer, PTSD, heart trouble, pneumonia, etc.) it is important to know what injury is being claimed and whether the reduced time period will apply.

## Temporary Disability Benefits
- Newly enacted, SB 1127 expands temporary disability for specified firefighters and peace officers claiming injuries related to cancers, including leukemia, to receive up to 240 weeks of temporary disability benefits. Unlike the other provisions in Labor Code 4656 that limit receipt of temporary disability benefits within 5 years from the date of injury, SB 1127 does not limit the collecting of benefits within 5 years from the date of injury for injuries related to cancer. Because this does not expand temporary disability over every injury nor to every employee, again it is important to make sure that the employer is aware that for this section to apply, the firefighter or peace officer must be claiming an injury related to cancer.

## Penalty
- Where liability has been found to be unreasonably rejected, the claims administrator/employer may be penalized equal to five times the amount of the delayed benefits, not to exceed $50,000. Whether the claim is “unreasonably” denied is to be determined by the local Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board. Unlike the other two provisions, where they are to commence on January 1, 2023, and injuries thereafter, penalties may be sought to apply to ALL injuries under Labor Code Sections 3212 to 3213.2, whether the injury occurs on or after January 1, 2023, or before. Therefore, should the claims administrator/employer decide to reject a claim, the appropriate factual, medical, and legal evidence is required to prove why the claim was rejected.

**Utilization Review**  
California Labor Code § 4610  

**What Is Utilization Review (UR)?** Labor Code § 4610 requires all employers or their workers' compensation claims administrators to have a UR program. UR was implemented as a way to confirm the treating physician's plan for the injured worker is medically necessary. To ensure prompt and effective medical treatment is provided to injured workers, UR must be completed within strict timeframes. Claims administrators who don't meet the timelines or the criteria for a proper UR program are subject to audits and penalties.  

**How does UR work?** If the injured worker requires a specific course of treatment, diagnostic tests, surgery or other medical services – the treating doctor must submit a signed “Request For Authorization” (RFA) form with their latest medical report. Medical requests will not be approved without this form. A decision regarding the RFA must be issued within 5 business days of receipt.  

**Levels of Review:** There are 2 levels of Utilization Review.  
1. **Non-Clinician** – Adjuster Level – This level includes simple requests like initial diagnostics, initial series of physical therapy, etc. Approximately 60% of all RFA received by Intercare are approved at the adjuster level, this expedites treatment & return-to-work.  
2. **Clinician**  
   - **UR Nurse Review:** This level includes review of surgeries, injections, medications, etc. If a UR Nurse is unable to make a determination, the request is forwarded to a Peer Review Physician.  
   - **Peer Review Physician:** A Peer Review Physician may approve, modify or deny a RFA. Only a Peer Review Physician may modify or deny a treatment request.  

**Timeframes and Penalties:**  
- A UR Decision is usually made within 5 business days from the date RFA was received.  
- If additional information is required to make a decision regarding the RFA, the nurse/peer review physician has up to 14 days to make a decision.  

**Can UR decisions be disputed?** Yes, if the injured worker wants to dispute the UR decision they may submit their dispute through the Independent Medical Review (IMR) process.

![What is Permanent and Stationary or Maximum Medical Improvement?](https://via.placeholder.com/768x986.png?text=What+is+Permanent+and+Stationary+or+Maximum+Medical+Improvement%3F)

- Permanent and Stationary (P&S) or Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI) is when the treating doctor determines the injured worker’s medical condition has reached a point where it is stable, probably not going to improve or change substantially.

- If the injured worker is receiving salary continuation or temporary disability benefits when P&S status is reached, those payments will generally stop at this point and permanent disability benefits will be addressed.

- At the time of P&S status, the treating doctor will decide if the injured worker’s condition has resulted in any lasting physical or mental limitations and outline permanent restrictions at which time the District will need to determine whether the permanent restrictions can be accommodated.

- If there is an objection of P&S findings by the injured worker or claims administrator the parties will proceed with the Qualified Medical Evaluation or Agreed Medical Evaluation to resolve the dispute.

# Med-Legal Evaluations
**California Labor Code § 4062.1**

- Medical-Legal evaluations may be required to determine if injury is work-related and to resolve issues not addressed by treating physicians or specialists.

- **Qualified Medical Examiner:** A physician who has been certified by California Division of Workers’ Compensation-Medical Unit to perform exams so that disability can be evaluated. This sort of evaluation may be used in unrepresented and represented cases.

- **Agreed Medical Examiner:** A physician who has been agreed upon by legal representative to establish the extent of injury or disability. This sort of evaluation is only used in represented cases.
