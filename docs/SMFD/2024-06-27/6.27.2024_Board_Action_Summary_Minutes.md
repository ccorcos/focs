**REPORTS**

1. **PRESIDENT’S REPORT - (President Goold)**  
No Report

2. **FIRE CHIEF'S REPORT — (Chief House)**  
Good evening, President Goold, Directors, Colleagues, and Members of the Public.  
This evening, I would like Chief Law to inform you of two significant events that took place recently.  
- On June 20, a joint investigation between Metro Fire and the Sacramento Sheriff’s Office (SSO) led to the seizure of 8,000 pounds of illegal fireworks at a residence in B9s area. According to SSO, this is the largest fireworks seizure ever recorded in Sacramento. I want to commend Chief Law, the Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD), our logistics team, and the E50 crew for their outstanding work. I would also like to recognize the EOD team, whose contribution was particularly significant. The sheer volume of 8,000 pounds of fireworks meant a lot of boxes, and their extra hands were crucial in managing this operation. Chief Law stated she was very appreciative of the anonymous tipster.  
- Additionally, on June 18, our Station 24 crews responded to a series of nuisance fires. Investigator Stanton began the initial investigation and, on June 19, passed the torch to Inspector Christensen. Christensen dedicated the day to canvassing the neighborhood, capturing several videos and still shots of the suspect and operation.

On the evening of June 20, the suspect reemerged. Thanks to Christensen's vigilance and the efforts of the 24 crew, the suspect was promptly recognized and apprehended. The suspect, an unhoused arson registrant, was subsequently booked by the SSO, with charges filed by the District Attorney based on the compelling evidence gathered.

These events not only highlight the dedication and effectiveness of our teams but also emphasize the significant impact of their work in keeping our community safe and secure. Take care over the July 4th holiday and if you are going to use fireworks, only use “Safe and Sane” legal fireworks.
