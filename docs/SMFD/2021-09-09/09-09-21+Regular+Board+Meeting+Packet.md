The mission of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District is to provide professional and compassionate protection, education and service to our community.

The Governor has declared a State of Emergency to exist in California as a result of the threat of COVID-19 (aka the “Coronavirus”). The Governor issued Executive Order N-25-20 and N-29-20, which directs Californians to follow public health directives including canceling large gatherings. The Executive Order also allows local legislative bodies to hold meetings via conference calls while still satisfying state transparency requirements.

On June 11, 2021, the Governor issued Executive Order N-07-21, which formally rescinded the Stay-at-Home Order (Executive Order N-33-20, issued on March 19, 2020), as well as set the framework for a gradual, risk-based reopening of the economy. Given the new framework and to facilitate this process, the meeting of the Board will be available in person and via Zoom at the location and phone number listed above. The Public's health and well-being are the top priority for the Board of Directors of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District and you are urged to take all appropriate health safety precautions. If you prefer viewing the meeting via the Zoom Application, please contact Interim Board Clerk Dehoney via email at the address listed below.

Members of the public seeking to attend and to address the Board who require reasonable accommodations to access the meeting, based on disability or other reasons, should contact the following person at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of a Regular meeting to make arrangements for such reasonable accommodations:

**DATE:** September 9, 2021  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Resolution Adopting the Fiscal Year 2021/22 Appropriations Limit Schedule  

**TOPIC**  
A resolution has been prepared establishing an appropriation (Gann) limit for Fiscal Year 2021/22 in the amount of $394,225,123. Staff recommends approval of the proposed resolution.  

**SUMMARY**  
State law requires that every governmental entity in California prepare calculations each fiscal year of the entity's maximum allowed appropriations. The formula used to make these calculations involves adjusting the entity's previous “Gann limit” by incorporating changes to population and per capita income. These factors are provided by the State Department of Finance. A governmental entity is not permitted to spend more than its calculated Gann limit.  

**DISCUSSION**  
Based upon staff calculations, the District's Gann limit for FY 2021/22 is $394,225,123 which represents an increase of $22,700,174 when compared to the FY 2020/21 Gann limit of $371,524,949. This increase is due to a 5.73% increase in per capita income statewide and 0.36% average increase in the population of the cities and unincorporated area within the District. Calculation details can be found in the attached schedule.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
There is no fiscal impact since the District's FY 2021/22 proposed operating budget subject to the limit is well below the $394,225,123 set by the Gann limit.

**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Purchase Approval – Three (3) BME Type V Engines  

**TOPIC**  
Staff seeks Board approval for the purchase of three (3) 2021 BME Type V Engines from Boise Mobile Equipment.  

**SUMMARY**  
This purchase is available through the Houston-Galveston Area Council (H-GAC) Contract [FS12-19]. This contract includes a clause allowing local government agencies to purchase vehicles with the same rights and privileges as the State under the terms of the contract. The State utilized a competitive bid process when awarding this contract. Additionally, purchasing has reviewed the contract and determined it is consistent with Metro Fire purchasing policies and procedures.  

**DISCUSSION**  
These vehicles will be replacing Type V Engines which are at the end of their service life due to age and mileage.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The total cost of the purchase for the three (3) Type V Engines is $608,929.65. The funds for this purchase are included in the FY 2021/22 Final Budget.  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff respectfully recommends the Board approve the purchase of these three (3) BME Type V Engines from Boise Mobile Equipment.

State and local laws subject the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District to competitive bidding rules. Requests for goods and/or services from a specific vendor or that are limited to a specific brand, where substitutes to the recommended vendor or brand are not in the best interest of the District, must be accompanied by a written justification explaining the circumstances that make alternatives unacceptable. The employee signing the justification must disclose in writing whether or not he/she has a potential or actual conflict of interest. Metro Fire employees who have a business relationship with or financial or personal interest in the recommended vendor must disclose the conflict of interest. Any employee with an actual or potential conflict of interest may not participate in the purchase decision.  

The Purchasing Manager or their authorized designee will determine whether the justification is appropriate. Requests for exceptions to the competitive bidding process must be supported by factual statements that will pass an audit.

**SUMMARY**  
This purchase is available through the Houston-Galveston Area Council (H-GAC) Contract [FS12-19].

**TODD HARMS**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** September 9, 2021  

**TO:** Board of Directors  

**SUBJECT:** FY2020 State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) Award  

**BACKGROUND**  
On February 19, 2021, Metro Fire submitted 3 applications for funding totaling $439,562 and an application on behalf of the Sacramento Regional Fire/EMS Communications Center (SRFECC) totaling $549,938 to the Sacramento County Office of Emergency Services (SacOES) under the FY2020 State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP).

The first request, in the amount of $341,695, was for the installation of controlled access systems at 37 of our fire stations in order to enhance fire station security. The second request, in the amount of $71,309, was for the purchase of a portable high-pressure mass spectrometry (HPMS) trace detection analyzer to enhance hazardous materials response capabilities through more accurate detection of synthetic opioids, explosive precursors, fourth generation chemical warfare agents, and other toxic hazardous materials in trace quantities. The third request, in the amount of $26,558, was for the purchase of supplies and equipment to develop a deployable cache for the Sacramento Regional Incident Management Team (SRIMT) in order to support Metro Fire and its regional partners in all-hazards incident planning, response, and recovery efforts. Finally, the application submitted on behalf of the SRFECC, in the amount of $549,938, was for the purchase and installation of a computer-aided dispatch (CAD) Live Move-Up Module (LiveMUM), a real-time, dynamic software application enhancement that provides emergency dispatchers with automated move-up recommendations while simultaneously allowing the continuous monitoring and identification of coverage gaps, strengthening emergency communication capabilities and enhancing multi-jurisdictional all-hazards incident planning, response, and recovery capabilities.

**DISCUSSION**  
Metro Fire received notification on April 8, 2021 that the applications for the SRIMT cache and HPMS trace detection analyzer were not funded; however, the HPMS trace detection analyzer was later funded through a Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) grant obtained by the Sacramento Urban Area Working Group, of which Metro Fire is a member.

On August 30, 2021, Metro Fire received an award notification from SacOES that the application for the installation of controlled access systems was approved as a scaled down project totaling $33,723. The application submitted on behalf of the SRFECC was also approved at the full funding request of $549,938.

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Grant funding in the amount of $33,723 has been included in the FY2021/22 Final Budget for the approved fire station controlled access systems project. There is no match requirement.

Metro Fire will provide an in-kind contribution, in the form of staff time, to the SRFECC to assist them in managing their grant award.

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends adoption of the attached Grant Acceptance Resolution.
