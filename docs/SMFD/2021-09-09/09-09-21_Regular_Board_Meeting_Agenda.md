The mission of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District is to provide professional and compassionate protection, education and service to our community.

The Governor has declared a State of Emergency to exist in California as a result of the threat of COVID-19 (aka the “Coronavirus”). The Governor issued Executive Order N-25-20 and N-29-20, which directs Californians to follow public health directives including canceling large gatherings. The Executive Order also allows local legislative bodies to hold meetings via conference calls while still satisfying state transparency requirements.

On June 11, 2021, the Governor issued Executive Order N-07-21, which formally rescinded the Stay-at-Home Order (Executive Order N-33-20, issued on March 19, 2020), as well as set the framework for a gradual, risk-based reopening of the economy. Given the new framework and to facilitate this process, the meeting of the Board will be available in person and via Zoom at the location and phone number listed above. The Public’s health and well-being are the top priority for the Board of Directors of the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District and you are urged to take all appropriate health safety precautions. **If you prefer viewing the meeting via the Zoom Application, please contact Interim Board Clerk Dehoney via email at the address listed below.**

Members of the public seeking to attend and to address the Board who require reasonable accommodations to access the meeting, based on disability or other reasons, should contact the following person at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of a Regular meeting to make arrangements for such reasonable accommodations:
