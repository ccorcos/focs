Miscellaneous
The National EMS Memorial Bike Ride (NEMSBR) seeks to recognize the sacrifices of EMS personnel that die in the line of duty, who become sick or injured during EMS service, or who died of various causes, but left an impact on their local, or greater, EMS community.

Engineer Kyle Rutherford is an honoree in this year’s ride, and retired Captain Matt Grew was accepted to ride in Kyle’s memory.

This year’s ride will start on September 23rd and run from Rancho Cordova to San Francisco. There will be ceremony honoring this year’s fallen angels at the State Capitol, details to be announced shortly.

NEMSBR includes a fund raiser, and 100% of the money raised goes to the Fallen Angel Fund, which is supporting the construction of The National EMS Memorial in Washington, D.C. and the National EMS Memorial Service to support the families of EMS LODD.

The goal for the west coast route riders this year is to raise $20,000. Please join in to honor Kyle’s service to our community.

OPERATIONS’ REPORT – (DC Mitchell)
Chief Mitchell began his report by providing an update on CERT who have been volunteering their time to assist at the Caldor Fire, including 9 members who have provided 55 staff hours between August 29 and September 5. Those members have been staffing a call center in addition to working at the on-site large animal shelter. Additionally, on Friday, August 28, CERT responded to provide rehab services during a 4 alarm fire in Battalion 9. This was a prolonged incident in 100 degree temperatures and their assistance was needed and greatly appreciated by the personnel operating on the incident.

Chief Mitchell also reported the OES status update which included the following information:
1. Two Engines and two support personnel still committed on the Caldor incident
2. IA Strike Team (3 engines and a Strike Team Leader) deployed to the Bridge Fire (American River confluence near Foresthill) in CALFIRE NEU to assist on

Sunday, September 5th that was quickly contained, members; SRIMT and Copter were also deployed to provide assistance

Chief Mitchell then discussed the ambulance drawdown difficulties that Metro Fire has been experiencing. He relayed that we have been managing ambulance drawdown challenges almost on a daily basis, especially in the late morning and afternoon/evening hours, and are continuing to develop plans for mitigation. Although call volume is up, significant wait time at the hospitals have had a critical impact on the regional EMS system.

Chief Mitchell closed his report by providing the statistics for the District which included 5,175 total calls since the last report on August 26, 2021 (Average of 369 calls/day). Additionally, there have been 20 building fires, 8 of which were Metro specific. The busiest engine was E109 with 202 responses and the busiest medic was M105 with 223 responses. Also, in the early morning hours on Wednesday the 8th, there were four large incidents in the County that Metro assisted with (Roseville Road under the bridge, Mobile Homes on Auburn, and two multi-alarm grass fires on the parkway west of Watt).

Warren's specific comment on deciding to drive his wife to the hospital rather than have her transported as he was not sure of the medic's vaccines status and therefore did not want to expose her to the possibility of contracting COVID from someone who may not be vaccinated. Being an RN for more than 20 years she discussed the ill effects she’s seeing on the hospital system, patients, and staff due to COVID including hospitals being at capacity, the restricting of visitors and loved ones, the postponement of elective surgeries and the strain on the hospital staff both mentally and physically. She relayed that the current surge was a preventable one and asked that everyone trust in the science, get vaccinated, wash their hands and above all be safe.

Directors Wood and Clark thanked Director Sheetz for her comments and echoed her sentiments.

Director Saylors concurred with Director Sheetz’s comments and thanked staff for their presentations during the meeting. She also thanked Chief Harms for speaking at the membership meeting and beginning the conversation on how to change the culture of the fire service. She expressed that she is looking forward to seeing Firefighter White transition to days and become a part of the Regional Diversity Committee which meets on a monthly basis as well as presenting his progress to the Board.

Director Kelly thanked the previous Directors for their comments and echoed Director Sheetz’s sentiments.
