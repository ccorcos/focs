**TODD HARMS**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** September 9, 2021  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**FROM:** Todd Harms, Fire Chief  
**RE:** Final Budget for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2022  

---

**BUDGET OVERVIEW**

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated stay at home orders that began in March 2020 introduced a great deal of uncertainty regarding the economic outlook and the potential for negative impacts to District revenues and expenditures in future years. During late FY 2019/20 and the first half of FY 2020/21, the District experienced a reduction in Emergency Medical Services (EMS) revenues and an increase in certain expenditures, particularly overtime related to workers’ compensation exposures resulting from the pandemic; however, those impacts appear to have lessened during the second half of FY 2020/21. Property taxes, which represent approximately two thirds of District revenues, have been relatively unaffected by any negative economic impacts of the pandemic, and are expected to experience continued growth in future years, although at more moderate rates than recent years.

Based on property values as of January 1, 2021, assessed property value growth within the District is estimated to result in a $7.6 million (5%) increase in property tax revenues received by the District in FY 2021/22, extending an 8-year trend of increasing property tax revenues following the Great Recession. The FY 2021/22 Final Budget also reflects increased ongoing spending requirements resulting primarily from labor cost escalation, including a $6 million (11%) increase in retirement costs driven largely by required payments on the District’s unfunded pension liability with CalPERS. Overall, the FY 2021/22 Final Budget presented for the Board of Directors’ consideration results in a $2 million budget surplus for the General Fund.

The budget for FY 2021/22 and projections for future years will continue to be refined as more information is available. Our overriding goals will be to optimize services to the greatest extent possible given the available sources of funding, ensuring that the ongoing all-risk fire, rescue and emergency medical needs of the District are met, and to provide adequate reserves for future contingencies.

![BUDGET DISCUSSION](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=BUDGET+DISCUSSION)

The FY 2021/22 Final Budget is summarized below.

**GENERAL FUND**

FY 2021/22 General Fund revenue is projected to total $240 million compared to budgeted General Fund expenditures of $241 million. After accounting for a transfer in from the Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) Fund of $9.4 million and transfers out to the Capital Facilities Fund of $6 million, the FY 2021/22 General Fund budget results in a projected $2 million operating surplus, serving to increase the General Fund reserve balance and reflecting the cautious approach of enhancing reserves for potential future needs.

**Revenue**

The chart below shows historical General Fund revenues and other financing sources beginning with the pre-recession peak of FY 2008/09 through the FY 2021/22 budget. As shown, FY 2021/22 is expected to represent the ninth consecutive year of property tax revenue growth and eleventh consecutive year of total revenue growth. Property tax revenues are expected to account for 70% of total financing sources in FY 2020/21 compared to 80% in FY 2008/09, reflecting an increasing share of emergency medical services cost recovery over that time period.

**In millions**

Note: FY 2014/15 through FY 2021/22 adjusted to reflect net IGT revenue.

Projected FY 2021/22 General Fund revenues of $250 million (including the $9 million transfer-in from the IGT Fund) represent an increase of $13 million compared to the FY 2020/21 unaudited actual revenue and transfers-in of $237 million. The primary factors contributing to this change include:

**Property Taxes**  
Property tax revenues of $175 million account for approximately 70% of total General Fund financing sources and represent an increase of 4.2% over the FY 2020/21 revenue of $168 million.

**Medic Cost Recovery**  
Medic cost recovery revenues of $43 million represent an increase of approximately 3% over the FY 2020/21 revenue of $42 million, resulting from a combination of a rate increase to reflect cost inflation and increase in expected transport activity compared to the first half of FY 2020/21.

**Deployment Reimbursements**  
Deployment reimbursement revenue is budgeted at $3.5 million, consistent with the revenue and deployment activity experienced in FY 2020-21.

**GEMT Reimbursement**  
Retroactive payments expected to be received during FY 2021/22 result in a $2 million budgeted increase in GEMT revenue.

**Expenditures**  
General Fund expenditures of $241 million represent a $10 million increase compared to FY 2020/21 unaudited actual expenditures. Including the $6 million transfer to the Capital Facilities Fund to fund debt service and capital purchases not being financed, the overall use of General Fund resources is $247 million.

The primary factors contributing to the change in expenditures compared to FY 2020/21 include:

**Labor**  
General Fund budgeted labor costs total $204 million for FY 2021/22, which represents a $5 million (2%) increase compared to FY 2020/21.

The largest factor contributing to the increase in General Fund labor expenses is the District’s required contribution to the CalPERS Safety Plan, which is budgeted to increase by $5.5 million (14%) to approximately $45 million due to an increase in the required unfunded liability contribution resulting from an actuarial loss for the most recent plan year and increasing payments due on earlier amortization bases. Other factors contributing to the increase in General Fund labor expenses include an increase in the other postemployment benefits (OPEB) contribution, increases in medical premiums, a planned firefighter academy beginning in July 2021, and six months of increased wages compared to FY 2020/21 resulting from a 3% wage increase effective January 1, 2021. The FY 2021/22 Final Budget does not reflect any assumed changes to the terms of the District’s labor agreements, which expire on December 31, 2021.

The table below displays the current number of funded full-time positions by division, proposed changes, and the resulting number of recommended funded full-time positions. While there are no proposed changes to the number of funded full-time positions, budget savings for wages and benefits have been assumed for certain positions that are expected to be vacant for at least part of the fiscal year.

**Services and Supplies**

The services and supplies budget totals $33 million, an increase of approximately $4 million from the prior year. Changes from FY 2020/21 include:

- An increase of $1.5 million for the District’s liability and property insurance premium
- An increase of $600,000 for the District’s contribution to the Sacramento Regional Fire and Emergency Communications Center
- An increase of $400,000 for safety clothing, supplies, and services related to the firefighter academy
- An increase of $300,000 for GEMT statewide administration (reimbursable)

**Taxes, Licenses, Assessments, Debt Service & Contributions**

This expenditure category includes the assessment paid to the County for property tax administration, the assessment paid to the State for the Ground Emergency Medical Transport Quality Assurance Fee (GEMT QAF), General Fund debt service payments and other assessments and fees. FY 2021-22 total expenditures for this category are budgeted at $4.7 million, which represents a $100,000 increase compared to FY 2020/21.

**General Fund Operating Reserves**

The amount of General Fund Operating Reserves is expected to be $36 million at June 30, 2022. This amount represents 15.2% of net budgeted expenditures, consistent with the 15% minimum target established by the District’s Reserve Funding Policy.

As specified in the policy, any unassigned fund balance remaining at fiscal year-end will initially be classified as General Fund Operating Reserves and be included in the reserve amount.

**INTERGOVERNMENTAL TRANSFER (IGT) FUND**

Intergovernmental Transfers (IGT) allow the recovery of federal funds associated with the District’s transport of Medi-Cal managed care beneficiaries. The expenditures and revenues associated with these transfers are tracked in a separate fund in order to provide greater transparency, and the net revenue generated is transferred to the General Fund to cover healthcare services.

It is anticipated that IGTs covering activity for the 18 months July 2020 through December 2021 will be completed during FY 2021/22. A total of $9.5 million is expected to be transferred to the State in order to receive approximately $24.1 million, for net IGT revenue of $14.6 million.

Net funding of approximately $9 million from the IGTs covering activity for FY 2019/20 is anticipated to be received during FY 2020/21 but will be transferred and applied to General Fund expenditures in FY 2021/22.

**CAPITAL FACILITIES FUND**

The Capital Facilities Fund accounts for the costs of acquiring and financing capital assets. Transfers are required from the General Fund to cover the cost of any assets not financed and to pay debt service.

Budgeted expenditures for FY 2021/22 total $15.1 million, which includes $9.1 million for capital outlay and $5.9 million for debt service. Approximately $7.3 million of the capital outlay expenditures are expected to be financed, with an additional $1.6 million already having been financed in the prior year. The remaining capital expenditures and debt service payments are funded with a $5.9 million transfer from the General Fund.

Major capital purchases for FY 2021/22 include:

- Three Type I engines - $2.1 million

**Serving Sacramento and Placer Counties**
<!-- Page 22 -->
![Page 6](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+6)

- Two Type III engines - $1.0 million
- One truck - $950,000
- Three Type V engines - $645,000
- One water tender - $575,000

**GRANTS FUND**

The FY 2021/22 Grants Fund Budget includes approximately $2 million in budgeted expenditures for completion of the District’s currently open grants, including the Mobile Integrated Health (MIH) program, for which funding was received during FY 2020/21. As additional grants are awarded and accepted, the associated revenues and expenditures will be reflected through revisions to the budget.

**LEASED PROPERTIES FUND**

The District leases property not required for current operations and accounts for the revenues and expenditures associated with leased property in the Leased Properties Fund. Total lease revenue for FY 2021/22 and expenses associated with the leased property are both budgeted at approximately $1.1 million.

**DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES FUND**

Annual development impact fee revenue of $1.3 million is budgeted for FY 2021/22. Use of this revenue source is restricted to costs related to new fire stations and equipment needed to mitigate the impacts of new development. During FY 2021/22, the District expects to use this funding to pay for the construction of Station 68, with $5.3 million budgeted for this purpose.

**PRIORITY ISSUES AND RISKS**

Through proactive financial planning efforts, the District has identified and begun addressing issues to ensure future financial sustainability. The recommended Final Budget for FY 2021/22 reflects continued emphasis on addressing the issues and risks described below.

**Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) Unfunded Liabilities**

The FY 2021/22 budget reflects an increase of almost $6 million (14%) in required contributions to CalPERS to fund the District’s pension plans, resulting largely from increased payments on the unfunded liability. Required contributions are expected to continue to increase through FY 2025/26, as an assumed reduction in investment return is fully phased in.

The FY 2021/22 budget also reflects a $4 million payment to the Sacramento County Employees’ Retirement System in accordance with a funding agreement to address the unfunded liability associated with a predecessor agency. Under this agreement, the District will make annual payments through FY 2036/37.

In accordance with Board policy, $25.5 million in outstanding Pension Obligation Bond principal was redeemed during FY 2018/19 using amounts set aside each year for this purpose, reducing the District’s outstanding pension bond debt. Approximately $2 million is being set aside in FY.

2021/22 and future years to redeem an additional $20 million in Pension Obligation Bond principal in 2025.

The District has been pre-funding its OPEB retiree medical obligations since 2013 and the FY 2021/22 budget reflects a full funding policy contribution of $18 million ($0.5 million increase compared to FY 2020/21). This contribution will fund the explicit subsidy liability, budgeted as a combination of retiree medical premium payments and contributions to the California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust (CERBT) Fund.

**Capital Replacement and Maintenance**

The FY 2021/22 budget includes $15 million in capital outlay. Of that amount, approximately $9 million is budgeted for the replacement of apparatus and other vehicles. The District expects to have continued significant vehicle replacement needs in the future, resulting in escalating costs.

FY 2021/22 capital outlay also includes $6 million associated with the design and construction of the new Station 68. As new development continues to occur within the District, future budgets are expected to include additional costs associated with constructing and equipping new fire stations. Additionally, the District’s most recent Facility Condition Assessment (FCA) identified the need for over $80 million of repairs to existing fire stations and facilities over the next 20 years, as well as $50 million of modernization costs for these facilities.

**IGT Program**

Through IGTs, the District has received additional federal funding associated with emergency transports of Medi-Cal managed care beneficiaries in each year since FY 2014/15. The amounts and timing of this supplemental funding have not always been consistent from year to year and, as a result, the District has taken the approach of accounting for this activity separately from the General Fund and budgeting IGT funding as a General Fund financing source only after the amounts are actually known.

Any unanticipated reduction in federal funding could have a significant impact on the net funding received by the District. As a result, opportunities to direct this funding source toward one-time expenditures will continue to be explored as future budgets are developed.

**RECOMMENDATION**

Staff recommends adopting the Final Budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022.

# BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK

## BUDGETARY FUND STRUCTURE

The FY 2021/22 Preliminary Budget includes appropriations for the following District budgetary funds:

- General Fund
- Capital Facilities Fund
- Leased Properties Fund
- Grants Fund
- Development Impact Fees Fund
- Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) Fund

For purposes of the District’s financial statements, activities of the IGT Fund and Leased Properties Fund are combined with those of the General Fund.

## FUND DESCRIPTIONS

The **General Fund** is the general operating fund of the District. It is used to account for all financial resources except those required or designated by the Board of Directors to be accounted for in another fund.

The **Capital Facilities Fund** is a capital projects fund used to account for the acquisition and construction of the District’s capital assets. It is primarily funded by capital lease financing and general fund operating transfers.

The **Leased Properties Fund** accounts for the revenues and expenditures associated with leased property not required for current operations.

The **Grants Fund** is a special revenue fund used to account for the proceeds of federal and state grants that are legally restricted to expenditures for specific purposes.

The **Development Impact Fees Fund** is a capital projects fund used to account for all resources received from development impact fees. It is used for the construction or acquisition of future fire stations and acquisition of apparatus to serve new developments.

The **Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) Fund** is used to account for the revenues and expenses associated with the District’s participation in Medi-Cal IGTs.

## FUND RELATIONSHIPS AND INTERFUND TRANSFERS

Budgeted operating transfers from the General Fund to the Capital Facilities Fund result from shortfalls of revenues and other financing sources relative to expenditures and other financing uses in that fund. Budgeted operating transfers from the General Fund to the Grants Fund result from any local funding matches required by grant agreements.

Budgeted operating transfers to the General Fund from the IGT Fund result from the net revenue received as a result of participation in the IGT program and are used to offset the General Fund cost of providing health care services.

## BASIS OF BUDGETING

The modified accrual basis of budgeting is used for all funds. This basis is the same as the modified accrual basis of accounting used in the District’s audited governmental fund financial statements. Under this basis, revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the District considers all revenues, except property taxes, to be available if they are
<!-- Page 48 -->
![BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK](https://example.com/image.png)

**BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK**

Collected within 90 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Property taxes are recognized if received within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Property taxes, charges for services, intergovernmental revenues, rental income, and investment earnings associated with the current fiscal period are all considered to be susceptible to accrual. Expenditure-driven grants are recognized as revenue when the qualifying expenditures have been incurred and all other eligibility requirements have been met, and the amount is received during the period or within the availability period for this revenue source. All other revenue items are considered to be measurable and available only when cash is received by the District.

Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and workers compensation claims, are recorded only when payment is due. General capital asset acquisitions are reported as expenditures in governmental funds. Issuance of long-term debt and acquisitions under capital leases are reported as other financing sources.

**LEVEL OF BUDGET CONTROL**

The District’s appropriated budget is prepared by fund, division, and object level. The legal level of budgetary control is at the fund level and then the object level. Each fund has its own budget for the following items: 1) salaries and benefits, 2) services and supplies, 3) capital outlay, and 4) debt service and other expenditures. The Board must approve amendments or transfers of appropriations between funds or objects.

Appropriations in all budgeted funds will lapse at the end of the fiscal year even if they related encumbrances. Encumbrances are commitments related to unexecuted (executory) contracts for goods or services (i.e., purchase orders, contracts, and commitments). Encumbrance accounting is utilized to the extent necessary to assure effective budgetary control and accountability and to facilitate effective cash planning and control. While all appropriations and encumbrances lapse at year end, valid outstanding encumbrances (those for which performance under the executory contract is expected in the next year) are re-appropriated and become part of the subsequent year’s budget.

**KEY FINANCIAL POLICIES**

Financial policies adopted by the Board of Directors are summarized below.

**Capital Asset Policy**

The District’s Capital Asset Policy defines capital assets as land, buildings, equipment, and other related improvements with an individual cost of $5,000 or more and a useful life of at least one year. The policy establishes a capital asset accounting system that provides guidelines for the accountability and financial and physical control of capital assets, consistent and uniform procedures and transactions for accounting of capital assets, and compliance with funding entity requirements for grant-funded assets. Board approval is required for budgeted capital asset acquisitions and for disposal of capital assets. This policy also requires a biennial inventory of all capital assets.

**Debt Management Policy**

The District’s Debt Management Policy sets forth written guidelines for the issuance, structuring, and administration of debt issued to finance District expenditures. This policy prohibits the issuance of long-term debt to fund District operating costs, as well as the use of any derivative products. Debt structuring provisions include a requirement that the maturity of a debt issue be consistent with the economic or useful life of the asset being financed, generally level annual debt services payments, and preferences for fixed interest rates and optional redemption at a reasonable call date.

**Pension Funding Bonds Early Payoff Policy**

The Pension Funding Bonds Early Payoff Policy establishes the framework for ensuring that the District’s Pension Obligation Bonds are paid off in a manner designed to minimize interest costs and provides a mechanism for paying off the bonds at the earliest possible dates. This policy requires annual deposits with the Pension Bond Trustee such that these amounts, together with investment earnings, will be sufficient to retire the Series 2004B Bonds on their call date of November 19, 2025.

**Reserve Funding Policy**

The Reserve Funding Policy establishes minimum and maximum target reserve levels as follows:

| DESCRIPTION | MINIMUM | MAXIMUM |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **UNASSIGNED FUND BALANCE** | | |
| 1) Operating Reserves¹ | 1.8 months (15%) | 6 months (50%) |
| **COMMITTED FUND BALANCE** | | |
| 2) Self-Insurance Reserves¹ | Short-term liability | Total liability |
| 3) Compensated Absence Reserves¹ | Amount expected to be paid in next 12 months | Total obligation owed to all employees |
| 4) Capital Replacement Reserves² | Annual depreciation | Accumulated depreciation |
| 5) Early Debt Extinguishment Reserves¹ | Ratable amount needed to retire pension obligation bonds at call dates | Total outstanding pension obligation bond principal |
| **RESTRICTED RESERVES** | | |
| 6) Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Reserves³ | 10% of current year planned CIP expenditures | Amount needed to fully fund the CIP |
| 7) Debt Service Reserves¹²⁴ | Amount required by bond documents | None |
| 9) Post-Retirement Medical Reserves (CERBT)⁵ | Cumulative ARC contributions plus interest earnings | Actuarial present value of other postemployment benefits |

¹ General Fund  
² Capital Facilities Fund  
³ Development Impact Fees Fund  
⁴ Leased Properties Fund  
⁵ CERBT Trust (not District-held)  

**LEGAL DEBT LIMIT**

California Health and Safety Code Section 13937 establishes the District’s legal debt limit at 10% of the assessed value of all taxable property within the District; however, this Code section was enacted when assessed valuations were based on 25% of full market value. To account for an adjustment of valuations based on full market value, the District’s debt limit is calculated at 2.50% of total assessed value within the District.

As of June 30, 2019, the District’s bonded debt limit was $1,679,816,206. Outstanding applicable debt as of the same date was $41,266,823, for a legal debt margin of $1,638,549,383.

# BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK

## BUDGET PROCESS

The District’s budget cycle generally consists of three adopted budgets each fiscal year, according to the following calendar:

- On or before June 30th: Adoption of the Preliminary Budget for the following fiscal year
- On or before October 1st: Adoption of the Final Budget for the current fiscal year
- After December 31st: Adoption of the Mid-Year Budget for the current fiscal year

### Preliminary Budget

Preliminary Budget development generally begins in early spring for the following fiscal year’s budget. District budget officers are invited to attend a budget kick-off meeting, at which time information regarding the long-term financial outlook and expected funding levels is shared. Divisional budget requests are then submitted for changes in position count or classification, overtime, services and supplies, and capital outlay. The Finance Division is responsible for preparing revenue estimates, and compiling and preparing the expenditure budgets based on submitted requests.

Compiled budget requests are reviewed by budget officers at the Branch level. The resulting budget is then reviewed by Executive Staff to determine the budget that will ultimately be recommended to the Board based on organizational priorities and funding constraints. The Preliminary Budget is first presented to the Finance and Audit Committee for informational purposes and then to the Board of Directors for approval.

### Final Budget

The Final Budget process begins in July, after the close of the previous fiscal year. Any requests for expenditure changes are submitted by budget officers and revenue estimates are updated based on newly available information. Typical final budget changes include re-budgeting of items not actually expended in the previous fiscal year and adjustment of property tax estimates based on assessed values released by the County Assessor.

The Final Budget is typically presented to the Finance and Audit Committee in August and recommended to the Board for adoption in September.

### Mid-Year Budget Reviews

Throughout the year, budget officers monitor actual expenditures compared to budget on a monthly basis. The Finance and Audit committee receives bimonthly reports of revenue and expenditure activity compared to budgeted amounts. Additionally, following the close of a fiscal quarter, a formal District-wide budget review is undertaken in which budget officers update estimates of annual spending for each budget account.

The 2nd Quarter review serves as the basis for the District’s Mid-Year Budget changes, which are based on actual results through December 31st of each year. The Mid-Year Budget process typically begins in January, with a presentation to the Finance and Audit Committee in February and Board adoption in March.

## DISTRICT STRATEGIC PLAN

In 2019, the District adopted a new Strategic Plan identifying initiatives, projects, and desired outcomes associated with the following high-level elements:

1. Members
2. Service Delivery
3. Capital Assets
4. Financial Management
5. External Engagement

![BUDGETARY AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK](https://example.com/image-url)

# LONG-RANGE FINANCIAL PLANNING

As part of the District’s strategic planning efforts, long-range financial trends and assumptions are used to identify financial challenges and develop plans to address them. Identified challenges include the escalating costs of pension and other postemployment benefits, equipment replacement and facility maintenance needs due to deferred investment during the Great Recession, and a potential interruption or reduction in IGT funding.

With regard to pension and other postemployment benefits, the District’s practice is to annually fund the actuarially determined contribution amounts for pension and the amount associated with the explicit subsidy liability for other post-employment benefits. Funding at these contribution levels is intended to ensure the long-term sustainability of these benefits.

To address equipment and facility needs, the District has developed a vehicle replacement plan and recently conducted a District-wide facility condition assessment. Each of these efforts will inform the level of capital outlay and facility maintenance spending required to support current service levels.

In order to mitigate any impact of reduced IGT funding levels in the future, the District is evaluating all opportunities to achieve full cost recovery for emergency medical services, including supporting efforts already underway to maximize reimbursements for Medi-Cal services.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated stay at home orders that began in March 2020 introduced a great deal of uncertainty regarding the economic outlook and the potential for negative impacts to District revenues and expenditures in future years. During late FY 2019/20 and the first half of FY 2020/21, the District experienced a reduction in Emergency Medical Services (EMS) revenues and an increase in certain expenditures, particularly overtime related to workers’ compensation exposures resulting from the pandemic; however, those impacts appear to have lessened during the second half of FY 2020/21. Property taxes, which represent approximately two thirds of District revenues, have been relatively unaffected by any negative economic impacts of the pandemic, and are expected to experience continued growth in future years, although at more moderate rates than recent years.

# BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District is an independent special district governed by a nine-member Board of Directors. Each Board Member is elected by represented divisions from within Metro Fire’s jurisdictional boundaries to serve alternating four-year terms of office. The Board of Directors establishes policy for the organization and is directly accountable to the citizenry.

The Board carries out its fiduciary duty by establishing the vision, mission, and strategic goals that will ensure the District meets its obligations and commitment to the public. It is responsible for adopting the District’s annual budget and exercises its fiscal oversight duties by reviewing bi-monthly financial statements and the annual independent audit which facilitates making vital decisions governing the future direction of the District. The Board is responsible for the governance of the District and the appointment of the Fire Chief to carry out the day-to-day administration of the policies and budget set by the Board.

## FY2020/21 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
- Maintained a fiscally responsible budget due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which limited training and conference attendance to virtual platforms.
- Worked with the County of Sacramento Voter Registration and Election to select incumbents Director Goold, Director Wood, Director Sheetz, Director Clark, and Director Jones who will serve citizens for another four year term, and Director White who was selected to serve the remainder of Division 9’s two year term.

## BUDGET DISCUSSION:
In an effort to ensure delivery of the highest level of service to the constituency, a fiscally conservative budget is maintained. Additionally, an annual audit will be conducted to meet the fiduciary responsibility to the citizenry. On-going travel expenses are utilized to improve public relations and enhance communications, as well as foster cooperation with other special districts and local agencies in attaining mutual goals.

## GOALS FOR UPCOMING YEARS:
The Board’s main goal each year is to deliver a balanced budget while maintaining a high level of service to the community. With the Strategic Plan now in the second year, the Board will continue to work with the Fire Chief to implement the Strategic Plan allowing staff to focus measurable efforts to ensure the Board’s goals are met.

# OFFICE OF THE FIRE CHIEF

The Fire Chief is the Chief Executive Officer for the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (Metro Fire). Under the direction of the Board of Directors, the Fire Chief provides leadership and is responsible for the overall management of the District. The Fire Chief acts as the Board of Directors’ Commanding Officer over all administrative and operational functions and is responsible for developing the vision and strategy of the District in conjunction with the goals and objectives established by the Board. With the selection and mentoring of his executive staff, they assure effective performance, the delivery of quality services and promote a strong relationship between labor and management to optimize a positive work environment for Metro Fire members. It is the Fire Chief’s responsibility to coordinate the operations of the District with other local, regional, and state fire protection agencies as well as other governmental agencies and the public.

## BUDGET DISCUSSION:
Budget requests for the Office of the Fire Chief can be grouped into the following major areas:
- **Memberships.** These memberships are deemed essential to the day-to-day operations of the department and support existing programs and customer service-based partnerships with organizations within our jurisdiction, and with organizations at the local, state and international levels. These agencies assist the District in meeting priorities that have been established by the Board of Directors and are consistent with the District’s mission.
- **Business/Conference.** The Fire Chief and selected personnel will attend annual conferences, meetings, etc. when deemed necessary. All costs associated with these functions are covered in this account.
- **Other Services and Other Supplies.** These accounts are used for “Other Professional Services” that are not covered by another division’s budget as well as expected unexpected District obligations, special recognition, and any other items not covered by other divisions or accounts.

## FY2020/21 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
- Continued to foster community relations at all levels of governance and the private sector. These relationships have increased collaborative opportunities locally and regionally for the District, and statewide for the fire service as a whole.
- Through a collaborative effort, continued to work with the Board of Directors, members of Metro Fire, labor-management, and stakeholders in maintaining and developing objectives and operational strategies to meet and address the five key strategies set forth in the District’s Strategic Plan.

- In conjunction with SRFECC board approval, continued to provide an assistant chief to serve as Executive Director of the Sacramento Regional Fire/EMS Communications Center (SRFECC).
- Provided guidance and overall management of the District’s response and recovery efforts for the COVID-19 pandemic, including operational and fiscal impacts and resources. With members of Metro Fire serving tirelessly as vital frontline responders during the pandemic, collectively, labor-management implemented changes to how service is provided, including PPE protocols, patient care protocols, supply utilization and stocking, health and safety procedures, staffing plans, and exposure reporting, among a multitude of others. In addition to these operational shifts, worked alongside other special district partners in advocating for direct access to federal stimulus funding to offset the impact of response and recovery efforts.

**GOALS FOR UPCOMING YEARS:**  
The Fire Chief will continue to carry out the day-to-day administration of policies set by our Board of Directors and state and legislative mandates. This will be done by continuing to work collaboratively with the Board of Directors, management and labor teams, state and local partners, community groups and stakeholders alike to ensure that the District’s service delivery model continues to maximize efficiencies and provide the highest level of service to our communities, while maintaining fiduciary obligations.

Additionally, to ensure the District is effectively and efficiently providing the highest level of service, priority will be placed on the continued assessment of our service delivery models and deployments, enhancing organizational communications and continuous training opportunities and building consistency and accountability within the organization.

![COMMUNITY RELATIONS DIVISION](https://www.metrofire.ca.gov/images/2020-2021-Annual-Report/Community-Relations-Division.jpg)

As the entire world and fire service was challenged in fiscal year 2020/2021 by the COVID-19 pandemic, Metro Fire’s Community Relations Division (COR) adapted and overcame to continue its priority to provide timely, accurate, and responsive information to the Sacramento Region regarding our emergency service delivery, educational messages, and to promote the District.

Public Information Officer’s (PIO) provide incident coverage, conduct press conferences, and market and enhance Metro Fire’s activities and reputation in the Sacramento Region. Last year, we worked with our partners in the media market to ensure our ability to be the primary source for local fire and emergency service topics, meeting their need to conduct interviews in a virtual format that were able to be syndicated throughout California and the Nation.

Our Community Relations Coordinator was tasked with developing new products for the District that reflected the unknown nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. These included our multi lingual “Stay Home Safety with Metro Fire” social media campaign to address expected human behavior and the subsequent risks due to the statewide stay at home order.

In FY20/21 we began to recognize Metro Fire’s 20th year with a new graphics and logos package, and place commemorative decals on every apparatus. We also provided our membership with 20th anniversary uniform patches. This past year we supported the State of California by deploying a PIO to the Creek Fire (the largest fire in state history by acreage), the Sacramento Regional IMT for civil unrest. COR also supported the funeral services for Metro Fire Engineer Kyle Rutherford by providing internal and external information, planning, and day of funeral production and technology support.

**FY2020/2021 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:**
- Provided high quality virtual media interviews to the Sacramento media market
- Continued 24/7/365 PIO and Communications coverage
- Developed “Stay Home Safely with Metro Fire” social media campaign
- Provide PIO representation on Sacramento Regional IMT and to California on major fire incidents

**BUDGET DISCUSSION:**
In FY2021/2022 COR will continue to present Metro Fire Sacramento’s premier all risk emergency service provider by soliciting and responding to local and national media opportunities. This requires sustaining the staffing model for 24/7 coverage and development through training opportunities in public engagement, video production, and professional communications skills while upgrading and replacing equipment to meet the public's expectations of professional content.

**GOALS FOR UPCOMING YEARS:**
- Improve livestream and event broadcasting quality
- Continue providing Operations Division with wildland live fire opportunities while achieving objectives in vegetation management
- Acquire training to provide new skills for existing COR personnel and train new members to baseline qualification

![Non-Divisional Budget](https://example.com/image.jpg)

The Non-Divisional (NDI) budget represents costs that are incurred by the District in general and are not directly associated with any division in particular. These costs include pension bond debt service, other post-employment benefits (OPEB), supplemental reimbursements to retirees, and various other payments.

**BUDGET DISCUSSION:**

The Non-Divisional budget includes $18 million representing current payments for retiree medical insurance as well as contributions to the CalPERS Employer’s Retirement Benefit Trust (CERBT) which is used to prefund future retiree medical premiums.

Additionally, pension bond debt service and sinking fund payments totaling $7 million are included in Non-Divisional expenditures. In accordance with the District’s plan to retire the pension bonds at the earliest date allowed, there was a $25.5 million expense to pay-off the Series C bonds in November 2018. A similar payment is also scheduled in FY 2025-26 for the Series B bonds. The funding for these disbursements will come from committed fund balance accumulated since FY 2005/06.

This division also budgets $4.4 million for a payment to Sacramento County Employees’ Retirement System (SCERS). These payments reduce an unfunded liability for District retirees and employees formerly employed by predecessor agencies that participated in SCERS. Also included in the budget are estimates for paid time off and sick leave buybacks of about $2.2 million for all divisions.

This division also covers expenditures for property and liability insurance premiums, postage, and for the District’s headquarters expenditures such as utilities, janitorial services, and landscape maintenance. Finally, Inter-Governmental Transfer (IGT) fees amounting to $9.5 million are included in the expenditure budget. This will allow the District to recover federal funding associated with Medi-Cal managed care beneficiaries amounting to approximately $24.1 million.

# OPERATIONS

The Operations Division oversees all aspects of the District’s all-hazard emergency services delivered from 41 stations with daily shift staffing of 185 personnel. The Operations Branch answered over 98,000 calls for service in 2020. These calls for service are answered by five battalion chiefs, 36 first-out engine companies, seven truck companies, 14 fire-based medics and four single role paramedic units.

Metro Fire has several special operations and all-hazard response programs that are managed under the Operations Division.

# EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES

The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Division is committed to providing the highest level of service possible to the communities we serve. Metro Fire’s team of skilled first responders is supported by recurrent professional training and continuous quality care improvement. The administrative side of EMS is comprised of an Assistant Chief, Battalion Chief/CQI Manager, three Captain/Paramedics, one Mobile Integrated Health Program Manager, one Administrative Specialist, and two EMS System Technicians. 24/7 support to all District ambulance operations is provided by three field supervisors (“EMS247”) who also oversee the members of the Single Role Paramedic Program.

The District’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Division supports the third largest fire-based Advanced Life Support (ALS) transporting program in the State of California, currently operating 19 Advanced Life Support (ALS) ambulances, five reserve ALS ambulances, and 43 ALS engine and truck companies. Metro Fire employs over 490 paramedics, 70 EMTs, and 10 first responders to staff these units, as well as Community Care Response Units (CCRU) watercraft, an ALS rescue capable helicopter, a Tactical Emergency Medical Services (TEMS) team, and bike medic teams for special events.

The year 2020 brought a number of challenges that inspired adaptive change and a coordinated response to unprecedented circumstances. The ensuing mobilization of resources is a testament to the commitment of Metro Fire’s team of professionals in serving the community, and highlights the many successes enjoyed by the District to the benefit of the public.

Metro Fire continues to be an innovator in the provision of EMS in the Sacramento region. In response to the pandemic, the District partnered with Sacramento County Public Health in 2020 to provide mobile COVID-19 assessment and testing, and we will commence operation of the Sacramento Mobile Integrated Health (SacMIH) pilot project in 2021.

## FY2020/21 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

# SINGLE ROLE PARAMEDIC PROGRAM

The Single Role Paramedic Program (SRPP) was established in 2013 as a pathway for its members to become Firefighter/Paramedics with Metro Fire. To date, nearly 60 percent of the program graduates have made the intended transition to Firefighter/Paramedic, and a number of members have since promoted to Engineer and Captain.

The SRPP is managed in the field by three supervisors (“EMS24”) that alternate by platoon to oversee the operation of up to five 24-hour medic units assigned throughout multiple battalions in Metro Fire’s jurisdiction. The deployment model is structured to maximize ambulance coverage as staffing levels allow.

## FY2020/21 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
- Graduated one SRPP Recruit Academy and scheduled the start of a second academy for May of 2021
- Hired 10 Paramedics
- Hired 8 Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs)

The continued goal of the program is to enhance the capabilities of the District to deliver high-caliber ambulance transportation to the communities it serves, while providing a career track for EMTs and Paramedics seeking the opportunity to become Firefighter/Paramedics.

## GOALS FOR UPCOMING YEARS:
- Succession planning
- Expand recruitment efforts
- Bolster the number of paramedic preceptors/FTOs in the SRPP ranks
- Work with Local 522 to revamp the program for long term sustainability

# TRAINING

The Training Division’s mission is to improve service delivery to the community by providing realistic, ongoing, and verifiable training to district personnel and assisting them to develop and strengthen essential job skills. We strive to ensure all-risk operational readiness and enhance the ability of our members to perform quality public service. We promote teamwork and service in a safe, effective, and efficient manner. There are many federal, state, and locally-mandated requirements which must be addressed, and as new information becomes available, it is imperative that we introduce new tools, technology, or equipment to train our fire personnel. The Training Division makes available opportunities to employees to achieve full potential in their current roles and assist them to advance their careers through training.

## FY2020/21 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
- Conducted performance appraisals of over 80 probationary suppression personnel from the rank of Battalion Chief to Firefighter
- Conducting multiple district wide hands on full scale exercises at donated structures
- Continue to grow the Battalion Chief training officer involvement and training supply caches
- During COVID-19 pandemic, the Training Division was able to make a quick transition from training and drills to setting up and running the District’s EOT
- During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Training Division was able to quickly establish a plan for a vaccine clinic which ran for 6 weeks and was able to administer over 460 vaccinations

## BUDGET DISCUSSION:
Metro Fire has seen a steady decrease of experience within the ranks. The need for realistic scenario base training which emphasizes comprehension of complex incidents can set our emergency responders up for success. Additional staffing expenditures will need to be committed to narrow this experience gap.

## GOALS FOR UPCOMING YEARS:
- Search Drill
- Advanced Auto-X
- Commercial Building Construction Class with Chief Naum
- Project Mayday with Don Abbott
- IFF FF Survival Grant Award

# COMMUNICATIONS

The Metro Fire Communications Division is responsible for the operation, maintenance, and repair of all District communication equipment and vehicle emergency lighting. Equipment includes: 800 MHz radios, VHF radios, pagers, Mobile Data Computers (MDCs), vehicle modems, vehicle intercom systems, code 3 lighting, station emergency (red) phones, fire station alerting systems, and traffic signal opticom systems.

The Communications Division is committed to providing the highest level of service to Metro Fire staff to help reduce unit response times and ensure communications stay intact. Communication Technicians handle all equipment repairs and radio programming out in the field. Metro Fire’s Communications Manager represents the District in Radio System Enhancement Committee meetings, Radio System Management Group (SMG) meetings, and sits on the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) for the Sacramento Regional Radio Communications System (SRRCS). This enables Metro Fire to have a voice on how the regional radio system is managed.

## FY2020/21 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
- Provided access to four Radio Channels through District owned smart phones.
- Conducted trial and identified replacement Mobile Data Computers (MDCs) to remove older equipment that is no longer available.
- Installed emergency lighting and communication equipment packages in new vehicles.

## BUDGET DISCUSSION:
The Sacramento Radio System only guarantees radio coverage within Sacramento County and certain southern areas of Placer County. Some Chief Officers and PIO personnel have residence outside of the coverage area and were unable to monitor incidents. An interface was created between the radio system and District owned smart phones by using a specialized internet modem to create a Radio Over Internet Protocol (ROIP) system to enable continued access to the radio system while out of the coverage area. The initial cost was $15,000 for equipment and setup. Ongoing cost is approximately $500 per radio channel per year. The Mobile Data Computer (MDC) used in fire apparatus is no longer manufactured or available. A Panasonic Toughbook CF-33 MDC was trialed and selected to be the standard going forward. $211,500 was budgeted to purchase the first batch of replacement MDCs to remove the oldest models from service. $300,000 was budgeted to purchase emergency lighting and communication equipment packages for new apparatus. Metro Fire Communication Technicians performed the installs in house to guarantee quality and prevent additional labor costs.

## GOALS FOR UPCOMING YEARS:
- Install Opticom emitters on additional intersections throughout Sacramento County
- Expand radio system access from District owned smart phones from four channels to eight.
- Replace VHF radios
- Enable paging feature in District owned Radios
- Enable GPS location through portable radios
- Enable Over the Air Programming for both 800 MHz and VHF Radios

The Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD) provides new construction, code enforcement, public education, and fire investigation services to the unincorporated portions of Sacramento County, City of Citrus Heights, and City of Rancho Cordova communities. The CRRD New Construction and Code Enforcement team is responsible for inspecting existing buildings and properties for fire code violations, issuing permits, assisting fire suppression personnel, responding to code violation complaints, reviewing and approving licensed care facilities, reviewing plans for all construction projects and fire protection systems, as well as conducting the testing and inspections for those projects. In addition, Fire Inspectors handle special event requests, carnivals, fairs, fireworks booth inspections, and public fireworks displays.

CRRD Community Relation Specialists cultivate community safety through various safety presentations, school age educational programs, fire extinguisher training, fire evacuation training, and other community programs. Lastly, through coordinated efforts with suppression personnel, the GIS Specialist provides detailed District maps and pre-fire planning for use in emergency response.

### FY2020/21 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
- Began Community Risk Assessment to identify, prioritize, and mitigate risks within our communities.
- Began cost of recovery study for CRRD related activities.
- Implemented process to respond after fire incidents to determine effectiveness of fire prevention features and to assist with re-opening/rebuilding.
- Implemented on-call Inspector program to assist Operations personnel, to facilitate repair of suppression and alarm systems out of service, and to evaluate and facilitate safe re-entry after fire events.
- Implemented early notification for exterior hazard mitigation of identified parcels and for defensible space around parcels located within our high-hazard areas.
- Re-implemented addition of high-risk occupancies to current inspection program.
- Facilitated successful task book completion for 2 new Fire Inspector I’s and 1 Fire Inspector II.
- Implemented K-2nd grade fire safe education program.
- Began implementation of 3rd-6th grade fire safety education program.

### BUDGET DISCUSSION:
The Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD) saw an approximate 4% decrease in construction inspections during FY2019/20. Though COVID-19 reduced many business activities, construction initially slowed, but overall remained fairly steady. Complaints (primarily alarm and suppression systems out of service) significantly increased by approximately 29 percent. Increased complaint and code enforcement inspections result in a larger workload. Through attrition and in consideration of the increased number of inspections, the division will backfill with Fire.

Inspector I positions (which entails a one-year training program) or Lateral Fire Inspector II positions (which includes completion of an Inspector I & Inspector II task book).

In FY2019/20, approximately 40% of plan reviews were outsourced, down from 52% in FY 2018/19. During initial COVID restrictions, CRRD re-evaluated and streamlined plan review processes enabling the return of many plan reviews completed by CRRD Inspectors. This has ensured consistency and provided increased service to our business community.

Additionally, CRRD continues to build and nurture strong working relationships with other agencies and has worked to become more involved in interagency associations. CRRD members currently hold board positions in the Sacramento Regional Fire Prevention Officers and Northern California Fire Prevention Officers groups. We are also working toward enhancing our professional development through applicable Fire Service conference and workshops (e.g. National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) conferences, Community Risk Reduction (CRR) conferences, California Conference of Arson Investigators, etc.).

**GOALS FOR UPCOMING YEARS:**

![FIRE INVESTIGATIONS](https://example.com/image.jpg)

Metro Fire is one of the few agencies in our region with a full-time Fire Investigation Unit (FIU). The primary role of the Fire Investigations Unit (FIU) is to investigate unidentified fire causes, the causes of fires resulting in serious bodily injury or death and suspected arson related incidents that occur within the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District. The FIU is an important component to our Community Risk Reduction Division (CRRD) and works collaboratively with our Inspection staff in enforcing Fire and Building codes and subsequent violations through the legal system. The FIU works as an assisting agency with local, State, and federal law enforcement agencies throughout the Sacramento region.

**FY2020/21 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:**
- The FIU conducted a total of 442 investigations for 2020 noting a 30% increase from 2019. As of April 20, 2021 a total of 81 investigations have been conducted.
- In 2020, there were a total of 17 cases closed by arrest with 120 cases determined to be arson related. 43 fires were determined to be fireworks related during this timeframe.
- The FIU investigated a total of 2 civilian fatality fires and 13 fires resulting in civilian injuries in 2020.
- In 2020, the FIU was staffed with three full-time investigators, with three part-time retired and unannuit investigators utilized to augment full-time investigators during mandatory training and/or vacancies for 24-hour investigator duty coverage.
- Implementation of a new reporting system utilizing the Fire Investigation Module in Image Trend.

**BUDGET DISCUSSION:**
In September of 2020, the FIU was reassigned under the Community Risk Reduction Division to further coordinate Metro Fire’s commitment to minimizing the risk of life and property loss from fire and other emergencies. Thorough fire investigations, evaluation of occupant safety and fire protection features facilitate business recovery and acts to reduce District liability after a fire event. Currently the FIU reports directly to the Fire Marshal and is in the process of creating a plan to provide greater support, consistency and stability for the Unit. The FIU will continue to maintain and expand its working partnerships with our fire and law enforcement agencies on local, State and Federal levels.

**GOALS FOR UPCOMING YEARS:**
- Launch pilot program assigning the Supervising Inspector to a 6 month day assignment.
- Provide Fire Investigation training to Fire Inspection staff to utilize as additional resources for origin and cause investigations.
- Continue to create adequate storage space for a District Evidence facility and implement a District evidence tracking system.
- Evaluate, update and/or create new policies, procedures and standards specific to the FIU.
- Increase efficiencies and tracking for all fire investigation case files.

Fleet Maintenance Division’s primary mission is to support District operational readiness by maintaining 345 vehicles and apparatus in safe, effective, and reliable working order. This is achieved through comprehensive fleet management practices including acquisition, inspection, maintenance, repair, testing, recordkeeping, and disposition of equipment. The Division monitors and maintains a daily pre-trip inspection program for all line vehicles, assessing reported defects and assigning them as immediate need, mobile field repair, or deferral to full service. Additionally, Fleet Maintenance staff provides vehicle familiarization and usage training, manages apparatus specification development while ensuring compliance with all applicable state, local and federal laws and regulations, and serves on several of the District’s oversight teams.

### FY2020/21 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
- Increased the volume of full services and decreased the intervals between services.
- Staffed a south shop at station 50 with two full time mechanics.
- Ordered the following vehicles: Ambulances (3 new, 2 remounts), Type I Engines (3), Type V Engines (2), Rescue Boat (grant funded), Staff SUVs (3), Staff Pick-ups (2), Electric Cart (CERT), Staff Van, and a large box van (Logistics).
- Purchased an above ground fire pump testing station to be located at fleet.
- Provided 24-hour mobile response services.
- Provided apparatus training to new SRPP employees, Recruit Firefighters, and current line personnel.

### BUDGET DISCUSSION:
The Fleet Maintenance Division’s projected budget includes adjustments that are necessary to run day-to-day operations and for replacement apparatus. The budget reflects minor adjustments to the service and parts lines to match our work throughput, parts costs, and outsourcing. Additionally, funds were added to increase the number of leased vehicles in our fleet, enabling the reduction of staff vehicles we own that are past their end-of-life cycle and costly to maintain. As in years past, the equipment and training budget for Fleet’s personnel has been prioritized to give our mechanics the tools and education they need to keep up with ever changing diesel engine technology. This will result in continued cost savings by reducing the number of repairs that are being outsourced, increasing efficiency, and decreasing the down time of our vehicles and apparatus.

### GOALS FOR UPCOMING YEARS:
- Implement a new app-based pre-trip inspection program for our line personnel.
- Reduce the number of fire apparatus that are outsourced for repairs by providing factory training and tools to our mechanics.
- Reestablish the ranks of Shop Assistant and Master Mechanic to make the division more efficient.
- Increase the number of leased vehicles in our fleet, to reduce the total cost of ownership for our aging staff vehicles.
- Increase the number of Hybrid and Zero Emission vehicles in our fleet.

Logistics is the central hub of warehouse operations for all District supplies and equipment. Our inventory supplies all 41 fire stations, Armstrong Headquarters, Fleet Division, Communication Division, and the Logistics/Training Facility. Deliveries of all inter-office mail is routed to all of these locations daily. While performing this task, we are able to deliver custodial supplies, office supplies, fire suppression equipment, oxygen tanks and EMS supplies for medics, and replenish SCBA bottles. Logistics keeps the District in compliance with NFPA standards by regularly testing ladders and hoses, and doing regular cleaning, inspection, and maintenance of turnouts. Logistics administers the District’s Hazardous Materials Plans and submits all required documentation and information to the County of Sacramento Environmental Management Department. Logistics is responsible for coordinating the repairs on fire station appliances and purchases replacement appliances when needed. Finally, Logistics supports numerous District functions and training operations by delivering supplies and equipment.

The Purchasing Manager and Procurement Specialist are responsible for administering the District’s Purchasing Policy. We review all purchase requisitions for correct budget expenditure and issue purchase orders for requests over $1,000. Staff works with budget officers for the procurement of services and supplies over $45,000 up to $100,000 requiring bid documentation. We review documents and offer advice for sourcing and cost savings. Purchasing handles all formal bids for the procurement of services and supplies over $100,000, working with budget officers to develop scopes of work and publishing all formal bid documents through our new eProcurement application ProcureNow. We facilitate bid openings and bid/proposal evaluations. Our division maintains vendor information in the District’s financial system. We upkeep insurance documentation for all vendors doing business with the District. Purchasing is the repository for all District contracts and agreements. Contract terms are routinely reviewed for invoice accuracy. Notifications regarding expiration dates will be sent to staff for contract renewals.

**FY2020/21 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:**

2020 was a very challenging year for the Logistics Division. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, our division still needed to locate and provide supplies to keep the District in full operation for the community we support. The supply chain for cleaning supplies and EMS supplies was hit the hardest with the whole world in need of these items. Logistics managed to keep our supply above the minimum level needed to keep all the station and medic inventory stocked. The close working relationship we have with our vendors allowed us to receive goods as quickly as the supply chain could handle. There was not a point at the station level where inventory was compromised. The Logistics supply inventory has been restored to pre-Covid-19 levels and our ordering process will allow us to handle any future interruptions in the supply chain.

**BUDGET DISCUSSION:**

The Logistics budget is a direct reflection of District needs requested by all divisions. The Logistics and Purchasing Division continues to seek value through cost savings research.

**GOALS FOR UPCOMING YEARS:**

- Move the management of the EMS supply inventory from the EMS Division into the Logistics Division.
- Work on getting additional personnel to handle EMS inventory at all of the medic stations, to organize and provide cycle counting. This will virtually eliminate supplies from expiring due to rotating inventory issues.
