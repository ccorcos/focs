**CRRD:**
- On Saturday, January 20, 2024, crews were dispatched to an apartment fire on Marconi Ave. Crews arrived to heavy fire affecting several first-floor units, extending up to the second-floor. Two victims were treated and one was transported. In a proactive approach, members of the CRRD team conducted a smoke alarm blitz last year at this complex on Feb. 8, 2023 in conjunction with a joint task force inspection due to ongoing issues related to vacant/boarded up units. The team installed a total of 38 smoke alarms in 20 units. Two alarms were installed in the transported victim’s unit, and two were installed in the main fire unit. The transported victim was alerted to the fire by a smoke alarm. This canvas potentially saved a number lives by providing early evacuation warnings.
- CRRD continues to play an active role in the Fireworks Taskforce. Last week Chief Law attended a meeting focused on proposed changes to the county’s ordinance.
- CRRD is in the process of scheduling meetings with each of the Superintendents of the public schools in our jurisdiction regarding the implementation of our new fee schedule as well as to discuss fire and life safety education needs, particularly teen vaping and false alarms.
