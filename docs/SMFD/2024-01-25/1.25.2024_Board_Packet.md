**OPERATIONS REPORT – (Deputy Chief Mitchell)**

1. **Decon 110**
   - In service 11/27/23, staffed with one FF – six month pilot program
   - Close collaboration and support from 522
   - Will respond to the scene of working fires at discretion of the incident commander
   - Will collect contaminated PPE
   - In addition to current StormStick usage
   - Plan to add more robust decontamination bags next spring

2. **EMS Team Introduction**
   - AC Rudnick introduced EMS team members Adam Blitz, Jim Ellis, Eric Matteoli, Chris Kellogg, and Eric Sacht.

3. **Commendation**
   - AC Fiorica will present commendation to BC Pittman

**Pittman Commendation**

Back on April 16th a vehicle accident with entrapment occurred on Highway 50 at Aerojet Road. Captain, now BC, Pittman was working an overtime shift at Engine 61 and he and his crew were on their way to Station 65 to complete some training when Captain Pittman heard Truck 23 get dispatched to the accident. Being aware of the extended response time for the closest available Truck for this incident he made contact with the Incident Commander and inquired about responding with Truck 65. The truck was in quarters but was unstaffed as the truck crew was already on a water rescue incident. The Incident Commander approved Captain Pittman’s plan so Engine 61 responded to Station 65 and staffed the Truck and responded to the incident. Captain Pittman’s decision had a significant positive impact on the response time to get the needed tools and equipment to this incident. Captain Pittman demonstrated outside of the box thinking and his decision is in line with the following pillars of the Metro Way: service delivery, adaptable, strong communications, and individual initiative.

10. Liability; Indemnification. Each party agrees that they shall indemnify, defend and hold the other party and its governing body, officers, agents and employees, harmless from any and all claims, damages, losses, causes of action and demands, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, incurred in connection with or in any manner arising out of the indemnifying party's performance of this Agreement. The indemnifying party, at the indemnifying party's own expense and risk shall defend any and all actions, suits, or other legal proceedings that may be brought or instituted against the other party, the members of its governing body, officers, agents, and employees for any such claims, damages, losses, demands, liabilities, costs or expenses incurred in connection with or in any manner arising out of the indemnifying party's performance of this Agreement. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for damage or injury occasioned by the sole negligence or willful misconduct of the non-indemnifying party and its officers, agents, or employees. It is the intention of the parties that where comparative fault is determined to have been contributory, principles of comparative fault will be followed and each party shall bear the proportionate cost of any damage attributable to the fault of that party, its elected and appointed officials, officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, subcontractors, and volunteers. These indemnification provisions shall survive the termination of the Lease.

11. Insurance. Lessee shall maintain at all times commercial general liability insurance insuring Lessor and Lessee against all claims or demands for personal injuries or death of any person, and damage to or destruction or loss of property, that may be claimed to have occurred on the Premises as a result of Lessee’s use thereof.

Lessee’s insurance shall be issued by an insurer licensed to do business in the State of California and shall contain a waiver of subrogation endorsement. Lessee shall deliver to Lessor certificates of such insurance coverage and evidence of payment of all premiums promptly upon demand by Lessor, which certificates shall show Lessor as an additional insured and shall provide that no cancellation, reduction in amount, or material change in coverage shall be effective until at least thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice to Lessor.

12. Assignment; Sublease. Lessee may assign this Lease and Lessee may sublease the Premises in whole or in part with Lessor’s written approval which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

13. Lessor’s Right of Access. Lessor and Lessor’s employees or agents, shall have the right to enter the Premises in a reasonable manner upon reasonable advance notice to Lessee to inspect the Premises or to conduct surveys, testing, or studies in connection with any engineering, design, financing, or permitting activities related to potential development of the Premises; provided, however, that no notice will be required in emergency circumstances where it is impractical to provide Lessee with advance notice. Lessor shall use reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption of Lessee’s activities.

14. Default. Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default:
a. Lessee fails to maintain at all times the insurance required by this Lease.
b. Lessee fails to comply with any agreement or requirement in this Lease for a period of thirty (30) days after notice from Lessor.

**DATE:** January 25, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**FROM:** Barbie Law, Assistant Chief-Fire Marshal  
**SUBJECT:** California Senate Bill 1205 Mandatory Inspections & Compliance Reporting and Resolution for CY 2023  

**TOPIC**  
Compliance with California Senate Bill 1205 California Health and Safety Code Section 13146.4 regarding mandatory inspection of public and private schools and certain residential occupancies for the calendar year 2023.  

**DISCUSSION**  
California Health & Safety Code Section 13145 specifies that the State Fire Marshal, the chief of any city, county, or city and county fire department or district providing fire protection services shall enforce in their respective areas building standards relating to fire and panic safety adopted by the State Fire Marshal and published in the California Building Standards Code and other regulations that have been formally adopted by the State Fire Marshal for the prevention of fire or for the protection of life and property against fire or panic.  

California Health & Safety Code Section 13146 identifies the responsibility for enforcement of building standards adopted by the State Fire Marshal and published in the California Building Standards Code relating to fire and panic safety and other regulations of the State Fire Marshal.  

California Health & Safety Code Section 13146.2 requires every city or county fire department or district providing fire protection services required by Sections 13145 and 13146 to enforce building standards adopted by the State Fire Marshal and other regulations of the State Fire Marshal to annually inspect all structures subject to subdivision (b) of Section 17921 for compliance with building standards and other regulations of the State Fire Marshal. Subdivision (b) of Section 17921 pertains to the rules and regulations for fire and panic safety in all hotels, motels, lodging houses, apartment houses and dwellings, buildings, and structures accessory thereto.  

California Health & Safety Code Section 13146.3 requires the chief of any city or county department or district providing fire protection services and authorized representatives to inspect every building used as a public or private school within the jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 13143, not less than once each year.

![Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+2)

In September of 2018, Senate Bill 1205 (SB 1205) added a new section to the California Health & Safety code which affected every city or county fire department or district required to perform the above-described inspections. The bill requires every fire department or district to report annually to its administering authority their compliance with the above-described annual inspection requirements.

Additionally, SB 1205 requires the administering authority to acknowledge receipt of the report in a resolution or a similar formal document. SB 1205 holds jurisdictional policy makers accountable to make progress on fire prevention resource requests, and ensures fire department funding allocations account for the longstanding needs of resource deficient fire prevention bureaus.

During Calendar year 2023, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District completed the annual inspection of 385 Group E occupancies, buildings, structures and/or facilities. This is a compliance rate of 100% for this reporting period. It should be noted that 37% of Group E occupancies were compliant with no violations noted during the inspection, while 63% of them required one or more re-inspections to resolve violations.

During Calendar year 2023, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District completed the annual inspection of 1878 Group R occupancies, buildings, structures and/or facilities. This is a compliance rate of 100% for this reporting period. It should be noted that 46% of Group R occupancies were found to be compliant with no violations noted during the inspection, while 54% of them required one or more re-inspections to resolve violations.

A focus of attention for the Board of Directors in future fiscal years should be augmenting staffing levels for Inspector I (code enforcement) to assist with the workload and to improve the percentage of occupancies found to be in compliance on the first inspection.

**RECOMMENDATION**

Pursuant to the requirements contained in SB 1205, staff recommends that the Board of Directors adopt a resolution acknowledging receipt of the annual report regarding the inspection of public and private schools and certain residential occupancies for the calendar year 2023.
