REPORTS

1. PRESIDENT’S REPORT - (President Goold)  
President Goold stated that he has been talking with Chief House and others on looking at a way to integrate our men and women in the military into our recruitment efforts in the future.

2. FIRE CHIEF'S REPORT — (Chief House)  
Good evening, President Goold, Directors, Colleagues, and Members of the Public.  
I want to highlight the exceptional work done by our members during the week of July 4th, especially considering the extreme heat in our area.  
- Sacramento Regional Fire/EMS communication center reported to us that the total amount of 911 calls for all of Sacramento on the 4th of July 2024 were 45% higher at 1,465 calls, a substantial rise from the 1,011 calls in 2023 our crews did outstanding work. Huge kudos to CRRD and all of our staff.  
- In addition, due to our focused efforts and drive on external engagement and relationships over the past year a pre-positioning request that Cal OES supported and funded. This included up-staffing our second helicopter, second dozer, a fully staffed

water tender with two personnel, an additional command officer (B12), and a fully staffed OES Type 3 engine from 0800 on July 1 through 0800 on Monday, July 8.

The resources provided through this preposition were beneficial to our operational area as a whole and had a substantial positive impact on Metro's community specifically.

**OPERATIONS REPORT** – (Deputy Chief Mitchell)

AC Keeley, B-Shift Commander, gave the Operations report for DC Mitchell and also highlighted the outstanding work done by our members over the July 4th holiday and week with excessive temperatures that started on July 1st. The resources provided by our relationships with Cal OES were instrumental in us maintaining coverage throughout the City and County during the peak call volume hours of the 4th of July. At one point, we had such a significant draw down in the region despite the fact that we implemented a new Dispatch level called “Grass Limited” response which sent just one Engine to the report of a grass fire. Typically, a grass fire would get a Battalion Chief and other resources ranging from Type 1 to Type 3 resources based on risk. At one point, he was informed by the communications center that the entire system only had one Type 1 engine remaining. We know July 4th is our super bowl week with excessive call volumes and as a District we are nimble and able to adjust. Today we are dealing with a structure fire and 112 degrees and a significant emergency at a mobile home park due to lack of power.

**ADMINISTRATIVE REPORT** – (Deputy Chief Bailey)

No Report

**SUPPORT SERVICES REPORT** – (Deputy Chief Wagaman)

No Report

3. **SMFD – FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL 522 REPORT** (Captain Sean Scollard, Local 522 Vice President)

Captain Scollard introduced Local 522 President Trevor Jamison who came to hear the General Obligation Bond Measure presentation. We need to be able to fix our fire stations so that we can respond to those extremely taxing days like July 4th. We are supportive of the measure and we need 100% support from the Board. We have to work together on this. President Goold responded stating that we as a Board are 100% in to seeing this measure be successful. We have to do this to maintain services and it is in the community's best interest. Sean Scollard stated this District is adaptable but Firefighters are not the type to ask for help, we are prideful. We don’t want to show the tiles falling off the walls at some of our stations and other living conditions. We must have the resources to support our members.

4. **COMMITTEE AND DELEGATE REPORTS**  
All Committee Meetings will be held at the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District Board Room, 10545 Armstrong Avenue, Mather, California unless otherwise specified.

**DATE:** August 8, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Purchase Approval – Purchase of Fire-Dex TECGEN51 Single-Layer Garments From Municipal Emergency Services for Metro Medic Program  

**TOPIC**  
Staff requests Board approval for the purchase of Fire-Dex TECGEN51 garments from Municipal Emergency Services, Inc. (MES) using Sourcewell agreement #010424-MES. These garments would be issued to all Metro Medic Program (MMP) members as well as establish a stock of garments during the 24-25 fiscal year.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The single-layer TECGEN51 garments are the front-line Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for MMP members, and are dual-certified to NFPA 1951 and 1977. This will be the third order of TECGEN51 garments. With this purchase, the Safety Division’s goal of having two sets of garments issued to each member, in addition to having a stock of replacement garments, will be fulfilled.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The Safety division identified the need for a specifically designed garment to protect the members of the MMP program. The Safety division, in collaboration with the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and PPE teams, worked to develop an EMS garment that provided protection while still looking professional and not increasing the risk for heat injuries. The PPE team reviewed products from fabric and garment manufacturers and conducted a wear-test, where garments from two of the garment manufacturers were tested in the field. The TECGEN51 garments from Fire-Dex proved to best meet the needs of the District. During fiscal year 23-24, the initial purchase of those garments was placed and the orders have begun to be delivered.  

This requested order will fully build out the MMP PPE program by providing MMP members with two sets of single-layer, dual-rated gear along with stock for replacements. Sourcewell cooperative agreement #010424-MES will be utilized to purchase these garments. Sourcewell is a State of Minnesota local government unit and service cooperative that facilitates competitive public solicitations and contract award processes for the benefit of its 50,000+ participating entities across the United States and Canada. Cooperative purchasing provides participating agencies increased administrative efficiencies and the  

**P10**  
Serving Sacramento and Placer Counties

![Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+2)

power of combined purchasing volume that results in overall cost savings. Purchasing has reviewed the documents from Sourcewell in relation to agreement #010424 and has confirmed the District may utilize this cooperative agreement.

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The proposed cost for the MMP single-layer, dual-rated PPE is $129,709.46. This cost is included in the District FY 2024/2025 Final Budget.

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff Recommends that the Board authorize the Purchase of Fire-Dex TECGEN51 garments from MES using Sourcewell agreement #010424-MES.

**DATE:** August 8, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Purchase Approval - Purchase of Storage Area Network (SAN) from Dell Marketing L.P.  

**TOPIC**  
Staff requests Board approval for the purchase of PowerStore SAN from Dell Marketing L.P. using NASPO ValuePoint master agreement #23026, participating addendum #7-23-70-55-01.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The SAN is used to store data for virtual servers, virtual PCs, email and user data. The District's current SAN will be end of life and end of support in October 2024.  

**DISCUSSION**  
The current SAN is almost end of life and needs to be replaced. This includes the primary SAN and the replication SAN at our Disaster Recovery site. With this purchase, storage capacity will be increased and will provide the District with room for data growth. Dell Marketing L.P. is offering the PowerStore off their cooperative agreement with NASPO ValuePoint. NASPO ValuePoint is a cooperative purchasing program that facilitates public procurement solicitations and agreements using a lead-state model. Cooperative purchasing provides participating agencies increased administrative efficiencies and the power of combined purchasing volume that results in overall cost savings. The State of California Participating Addendum to NASPO ValuePoint's contract #23026 confirms that this contract is available for use by California local governments.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Funding for the SAN is included in this fiscal year.  

| Provider | Product         | Cost        |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Dell     | PowerStore 500T | $ 167,628.54|

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends that the Board of Director's allow the District to procure the SAN from Dell Marketing L.P using the NASPO ValuePoint master agreement #23026, participating addendum #7-23-70-55-01.

**DATE:** August 8, 2024  

**TO:** Board of Directors  

**SUBJECT:** Disclosure of material expenditure – Excess General Liability Insurance – Vantage Risk Specialty Insurance Company for $284,776 and Westchester Surplus Lines Insurance Company for $199,137  

**TOPIC**  
Disclosure of material expenditure to purchase Excess General Liability Insurance for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025.  

**SUMMARY**  
The expenditure will be payable to both Vantage Risk Specialty Insurance Company for $284,776 and Westchester Surplus Lines Insurance Company for $199,137.  

**DISCUSSION**  
USI Insurance Services provided the District's insurance brokerage services this year and managed the marketing of the District's Excess General Liability Insurance. This type of coverage provides the District additional insurance coverage in the event of a catastrophic loss in excess of our general liability insurance retention. Several carriers were contacted during marketing to provide a quote for the District's Excess General Liability Insurance including Homesite Insurance Company and HDI Global Insurance Company, who all declined to quote.  

Metro Fire's Board of Directors voted in FY23/24 to switch our General Liability Insurance provider from Special District Risk Management Authority (SDRMA) to Fire Agencies Insurance Risk Authority (FAIRA). The aggregate or total insurance coverage for all agencies under SDRMA was $50 million, whereas FAIRA is $10 million. Because of this difference, USI Insurance Services recommended that the District purchase an Excess Policy to mitigate its overall risk should it suffer a catastrophic event in the future.  

The two companies which provided the District with quotes were Vantage Risk Specialty Insurance Company and Westchester Surplus Lines Insurance Company. Each of these companies will provide the District with a self-insured retention of $5 million. Vantage Risk Specialty Insurance Company will be the District's primary provider and in the event that this insurance coverage were exhausted, the secondary coverage with Westchester Surplus Lines Insurance Company would be utilized. Neither company was able to provide the full $10 million recommendation as a standalone policy which is why both companies are being recommended to carry the District's Excess General Liability Insurance needs.

**ADAM A. HOUSE**  
Fire Chief  

**DATE:** August 8, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** Contract Award Recommendation – Rapid Intervention Injury Management and Navigation Services  

**TOPIC**  
Request to approve a contract award to Ready Rebound, Inc. to provide rapid intervention injury management and navigation services to Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) employees, immediate family members of current employees, and retirees of the District.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The District encounters numerous and frequent on-the-job injuries and ensuring injured members receive timely treatment is essential to maintain District operations and member wellness. In an effort to hasten injured employees’ recovery and safe return to work in addition to reducing the District's workers' compensation related expenses, the District sought to find a firm capable of providing a service where injured members could receive assistance navigating the healthcare process. As they usher individuals through the process, this firm would be expected to aid in scheduling appointments with doctors, diagnostic testing services, physical therapy, and other medical needs with the goal of eliminating unnecessary appointments, reducing time to receive definitive care, and reducing time between appointments. The firm would also be required to work directly and collaboratively with the District's workers' compensation process, as well as injured individuals' insurance providers.  

**DISCUSSION**  
On July 11, 2024, staff issued Request for Proposals (RFP) 24-04 to solicit proposals from qualified firms to provide rapid intervention injury management and navigation services. The RFP notification was posted on the District's website, e-procurement portal (OpenGov), and PublicPurchase. Submissions were due July 23, 2024. The District received one response. This response was submitted by Ready Rebound, Inc. Their proposal was deemed responsive and was provided to an evaluation committee comprised of three Metro Fire employees for review. The proposal was reviewed individually by each committee member using the following criteria:  

- Qualifications and Experience with Providing Services of Similar Size, Scope, and Complexity  
- Program Understanding & Methodology  
- Past Performance  
- Conformance to Specified RFP Format  
- Fee Proposal  

**Serving Sacramento and Placer Counties**  
P50
<!-- Page 51 -->
![Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/983x768.png?text=Page+2)

Once each evaluation committee member completed their evaluation of the proposal, the committee and Purchasing met to discuss their scores. Based upon the scores, the evaluation committee unanimously agreed to recommend Ready Rebound, Inc. for contract award.

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
The term of the contract is for one year with the option to extend for up to two additional 12-month periods. The cost of the proposed services is based upon a rate of $399 per active sworn member, with the first year of service estimated at $248,179.00. This pricing remains the same if extended for a second year and third year. If approved, funding will be added to the District's FY 2024/25 Final Budget.

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends the Board adopt a resolution to approve a contract award to Ready Rebound Inc. and authorize the Fire Chief or his designee to execute and administer an agreement materially similar to the attached agreement.
