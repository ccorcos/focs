# OPERATIONS REPORT – (Deputy Chief Mitchell)

## Squad 53 Implementation
- Our call volume has grown exponentially over time, resulting in our members and apparatus becoming busier and busier.
- One way we have been able to adapt to the growth in demand for services is through implementation of the squad response model, and we have seen great success with this model.
- Fortunately, through consistent exploration of budget efficiencies and the work of multiple divisions, we have been able to find innovative and fiscally responsible ways to support our members in the field. This has resulted in our ability to deploy a 4th squad unit.
- I’m happy to announce to the Board tonight that through collaboration with a number of folks, Operations has determined that Squad 53 will be implemented as our 4th squad unit on or before September 4, 2024 as an additional first responder.
- We are not done. We still need more resources in the streets. We look forward to continuing adapting to the needs of our community, and pursuing innovative ways of delivering service to the public through the right resource, with the right capabilities, at the right time.

## 3. SMFD – FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL 522 REPORT (Captain Sean Scollard, Local 522 Vice President)
Captain Scollard thanked staff for their fantastic presentations tonight on the wellness front and we appreciate the collaboration on the health and wellness visits.

This is a result of the collaborative efforts between labor and management.
