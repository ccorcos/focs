Fire Chief  

**DATE:** July 11, 2024  
**TO:** Board of Directors  
**SUBJECT:** MIH Program Expansion Grant Award Acceptance – County of Sacramento  

---

**TOPIC**  
Request to accept a grant award from the County of Sacramento for the expansion of the Mobile Integrated Health (MIH) Program.  

**BACKGROUND**  
On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) was signed into law, whereby the County of Sacramento (County) received approximately $301.4 million from the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (SLFRF) for the purpose of responding to the economic and public health impacts of COVID-19. Since then, the County Board of Supervisors has continued to approve strategic investments of this funding to address identified priority issues.  

**DISCUSSION**  
On January 31, 2024, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District (District) submitted a request for funding to the County Department of Health Services (DHS) for the expansion of the District’s Mobile Integrated Health (MIH) Program in order to increase equitable access to appropriate patient-centered pre-hospital healthcare services for residents of Sacramento County, including those disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Proposed program expansion activities included expanding hours of operation, days of operation, and/or adding an additional unit, at the discretion of the District and in response to community need.  

On April 23, 2024, the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors approved an allocation of $1,100,000 in FY2021 SLFRF funding to the District for the expansion of the MIH Program. An additional funding allocation of $275,000 was approved by the County Board of Supervisors on June 11, 2024, utilizing funds from both the FY2021 SLFRF ($260,000) as well as the County's Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) Community Services Projects Fund ($15,000). In total, $1,375,000 has been allocated to the District with a period of performance from July 1, 2024 – December 31, 2026.  

**FISCAL IMPACT**  
Grant funding in the amount of $1,375,000 will be added to the FY2024/25 Preliminary Budget through the attached budget amendment. There is no match requirement. Any unspent funds at the end of the fiscal year will be budgeted in FY2025/26 for continued program activities.
