## REPORTS

### 1. PRESIDENT’S REPORT - 
**(President Goold)**  
President Goold stated that he has been talking with Chief House and others on looking at a way to integrate our men and women in the military into our recruitment efforts in the future.

### 2. FIRE CHIEF'S REPORT — 
**(Chief House)**  
Good evening, President Goold, Directors, Colleagues, and Members of the Public.  
I want to highlight the exceptional work done by our members during the week of July 4th, especially considering the extreme heat in our area.

- Sacramento Regional Fire/EMS communication center reported to us that the total amount of 911 calls for all of Sacramento on the 4th of July 2024 were 45% higher at 1,465 calls, a substantial rise from the 1,011 calls in 2023 our crews did outstanding work. Huge kudos to CRRD and all of our staff.

- In addition, due to our focused efforts and drive on external engagement and relationships over the past year a pre-positioning request that Cal OES supported and funded. This included up-staffing our second helicopter, second dozer, a fully staffed

water tender with two personnel, an additional command officer (B12), and a fully staffed OES Type 3 engine from 0800 on July 1 through 0800 on Monday, July 8.

The resources provided through this preposition were beneficial to our operational area as a whole and had a substantial positive impact on Metro's community specifically.

**OPERATIONS REPORT** – (Deputy Chief Mitchell)  
AC Keeley, B-Shift Commander, gave the Operations report for DC Mitchell and also highlighted the outstanding work done by our members over the July 4th holiday and week with excessive temperatures that started on July 1st. The resources by provided by our relationships with Cal OES were instrumental in us maintaining coverage throughout the City and County during the peak call volume hours of the 4th of July. At one point, we had such significant draw down in the region despite the fact that we implemented a new Dispatch level called “Grass Limited” response which sent just one Engine to the report of a grass fire. Typically, a grass fire would get a Battalion Chief and other resources ranging from Type 1 to Type 3 resources based on risk. At one point, he was informed by the communications center that the entire system only had one Type 1 engine remaining. We know July 4th is our super bowl week with excessive call volumes and as a District we are nimble and able to adjust. Today we are dealing with a structure fire and 112 degrees and a significant emergency at a mobile home park due to lack of power.

**ADMINISTRATIVE REPORT** – (Deputy Chief Bailey)  
No Report

**SUPPORT SERVICES REPORT** – (Deputy Chief Wagaman)  
No Report

3. **SMFD – FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL 522 REPORT** (Captain Sean Scollard, Local 522 Vice President)  
Captain Scollard introduced Local 522 President Trevor Jamison who came to hear the General Obligation Bond Measure presentation. We need to be able to fix our fire stations so that we can respond to those extremely taxing days like July 4th. We are supportive of the measure and we need 100% support from the Board. We have to work together on this. President Goold responded stating that we as a Board are 100% in to seeing this measure be successful. We have to do this to maintain services and it is in the community’s best interest. Sean Scollard stated this District is adaptable but firefighters are not the type to ask for help, we are prideful. We don’t want to show the tiles falling off the walls at some of our stations and other living conditions. We must have the resources to support our members.

All Committee Meetings will be held at the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District Board Room, 10545 Armstrong Avenue, Mather, California unless otherwise specified.
