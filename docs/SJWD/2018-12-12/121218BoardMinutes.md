## V. OLD BUSINESS
1. SSWD/SJWD Ad Hoc Committee Update (W & R)  
   Mr. Helliker reported that, at the committee meeting on October 3rd, the committee directed the general managers to meet with the other general managers who attended the meeting and expressed an interest in expanding the work and including other agencies. He reported that the general managers met twice and discussed the problem statements that were provided to the committee from the previous studies, along with working on the goals. He reviewed the problem statements, goals, and project tasks (proposed scope of work) with the Board.

   Mr. Helliker informed the Board that the problem statements, goals, and project tasks were reviewed by the committee on December 10th. He stated that the committee members were receptive to adding other participating agencies. He suggested that the scope of work be refined, then taken to each board for their defined interest and approval. He stated that then the boards could move forward to the analysis with all interested parties.

**Page 3**

President Hanneman commented that, at the committee meeting on the 10th, Mr. Helliker and Mr. Dan York reviewed the information with the committee and about ten attendees at the meeting. President Hanneman reminded the Board that SSWD Board did not accept the Phase 2a study and did not direct staff to move to the Phase 2b study. Director Costa commented that SSWD wanted to obtain input from the wholesale customer agencies and also review their study on water rights; however, SSWD never came back with information so that is why he inquired on the status. President Hanneman commented that now the two agencies are being more inclusive and are basically going back to square one in order to include all participants.

President Hanneman reported that the next meeting of the general managers will be January 8th then another committee meeting will be scheduled for February/March. Mr. Helliker commented that once the general managers have a well-defined scope of work then it will be reviewed by the committee before being taken to the boards. President Hanneman commented that the committee asked that the general managers from the other agencies obtain their boards’ interest in participating.

Director Miller would like to see more information regarding mutual water companies and cities versus water agencies, and whether they should stay on board or remove themselves from participation. President Hanneman responded that the committee asked the other agencies to obtain their board-level approvals for joining the effort by February/March.

Vice President Rich inquired when the financial benefit to customers will be addressed as that might encourage other agencies to be interested in this endeavor. President Hanneman commented that they first need to see who might be interested in the process then we can determine the financial benefit. Director Tobin commented that once they find it beneficial then they will probably join the process, but more information needs to be provided to them.

Director Costa commented that the District should not wait on any other plans with other agencies such as any transfer agreements. Director Rich commented that the District might want to consider funding the studies with some percentage from the water transfer revenues. Director Costa requested that Mr. Helliker conduct the same presentation at a future Board meeting that he presented to the committee. Mr. Helliker commented that the presentation consisted of two examples of recent consolidation efforts from two separate groups, and he will conduct that presentation at the next Board meeting.

**VI. NEW BUSINESS**

1. **2019 Board Officers**  
   President Hanneman announced that the Board needed to nominate a new President and Vice President for 2019. He thanked the Board for allowing him.

to serve as President in 2018, thanked Vice President Rich for his service, and thanked staff for their hard work as well.

President Hanneman moved to elect Dan Rich as Board President and Ted Costa as Board Vice President. Director Miller seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

2. General Manager Compensation  
President Hanneman requested that the Board consider a cash incentive award for the General Manager similar to the incentive awards that were recently approved for employees. He explained that the Personnel Committee discussed this and recommended that the full Board discuss awarding an incentive award. The Board discussed the performance warranting an incentive award and the timing of the award, and agreed that an award should be given to the General Manager at this time. In addition, President Hanneman confirmed that the Board will not be hiring a facilitator to conduct the General Manager’s evaluation this year.

Director Costa moved to approve a cash incentive award for General Manager in the amount of $5,000. President Hanneman seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

VII. INFORMATION ITEMS

1. GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT  
1.1 General Manager’s Monthly Report (W & R)

Mr. Helliker reported that Folsom Reservoir storage is down to 33% full and 69% of average (85% of the 15-year average).

He reported that the snow pack is at 94% of average statewide.

Mr. Helliker reported that Folsom’s wettest year on record was 2017 with the highest water storage level at just over 950,000 AF. He stated that currently the water storage level is at 326,000 AF and should start coming up.

Mr. Helliker informed the Board that the water transfer is finished after receiving the final numbers from the Department of Water Resources.

He commented that
<!-- Page 5 -->

there was a meeting this week to discuss how groundwater pumping can affect future transfers and what needs to be done to help assure the success of future water transfers.

Mr. Helliker reported that PCWA is interested in using some of the District’s capacity for the Placer Vineyards development in western Placer County. He explained that the next step will be to look at future demands so that there is a better idea of what the District can offer PCWA. He commented that PCWA would need 10 to 15 MGD and also a commensurate amount of capacity in the Cooperative Transmission Pipeline.

Mr. Helliker reported that the Public Information Committee will be reviewing the wholesale mailer on Friday and once finalized it will be mailed out.

Mr. Helliker reported that the SSWD completed their compensation study last week and their study showed that their salaries are at the bottom end of the range of the agencies that they surveyed; therefore, SSWD will allot approximately $500,000 in order to bring all pay scales to the median of the range. He informed the Board that the District’s compensation survey will start after the beginning of the year. He stated that Ms. Silva has already begun the process to obtain bids for the project. Director Tobin commented that, at the last JPIA Board meeting, she asked JPIA to consider pulling the salary data together for all the agencies to use as an additional resource. She commented that JPIA agreed to help pull data together for agencies requesting their help. Ms. Silva will look into receiving the data from JPIA.

**Conclusion:**
Water deliveries for the months of October and November were higher than budgeted. This improved the negative variance in deliveries from -11% as of October, to -3.4% and revenues from -8% to -4.8%. Due to issues with wells, both Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks were unable to pump the expected amount of groundwater in July, resulting in less surface water being transferred. This was NOT offset by a larger than anticipated sale of surface water. Water deliveries to the Retail Service Area, Orange Vale, City of Folsom and SSWD continue to track fairly close to the budget.

**AGENDA ITEM VIII-1-3**

**San Juan Water District**  
**December 12, 2018**

**Local Government November 27, 2018**

**Legislative update: Adam on Consolidation**

- **AB 2179** Gibson companion bill for consolidations, transfer and sales of water systems primarily for cities.
- **SB1215** Hertzberg, consolidation of sewer systems. ACWA provided a few comments to bill, took a neutral position.
- **AB2015** new process for state to consolidate small water systems. Allowed water board to consolidate 5 or more underperforming water agencies into one agency. ACWA supports, because it would not force this onto an agency that’s in good standing. $50M from the state for funding.
- **AB2501** Chu, builds on current authority to consolidate systems exports to domestic well. ACWA was neutral big was signed by the Governor.

ACWA was opposed and bills didn't pass.
- Granny Flats SB831, SB1469, AB2390 removed local governments to remove any fees associated with Granny Flats/residences. Not for Air B&B or rentals.
- Bills said that agencies cannot charge anything for these dwellings to water systems. ACWA was successful in negotiating for Water Agencies allowing them to charge for hookups and water service costs. These 3 bills will likely come back next year along with the water reserve policy.

**SB 998 Wendy Ridderbusch:**
- Water Service shutoffs (Dodd) Bill. Bill passed and signed by Gov. Brown. Issues with prop 218 and smaller agencies about the implementation. Bill doesn’t take effect until 2020. There will have to be tightening up and hasn’t taken focus away from the water tax issues which are still crafted to move forward. ACWA is preparing to troubleshoot as we move through implementation of this bill.

**Safe Drinking Water Proposal: Cindy Tuck**
- Water tax will be back and could be introduced very soon. ACWA is proactive and is suggesting a safe drinking water fund and safe drinking water trust. Infuse general fund money and infuse the drinking water fund because it’s a state problem and should be a state cost. Operation and maintenance costs. ACWA has a task force in this issue. Voter rejected Prop 6 (the gas tax), didn’t approve prop 3 (water bond). So ACWA is asking for help to reach out to legislators to direct them to block water agencies from being collectors of fees for the state. Prop 68 passed in June and has some funding for safe drinking water for disadvantaged communities.

**Property tax reserve policy discussion.** This came up in response from the little hoover commission but was successful in redirecting the scrutiny on handling reserves responsibly. The 2005 policy is being revisited and updated using member agencies as templates to use. Over the next year at the May meeting 2019 this committee will bring forward a final document. Meeting in Feb and April workshops will be done on the policy. A majority of the local government committee will be working with the finance committee on the reserve policy updates.

**Larry McKenney wants to suggest that this committee works on prevention of more disadvantaged communities and having LAFCO at the table.** Plan of action recommend policy on the creation of no more disadvantaged communities.

**Suggestion of developing a way to measure or self-assess drinking water agencies by means of technical, managerial and financial (TMF) survey on identifying disadvantaged or underperforming agencies might give us the numbers in terms of costs that we could use to support our agency positions with the State. This would be a good metric to identify what funds are needed to remedy the issue in defense of funding that the state says they need.**

**Abby Schnider talked about the clean water act.**  
She said there are two issues:  
1) EPA was supposed to put a national perchlorate standard but got a 6 month extension (so it could be above or below CALIFORNIA level?)  
2) Timeline questions. Wotus Act is the clean water act and was supposed to come out in the fall but, it’s still not here.  

Next meeting Jan 23-24, 2019

RWA Exec Comm Mtg Dec 5th, 2018

AUDIT: The firm of Gilbert Associates, Inc. has been retained to provide professional auditing services for RWA for a five year term. Received a clean audit with no adjustments.

RETIRE HEALTH BENEFITS: John Woodling, Executive Director, reported that the Executive Committee directed staff to evaluate alternatives that would lower the long term costs of providing health benefits to retirees. Participating in the CalPERS health program limits options and adds complexity. The Executive Committee asked for a breakdown of options including two classes of current retirees. He briefed the Executive Committee on available alternatives and requested direction for moving forward. Mr. Woodling presented options for reducing future retiree benefit liabilities and CalPERS limitations. In 2007 a different system was adopted by resolution that provided for employees serving 5 years at RWA with a total of between 10 and 20 years of CalPERS service, receiving 50% of the benefit at 10 years and 100% of the benefit at 20 years. Current employees are under the 2007 plan option. The objectives are to balance a reduction in long term costs and the ability to recruit and retain staff. There was discussion on the different options presented. There is flexibility in what is determined for benefits for new hires. It was suggested that it would be difficult to recruit and retain employees if benefits are decreased too much or if benefits are not competitive. Mr. Woodling asked if the Executive Committee wants to begin moving forward to implement a change and how a new benefit from the Tier 3 alternatives will be determined. If a change is determined there is a 60 day time frame between when we make our intentions known to CalPERS and the date the new plan is implemented. It was suggested that an action be taken to the full board presenting the minimum CalPERS payment with a health reimbursement arrangement that provides what we currently have. The retiree health benefits item will be brought back to the full board for their input before proceeding.

SUBCOMMITTEE UPDATES: The Conference Subcommittee is planning a Delta Update workshop event that will follow the November 8th RWA Board meeting. Speakers for the Delta Update include Jennifer Buckman, Jim Peifer, Ryan Bezerra and Tom Ghohring. A new topic is under discussion for the focus of a spring event. At the last Executive Committee meeting Pam Tobin, Membership Subcommittee chair requested Executive Committee members to reach out to contacts they may have with SACOG and report on contacts made to determine their interest in RWA membership. Chair Yasutake contacted Craig Locke, City of Woodland, who will make contact with the City Council about membership. Mr. Schubert will make contact with Rhonda Cordova and Mr. Peifer will make contact with Allison Jewell, so staff to Councilmember Scherer. Mr. Greenwood reported that Sacramento County Realtors are very interested in RWA membership. It was suggested that it would be helpful if someone reached out to SACOG’s Darren Steen. After the upcoming elections Mr. Greenwood will reach out to Pat Hume with the City Council for the City of Elk Grove. Nevada Irrigation District will also be contacted after the elections.

PROPOSED AQUIFER STORAGE AND RECOVERY FEASIBILITY STUDY CONSULTANT SELECTION: Rob Swartz, Manager of Technical Services, reported that several agencies have expressed an interest in developing a subscription-based project for a high-level feasibility study of employing aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) wells in the region. In order to develop a project agreement for the study, it is first necessary to identify a consultant with expertise in the construction and use of ASR wells to assist in scoping the work required to answer the questions of the potential study participants. On September 13th, staff released a request for qualifications (RFQ) by posting it on the RWA and SGA websites, sending an e-mail to individuals that subscribe to the RWA interest list for contracting opportunities, and by forwarding to the RWA members that are interested in the ASR study for further distribution. A copy of the RFQ was enclosed in the packet. The RFQs were due to RWA by October 12th. Two responses were received. Staff worked with staff from Citrus Heights Water District and the City of Sacramento to review the responses and have a summary of the results and recommendation for the Executive Committee to approve. A question to be answered by the study is where in the region are good places to put ASR wells recognizing physical, chemical and contaminant issues. Staff is looking for a high level reconnaissance study by the consultants with a focus of the study to identify the upfront associated costs. Depending on how this develops past the initial study, coordination of the legal aspects will need to be considered including water rights, contracts and settlement contracts in the region. Interested agencies at some point will have to determine if they want to get together to share costs to figure out the issues going forward or if they want to make decisions based on their agency needs. Staff is requesting approval of the consultant selection process at this time. Due to the unique nature of ASR, staff does not have a scope of work and budget to approve. However, the budget is not anticipated to be above the Executive Committee approval authority under RWA Policy 300.2. A scope of work and budget, and a subscription project agreement will be brought to the Executive Committee at an upcoming meeting for additional approvals, as applicable. Mr. Swartz distributed a memorandum documenting the results of the RFQ process. Two
<!-- Page 49 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
responses were received to the RFQ. One response was from a team consisting of staff of GEI, Wood Rodgers, and Stantec. The other response was from West Yost. These responses were evaluated by Rob Swartz of RWA, Brett Ewart of the City of Sacramento, and David Gordon of Citrus Heights Water District. After review of the RFQs, the reviewers reached a consensus that the GEI team had the strongest overall qualifications to perform the tasks identified in the RFQ. GEI demonstrated a very strong project manager, a very diverse and deep project team, and very good depth of experience in past projects of this nature. In particular, the GEI team possessed the most in-depth experience with local hydrology and groundwater quality, which are very important aspects for the high level nature of the proposed study. During the item, Chair Yasutake asked if there was any public comment. Mr. Duncan commented that he did not believe that the rates presented by West Yost were high when considering how staff would be used on the project. Mr. Swartz assured Mr. Duncan that the rates were not the key determinant in deciding on the GEI team selected through the RFQ process.

LANDSCAPE IMAGERY ANALYSIS PROPOSAL: The Sacramento region collectively purchased high resolution aerial imagery (delivery expected in Nov. 2018) to assist with local and regional planning efforts, including those associated with the recently passed SB 606 and AB 1668 legislation. Part of these new laws will require the calculation of water efficiency targets that will be based in part on the amount of irrigable landscaping in a water supplier’s service area. These landscape efficiency level (not assigned to any one customer/account) as one component of an agency’s overall water use objective or target. Water use targets are enforceable at the water agency level by the state beginning in 2023. To better understand the development of landscape budgets for water agencies, the region has shown interest in conducting further analysis of the aerial imagery to estimate the area of relevant irrigable and irrigated land. The state’s 2022 required deadline to adopt a similar landscape water budget methodology. Amy Talbot, Water Efficiency Program Manager, explained that Land IQ performed a high level landscape analysis of irrigated urban areas for RWA in August 2016. At RWA’s request Land IQ provided a successive scope of work on September 4, 2018 to perform an analysis of irrigated and irrigable landscape area for the urbanized areas within the RWA member service areas of Sutter, Placer, Sacramento, Yolo, and El Dorado counties. Mr. Wooding said he has heard from an RWA member and others in the region that provides this type of service. He proposes staff send out an RFQ or RFP to let additional vendors tell us how they could help us use the imagery we have to get the next step so that irrigable landscape area and the money is recommended pulling the action item at this time. Staff will come back with a selection for a consultant at a later date. Staff will get an RFP out by early November and should have the imagery results by then. Once the data is received it will give staff an understanding of our region that will inform us as regulations are developed.

Legislative & Regulatory Affairs Manager is Ryan Ojakian

WATER MARKETING STRATEGY PLAN: The RWA board authorized the Executive Director to sign a Memorandum of Agreement with non-Federal Partners to develop a Water Marketing Strategy Plan. When this plan was first coming together Shauna was leaving San Juan as Paul was newly coming on board. NID and the Bureau worked together to get the Grant request approved and for the purpose of the agreement Paul will be working with Ken Payne on an agreement to include San Juan in this plan as well. Because we’ve already done a water transfer we are central to the region and the agreement can be modified to include us and others.

PERSONNEL POLICIES UPDATE: RWA board approved RWA Personnel Rules Policy 400.1 Appendix C: Harassment and Retaliation Prevention: Appendix D: Drug Free Workplace; Appendix E: Workplace Violence; Appendix G: Health Reimbursement and Appendix H: Family Care Leave.

**GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM UPDATE:** Rob Swartz, Manager of Technical Services, provided an update on activities relevant to the groundwater management program including groundwater elevations in the basin. Groundwater substitution transfers occurring in the basin this year and some highlights on SGMA. Monitoring has increased in six wells to understand what was happening in the basin through the dry conditions. Monthly monitoring has been maintained in those wells following the end of drought conditions. He showed an overview of wells that are representative for the geographic areas. A history of the wells from January 2012 to the present included a USGS well, an inactive SWD production well, Chuck Wagon Park well near West El Camino Avenue, and two wells that SGA constructed on the American River with a Department of Water Resources grant. The data assists staff to understand the relationship between the groundwater basin and the surface water systems at these locations as flows and water elevations are monitored. Mr. Swartz then gave background on groundwater substitution transfers. Groundwater substitution transfers occur when an agency uses groundwater in place of existing surface water rights. The transferring agency demonstrates that groundwater is being extracted in excess of a baseline amount of use. A baseline is typically determined by operations in three previous normal years, and the typical conveyance window for transfers is July 1 through September 30. Transfers depend on state and federal conveyance systems having adequate capacity. Agencies that are involved in 2018 Groundwater Substitution Transfers include San Juan Water District, Fair Oaks Water District, Citrus Heights Water District, Carmichael Water District, City of Sacramento and Sacramento Suburban Water District. Mr. Woodling, Executive Director, noted that there are times when we have adequate surface water supplies and other parts of the state need water. If there is capacity to move water, it provides an opportunity to bring in dollars that help to build some of the facilities that are going to potentially serve us in the future. When there is a potential surface water shortage in the future, we will have facilities built to have more groundwater capacity. Through SGA we are managing and monitoring the basin to ensure we are not having negative impacts for those who aren’t participating in the transfers or harming ourselves in the long term because our groundwater basin is not healthy in the years we need it. After discussion it was agreed that a Groundwater Management Program Update will be presented at all future SGA Board meetings to include reports on the monitoring efforts and determine any drops in the wells and what the rate of recovery was. Prior to executing an agreement with the Department of Water Resources (DWR), SGA is required to file our initial notification to prepare a GSP. The GSP is intended to be a basic resource that will be available to the public that will provide information on the five Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSAs), including maps with a link to the individual GSAs.

**SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT (SGMA) UPDATE:** John Woodling reported that staff continues to track all aspects of the regulatory implementation of SGMA. One of the recent activities of DWR was the release of draft modifications to groundwater basin priority levels. The draft modification reduced the number of basins subject to GSP requirements, because there are small areas in the order of adjudicated basins that were dropped down to low priority. Some basins moved from low to medium because of water quality concerns. Recall that basins ranked high or medium are required to comply with SGMA, and compliance is voluntary for low and very low priority basins. The priority of the North American and neighboring basins did not change. Staff continues to stay engaged with ACWA and DWR. SGA has a strong voice in the legislation on SGMA including the regulations. DWR is still reviewing alternatives that were submitted as GSP alternatives.

**Legislative/Regulatory Update:** Staff is closely engaged with ACWA on legislation and regulatory changes that will promote and streamline groundwater recharge. An ACWA workgroup has held several meetings with State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) staff to pursue administrative changes that will make acquiring water for groundwater recharge easier. SWRCB staff recently provided a draft process for temporary water rights permits for consideration. AB 2649 (Arambula) would make statutory changes for temporary water rights permits. A working group of the ACWA State Legislative Committee developed amendments that allowed ACWA to take a “support if amended” position. AB 2649 makes some statutory changes for getting temporary water rights permits to recharge groundwater. We are trying to find the balance between getting water into the ground to reach groundwater sustainability and not impacting anyone’s surface water rights. Page 4 There has been an attempt to change the definition of water rights so that just taking surface water and recharging it into groundwater can be a beneficial use of water. In our area when we take surface water and replace groundwater (in lieu recharge), that is a direct beneficial use. SGA Outreach – SGA was formed 20 years ago in 1998. To celebrate this milestone, we will hold a luncheon event on October 18, 2018. The SGA Board meeting has been rescheduled to October 16th and will begin at 10:00 a.m. The 20th Anniversary event will follow at 11:30 a.m. at the North Ridge Country Club. SGA is engaged in other activities to mark this anniversary, including preparing and submitting an application for the Governor’s Environmental and Economic Leadership Award (GEELA), and sponsoring lunch at the

upcoming GRA Western Groundwater Congress. We are also planning to brief the boards/councils of the four JPA signatories; Sacramento, Folsom, Citrus Heights, and Sacramento County.

Human Resources Policy Updates – Pursuant to the management agreement between RWA and SGA, staff members are directly employed by RWA even when performing SGA work. While SGA has become a CalPERS contracting employer, we have maintained all other aspects of the RWA-SGA agreement. RWA has recently selected a human resources consultant, and will be conducting a number of activities over the next two years, including updating the employee manual, considering alternatives for retiree health insurance benefits, and focusing on succession planning. Mr. Woodling will keep the SGA Board informed of progress on these activities.

SGA Next Meeting is Thursday, December 13, 2018

**ACWA-JPIA**

JPIA's Chief Executive Officer, Andy Sells pointed out the goals and objectives for 2018 and the organization's progress on those goals.

* Research & Evaluate possibility of creating a Captive Insurance Company. The Captive Insurance Company would reinsure select risks of various JPIA programs. The captive will benefit all programs by providing an efficient and diverse risk transfer mechanism. The diversity created by co-mingling risks provides greater stability. In addition, assets held by the captive will be invested based upon the regulations of the domicile where the captive is located, which will afford the opportunity to increase investment earnings over time. The domicile selected is Utah.

* Research and evaluate possibility of creating and conducting Board training.

* Develop and conduct a Strategic Planning Session for Exec Committee and senior staff.

* Expand membership outreach.

* Present in 2019 for board of director's approval the implementation of the Captive Insurance Company.

* Finalize JPIA core values and integrate into future planning.

* Explore and expand use of technology to mine information and streamline processes in order to better serve the pool (i.e. upgrade website, expand existing reporting capabilities, research new technology and software).
