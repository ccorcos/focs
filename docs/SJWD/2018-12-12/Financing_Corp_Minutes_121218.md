### III. ACTION ITEMS
1. **Approve minutes of San Juan Suburban Water District Financing Corporation Meeting of December 13, 2017**

   Director Tobin moved to approve the minutes of the San Juan Suburban Water District Financing Corporation Meeting of December 13, 2017. Director Rich seconded the motion carried unanimously.

   In response to Director Costa’s question, the Board Secretary confirmed that the meeting minutes of the San Juan Suburban Water District Financing Corporation are complete and kept in the board meeting minute book which is located in her office.

2. **Other Business**

   Director Costa requested that the Board authorize the Board Secretary to sign the minutes immediately after they are complete and place them in the meeting book. Ms. Silva inquired if that were to happen then would an annual meeting be necessary. Mr. Horowitz responded that an annual meeting technically does not have to happen but stated that it is the better practice to have an annual meeting and not go years without having one. Director Costa commented that the bylaws state that there is an annual meeting and Mr. Horowitz explained that a motion could be passed to waive the annual meeting. Director Costa withdrew his request.

### IV. FUTURE MEETING DATE
The next annual meeting will be held on December 11, 2019.

### V. ADJOURN
There being no further business to come before the Financing Corporation, the meeting was adjourned at 6:03 p.m.
