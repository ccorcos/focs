### IV. OLD BUSINESS

1. **Incentive Award Program (W & R)**  
   Mr. Helliker provided the Board with a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He provided the background of the incentive award program and explained that the awards would be between $500 and $5,000. He stated that the awards would be available to employees who are consistently exceptional in their performance or who have ideas or actions that result in significant improvements in the District’s operations.

   Mr. Helliker informed the Board that authorization of up to $30,000 to apply towards the Incentive Award Program should cover the recommended recipients. He stated that this was reviewed with the Personnel Committee and they agreed with the recommendations. In response to Director Costa’s question, Ms. Silva explained that the incentive award is a one-time payment that will be subject to PERS, unless the employee falls under PEPR. In response to Director Rich’s questions, Mr. Helliker will research which agencies in the area participate in a similar program and informed the Board that it is at his discretion on who receives an award within the parameters set in the policy.

   President Hanneman moved to approve funding of the 2018 Incentive Award Program at a level not to exceed $30,000. Director Rich seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

### V. NEW BUSINESS

1. **General Manager’s Contract Amendment (W & R)**  
   Mr. Helliker provided the Board with a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained that there is a term in his contract that terminates the contract on March 6, 2019. He informed the Board that most general manager contracts in the area do not have terms since the contract can be
<!-- Page 6 -->
![Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=November+13%2C+2018%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+3)

terminated by the Board at any time. Therefore, he is requesting that Section 3 of the contract be deleted which will remove the term.

Director Costa suggested that a facilitator not be hired to conduct the General Manager’s evaluation and instead have Director Rich review the contract and return a recommendation to the Board. President Hanneman commented that the Personnel Committee can also take over this function.

Director Miller asked for clarification on the three items being discussed: evaluation, contract term, and contract review. President Hanneman stated that the deletion of Section 3 of the current contract is on the table, and that he will discuss the General Manager evaluation with Mr. Helliker in the next few weeks. President Hanneman stated that the Board will determine the evaluation process once a recommendation is brought forward. Director Tobin commented that the contract should be reviewed by the Personnel Committee. President Hanneman stated that the Personnel Committee had that discussion.

Director Costa moved to approve amendments to GM Contract. Director Rich seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

2. Grant of Easement and Right of Way (R)  
Mr. Watson informed the Board that the easement relates to the 10-lot subdivision project at Joe Rodgers. The District requested the easement from the developer in order to have dual feed for fire flow to the hydrant for the project. He explained that there is no cost to the District.

Director Tobin moved to accept a dedicated easement and right of way for a new pipeline installation to supply the Colinas Estates development, and authorize staff to accept and process the documents from the property owner. President Hanneman seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

3. Timothy H. Quinn Resolution (W & R)  
Mr. Helliker informed the Board that Mr. Timothy Quinn, ACWA Executive Director, is leaving at the end of the year and there will be a celebration in his honor at the ACWA Fall Conference. He explained that ACWA provided information that was used to draft the resolution and all the resolutions will be displayed at the event. Mr. Zlotnick commented that Mr. Quinn will be working with Water in the West at Stanford University.

Director Costa moved to adopt resolution 18-10 in honor of Timothy H. Quinn. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

VI. INFORMATION ITEMS

1. GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT  
   1.1 General Manager’s Monthly Report (W & R)  
   Mr. Helliker provided the Board with a written report for October which will be attached to the meeting minutes.  

   1.2 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence  
   Mr. Helliker reported that Folsom Reservoir storage is down to 37% full from 43% full and 74% of average; however, Reclamation shows Folsom at 96% of the 15-year average. He reported that precipitation is at 18% of average and snow water content will be reported in December.  

   Mr. Helliker reported that there were questions raised from DWR regarding the baseline pumping amounts used in the water transfer. He explained that DWR is questioning why the three most recent years were not used in the calculations. He explained that there is a good rationale as to why those numbers were not used and it was because Fair Oaks Water District pumped more water than normal in 2017, and in 2014 both Fair Oaks and Citrus Heights water districts were asked to pump more water during the drought.  

   Mr. Helliker informed the Board that, after the 2x2 meeting with PCWA, there was a meeting to discuss infrastructure. He explained that PCWA will have a need for additional treatment plant and transmission capacity in order to deliver water to the developments that are proposed to be developed west of Roseville over the next twenty years. He explained that PCWA would like to start discussions regarding how the District could provide them with treatment and transmission capacity for 10-15 MGD. He explained that District staff will look at projected demands and talk with the wholesale customer agencies regarding their demands as well.  

   Mr. Helliker announced that the Democrats have supermajorities in both houses of the legislature after the recent election. He commented that there will most likely be discussion at the ACWA Board meeting this week regarding the water tax debate and changing the position to offer a proposal to work with the State Water Board.  

   Mr. Helliker informed the Board that he and Mr. Zlotnick attended the PPIC Priorities for the Next Governor meeting today. Mr. Zlotnick commented that it was a general policy brief and meetings with the Governor-elect will be scheduled.  

   Mr. Helliker reported that he sent an email to the Board regarding the comments that were put together regarding the annual report. He commented that the agencies that worked together on the comments

![November 13, 2018, Board Minutes Page 5](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=November+13%2C+2018%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+5)

decided not to provide information in the annual report on items over which the State Water Board does not have regulatory authority.

Mr. Helliker informed the Board that Lucy & Company (formerly Crocker & Crocker) created the “From Source to Tap” info-graphic that will be placed on the District’s website. In addition, a wholesale e-blast will be sent out shortly and a copy of that will be forwarded to the Board.

Mr. Helliker reported that Governor Brown and Governor-elect Newsom wrote a joint letter to the State Water Board asking them to delay their vote on the Water Quality Control Plan until December 12th. He informed the Board that he will be attending a meeting with Reclamation on Friday to have more discussions regarding a voluntary agreement.

Mr. Helliker informed the Board that the December 12th Board meeting will include election of the Board officers. In addition, the Financing Corporation’s annual meeting will be held just prior to the Board meeting at 6:00 pm.

2. DIRECTOR OF FINANCE’S REPORT

2.1 Update on Implementation of Approved Five-Year Rate Schedule (W & R)  
Ms. Silva reported that, when the 5-year rate plan was approved, one caveat was for staff to report annually on the possibility of a rate decrease. She explained that the Board did talk about this during the budget adoption this year and about the District’s plan for achieving pay-as-you-go funding. She reported that the Board’s decision at that time was to continue with the previously approved financial plan.

Ms. Silva reported that San Juan Wholesale is ahead of the financial plan, and those funds should be allocated to the Hinkle Reservoir project, and there should be no changes to the rates at this time. Director Costa inquired if the Financial Plan was based on achieving full pay-as-you-go funding. Ms. Silva explained that the financial plan was designed to fund the five-year CIP with the exception of the Hinkle and Kokila Reservoir projects, which were to be debt financed. She explained that the excess $5.9 million in wholesale will reduce the amount to be financed which should save the District $1.5 to $2 million in interest costs over the life of the financing.

Mr. Helliker commented that the District will be updating the wholesale and retail master plans, which will provide a better analysis on future capital expenses, and will help answer Director Costa’s question in about a year. In response to Director Rich’s question, Ms. Silva informed the Board that the capital facility fee study has been started. She explained that for this study, the consultant is recommending that the District continue with the buy-in methodology, which is a reimbursement of past expenditures, and
<!-- Page 9 -->
![Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=November+13%2C+2018%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+6)

1. **WIFA Financing Update**
   - Mr. Silva reported that the District received an invitation to apply for WIFA financing, which is required if the District should proceed with WIFA financing. He informed the Board that there is a $100,000 application fee. Staff is working on the application to the State Revolving Fund (SRF). The District provides a 20% match for the clean water SRF, but it is still being determined if the same applies to the drinking water SRF.

2. **Comments on WIFA Financing**
   - Mr. Helliker commented that once an applicant receives the invitation to apply for WIFA financing, they will most likely obtain the loan. A decision will need to be made on whether or not to apply. Ms. Silva mentioned that WIFA financing only covers 49% of the project cost, with a minimum project cost of $20 million. Mr. Zlotnick noted that if the District project comes in under $20 million and the original estimate was made in good faith, WIFA funding would still be available.

3. **Application Deadline**
   - Ms. Silva informed the Board that the District has a year to apply for the WIFA financing, which is due on October 30, 2019. Staff is preparing the application for the SRF financing for 100% of the project cost.

4. **OPEB Trust Returns**
   - Ms. Silva reported that the OPEB Trust, since inception on June 1, 2007, has had a gross return of 4.91%, which is better than the District investment portfolio.

5. **Miscellaneous District Issues**
   - In response to President Hanneman’s question, Ms. Silva informed the Board that there is an open recruitment for the Customer Service position, which closes on December 3rd.

6. **Operation Manager’s Report**
   - There were no other matters discussed.

7. **Legal Counsel’s Report**
   - No report.

8. **Directors’ Reports**

**Conclusion:**
Water deliveries for the months of October and November were higher than budgeted. This improved the negative variance in deliveries from -11% as of October, to -3.4% and revenues from -8% to -4.8%. Due to issues with wells, both Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks were unable to pump the expected amount of groundwater in July, resulting in less surface water being transferred. This was NOT offset by a larger than anticipated sale of surface water. Water deliveries to the Retail Service Area, Orange Vale, City of Folsom and SSWD continue to track fairly close to the budget.
