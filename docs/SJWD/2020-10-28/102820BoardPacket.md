2. **Collaboration/Integration Project and Potential San Juan Retail Agency (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker provided the Board with a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained that the project is ongoing, with the ad hoc
<!-- Page 7 -->
![September 23, 2020, Board Minutes Page 3](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+not+available) 

committee briefed on the report last month and comments submitted to the consultant in August. The managers are meeting on September 24th to review the input that the consultant received.

GM Helliker reviewed the timeline to date and explained that the previous 2x2 committee was placed in a dormant status in 2019 so that the Collaboration/Integration Project could move forward. In addition, he explained that there are no discussions with Sacramento Suburban Water District regarding merger at this time. The Board discussed the timeline of the current study and GM Helliker informed the Board that the consultant is on schedule with the study.

GM Helliker provided information from Sacramento and Placer LAFCo regarding the topic of creating a separate retail agency which is included in his staff report. President Costa commented that customers should initiate this process and if enough signatures are collected for the petition, then the Board should consider this at that time. Ms. Buckman informed the Board that this is a legal process and recommended that it not be considered until after the transition to division-based elections process is complete.

3. Regional Water Bank Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed the North American sub-basin map which shows the five GSAs along with the water depth contours of the groundwater basin. He explained that there is approximately two million acres of storage available in this basin. In addition, he stated that the region is very capable of banking groundwater through various methods such as use of surface water instead of groundwater or through the use of injection using aquifer storage and recovery wells.

GM Helliker informed the Board that there is approximately 389,147 acre-feet of water banked in the SGA Central Area. In addition, he reviewed the water bank development phases and explained that phase 1 is complete and the region is entering phase 2. He explained that phase 2 focuses on getting the groundwater bank acknowledged by the federal government, which would allow the District to store its CVP water, as well as the region being able to bank and deliver CVP water supplies from other agencies. He explained that Reclamation established groundwater banking guidelines in 2019 to incentivize and facilitate the use of groundwater banks to store CVP water on a multiple year basis.

GM Helliker reported that $90,000 of the $500,000 was not spent in Phase 1 and will be applied to Phase 2. He explained that the District’s portion was 6% ($25,000) for Phase 1.

GM Helliker informed the Board that there is still a lot of information and analysis that needs to be completed in order to have a fully operational groundwater bank. He reviewed the Phase 2 activities which covers a two to three year period with an approximate cost of $1.2 million for the region. He estimates that the District’s share will be $72,000 - $90,000 over the next few.

   1.2 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence  
   GM Helliker provided a hydrology report on current conditions. He reported that Folsom Reservoir is 45% full with storage at about 77% of average. He informed the Board that a group is working on conserved water transfers and they will meet with the consultant in November with the goal to establish a new transfer mechanism that is included in the white paper.  

   GM Helliker reported that a group of agencies are meeting with state water board members to discuss water loss issues. The group is educating the state water board members regarding the effects of their proposed water loss regulations, which would, if adopted, result in the District being required to meet a 70% reduction in real loss.  

   GM Helliker reported that RWA has offered to manage the work on the water quality control plan and the major project subscription program agreement was approved at the RWA, which will be brought to the Board for review and approval in October.

## II. PUBLIC HEARING

1. **Transition to Division-Based Elections (W & R) – Transition to Division-Based Elections - Public Hearing #4:**
   President Costa opened the Public Hearing at 6:02 pm. The Board Secretary confirmed that the notice of this item was duly posted and published. The Board Secretary also noted that one joint comment letter from Citrus Heights Water District and Fair Oaks Water District had been received prior to this public hearing. In response to President Costa’s question regarding the CHWD/FOWD joint letter from the previous public hearing in September, the Board Secretary confirmed that there was no map attached to that prior comment letter.

   Ms. Buckman prepared a staff report for the meeting and a copy will be attached to the meeting minutes. She reported that an alternative map was never received from CHWD/FOWD as mentioned. In addition, she pointed out that the most recent joint comment letter from CHWD/FOWD contained some errors which stated that the demographer was calculating household density instead of total population per square mile. Ms. Buckman confirmed with the demographer that this assertion from CHWD/FOWD is incorrect. In addition, CHWD/FOWD took issue with the lines on the proposed map following the rural/urban divide. She explained that the rural/urban lines were based in part on adjustments for contiguity and to make the divisions have reasonably equal populations. Ms. Buckman also explained that the eastern Granite Bay boundary was drawn to keep the Johnson Ranch community together.

   Ms. Buckman reported that the Board has identified its reasons for selecting the boundaries and disagreement with those boundaries, in and of itself, is not a basis for invalidating them. In addition, she mentioned that the comment letter suggested, without evidence, that the intent of the Board was to protect the incumbent seats. She reported that there is no evidence in the record to support that statement and unsupported opinions do not constitute substantial evidence and need not be considered by the Board. Furthermore, she informed the Board that the CHWD/FOWD comment letter from October 8th included a map with the purported addresses of the incumbent directors, but she has not verified the accuracy of those addresses since the Board did not and is not taking that information into consideration in drawing the maps.

   Ms. Buckman informed the Board that this is the fourth and final public hearing for transitioning to division-based elections. She reported that the revisions that the Board made at the last meeting to the map have been completed and the map was attached to the staff report and both it and the proposed sequence of election by division were published seven days prior to the hearing as required by the Election Code. In addition, she explained that the ordinance was included in the Board packet as well and the introduction and waiving of the first reading of that ordinance is the recommended action for the Board to take at this meeting. She explained that the ordinance will provide for election of directors by division, establish the boundaries and identification number of each electoral division, and establish the order of election for each division. The ordinance will then be

![October 14, 2020, Board Minutes Page 3](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=October+14,+2020,+Board+Minutes+Page+3)

presented to the Board for adoption at the November 9, 2020 regular Board meeting.

President Costa opened the floor for public comment.

Ms. Amber Beckler addressed the Board and stated that she agrees with the map that the Board selected as it preserves communities of interest and representation.

Mr. Mike McRae addressed the Board and stated that he feels the map will bring long-term disharmony to the San Juan family. He stated his opinion that the primary community of interest is the retail water agencies and the map splits up the representation. He voiced concern regarding the size of the Placer County area and its representation. He asked the Board to reconsider its position and the long-term effects.

Mr. Ray Riehle addressed the Board and stated that CHWD has submitted four comment letters and he doesn’t see the rationale on the map selected by the Board based on the communities of interest, though he acknowledged that he had not attended some of the hearings and workshops and might have missed some of the explanation. He stated that he understood the Board's action met the legal standards but he felt it did not meet the spirit of the law. He also indicated he did not feel the Board considered the comments from CHWD/FOWD appropriately in this process. He pointed out that CHWD's boundaries could allow it to seat directors in 4 of the 5 divisions.

Ms. Sandy Harris addressed the Board and stated that she agrees with Ms. Beckler’s comment in support of the proposed map and that the Granite Bay Community Association also supports the decision of the Board.

President Costa closed the Public Hearing at 6:17 pm.

President Costa commented that he feels the Board kept the cities compact, the counties together as much as possible, and the community associations together.

III. NEW BUSINESS
1. Introduction of Ordinance 20-02 (W & R)  
President Costa stated that Ms. Buckman reviewed the ordinance in the previous agenda item.

Vice President Tobin moved to Introduce and Waive First Reading of Ordinance No. 20-02 – An Ordinance of the Board of Directors of the San Juan Water District Providing for the Election of Directors by Division, Establishing the Boundaries and Identification Number of Each Electoral Division, and Establishing the Order of Election For Each Division. Director Rich seconded the motion and it carried with the following roll call vote:

# AGENDA ITEM III-3

**STAFF REPORT**

To: Board of Directors  
From: Adam Larsen, Field Services Manager  
Date: October 28, 2020  
Subject: Authorization and approval of Amendment #1 to the Annual Installation Services contract for FY 2020/21  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Authorization and approval of Amendment #1 to the Annual Installation Services agreement with Flowline Contractors Inc. for FY2020/21, net increase $277,462. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Engineering Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
On June 24, 2020, the Board approved a contract with Flowline Contractors Inc. in the amount of $297,538 for work during FY 2020/21. The contractors work complements the District’s Field Services staff and provides an additional resource for installation projects. The District is requesting amendment #1 for additional budgeted capital work; that includes ARV and Hydrant installations. The current contract is valid through June 30, 2021.

The following detail summarizes the current agreement and proposed additions:

| Contract/Amendment | Date       | Total      | Duration  | Completion Date |
|---------------------|------------|------------|-----------|------------------|
| Original Contract    | 7/1/2020   | $297,538   | 365 Days  | 6/30/2021        |
| Amendment 1         | 10/28/2020 | $277,462   | 0         | 6/30/2021        |
| Proposed Revised Contract |        | $575,000   | 365 Days  | 6/30/2021        |

Flowline Construction Inc.’s installation work has been good to date and supportive of our schedules. They have also provided us with some additional savings on fire hydrant installations.

Staff is requesting Board authorization and approval to increase the contract by $277,462 to meet the additional installation requirements; the revised contract total for FY 2020/21 will be $575,000 after Board review and approval.

---

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
This additional work is forecasted and included in the FY2020/21 retail operations budget and CIP retail budget.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Greg Zlotnick  
Water Resources Manager  
**Date:** October 28, 2020  
**Subject:** 2020 Urban Water Management Plan Update  

**Recommended Action**  
Recommend Board approval of contracting with Tully & Young/Zanjero for completion of the District’s state mandated 2020 Urban Water Management Plan update. The not-to-exceed amount for the District’s share of the project is $53,240. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Urban Water Management/Water Transfer Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.

**Background**  
Based upon previously positive conversations between District staff and Wholesale Customer Agency (WCA) staff as far back as last year and again in April of this year, the District, as legally permitted for a wholesale agency to undertake to promote efficiency and cost savings, was looking forward to managing the state mandated 2020 Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) update effort for ourselves and on behalf of the WCAs through a shared-cost collaboration.

However, when the draft RFP was distributed to the WCAs for their review, Citrus Heights Water District and Fair Oaks Water District informed staff they were not interested in pursuing a joint, collaborative approach.

The City of Folsom, because it has to do its own UWMP update to cover their non-Ashland areas, was always expected to do its own document. Still, the City confirmed it will use the data developed in the 25-year demand study the District completed earlier this year to maintain consistency in its UWMP update with regard to analyses of future Ashland demands.

Orange Vale Water Company (OVWC) did decide to join the District in the UWMP effort.

On August 31, 2020 staff posted to the District web page, and emailed 13 consulting firms, a Request for Proposals (RFP) for professional engineering services to complete the 2020 Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) update.

The 2020 UWMP update must be adopted by agency Boards and submitted to the Department of Water Resources by July 1, 2021. The absolute due date for District receipt of the 2020 UWMP Update document is June 1, 2021.

The RFP specified that the consultant will provide distinct and separate 2020 UWMP Update documents to the District and OVWC.

A pre-proposal go-to-meeting conference was held on September 23, 2020. Additional information regarding the project was provided to the attending consultants and questions were received and answered. Those Q&As were posted to the web page. Two consultants attended the pre-proposal conference.

A proposal was received prior to the due date from the following firm:

- Tully & Young/Zanjero

In addition, two firms who received the RFP informed staff that they were not submitting because of a lack of bandwidth.

Per the instructions in the RFP, the proposal was submitted in two separate files consisting of a Technical Proposal and a Cost Proposal. Staff reviewed the Technical Proposal for its project understanding, work plan, description of experience and qualifications, proposed project schedule, and other project-specific criteria. Staff believes the proposal is satisfactory with regard to substantive capabilities and experience, as well as reasonable from a not-to-exceed cost basis.

As a result of prior work done for the District and consequent comfort and familiarity with Tully & Young/Zanjero, an interview was not considered to be necessary.

Staff recommends the Committee recommend to the Board that it accept the Tully & Young/Zanjero proposal and that the District engage them to complete the District’s 2020 UWMP update.

OWVC has communicated its acceptance of the proposal and the not-to-exceed cost estimate for the work attributable to its 2020 UWMP update.

**Budget Impact**

The proposal’s not-to-exceed cost estimate for completing the District’s 2020 UWMP Update is $4200 over the $49,000 estimate included in the FY 20/21 budget (currently all of which is listed in the wholesale budget, but which will be split 50% to wholesale and 50% to retail). However, as the $53,240 is a not-to-exceed amount, the final charge may or may not exceed the budgeted $49,000.

OWVC will pay for costs solely attributable to the update of its UWMP. The proposal’s not-to-exceed cost estimate for that portion of the project is $29,710.

# AGENDA ITEM V-1

## STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** October 28, 2020  
**Subject:** SJWD Board Policy Updates  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Staff recommends a motion to repeal General Policy ADM-3.2 Consultant/Professional Services Selection.

Staff recommends a second motion to amend Policy ADM-3.1 Claims Processing Policy.

### BACKGROUND
The SJWD Board Policies are designed to record policies adopted by the Board of Directors of San Juan Water District. The policies are periodically reviewed and amended as needed.

### CURRENT STATUS
In 2019, staff began reformatting and amending the legacy District Policies originally adopted in 2003 and amended in 2011, and is working to ensure that the amended and restated Board Policies accurately reflect the Board’s policy direction and applicable legal requirements. During this process, staff determined that some of the policies in the legacy District Policies manual should not be amended and readopted as part of the new Board Policies. Many of these were repealed at the August 19, 2020, Board meeting. Staff continues to work through the remaining policies and determine if they need to be updated or repealed.

Policy ADM-3.2, Consultant/Professional Services Selection, should be repealed because the content is substantially covered in the updated FIN-5.7 Procurement Policy, which is part of the new Board Policies series. In general Policy ADM-3.2 states that the procurement of consulting and professional services for the San Juan Water District will be on the basis of documented competence and qualifications for the types of services to be performed, rather than strictly on the lowest price. This is covered in Section 5.B(v) of FIN-5.7 Procurement Policy. As such, staff recommends repealing Policy ADM-3.2 Consultant/Professional Services Selection.

Policy ADM-3.2, Claims Processing Policy, is a legacy policy adopted in the 2003 District Policies manual and is in need of a complete overhaul. The processing of claims against the District is governed by California Government Claims Act, Government Code sections 810 through 998.3. The current policy was adopted 17 years ago and focuses on the administrative processing of a small claim. Current
<!-- Page 23 -->

**October 28, 2020**

claims processing practices used by management now follow the process requested by the District’s insurance provider, ACWA-JPIA, rather than by the existing policy.

The proposed policy complies with the Government Claims Act requirements and the process recommended by ACWA-JPIA. The proposed policy requires the Board of Directors to consider all claims greater than $50,000 for property damage and claims for bodily injury of any amount for rejection or approval.

**Policy**: ADM-3.2 Consultant/Professional Services Selection Policy  
**Approval Date**: 10/23/03  
**Latest Revision**:  

### ADM-3.2 Consultant/Professional Services Selection Policy

The procurement of consulting and professional services for the San Juan Water District will be on the basis of documented competence and qualifications for the types of services to be performed, and at a fair, competitive and reasonable price.

For the purposes of this policy, the term “consulting and professional services” means any specialized services performed by firms or persons who are qualified, by education, experience, licenses or certification in a particular field. Types of services may include, but are not limited to: engineering, environmental, information technology, financial, public relations, legal, and human resources.

For consulting and professional services for a District project that would cost less than $50,000, which cost is included in the current District budget and follows policy direction from the board, the General Manager is authorized to determine an appropriate process for selection of the consultant, and to execute the consulting agreement on behalf of the District. Consulting and professional services that would cost more than $50,000 will be obtained by a competitive proposal process by issuance of a Request for Proposals or the issuance of a Request for Qualifications, as determined by the General Manager, and would require approval of the Board of Directors. The General Manager will recommend to the Board of Directors selection based on documented competence and qualifications for the types of services to be performed, and at a fair, competitive and reasonable price, and not based solely on the lowest-cost proposal submitted. The Board of Directors may waive or amend this policy at any time, and may waive the competitive proposal process in cases where a consulting firm has satisfactorily performed the previous stage of a project, has acquired extensive background and working knowledge of the work to be performed, is a highly-recognized authority in the field or area of work to be performed, or is the only-known available highly-recognized authority.

A written description of the selection process, including selection rationale, list of firms on a selection short-list, basis of selection and determination of project fee/cost will be submitted by the General Manager to the Board of Directors with each contracting recommendation.

**Approval Date**: 10/23/03  
**Latest Revision**: 08/23/17  

# FIN-5.7 Procurement Policy

## Section 1. Purpose and Authority.
The purpose of this policy is to establish regulations and procedures governing District purchases of supplies and equipment, approval of contracts, and other expenditures. This policy is adopted pursuant to Government Code sections 54202 and 54204, Public Contract Code sections 20680 to 20683, and other applicable law.

## Section 2. Definitions.

A. **“Emergency”** means a sudden, unexpected occurrence or incident that poses a clear and imminent danger or threat, requiring immediate action to prevent or mitigate the loss or impairment of life, health, property, or essential public services.

B. **“Expenditure”** means any District expenditure, payment, purchase, contract or lease relating to a District expense or cost item, including, but not necessarily limited to, the purchase of Supplies; professional, consultant or service contracts; equipment service, maintenance or repair contracts; utility service accounts and contracts; procurement of insurance and bonds; purchase of fuel, oil or other vehicle maintenance supplies; and Public Works contracts.

C. **“Lowest Responsible Bidder”** means the bidder that timely submits a complete and fully responsive bid and that best responds in price, quality, service, fitness and capacity to meet the particular bid requirements. Price alone will not be the determinative factor, but will be considered along with other relevant bidder responsibility factors such as bidder reputation, qualifications and experience, ability of the bidder to deliver, quality of the Supplies, and availability of parts or service.

D. **“Public Works”** means the construction, alteration, reconstruction, installation or repair of District improvements, facilities, buildings or structures.

E. **“Supplies”** means supplies, materials, equipment, and merchandise, including vehicles, computers, other machines, equipment parts, office supplies, chemicals, tools, and furniture.

**FIN-5.7 Procurement Policy**

<!-- Page 26 -->
![Page 2](https://example.com/image.png)

**Section 3. Applicability.**  
This policy applies to District purchases of Supplies, approval of Public Works contracts and other contracts, and approval of other expenditures.

**Section 4. General Manager Duties.**  
The District General Manager shall have responsibility and authority in connection with purchasing Supplies, approving Public Works and other contracts, and approving other Expenditures in accordance with this policy. The General Manager may delegate to other District officers or employees the authority to make purchases, approve contracts and perform other duties in accordance with this policy. The General Manager may adopt rules and procedures to implement and supplement these regulations so long as they are consistent with this policy.

**Section 5. Expenditures Other Than Public Works Less Than $50,000; General Manager Approval.**

A. **Comparative Pricing Generally.**  
For an Expenditure of estimated value less than $50,000 for which there are unappropriated funds available in the current approved District budget for the item, the General Manager may make the Expenditure on the open market or through the Internet by seeking the most favorable terms and price either through negotiation, comparative pricing or informal competitive bidding, whichever method the General Manager deems most appropriate in the circumstances. The General Manager may approve the Expenditure through a written invoice, purchase order, contract, or other appropriate bidding method.

B. **Exceptions.**  
Negotiation, comparative pricing or informal competitive bidding is not required for an Expenditure in the following situations:

(i) The amount of the Expenditure is less than $1,000;  
(ii) The General Manager determines that the Supplies can be obtained reasonably and efficiently only from one vendor or supplier;  
(iii) The General Manager determines that it is strongly preferred for efficient operations that the Supplies be of a particular model, brand or make in order to match and be compatible with the model, brand or make of existing in-use equipment or facility;  
(iv) The Supplies are to be purchased through or from the State of California or other federal, state or local government group sale program;  
(v) Professional service (e.g., architect, engineer, accountant, attorney, or environmental consultant) contracts;  
(vi) The General Manager determines that the nature of the Expenditure is such that competitive proposals would not produce an advantage and negotiation, comparative pricing or informal competitive bidding therefore would be undesirable, impractical, unattainable, unfeasible or impossible;  
(vii) An Emergency under section 9.

**Section 6. Expenditures Other than Public Works Over $50,000; District Board Approval.**  
For an Expenditure of estimated value over $50,000 not involving Public Works or an Expenditure of any amount for which there are not unappropriated funds within the current approved District budget, the Expenditure must be authorized by the Board (except for an Emergency under section 8). The General Manager will present an Expenditure recommendation to the Board after seeking the most favorable terms and price either through negotiation, comparative pricing or informal competitive bidding.

**Approval Date**: 10/23/03  
**Latest Revision**:  

# ADM-3.1 Claims Processing Policy

All liability claims made against the District will be investigated and settled fairly and expeditiously where legal liability is determined. Decisions regarding the disposition of a claim will be based on the merits of the claim.

In the course of District operations damage to land and improvements thereon occasionally occurs due to the proximity of District facilities to the private property. When District employees are aware that property has been damaged in the course of their work, restorative measures are to be taken to return the property as close to its original condition as possible.

When a property owner informs a District employee of damage to their property, the employee receiving the claim will document in writing the time and date, and a description of the stated circumstances and allegations. Employees should respond to questions, be cordial and respectful, but refrain from commenting on liability questions.

As soon as possible after information about the damage has been received, it will be given to the department manager, who will notify the General Manager. If the owner of damaged property informs a member of the Board of Directors, the information will be given to the General Manager. Directors should not independently investigate claims.

If the investigating staff person is convinced that the damage was caused by District personnel, equipment or infrastructure, he/she will prepare a work order to have the damage repaired, subject to the following conditions:
- Property owner agrees that the proposed repairs are appropriate and adequate;
- Property owner agrees to allow the District personnel or subcontractor access to their property to perform the repair work;
- District personnel or subcontractors have the necessary tools, equipment, and expertise to perform the necessary work;
- Repair work can be accomplished within a reasonable amount of time; and
- Cost of labor and material for the repairs will not exceed $500.

<!-- Page 30 -->
![Page 2 of ADM-3.1 Claims Processing Policy](https://example.com/image.png)

If the cost of the job for repairs is stated by claimant or estimated by staff to exceed $500, the owner will be asked to submit their claim in writing on a District claim form. The General Manager will review the damage claim and the proposed work. If he/she determines that the damage is the District’s responsibility and that the proposed repair work is appropriate, he/she may authorize the work if the cost of the job will not exceed $1,500. If the cost exceeds $1,500, the claim will be submitted to the Board of Directors for consideration. If the Board of Directors elects to submit the claim to the District’s liability insurance carrier, the General Manager or his/her designee will report the claim to the District’s liability insurance carrier in accordance with claims reporting procedures set forth by the insurance carrier.

### 3.1.1 Purpose and Authority
The purpose of this policy is to establish a claims handling process that complies with the Government Claims Act, Government Code sections 810 and following and ACWA-JPIA’s recommendations for claims handling. This process will be used by the District to address claims seeking reimbursement from the District for damages to personal or real property, or for personal injuries alleged to be caused by District facilities or equipment, or its directors, officers, employees or agents.

### 3.1.2 Policy
Pursuant to authority granted by the Government Claims Act, the District must take action on each valid claim made by a person or entity against the District for damages to personal or real property, or personal injuries. The Board of Directors grants the General Manager, or his or her designee, the authority to review and approve or reject a claim for property damage in an amount not exceeding $50,000. In accordance with the policies of the District’s risk pool, ACWA-JPIA, all claims involving bodily injury must be denied by the Board of Directors and referred to ACWA-JPIA for handling.

The processing of all claims will be conducted in accordance with the Government Claims Act, including the time limits on claims processing and requirements for claims presentation. All claims for bodily injury in any amount and all claims exceeding $50,000 in value will be presented for action to the Board of Directors at a noticed regular or special board meeting, within 45 days of receipt of the claim. District staff will present all documents received from a claimant, an investigation report, and a recommendation to approve or reject the claim. In the event that a claim against the District is rejected, District staff or legal counsel will send a letter to the claimant describing the Board of Directors’ action on the claim and advising the claimant of his, her or its rights under the Government Claims Act with respect to any adverse action on the claim. Staff also will send a letter to and negotiate any necessary agreement with any claimant whose claim is approved in whole or in part.

### 3.1.3 Responsibility
The General Manager, or designee, has the authority to approve or reject a claim for damages to personal or real property up to a value of $50,000. The Operations Manager has the responsibility to receive claim documentation and prepare an investigation report with recommendation for action to the General Manager or Board. The General Manager shall adopt and implement appropriate procedures to carry out.
<!-- Page 31 -->
this Policy and will report to the District Board of Directors at its next regular meeting on each claim in the amount of $50,000 or less that is processed by staff under this policy.

### 3.1.4 Tender of Claims to Risk Pool or Insurer
Upon receipt of any claim, District staff will provide notice of the claim and all relevant documents to ACWA-JPIA or to any other risk pool or insurer from which the District may obtain any insurance coverage or indemnity for claims from time to time.

**Date:** October 28, 2020  
**Subject:** Water Leak Bill Adjustments  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Discussion item

The District’s one-time consumption credit practice  
As a courtesy to our customers, the District has offered a one-time consumption credit to those who have experienced water leaks in their system. Ordinance 17000.07.03 reads:

Upon written request from the Customer, the District will consider a one-time credit during a single billing period for excessive consumption due to leaks in a Customer’s service line. The Customer’s written request shall describe the leak situation, include date(s) of leak, and must affirm that the leak has been repaired. Credits are based on the property’s historical consumption and shall be determined by the District on a case-by-case basis.

To apply for a credit, the customer must complete a consumption credit form. In it, they describe the reason for their request, affirm the leak has been repaired, and acknowledge the process by which the credit is issued. The form states that credits are determined by comparing the customer’s water use during the period in which the leak occurred to their historical water use, calculates the consumption amount due to the leak and offers a credit of 50% of this amount. The customer has the right to accept the credit or save the one-time credit allowance for future use.

To provide a recent snapshot of the frequency of issuance, the District has offered this benefit to 108 customers over the past three years. The average credit amount was $146.51. Each customer who receives a credit is notified via email or phone of the credit amount and when the credit has posted to their account.

| Year  | Avg Credit      | Total Amount Issued | # Credits Issued | Largest Credit   | Smallest Credit |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 2018  | ($192.99)        | ($5,403.59)        | 28                | ($1,018.66)       | ($13.80)         |
| 2019  | ($121.85)        | ($4,508.29)        | 37                | ($1,278.80)       | ($18.86)         |
| 2020* | ($124.70)        | ($5,860.82)        | 43                | ($1,532.63)       | ($9.20)          |

**Consumption Credit Practice Discussion**  
**Lisa Brown**  

**Regional Water Agency Credit Comparison**  
As shown in the attached table, of the thirteen agencies that responded to an informational request, seven offer a consumption credit and six do not. Of the seven that offer a credit, four offer the credit once per the life of the account, two offer the credit once every three years and one offers the credit every five years. Four offer a 50% credit of the amount above the normal bill (one of those with limitations), two offer a 100% credit of the amount above the normal bill (one with limitations) and the other agency’s policy is unknown.  

**Current Status**  
This issue is being brought up for discussion today because of a customer complaint regarding our current practice. The customer experienced a severe leak in her water line during her last billing period. The meter was read on 9/16 and was flagged for high use. On 9/17 staff went out to check the service because of the high use alert. They discovered a leak on her service line. While on site, staff turned off her service and connected her service to her neighbor’s until the leak could be repaired. Her son repaired the leak on 9/19.  

It is unknown how long the leak was active. Her last reading was on 7/16 and her usage was normal. Her water usage from 7/16-9/16 was 1,808 units of water, resulting in a $1788.41 water bill. Her average use for this billing period is 51.7 units. We issued her a one-time consumption credit for 878.2 units resulting in a credit of $807.94 against her current bill. This still left a residual balance of $980.47. The customer expected a full credit of the overage, not half, and is unhappy with the credit we applied to her account.  

This information is for your discussion. If the Board wishes to update the consumption credit practice currently in place, this issue can be brought back to the Board for action at a later date.

**AGENDA ITEM V-3**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** October 28, 2020  
**Subject:** Groundwater Sustainability Plan  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Information only  

**BACKGROUND**  
The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) requires that a Groundwater Sustainability Plan (GSP) be developed for every medium and high-priority groundwater basin in California. As a result, a GSP is required for both the North and South American River Subbasins, due to the Department of Water Resources (DWR) by January 1, 2022. SGMA requires that GSPs be developed and submitted by Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSAs), or if no GSA is formed, by the county in which the basin exists.

The Sacramento Groundwater Authority has designated itself as the GSA for its portion of the North American Subbasin. SGA has decided to develop a GSP jointly with the other four GSAs that exist in the subbasin – RD 1011, South Sutter, Sutter County, and West Placer. The five GSAs will be responsible for implementing the GSP within their own geographic areas, but they will also establish an implementation agreement among themselves, to guide future joint activities (such as updated to the hydrogeological model) and to establish a process to resolve issues among GSA boundaries or impacts by one GSA on another.

**GSP Elements**  
The GSP is composed of the following elements:  

1. GSA Information  
2. Plan Area and Basin Setting  
   a. Plan Area  
   b. Basin Setting  
3. Sustainable Management Criteria  
   a. Sustainability Goals  
   b. Measurable Objectives  
   c. Minimum Thresholds  
<!-- Page 38 -->
![Staff Report – Groundwater Sustainability Plan](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Staff+Report+%E2%80%93+Groundwater+Sustainability+Plan+p.+2+October+28%2C+2020)

- d. Undesirable Results
- e. Monitoring Network
- 4. Projects and Management Actions to Attain Sustainability Goals
- 5. Plan Implementation and Reporting

**Next Steps**

SGA and the other GSA teams are finishing the update of the groundwater model, and are in the process of collecting the information that will be used to prepare the GSP. SGA is evaluating which wells to use for defining compliance with the GSP (e.g., the “representative” wells). There are over 200 wells in the subbasin that could be used, and SGA has been tracking and reporting monitoring information at 10 wells in its area for a number of years, which it will evaluate to determine if they or others should be used as “representative.”

Other issues that will need to be addressed include what sort of structure to establish for the inter-GSA group, and what responsibilities to give to it. SGA will also need to consider how to use authorities provided by SGMA that SGA does not have now, such as control of groundwater extraction (SGA is currently limited by the Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement that created SGA to exerting such control only via economic means). The JPA also specifies a process whereby the City of and County of Sacramento have to approve the Board members from the special districts in SGA (including San Juan), and limits those representatives from the special districts to elected officials. Representatives from the County and the cities (Sacramento and Folsom) can be any employee.

# AGENDA ITEM V-4

## STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** October 28, 2020  
**Subject:** Status of Water Transfer Activities  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Information only

### BACKGROUND
American River Basin (ARB) water agencies have been conducting various types of water transfers for a number of years. As these transfers have been developed and implemented, the water agencies have identified various issues concerning the methodologies used to quantify transferred water that need to be addressed and resolved.

DWR and Reclamation have established a team, including Michelle Banonis in DWR’s Executive Office, to collaborate with water transfer sellers and buyers to improve the process of preparing and implementing transfers. A small group has met a few times, and has developed two documents for discussion – a checklist of items that are needed to implement transfers, and an example schedule template, which shows the sequence of actions associated with a transfer. DWR and Reclamation will convene discussions on these documents with all stakeholders shortly.

Just as with Bay-Delta issues, the Sacramento Valley water agencies have organized a “Task Force” to work on transfers. This group is composed of agencies that have been sellers in previous transfers, as well as those interested in doing so in the future. Each of the tributaries is participating, and the group will address common issues (such as schedules and checklists), as well as those specific to the various types of transfers that occur or are planned – crop idling, reservoir reoperation, groundwater substitution and conserved water. American River basin agencies are involved in the latter three types of transfers, more specific descriptions of which follow.

### Groundwater Substitution Transfers
Groundwater substitution transfers have been conducted by ARB water agencies for a number of years, most recently in 2018 and in the current year (2020). These transfers have used surface water supplies from pre- and post-1914 water rights that are held by various agencies in the American River Basin. These supplies became available for transfer as a result of groundwater being pumped and supplied to these agencies to offset surface water supplies that would otherwise have been diverted and delivered to municipal and industrial customers.
<!-- Page 40 -->
![Staff Report – Water Transfer Activities](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Staff+Report+%E2%80%93+Water+Transfer+Activities+October+28%2C+2020)

In 2018, the conveyance agreements between The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the City of Sacramento and San Juan Water District specified that the streamflow depletion factor would be 8%. This figure had been used for previous ARB groundwater substitution transfers. However, in 2020, DWR required that the streamflow depletion factor be 13%. ARB water agencies are now working to complete studies to verify that the factor should be no more than 8%. Other issues arose during the deliberations on the details of the ARB water agencies’ 2020 transfers, which they plan to address with DWR after the transfers are completed. This work is being organized by the Regional Water Authority, and will include participation by Carmichael Water District, Golden State Water Company, the City of Sacramento, Sacramento County Water Agency, Sacramento Suburban Water District, and San Juan Water District.

**Conserved Water Transfers**

In 2017-18, the El Dorado Irrigation District (EID) and San Juan Water District convened discussions with DWR and the Bureau of Reclamation, to attempt to achieve agreement on a methodology to quantify water that could be transferred pursuant to California Water Code Section 1011. EID developed a proposed project to implement a conserved water transfer in 2018, but was unable to reach agreement with DWR and Reclamation on the proposed transfer. In 2020, the City of Folsom also attempted to reach agreement with DWR and Reclamation on a conserved water transfer proposal.

San Juan will be organizing further discussions with DWR and Reclamation on this topic in 2020 and early 2021, which will include participation by EID, Folsom, Carmichael Water District, the City of Sacramento, and Sacramento Suburban Water District. The issues to be resolved in these discussions include methodologies to define water that is not consumptively used, such as diversions that return to the river via urban runoff or percolation to groundwater and migration to the river. Another issue that will need final agreement is the definition of the baseline amount of demand which has been reduced via conservation. The goal of this effort is to reach agreement on a quantification methodology in time for implementation of conserved water transfers in 2021, should hydrologic conditions allow for transfers. The first meeting with DWR and Reclamation is being scheduled for the first or second week in November.

**Reservoir Reoperation Transfers**

Reservoir reoperation transfers are conducted regularly by ARB water agencies, including transfers being conducted in 2020 by EID and the Placer County Water Agency. Various issues have arisen in 2020 that need further resolution, including reservoir refill criteria. EID and PCWA will be discussing these issues further with DWR and Reclamation, to reach mutual agreement.

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Information only

### BACKGROUND

Water agencies typically update rates either in January or July. For that reason, we wait until the fall to update our bill comparison. We have compiled the latest information from the suite of water agencies around the state that we track, and have updated the spreadsheet that calculates water bills at various levels of use: 20, 31, 40, 55, and 80 ccf per month. We prepare graphs that display usage at the 31 ccf/mo and 55 ccf/mo month levels, which correspond to the level of use by our single-family residential customers that is the average annual use and the average use during the summer. The latest graphs for those usage levels are attached.

At their Board meeting on October 12, the Fair Oaks Water District discussed water rates and bills among San Juan’s wholesale customer agencies. They compared bi-monthly bills, based on a comparison of a consumption level of 40 ccf for the bimonthly period. A graph of that level of consumption, using the same comparison agencies as we have in the graphs of 31 and 55 ccf/mo, is also attached. At that level of consumption, the bimonthly bills are:

| Agency                          | Bimonthly Water Bill |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| Citrus Heights Water District    | $134.50              |
| City of Folsom                  | $92.40               |
| Fair Oaks Water District         | $91.62               |

### Conclusion:
The budget anticipated an overall 10% decline in deliveries, per customer, and no revenue from Sacramento Suburban Water District. The decline was anticipated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All wholesale customers took more water from July - September than anticipated in the budget. Deliveries outpaced expectations by 29% and revenues by 21%.

Excluding SSWD, deliveries for July-September outpaced the prior year by 518.91 acre feet.

# AGENDA ITEM VI-2.1

## DRAFT STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** October 28, 2020  
**Subject:** Fiscal Year 2019-2020 Results of Operations – Budget to Actual  

---

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Receive report.

### BACKGROUND
The Board of Directors adopted the Fiscal Year 2019-2020 Operating and Capital Budget on June 26, 2019. The Board of Directors received monthly budget to actual reports at each Board meeting during the fiscal year and a mid-year budget review was provided to the Board on March 25, 2020. The Finance Department has performed all the year-end accounting and the audit was completed in October, with no adjustments to the books required, as of the date of this report. The auditors will present the financial statements and the results of their audit to the Finance Committee in December.

The purpose of this report is to provide an in depth analysis to the Board of Directors on the actual activity of the District’s four funds (Wholesale Operations, Wholesale Capital, Retail Operations and Retail Capital), on the budgetary basis of accounting, for Fiscal Year 2019-2020.

### Wholesale Operations:
As illustrated in the graph below, wholesale operating revenues came in almost spot on, with a positive variance from the budget of just 1.5%, which equates to $164,400 more revenues than anticipated in the original budget.

Expenses came in $550,300 or 6.2% below the original budget and 5.3% less than estimated during the mid-year budget review. The largest variances came from Salaries and Benefits, Professional Services and Materials and Supplies, although almost all expense categories came in under budget.

- Salaries and Benefits came in 3% or $110,260 under budget, due to pay increases awarded through COLA’s or merit increases being less than anticipated by CalPERS. Incentive Awards were not utilized in the fiscal year.
- In Professional Services, costs came in under budget because the inspections of the Hinkle to Baldwin 72” pipeline and the Twin 54” pipelines that run from the Bacon Pump Station to the Penstocks were all pushed to the current year. Additionally, the Regional Collaboration Study was fully budgeted in FY 2019-20 but didn’t really get underway until the current fiscal year.
- Materials and Supplies came in about $100,000 less than anticipated due to lower than expected chemical costs. Water production in the second half of the year.

![Wholesale Operations Budget to Actual Analysis FY 2019-20](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Wholesale+Operations+Budget+to+Actual+Analysis+FY+2019-20)

**Wholesale Operations Budget to Actual Analysis FY 2019-20**

- Revenues: $14,000,000
- Expenses: $14,000,000

**Budget**: 
- Revenues: $12,000,000
- Expenses: $10,000,000

**Mid-Year Estimate**: 
- Revenues: $10,000,000
- Expenses: $8,000,000

**Final**: 
- Revenues: $8,000,000
- Expenses: $6,000,000

As a result of the stable revenues and lower than anticipated expenses, staff was able to transfer $3,224,465 into the capital reserve, $824,958 more than expected. With annual depreciation expense of $2,367,153, this transfer funds current year depreciation and helps make up lost ground from prior years.

At the end of the fiscal year, Wholesale Operating fund had an available reserve balance of $1,750,853, which is in conformance with the Board’s Reserve Policy.

**Wholesale Capital**:

Wholesale Capital revenues exceeded the budget by $465,335 or 33%. They were 10.5% higher than the mid-year estimate. The increase in revenues derives from Capital Contributions and Investment Earnings.

Capital Contribution revenues exceeded the budget due higher than anticipated costs for the Fair Oaks-40 Pipeline Re-Lining project. The project was completed in November 2019. A final analysis of total costs and contributions received was completed in conformance with the terms of the MOU with the Fair Oaks Water District and the Financial Plan, resulting in a true-up billing, which generated additional revenues.

![STAFF REPORT FY 2019-20 Preliminary Financial Results Donna Silva](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768)

Investment earnings were almost double what was anticipated. This is due to the transfer from the prior year being greater than anticipated and lower current year spending, resulting in more cash in the capital reserve fund upon which to earn interest.

### Wholesale Capital Budget to Actual Analysis
**Fiscal Year 2019-20**

Wholesale Capital expenditures were originally budgeted for $9,380,400. At year end, the District had spent $4,980,723, 53.1% less than anticipated (17.3% less than anticipated in the mid-year budget review). The pandemic played a role in some, but not all of these projects being deferred to the current year. The following budgeted projects were either not started, or not finished, and were pushed into the current fiscal year:

**Land Improvements:**
- Water treatment plant site paving
- Solar site access culvert replacement
- East campus fence replacement
- West end of WTP at WEL Garden fence replacement
- Perimeter fencing for Barton Road parcel

**Buildings & Improvements:**
- Security improvements
- Administration building improvements: fire system and alarm system upgrades

**Water Treatment Plant Improvements:**
- Filter floor repairs & media/nozzle replacements: as anticipated in mid-year budget review, only did one basin, second basin delayed to FY 2020-21.
- Solids containment area & handling improvements: started, but not complete by year end.

With revenues greater than spending, and the transfer in from operations, the Wholesale Capital Reserve grew to $16,163,310 at year end.

Retail Operations:

The graph on the next page depicts Retail Operating revenues and expenses as compared to the original budget and the mid-year review.

Retail Operating revenues were 3.41% greater than the original budget, and were greater than the mid-year estimate by a similar amount. Excess revenues of $440,931 were due mostly to increased water sales, but also to increases in cost recovery and fee revenues.

Retail Operating expenses came in $669,375 less than the original budget, a variance of -6.4% and -5.7% below the mid-year estimate. While there were variances in almost every expense category, they cancelled each other out, leaving the drivers of the variance to be Salaries and Benefits and Professional Services.

Salaries and Benefits came under budget by $185,222, a 3.7% variance. Most of the variance is due to pay increases being lower than expected by CalPERS (CalPERS’s estimate on salary increases is used to build the annual budget).

Professional Services came in under budget by $701,389 a significant variance of -55.4%. The following budgeted projects are responsible for the variance:
- The regional water meter replacement program was budgeted to cost $107,000 in FY 2019-20. Actual expenses were $81,504 leaving a variance of $25,500.
- SCADA programming and improvements were budgeted at $55,000, but only $11,000 was spent, leaving a variance of $44,000.

- Service area installations were budgeted at $390,000. Actual expenses in the operating budget were $103,533. Due to the pricing of the contractor, many of these qualified for capitalization. As such, they were recorded in the capital fund, not the operating fund.
- Paving services came in $18,000 under budget.
- Fire hydrant and valve exercising was budgeted for $95,000. Actual costs were $36,760.
- ARV repairs/replacements were budgeted at $50,000 and there was no activity during the year.
- The Engineering department budget included $133,400 for Professional Services, but only spent $9,379. Most of these expenses end up in the capital fund. Going forward they will not be budgeted in the operations fund.
- $35,000 was budgeted in Retail for the regional collaboration study, which didn’t really start gaining momentum until the current fiscal year.
- Budget included $15,000 for the retail capital facility fee study which was delayed until the completion of the retail master plan.
- Landscape Imagery costs of $25,000 were budgeted but not incurred.

### Retail Operations Budget to Actual Analysis Fiscal Year 2019-20

The budget anticipated a transfer out to capital reserves of $974,500. As a result of favorable operations, the transfer was actually $2,282,468.

At $2,525,340 the Retail Operating Reserve is in conformance with the District’s Reserve Policy.

# STAFF REPORT  
## FY 2019-20 Preliminary Financial Results  
### Donna Silva  

## Retail Capital:

Retail Capital Fund revenues came in at $1,641,411, which was $268,411 or 19.5% greater than budget, but only 2.4% off from the mid-year estimate. The increase in revenues is attributable to higher than expected connection fees. We budgeted for $100,000 of connection fees and received $319,577. Property Taxes came in slightly higher as did investment income.

![Retail Capital Budget to Actual Analysis Fiscal Year 2019-20](attachment://image.png)

Retail Capital expenditures came in at $1,315,967, which was 67.1% below the budget of $3,994,300. Of the total 37 budgeted projects, 19% were completed, 30% were in progress at the end of the year, and 52% were not started. Most of the projects not completed in the FY 2019-20 were pushed into FY 2020-21 or beyond.

With many projects not completed, higher revenues and a larger than anticipated transfer in from operations, the Retail Capital Fund ended the year with $8,027,851 in reserves, which is greater than the planned reserve balance of $3,039,441. Given that most of the projects still need to be completed, the increased reserve balance will fund those projects when they commence.

- Public Comment  

1. **2020 Urban Water Management Plan Update (W & R)**  
   Mr. Zlotnick provided the committee with a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He reported that there was only one proposal submitted by the deadline for the Request for Proposals on the Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) update. The consultant is the same consultant that worked on the demand study which was completed earlier this year. In addition, he informed the committee that the wholesale customer agencies initially expressed interested in completing this as a joint effort; however, only Orange Vale Water Company ultimately agreed to participate and will pay the cost of the UWMP prepared for them. He reported that the not-to-exceed amount for the District’s share of the project is $53,240. The UWMP must be submitted to the Department of Water Resources by July 1, 2021.

   The Urban Water Management/Water Transfer Committee recommends approval of contracting with Tully & Young/Zanjeros for completion of the District's state mandated 2020 Urban Water Management Plan update.

2. **Water Transfer Discussions with DWR and Reclamation (W)**  
   GM Hellliker reviewed a summary of the Water Transfer Methodology Discussions. He plans to update the summary and provide the information to the Board. He reported that the American River Basin (ARB) water agencies have re-initiated discussions regarding conserved water transfers. The group, with support from Tully & Young, will be meeting with DWR and Reclamation in November. The goal of this effort is to reach agreement on a quantification methodology in time for implementation of conserved water transfers in 2021, should hydrologic conditions allow for transfers.

   Mr. Zlotnick informed the committee that the District’s current allocation of CVP water under Reclamation’s shortage criteria is zero due to lack of historic use. He commented that the District could consider paying for and using CVP water to increase future historic use calculations so that it would have access to CVP water during dry periods. The committee discussed this idea and asked for additional information and a staff recommendation after the first of the year.
