**AGENDA ITEM III-3**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tony Barela, Operations Manager  
**Date:** February 24, 2021  
**Subject:** Hinkle Reservoir Outage Temporary Tanks Project – ICM Group, Inc Amendment  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a recommendation from the committee to the Board of Directors for a motion to approve an amendment to Infierra Construction Management Group, Inc. (ICM) contract for the amount of $28,000 bringing the authorized total contract budget to $106,200. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Engineering Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.

**BACKGROUND**  
This project involves the construction of two (2) bolted steel potable water storage tanks and appurtenances that will be used for operational storage while the Hinkle Reservoir liner and cover are being replaced in FY21/22. This project is needed to maintain Wholesale water delivery operations while Hinkle Reservoir is off-line.

ICM provided Construction Management and Inspection services during the construction of the two steel tanks. During the project, there was a District caused delay at the beginning of the project as the tank pads were completed and there was a delay at the end of the project as the District constructed the Ashland Bypass Pipeline to provide reliable service to the City of Folsom. Due to these delays, the Contractor worked weekends, causing inspection OT, and the project ran beyond the initial completion date.

Additionally, while the District’s Construction Inspector was on medical leave for approximately one month, ICM provided inspection support for the Hinkle Reservoir Outage Temporary Tank Project - Civil Improvements. This additional inspection service was not anticipated in the original contract.

The District is currently working to obtain a quote for modifications to the tanks to include two additional 24” connections. During this installation, the District is requesting that ICM provide construction management/inspection services for the installation of the connections, disinfection, and closing of the contract. The proposed amendment includes these services to close out the project.

**PROJECT STATUS**  
As of December 2020, the tanks have been in service and operating as planned. The original $1.04M construction contract for the tanks has been completed with only three change orders for a total additional cost of $1,150.

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
This service is included in the approved FY20/21 Wholesale budget for the Hinkle Reservoir Outage Temporary Tanks Project.

The parties agree that Contractor is not a designated employee within the meaning of the Political Reform Act and District’s conflict of interest code because Contractor will perform the Work independent of the control and direction of the District or of any District official, other than normal contract monitoring, and Contractor possesses no authority with respect to any District decision beyond the rendition of information, advice, recommendation or counsel.

6 Contractor Records

6.1. Contractor shall keep and maintain all ledgers, books of account, invoices, vouchers, canceled checks, and other records and documents evidencing or relating to the Work and invoice preparation and support for a minimum period of three years (or for any longer period required by law) from the date of final payment to Contractor under this Agreement. District may inspect and audit such books and records, including source documents, to verify all charges, payments and reimbursable costs under this Agreement.

7 Ownership of Documents

All works of authorship and every report, study, spreadsheet, worksheet, plan, design, blueprint, specification, drawing, map, photograph, computer model, computer disk, magnetic tape, CAD data file, computer software and any other document or thing prepared, developed or created by Contractor under this Agreement and provided to District (“Work Product”) shall be the property of District, and District shall have the rights to use, modify,

reuse, reproduce, publish, display, broadcast and distribute the Work Product and to prepare derivative and additional documents or works based on the Work Product without further compensation to Contractor or any other party. Contractor may retain a copy of any Work Product and use, reuse, reproduce, publish, display, broadcast and distribute any Work Product and prepare derivative and additional documents or works based on any Work Product; provided, however, that Contractor shall not provide any Work Product to any third party without District’s prior written approval, unless compelled to do so by legal process. If any Work Product is copyrightable, Contractor may copyright the same, except that, as to any Work Product that is copyrighted by Contractor, District reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable license to use, reuse, reproduce, publish, display, broadcast and distribute the Work Product and to prepare derivative and additional documents or works based on the Work Product. If District reuses or modifies any Work Product for a use or purpose other than that intended by the scope of work under this Agreement, then District shall hold Contractor harmless against all claims, damages, losses and expenses arising from such reuse or modification. For any Work Product provided to District in paper format, upon request by District at any time (including, but not limited to, at expiration or termination of this Agreement), Contractor agrees to provide the Work Product to District in a readable, transferable and usable electronic format generally acknowledged as being an industry-standard format for information exchange between computers (e.g., Word file, Excel spreadsheet file, AutoCAD file).

8 Confidentiality of Information

8.1. Contractor shall keep in strict confidence all confidential, trade secret, and proprietary information, data and other materials in any form generated, used or obtained by the District or created by Contractor in connection with the performance of the Work under this Agreement (the “Confidential Material”). Contractor shall not use any Confidential Material for any purpose other than the performance of the Work under this Agreement, unless otherwise authorized in writing by District. Contractor also shall not disclose any Confidential Material to any person or entity not connected with the performance of the Work under this Agreement, unless otherwise authorized in advance in writing by District. If there is a question if Confidential Material is protected from disclosure or is a public record or in the public domain, the party considering disclosure of such materials shall consult with the other party concerning the proposed disclosure.

8.2. Contractor, and its officers, employees, agents, and subcontractors, shall at all times take all steps that are necessary to protect and preserve all Confidential Material. At no time shall Contractor, or its officers, employees, agents, or subcontractors in any manner, either directly or indirectly, use for personal benefit or divulge, disclose or communicate in any manner, any Confidential Material to any person or entity unless specifically authorized in writing by the District or by order of a court or regulatory entity with jurisdiction over the matter. Contractor, and its officers, employees, agents, and subcontractors shall protect the Confidential Material and treat it as strictly confidential in accordance with applicable law, District policies and directives, and best industry security practices and standards.

8.3. If any person or entity, other than District or Contractor, requests or demands, by subpoena, discovery request, California Public Records Act request or otherwise, Confidential Material or its contents, the party to whom the request is made will immediately notify the other party, so that the parties may collectively consider appropriate steps to {002106839.1} rev. 05-18-20 Rev 4 2_23_2021 3
<!-- Page 19 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
protect the disclosure of those materials. The parties agree to take all steps reasonably necessary to preserve the confidential and privileged nature of the Confidential Material and its content. In the event that the parties cannot agree whether to oppose or comply with a disclosure demand, the opposing party may oppose the demand at its sole cost and expense, in which event the party favoring disclosure will refrain from disclosing the demanded Confidential Material until such time as a final agreement regarding disclosure is reached or, if an agreement is not reached, a judicial determination is made concerning the demand.

9 Compliance with Laws, General. Contractor shall perform the Work in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. Contractor shall possess, maintain and comply with all federal, state and local permits, licenses and certificates that may be required for it to perform the Work. Contractor shall comply with all federal, state and local air pollution control laws and regulations applicable to the Contractor and its Work (as required by California Code of Regulations title 13, section 2022.1). Contractor shall be responsible for the safety of its workers and Contractor shall comply with applicable federal and state worker safety-related laws and regulations.

10 Indemnification

10.1. Contractor shall indemnify, defend, protect, and hold harmless District, and its officers, employees and agents (“Indemnitees”) from and against any claims, liability, losses, damages and expenses (including attorney, expert witness and consultant fees, and litigation costs) (collectively a “Claim”) that arise out of, pertain to, or relate to the negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct of Contractor or its employees, agents or subcontractors. The duty to indemnify, including the duty to defend, is limited as provided in this section. However, this indemnity provision will not apply to any Claim arising from the sole negligence or willful misconduct of District or its employees or agents. Contractor’s obligations under this indemnification provision shall survive the termination of, or completion of Work under, this Agreement.

10.2. District agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Contractor harmless (including attorney’s fees) against any lawsuit, claim or demand brought against District by any party other than District with regard to services performed under this agreement.

No payment by District to Contractor shall be considered or construed to be an approval or acceptance of any Work or a waiver of any breach or default.

12.6. Severability. If any part of this Agreement is held to be void, invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then the remaining parts will continue in full force and effect and be fully binding, provided that each party still receives the benefits of this Agreement.

## SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT  
### PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENT

THIS AGREEMENT is entered into as of the date last signed and dated below by and between San Juan Water District, a local government agency (“District”), and Strategy Driver, Inc. a California corporation (“Contractor”), who agree as follows:

1. **Scope of Work**  
   Contractor shall perform the work and render the services described in the attached Exhibit A (the “Work”). Contractor shall provide all labor, services, equipment, tools, material and supplies required or necessary to properly, competently and completely perform the Work. Contractor shall determine the method, details and means of doing the Work.

2. **Payment**  
   2.1. District shall pay to Contractor a fee based on:  
   X Contractor’s time and expenses necessarily and actually expended or incurred on the Work in accordance with Contractor’s fee schedule on the attached Exhibit A.  
   ___ The fee arrangement described on the attached Exhibit A.  

   The total fee for the Work shall not exceed $25,000.00. There shall be no compensation for extra or additional work or services by Contractor unless approved in advance in writing by District. Contractor’s fee includes all of Contractor’s costs and expenses related to the Work.  

   2.2. At the end of each month, Contractor shall submit to District an invoice for the Work performed during the preceding month. The invoice shall include a brief description of the Work performed, the dates of Work, number of hours worked and by whom (if payment is based on time), payment due, and an itemization of any reimbursable expenditures. If the Work is satisfactorily completed and the invoice is accurately computed, District shall pay the invoice within 30 days of its receipt.

3. **Term**  
   3.1. This Agreement shall take effect on the above date and continue in effect until completion of the Work, unless sooner terminated as provided below. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

4  Professional Ability of Contractor  
4.1. Contractor represents that it is specially trained and experienced, and possesses the skill, ability, knowledge and certification, to competently perform the Work provided by this Agreement. District has relied upon Contractor's training, experience, skill, ability, knowledge and certification as a material inducement to enter into this Agreement. All Work performed by Contractor shall be in accordance with applicable legal requirements and meet the standard of care and quality ordinarily to be expected of competent professionals in Contractor's field.  

5  Conflict of Interest  
Contractor (including principals, associates and professional employees) represents and acknowledges that (a) it does not now have and shall not acquire any direct or indirect investment, interest in real property or source of income that would be affected in any manner or degree by the performance of Contractor's services under this agreement, and (b) no person having any such interest shall perform any portion of the Work. The parties agree that Contractor is not a designated employee within the meaning of the Political Reform Act and District's conflict of interest code because Contractor will perform the Work independent of the control and direction of the District or of any District official, other than normal contract monitoring, and Contractor possesses no authority with respect to any District decision beyond the rendition of information, advice, recommendation or counsel.  

6  Contractor Records  
6.1.

**Confidentiality of Information**  
8.1 Contractor shall keep in strict confidence all confidential, privileged, trade secret, and proprietary information, data and other materials in any format generated, used or obtained by the District or created by Contractor in connection with the performance of the Work under this Agreement (the "Confidential Material"). Contractor shall not use any Confidential Material for any purpose other than the performance of the Work under this Agreement, unless otherwise authorized in writing by District. Contractor also shall not disclose any Confidential Material to any person or entity not connected with the performance of the Work under this Agreement, unless otherwise authorized in advance in writing by District. If there is a question if Confidential Material is protected from disclosure or is a public record or in the public domain, the party considering disclosure of such materials shall consult with the other party concerning the proposed disclosure.

8.2 Contractor, and its officers, employees, agents, and subcontractors, shall at all times take all steps that are necessary to protect and preserve all Confidential Material. At no time shall Contractor, or its officers, employees, agents, or subcontractors in any manner, either directly or indirectly, use for personal benefit or divulge, disclose, or communicate in any manner, any Confidential Material to any person or entity unless specifically authorized in writing by the District or by order of a court or regulatory entity with jurisdiction over the matter. Contractor, and its officers, employees, agents, and subcontractors shall protect the Confidential Material and treat it as strictly confidential in accordance with applicable law, District policies and directives, and best industry security practices and standards.

8.3 If any person or entity, other than District or Contractor, requests or demands, by subpoena, discovery request, California Public Records Act request or otherwise, Confidential Material or its contents, the party to whom the request is made will

immediately notify the other party, so that the parties may collectively consider appropriate steps to protect the disclosure of those materials. The parties agree to take all steps reasonably necessary to preserve the confidential and privileged nature of the Confidential Material and its content. In the event that the parties cannot agree whether to oppose or comply with a disclosure demand, the opposing party may oppose the demand at its sole cost and expense, in which event the party favoring disclosure will refrain from disclosing the demanded Confidential Material until such time as a final agreement regarding disclosure is reached or, if an agreement is not reached, a judicial determination is made concerning the demand.

8.4. Unless otherwise directed in writing by the District, upon contract completion or termination, Contractor must destroy all Confidential Materials (written, printed and/or electronic) and shall provide a written statement to the District that such materials have been destroyed.

9 Compliance with Laws, General. Contractor shall perform the Work in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. Contractor shall possess, maintain and comply with all federal, state and local permits, licenses and certificates that may be required for it to perform the Work.

10 Indemnification

10.1. Contractor shall indemnify, defend, protect, and hold harmless District, and its officers, employees and agents (“Indemnitees”) from and against any claims, liability, losses, damages and expenses (including attorney, expert witness and consultant fees, and litigation costs) (collectively a “Claim”) that arise out of, pertain to, or relate to the negligence, recklessness, or willful misconduct of Contractor or its employees, agents or subcontractors. The duty to indemnify, including the duty and the cost to defend, is limited as provided in this section. However, this indemnity provision will not apply to any Claim arising from the sole negligence or willful misconduct of District or its employees or agents. Contractor’s obligations under this indemnification provision shall survive the termination of, or completion of Work under, this Agreement.

10.2. This subsection 10.2 applies if the Contractor is a “design professional” as that term is defined in Civil Code section 2782.8. If a court or arbitrator determines that the incident or occurrence that gave rise to the Claim was partially caused by the fault of an Indemnitee, then in no event shall Contractor’s total costs incurred pursuant to its duty to defend Indemnitees exceed Contractor’s proportionate percentage of fault as determined by a final judgment of a court or final decision of arbitrator.

12 General Provisions

12.1. Entire Agreement; Amendment.

12.5. No Waiver of Rights. Any waiver at any time by either party of its rights as to a breach or default of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver as to any other breach or default. No payment by District to Contractor shall be considered or construed to be an approval or acceptance of any Work or a waiver of any breach or default.

**BACKGROUND**  
The purpose of the treasurer’s report is to update the Board and the public on the status of the District's cash balances and investments, and highlight material changes from one period to another. The scope of this report covers the second quarter of fiscal year 2020-2021, ending December 31, 2020.

The District’s investment objectives are established by the Board approved Investment Policy. The Investment Policy is guided and constrained by the California Government Code. The Board periodically reviews and adjusts the Investment Policy to ensure ongoing compliance with the government code and to maximize investment flexibility as permitted. The current Investment Policy has the following objectives for the portfolio:

1. Safety  
2. Liquidity  
3. Yield  

Attached is the quarterly Treasurer’s Report for the three months ended December 31, 2020.

At September 30, 2020, the end of the previous quarter, the value of the District’s total portfolio was $29.9 million. Since that time, the value of the District’s portfolio increased by $938,439 for an ending balance of $30.9 million as of December 31, 2020. Cash and short-term investments increased by $994,956. Medium term investments increased by $328,535 and long-term investments decreased by $385,051.

The funds are currently held as follows:

- Cash at Banking Institutions: $1,663,686  
- Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF): $19,362,082  
- PFM Managed Investment Portfolio: $9,884,220  

**Total:** $30,909,988
<!-- Page 36 -->
![Distribution of Investments](https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png?text=Distribution+of+Investments+San+Juan+Water+District)

The overall portfolio is diversified with 32% invested in marketable securities (PFM Portfolio), 63% invested in short-term investments that are considered liquid (LAIF) and 5% on deposit with US Bank. Staff, in conjunction with your financial advisors, periodically review the mix of liquid and long-term investments and adjusts the portfolio according to the market conditions and the District’s short term cash needs.

All securities held are in conformance with those permitted by the District’s Investment Policy. There are sufficient funds to meet the District’s expenditure requirements for the next six months.

The mix and duration of investments are displayed in the following charts:

![Duration of PFM Portfolio](https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png?text=Duration+of+PFM+Portfolio)

In spite of the uncertainty caused by the pandemic and political uncertainty, the economy continued a slow recovery and the market has proved resilient. Economic conditions over the past quarter improved at a faster-than-expected pace, yet still trail pre-pandemic conditions. The pace of recovery is dependent upon the speed of the COVID-19 vaccination rollout. The District’s portfolio managers will maintain the portfolio’s neutral duration position relative to the benchmark.

The portfolio is still performing well and continues to outperform the benchmark (Bank of America Merrill Lynch “BAML” 0-5 year Treasury Index) on an historical basis.

**AGENDA ITEM III-7**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Adam Larsen  
**Date:** February 24, 2021  
**Subject:** Authorization of purchase for vehicle #24 replacement  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff recommends authorizing the purchase of a replacement vehicle for vehicle #24. The replacement vehicle would be a Ford F450, with a Scelzi utility bed, and Auto Crane for Field Services from Downtown Ford, a budgeted item for FY2020-21.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
The District's existing Vehicle #24 is a 2008 Ford F450, with a CTEC utility bed and Auto Crane. The vehicle has approximately 96,000 miles and is 13 years old. The vehicle has reached the point where repair and maintenance costs to the District are no longer cost effective and vehicle reliability and safety are a concern.

The District's policy for vehicle replacement is when a vehicle reaches 10 years old and/or 100,000 miles it is to be replaced. This policy has been developed based upon vehicle expenditures by District operations staff and experience with vehicle repairs and identification of the general point to where the vehicle breaks down. This policy is one that many other Districts follow.

The District will utilize the State of California vehicle contract 1-18-23-20A-I CLIN 30. Staff selected the diesel replacement; based upon vehicle mileage, maintenance costs, and towing capability. In addition, staff assessed two acceptable utility beds that offered different crane options; CTEC with the Liftmoore Crane, and Scelzi; with the Auto Crane. We currently use the Auto Cranes on two vehicles and find them reliable. The Scelzi utility body/ Auto Crane package was 17% lower in overall cost.

---

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
This vehicle replacement was budgeted for $90,000. The quote came in at $5,841.86 over the budgeted amount. We will be able to offset the extra cost with savings that we identified on a different project.

Staff is recommending that the Board approve the vehicle #24 replacement with a Ford F450, with Scelzi utility bed, and Auto Crane from Downtown Ford, in the amount of $95,841.86.

After vehicle #24 is replaced, it will go to public auction and then the amount that it is sold for will go back into the District's General CIP Fund.

# AGENDA ITEM IV-1

**STAFF REPORT**

To: Board of Directors  
From: Paul Helliker, General Manager  
Date: February 24, 2021  
Subject: General Manager Performance Review Form  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Information and Discussion  

**BACKGROUND**  
During the Board’s discussion in 2020 with me concerning my performance review, some members of the Board suggested reviewing and potentially modifying the review form. I reviewed the form and provided comments on a few items in the form, and some suggestions on sections in which certain items should be listed. These comments were reviewed by the Personnel Committee on December 8, 2020, and the committee did not provide any recommendations.

The Board may want to consider changes to the review form. The Board should also consider using the services of an HR consultant (facilitator) to assist it in conducting the performance review this year. We have used Kim Silvers in the past, and she has been helpful.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

To: Board of Directors  
From: Paul Helliker, General Manager  
Date: February 24, 2021  
Subject: RWA/SGA Subscription Program Agreement – Water Bank Phase 2  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Approve subscription program agreement  

**BACKGROUND**  
San Juan participated in Phase 1 of the RWA/SGA Water Bank project via a subscription program agreement. Our contribution to that program totaled $30,000 (out of $500,000 for the program), and the work primarily focused on updating and expanding the hydrogeological model of the Cosumnes, South American and North American groundwater basins.

Phase 2 of the program will include temperature modeling of any potential impacts of banking operations on the American River, as well as any CEQA and NEPA documentation necessary to allow the Bureau of Reclamation to “federally acknowledge” the groundwater bank. This phase will also include developing contract templates for banking partnerships.

Phase 2 is expected to be conducted during 2021 and 2022. San Juan’s portion of the projected costs of Phase 2 is defined as not to exceed $60,000. The draft agreement is provided as an attachment to this report.

# REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY  
## PROGRAM AGREEMENT  
### SACRAMENTO REGIONAL WATER BANK, PHASE 2  

This Agreement is made and entered into as of the ____ day of ______, 2021, by and between the Regional Water Authority (“RWA”), a joint exercise of powers authority formed under California Government Code section 6500, and following, and the Members and Contracting Entities of RWA listed in Exhibit 1 to this Agreement, upon their execution of this Agreement (who are collectively referred to in this Agreement as “Participants”), to provide for carrying out a Project or Program that is within the authorized purposes of RWA, and sharing in the cost and benefits by the Participants.  

## RECITALS  

A. RWA is a joint powers authority, formed to serve and represent regional water supply interests and to assist its members in protecting and enhancing the reliability, availability, affordability and quality of water resources.  

B. The joint powers agreement (“RWA JPA”) pursuant to which RWA was formed and operates, and as was amended on October 8, 2013, authorizes RWA to enter into a “Project or Program Agreement,” which is defined in the RWA JPA as an agreement between RWA and two or more of its Members or Contracting Entities to provide for carrying out a Project or Program that is within the authorized purposes of RWA, and sharing in the cost and benefits by the parties to the Project or Program Agreement.  

C. Article 21 of the RWA JPA states: “The Regional Authority’s projects are intended to facilitate and coordinate the development, design, construction, rehabilitation, acquisition or financing of water-related facilities (including sharing in the cost of federal, State or local projects) on behalf of Members and/or Contracting Entities. The Regional Authority may undertake the development, design, construction, rehabilitation, acquisition or funding of all or any portion of such projects on behalf of Members and/or Contracting Entities in the manner and to the extent authorized by such Members and/or Contracting Entities as provided in this Agreement, but shall not accomplish these functions, nor acquire or own water-related facilities in its own name.”  

D. Article 22 of the RWA JPA states: “Prior to undertaking a project or program, the Members and/or Contracting Entities who elect to participate in a project or program shall enter into a Program or Program Agreement. Thereafter, all assets, benefits and obligations attributable to the project shall be assets, benefits and obligations of those Members and/or Contracting Entities that have entered into the Project or Program Agreement. Any debts, liabilities, obligations or indebtedness incurred by the Regional Authority in regard to a particular project or program, including startup costs advanced by the Regional Authority, shall be obligations of the participating Members and/or Contracting Entities, and shall not be the debts, liabilities,
<!-- Page 55 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

obligations and indebtedness of those Members and/or Contracting Entities who have not executed the Project or Program Agreement.”

E. There is nothing in the RWA JPA or RWA policies that would prevent the participation of unaffiliated entities in projects conducted by RWA and its Members and Contracting Entities under a Project or Program Agreement, subject to approval of all participating Members and Contracting Entities and the unaffiliated entity’s execution of the Program Agreement.

F. RWA and the Participants desire to carry out a Program and share in the costs and benefits of the Program, as a Project or Program Agreement as provided for in Articles 21 and 22 of the RWA JPA.

## PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

### REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY

### SACRAMENTO REGIONAL WATER BANK, PHASE 2 PROGRAM

The Sacramento Regional Water Bank Program Phase 2 scope of work and budget is described below in four primary tasks.

## SCOPE OF WORK

The following tasks describe the overall work activities expected for the Sacramento Regional Water Bank (“Water Bank”) Program, Phase 2. More detailed scopes of work and deliverables would be specified upon the issuance of task orders to authorize the work.

### Work Category 1: Technical Activities

To reach an operational, federally-recognized Water Bank, the following technical activities were identified:

- **Develop CalSim 3 Application** – Water operations data for the American River basin, the Sacramento River basin, the Delta, and the CVP and SWP delivery areas are needed to support analysis of water supply, and to provide reservoir storages and river flows required for temperature and ecosystem analysis. CalSim 3 was selected to support this analysis. This task is being funded through the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s Water Management Options Pilot Program, so it is not part of the Phase 2 budget and fees.

- **Confirm Operational Assumptions** – The August 2018 survey elicited initial interest of local agencies in participating in the Water Bank. No red flags were identified at that time, and survey participants were open to all considerations. This action will reaffirm local agencies' level of participation in Water Bank operations.

- **Temperature Modeling** – River temperatures are an important driving factor for fish health in the American River basin and the Sacramento River. Any changes in reservoir storage and releases, and river flows associated with a Water Bank require evaluation.

- **Stream Depletion Factor** – To quantify the water available for transfers, a stream depletion factor must be developed. A stream depletion factor is the reduction in streamflow during balanced Delta conditions resulting from pumping groundwater to make surface water available for transfer.

- **Water Accounting Framework** – This framework will establish a set of policies and procedures to encourage and support conjunctive use operations to facilitate the long-term sustainability of the underlying groundwater basin as a source of public water.
<!-- Page 61 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

supply. This will be developed in coordination with local Groundwater Sustainability Agencies to ensure consistency with applicable Groundwater Sustainability Plans.

- **Monitoring/Mitigation Plans** – This activity will develop generic components that can be used to support annual transfers and long-term water banking operations.

## Work Category 2: Environmental Activities

The following are activities to support state, federal, and local environmental requirements. It includes regional and statewide impact analyses using CalSim 3 and regional models.

- **CEQA/NEPA Scoping** – Scoping will provide an opportunity to develop the project definition and assumptions. Based on the outcomes of this scoping, the degree of environmental review needed will be confirmed.
- **CEQA/NEPA Documents** – This activity includes preparation of environmental documentation and associated impact analyses. It currently assumes that only an Environmental Assessment will be needed for the Program. Costs may be higher if an Environmental Impact Statement/Report is required.

## Work Category 3: Institutional Activities

The following activities will establish governance and create contracting templates for water banking operations.

- **Governance** – This activity will determine and establish a formal governance structure for Water Bank operations and management, assuming an RWA-managed program. It will establish tools to support the governance structure, and roles and responsibilities. It will also address policy-related issues such as potential fees from transfers and environmental commitments.
- **Legal Support** – This activity will include development and review of contracts that are needed for operation of the Water Bank:
  - Long-term water storage and recovery agreements for a federally-recognized Water Bank.
  - Buy/Sell agreements for annual groundwater substitution transfers.
  - Conveyance agreements for annual groundwater substitution transfers.

## Work Category 4: Miscellaneous Activities

In addition to the above activities, three more activities were identified which focus on collaboration and engagement efforts related to the Water Bank.
<!-- Page 62 -->
- Outreach/Engagement – This will include some additional outreach materials but will focus on local stakeholder engagement and potentially external partners, if needed.

- Committee Support – A Water Bank committee has been formed that consists of local water purveyors that may participate in the future Water Bank. This activity will provide support for up to 8 committee meetings a year.

- Reclamation Participation – This activity will provide funding to reimburse Reclamation for the costs of its staff providing guidance on Water Bank criteria and environmental compliance.

### Estimated Budget by Work Category
| Work Category 1: Technical Activities      | $450,000  |
| Work Category 2: Environmental Activities   | $450,000  |
| Work Category 3: Institutional Activities    | $100,000  |
| Work Category 4: Miscellaneous Activities    | $200,000  |
| **Not-to-Exceed Total**                     | **$1,200,000** |

## FINANCING PLAN
### REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY
### SACRAMENTO REGIONAL WATER BANK, PHASE 2 PROGRAM

In developing the proposed fees for each agency, factors such as agency size, past participation in a groundwater substitution transfer, and the likelihood and level of participation in the Water Bank in the future were considered. A not-to-exceed fee was established to account for the possibility that other sources of funding may become available during the course of the Phase 2 Program. Fees will be collected over two years as shown below, unless an agency requests to pay its not-to-exceed fee at the outset of the program.

![DRAFT STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=DRAFT+STAFF+REPORT)

**AGENDA ITEM V-4**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Greg Zlotnick, Water Resources Manager  
**Date:** February 24, 2021  
**Subject:** Proposed Agreement Between San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District to Provide Surface Water Supplies to Enhance Groundwater Stabilization  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
(1) Adopt Notice of Exemption [CEQA]; (2) make a formal finding concurring with staff’s analysis, that the proposed transfer is of water surplus to the needs of the Wholesale Customer Agencies in accordance with their Wholesale Water Supply Agreements; and, (3) Authorize the General Manager to sign the Proposed Agreement Between San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District to Provide Surface Water Supplies to Enhance Groundwater Stabilization  

**BACKGROUND**  
To optimize the utilization of San Juan Water District’s (District) surface water supplies; generate revenue for the District’s wholesale enterprise; increase regional conjunctive use; enhance groundwater stabilization in Sacramento Suburban Water District’s (SSWD) northern service area; and, contribute toward a favorable baseline for future District/SSWD groundwater substitution transfer opportunities, the District and SSWD seek to enter into an agreement whereby the District will sell up to 6,000 acre-feet (AF) of surface water (with a minimum target of 4,000 AF) to SSWD between March 1, 2020 and February 28, 2022.  

The proposed agreement incorporates the same terms as the agreement approved last year for the pilot agreement, with adjustment to current rates.  

We have also informed the Wholesale Customer Agencies, in accordance with the Wholesale Contract, that we are undertaking this transfer and have determined as much as 6,000 AF of transfer water is available as surplus to WCA demands, even if assuming a 10% increase over last year.  

If 4,000 AF of water is transferred to SSWD, the District will receive over $880,000 in payments as compensation for treatment of that water. The charge per AF for treatment is the same as the District charges SSWD for treating Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) water it receives in years, which is not expected in the.
<!-- Page 68 -->
![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT+Water+Transfer+Agreement+with+SSWD+GregZlotnick)

current year, when the unimpaired inflow to Folsom Reservoir is 1.6 million AF or more.

The price SSWD is paying the District for the surface water supplies provided (exclusive of treatment) is significantly less than the rate it pays PCWA for water in years when it can access it, however, it also reflects a net revenue amount of approximately $12.96/AF for the District, which should result in net revenue to the District’s wholesale enterprise of up to $51,840. In the event that the District either does not deliver the full 4,000 AF or has to adjust its operations to meet that “up to” amount, net revenue may be reduced somewhat.

In prior years the District’s overall demand levels have resulted in the use of water right water in the District’s Placer County retail service area since it is less expensive to do so than using the PCWA water, even though “take-or-pay” water is paid for but unused. Because the Bureau of Reclamation’s (Reclamation) wheeling charge for that unused water is not paid on water right water, it is cheaper for the District to use it and leave a portion of its PCWA entitlement water “on the table” unused.

Notably, another benefit of the proposed transfer is that it rectifies this situation because the District will use much more (potentially all) of its “take-or-pay” water to meet demands in its Placer County service area, which will eliminate PCWA entitlement water being left “on the table”. Consequently, the transfer to SSWD will eliminate what could be as much as $138,000+ in otherwise “sunk” costs for San Juan wholesale that would be potentially attributable to paying for unused PCWA “take-or-pay” water.

In total, then, it is expected that this agreement to transfer up to 6,000 AF (with a minimum target of 4,000 AF) will result in over $1,000,000 in positive revenue impact to the District’s wholesale enterprise; including eliminating at least an estimated $138,000+ in sunk costs and generating at least an estimated $50,000 in net revenue.

CEQA  
Adopting and implementing this agreement is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) because it does not involve the construction of any new facilities or modification or expansion of capacity of existing facilities, and involves water supplies that have historically been consumptively used by the District prior to undertaking conservation actions. Therefore, it can be seen with certainty that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment.

**Project Title:** Sale of conserved water to Sacramento Suburban Water District  

**Project Location:** San Juan Water District facilities in Sacramento and Placer Counties will be used to receive, treat and convey water to Sacramento Suburban Water District in Sacramento County. See attached map.  

**Description of Nature, Purpose and Beneficiaries of Project:** San Juan Water District (San Juan) will sell up to 6,000 AF of water to Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD), which San Juan has previously conserved through various conservation efforts, including primarily the improved water use efficiency of its customers. The project does not involve the construction of any new facilities or the modification or expansion of capacity of existing facilities. San Juan will benefit from the project as a result of being better able to utilize the surface water supplies it has available to it for public benefit, as well as receiving revenue that will improve its wholesale enterprise’s financial position. SSWD will benefit from the receipt of surface water to improve the conjunctive management and health of its north groundwater basin.  

**Name of Public Agency Approving Project:** San Juan Water District  

**Name of Person or Agency Carrying Out Project:** San Juan Water District  

**Exempt Status:** (Check One)  
____ Ministerial  
____ Declared Emergency (Sec. 15071(a))  
____ Emergency Project (Sec. 15071(a) and (c))  
✔ Statutory Exemption: Class 1 Exemption, CEQA Guidelines section 15301  
✔ Other: Common Sense Exception, CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3)  

**Reasons why project is exempt:** This project does not involve the construction of any new facilities or modification or expansion of capacity of existing facilities, and involves water supplies that have historically been consumptively used by San Juan prior to conservation. It therefore can be seen with certainty that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment.

<!-- Page 72 -->
D. SSWD is a public agency located in northern Sacramento County, authorized to acquire water entitlements to provide water service within its service area. SSWD currently provides water for potable use within its service area primarily from groundwater pumped from its South and North Service Areas, overlying separate groundwater sub-basins, which SSWD conjunctively manages to ensure water supply reliability and groundwater sustainability.

E. On September 20, 2017, San Juan and SSWD entered into an AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT BETWEEN SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT AND SACRAMENTO SUBURBAN WATER DISTRICT CONCERNING DIVERSION, TREATMENT AND CONVEYANCE OF WATER. That 2017 Agreement will govern the measurement, treatment and conveyance (via the Cooperative Transmission Pipeline (CTP) owned by San Juan and in which SSWD owns a portion of the capacity), and payment by SSWD to San Juan for treatment and conveyance, of the water San Juan will provide to SSWD pursuant to this Agreement.

F. All of SSWD’s payments for the water provided by San Juan to SSWD pursuant to this Agreement will be made by SSWD to San Juan under the same schedule as that paid for treatment and conveyance in accordance with the 2017 Agreement identified in Recital E above.

G. SSWD has installed a pipeline to convey treated surface water from the terminus of the CTP to its North Service Area to enable SSWD to better conjunctively manage, conserve and utilize its groundwater resources.

H. San Juan has determined, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, it will be able to deliver up to 6,000 acre-feet of its water right water, surplus to the needs of its WCAs, to SSWD for the purpose of enhancing conjunctive management of the groundwater basin underlying its North Service Area, during the period of March 1, 2021 through February 28, 2022, as provided for in this Agreement.

### Conclusion:
Due to the possible effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, the budget anticipated a 10% decline in water deliveries. Those effects have not materialized. The budget did not anticipate selling water to SSWD but an agreement was reached subsequent to budget adoption. As a result, deliveries from July - January are 35% greater than anticipated in the budget and revenues outpace the budget by 22%.

Excluding SSWD, deliveries for July-January outpaced the prior year by 1,348 acre feet (5.9% increase).

High base rate charges.  

**Message:**  
Hi, this message is on behalf of my 80 year old mother who lives by herself at the above address. She lives on social security. I was looking at her utility bills and secured low income rates for PG&E, SMUD, ATT internet and Sewer/Garbage (Sac County). I was hoping to do the same with SJWD but was told there is no available rate reductions for those in need. I live in Folsom and was comparing water rates to SJWD and the comparison is eye opening. Base rate per day in Folsom is $0.60 while for SJWD it is $2.23. The water usage charge is about $0.92 per unit with SJWD while for Folsom it is $1.36 (1-20 units tier 1). Looking and comparing our last bill (Folsom) with my mothers bill (SJWD). Units for us for 30 days was 6.95 with a
<!-- Page 113 -->
total bill for the month of $27.55. - for 60 days of base rate and double water (two months) use this would be 13.9 units for a total of $55.10 Units for my mother for 60 days was 5 with a total bill of $129.65. What that shows is that I used almost 3 times the amount of water and pay less than half of what my mother does. Besides the fact that she has low fixed income, this just does not seem fair. This probably affects many of those who are least able to afford it with the service area of SJWD. I would appreciate it if I could be contacted and offered an explanation of why the base rate is so high and whether anything can be done to reduce the payments/bill to my mother. Thanks Sincerely Joe Ostdieck. P.S. I have seen your comparison of water rate charts. They are competitive for high users but for someone who lives alone and uses little water (which the charts do not show.), the chart would be very different.

# AGENDA ITEM VII-2

**RWA Exec Comm notes**  
**2/22/21**

**Closed Session**  
Nothing to report.

**Mark Madison**  
Sacramento County has $30.8 M in funding to assist residents with Covid expenses – water, wastewater, solid waste utility expenses. Agencies must enter into an agreement with SHRA, to allow funding to flow from SHRA for utility bills. Mary Liz Paulson at the County is the person to contact. The customers have to go directly to SHRA for to request funding.

**Dues Structure**  
Discussion about potential reduction of dues for San Juan (to avoid double-payment for wholesale service area), and discounts for non American River agencies (West Sacramento and Yuba City). City of Sacramento dues would increase. The Exec Committee agreed to refer the issue to the Board.

**SCGA**  
RWA/SGA moving to secure a facilitator, and a potential SGA staffer. The three Boards will meet soon to flesh out the topics to be discussed. The SGA Board is still expecting a workshop on the financial and governance issues.

**Office Space**  
Michelle Banonis does not have an office. Covid has changed the way that work happens – online meetings and working from home are now common. Potentially lease office space near the Capitol. Need to do a space needs analysis, including where RWA should be located. Recommendation to set up an ad hoc committee.

**Legislation**  
2200 bills introduced – 25% less than average. Last year, the number was 75% lower. Legislature continues to say that they are focused on Covid, impacts of wildfire and affordability (housing and homelessness). Two big issue areas are water affordability – SB 222, 223 (RWA has watch positions) and bond measures. Several bond measures that have yet to be developed, which focus on issue of equity.

600-700 of the 2200 bills are spot bills. Bills must have language before they are heard in committee – meetings ramp up in April. Committees generally meet three times. Ryan Ojakian reviewed proposed support/support with amendment positions on 8 bills, only one of which relates directly to water agency operations (SB 427, concerning water theft). The Exec Comm approved unanimously.

Federal Affairs Committee – directed Jim to send a letter of support for HR 535/S 91, which allow special districts to access federal Covid funds, and to support HR 1015, that...
<!-- Page 115 -->
creates a grant program for recycled water projects. Exec Comm approved unanimously.

**RWA March Board Meeting Agenda**  
March 19 3-5 p.m. strategic plan workshop. Exec Comm approved agenda, with that item removed.

**Executive Director Report**  
ACWA DC Conference this Wednesday.  
Coffee and conversation on March 5 – special Board meeting. Three speakers to talk about Sites (Jerry Brown), Green Means Go (James Corliss, SACOG), River Arc (Tony Firenze)

# ACWA UPDATE ON PRIORITY ISSUES
A high-level look at recent ACWA activity and initiatives.

## AGENDA ITEM VII-3.1

### FEBRUARY 2021

#### Federal COVID-19 Relief Funding
Thanks in part to advocacy by ACWA and a broad coalition, the COVID-19 stimulus bill contains $638 million to help low-income families cover the costs of their drinking water and waste water utility bills. The program, to be run through the Department of Health and Human Services, will provide grants to states and tribes, who in turn will provide funds to owners or operators of public water systems or treatment works to reduce arrearages and rates to low-income households.

On Feb. 2, ACWA and other statewide associations submitted a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom requesting a meeting to discuss how to expedite distribution of California’s share of the $638 million. ACWA will continue to work with state officials on this issue. The full coalition letter is available at [www.acwa.com/resources](http://www.acwa.com/resources).

#### State Water Board Surveys of COVID-19 Financial Impacts
In January, State Water Resources Control Board staff presented the results of two statewide surveys on the COVID-19 financial impacts on California water systems, estimating at least $600 million in customer drinking water debt. State Water Board staff estimated “household debt” as at least $1 billion, but that estimate included debt for other services, such as electricity and trash services that are all included on one bill at some utilities. Staff also estimate that up to 25 small/ medium water systems may require emergency financial assistance within six months. The survey results were based on 406 responses from small and medium water systems with fewer than 10,000 connections and 131 responses from large systems with more than 10,000 connections.

ACWA encouraged member agencies that were contacted as part of the survey efforts to participate. ACWA staff will continue to engage in this issue and keep members apprised. ACWA has a working group that is providing input on issues related to the suspension of shutoffs, including the financial impacts and federal and state action.

#### Water Infrastructure Investment
On Jan. 12, a national coalition including ACWA and more than 200 agricultural organizations and urban and rural water districts sent letters to then President-elect Joe Biden and congressional leadership urging them to address aging Western water infrastructure in any potential infrastructure or economic recovery package.

The coalition encouraged the federal government to invest in a diversified water management portfolio that enhances water supply and quality for urban and environmental uses while keeping water flowing to Western farms. Beyond financial support, the coalition also called on the federal government to ensure the timely construction of water projects by streamlining the regulation and permitting processes. The letters are available at [www.acwa.com/resources](http://www.acwa.com/resources).

#### PFAS Regulatory Determination
On Jan. 19, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a final regulatory determination to set a drinking water standard for PFOA and PFOS, two types of PFAS or “forever chemicals,” under the Safe Drinking Water Act. This kicks off the federal rulemaking process to set enforceable drinking water standards for these two contaminants.

EPA previously announced its intention to regulate these chemicals in its fall 2020 Unified Agenda, a biannual document that outlines anticipated regulatory activity for the coming year. Currently, EPA maintains an unenforceable Public Health Advisory that identifies 70 parts per trillion as a threshold level for both PFOs and PFOA in drinking water systems.

ACWA will continue to track this developing issue under the Biden Administration.

![Water Use Efficiency Updates](https://example.com/image.png)

**Water Use Efficiency Updates**  
ACWA met with representatives at the Department of Water Resources to discuss the indoor and outdoor water use efficiency standards. DWR is expected to release the draft indoor water use standards this month. ACWA continues to ramp up coordination meetings with members on the state’s development of indoor, outdoor, and water loss water standards, and variances and bonuses.

**Governor Newsom 2021-22 Budget**  
Gov. Gavin Newsom last month released his proposed 2021-’22 State Budget that includes a priority for funding climate resilience, including categories of special interest to ACWA members such as improved forest health, restoration of ecosystems, sustainable groundwater management and safe drinking water.

The $227 billion budget proposal focuses on several state priorities, including funding for economic recovery, education, health care, housing and immediate COVID-19 response and relief efforts. It does not include a climate resilience bond, as the Governor included with last year’s budget proposal but was sidelined due to COVID-19 priorities. ACWA and other organizations are working on legislative language in support of a climate resilience bond for the November 2021 ballot. The statutory deadline for the Legislature to pass a budget is June 15.

**Federal Lead and Copper Rule**  
On Jan. 15, EPA published the final Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) that is scheduled to go into effect on Mar. 16. However, the Biden Administration issued a regulatory freeze for numerous federal regulatory actions to allow for additional agency review. The LCR is covered by this freeze, meaning the rule and its effective date may be subject to change.

Unless the regulatory review halts implementation of the LCR, it will become the first significant federal rule governing lead in drinking water in nearly 30 years. The final rule maintains the federal action level for lead in drinking water at 15 parts per billion (ppb), but it does not match what water systems must do to replace lead service lines. It also establishes a new action level of 10 ppb that requires water systems to reassess their water treatment processes and potentially add corrosion-control measures. The rule also requires water utilities to notify customers with lead or copper of system-wide lead concentrations exceeding action levels, requires utilities to replace 3% of lead service lines (previously 7%) in communities where high lead levels are discovered, and mandates testing in elementary schools and child care facilities for the first time at the national level.

If the regulation goes into effect, ACWA regulatory advocates will be working with the State Water Board on how the new federal regulation will be implemented in California.

**California Water Commission Water Conveyance Infrastructure**  
The California Water Commission (Commission) intends to produce a white paper, including recommendations for state policy makers, describing key issues and mechanisms to consider as they assess the state’s role in financing water conveyance infrastructure. The paper will describe the essential criteria for water resilience water conveyance projects that meet the needs of a changing climate, the potential public benefits of such a project, and the implications of various funding options. The Commission held a series of regional workshops last month to solicit stakeholder input.

ACWA has met with Commission staff to provide input on financing conveyance and, with input from the ACWA working group, expects to submit recommendations this month to the Commission.

# AGENDA ITEM VII-3.2

## Finance & Audit Committee Structure
The Executive Committee approved changing the structure of the Finance and Audit Committee to match the other JPIA Program committees by adding two Executive Committee members to sit as Chair and Vice Chair and keeping other members of the Committee as staff members, and submit to the Board of Directors for a change to the By-Laws.

## Rate Stabilization Funds
Mr. deBernardi reported that total refunds to members with no changes to the Rate Stabilization Fund (RSF) calculation are anticipated at $8.9 million. Staff has projected that member refunds may not continue past 2022 where the hard market for both the Property and Liability Programs is likely to put the funding backwards. To smooth the refunding process, staff proposed changing the refund calculation by modifying the target balance of RSF accounts from 50% of their basic Liability Program premium to the proposed 70%. This change revises member refunds to $6.2 million. These refunds will go out to approximately 195 active members. The grounds for these refunds are largely due to Workers’ Comp policy year 2016/17 ($5.2 million) and Liability policy year 2016/17 ($3.8 million) having favorable adjustments. Property retrospective premium adjustments of approximately $100,000 were excluded from the process this year to reduce the anticipated amounts due from Property Program members for policy year 2018/19. The Executive Committee recommends changing the balance exceeds threshold from 50% of the basic Liability Program premium to 70% and approve approximately $6.2 million refunds to members as a result of the change to the 70% threshold.

## Liability, Property, Workers’ Compensation Claims Audit
Mr. Sells reported that the latest claims audit was completed September 2020. The packet included the Executive Summary from the auditors. All programs received an average rating of 99 (out of 100) or above.

## CEO and Directors Update
Mr. Sells and JPIA Directors updated the Executive Committee on relevant current issues. Those discussed were:
- Return to work schedule for staff
- Spring Conference
- Claims Department recruitment of Sr. Claims Adjuster
- Property, General Liability, and Cyber Liability renewals
- Software challenges
- California Water Insurance Fund (CWIF) audit
- Training Department update
- Human Resources webinars
- Current staff activities
- COVID vaccine update
- Workers’ Compensation COVID cases

## Insurance Market Update
Mr. Sells provided a short update on the state of the insurance market. The excess/reinsurance market for the Liability and Property Programs continues to be very challenging. Both JPIA programs saw significant increases in the costs of the
<!-- Page 120 -->
excess/reinsurance purchased for the 2019/20 and 2020/21 policy years. Looking forward to the 2021/22 policy years, the current projections are anticipating continued increases in the excess/reinsurance costs. The exception to the rising costs is the Workers' Compensation Program. Current indications are that excess pricing will remain stable. A meeting with insurance brokers will take place in the next few weeks with the Property Program renewal as the first to be addressed.

**General Counsel Report**  
Mr. Greenfield reported on some of the new legislation or case laws which may have an impact on the JPIA.

1. **Reservoir Outage Temporary Tanks Project – Construction Management/Inspection Services (W)**  
   Mr. Barela provided the committee with a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained that ICM is the Construction Manager for the Temporary Tank Project and, due to delays by the District, additional time was needed to complete the project. In addition, an additional scope of work was needed to help cover the District’s Construction Inspector’s medical leave and for modifications to the tank.  
   The Engineering Committee recommends a motion to authorize and approve a contract amendment to Inferrera Construction Management Group, Inc. for Construction Management & Inspection Services during Construction of the Hinkle Reservoir Outage Temporary Tank Project.

2. **Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project Update (W)**  
   Mr. Pierson informed the committee that the 95% design comments were returned to HDR and he will be meeting with them on February 11th to review the contractual agreements. The project is on schedule with the bid documents being available in March and the award of the contract in May.

3. **Retail Water Master Plan Presentation (R)**  
   Mr. Barela provided a brief presentation to the committee on the Retail Water Master Plan. He informed the committee that HDR was contracted in 2019 to complete the master plan for the District. He reviewed the background, system piping and hydraulic connectivity, service lateral replacements, and system storage. The committee discussed the timeline for the service lateral replacements, and Mr. Barela explained that the cost to replace the service laterals is approximately $1.4 million for 85 per year.

Mr. Barela informed the committee that there are approximately 750 ARVs in the system that do not have vents and will eventually need to be moved and vented. He explained that this plan starts the process to address a 20-year program to mitigate this situation.

Mr. Barela informed the committee that HDR also evaluated the Stoneridge Tank site. He explained that there is a joint agreement with the City of Roseville for this site; however, it was never finished due to cost issues and location of the storage tank. He reported that this might be an option for wholesale storage which will be evaluated during the update of the wholesale master plan.

Mr. Pierson reviewed some of the retail pipeline projects that are on the plan and explained that staff has created a timeline for the retail projects which will be spread out over the years in order to level out the retail expenses. Mr. Barela explained that the meter replacement costs are not included in the retail master plan since those costs were evaluated by another consulting firm and will cost approximately $610,000 per year. Ms. Silva informed the committee that the financial plan is being completed this year and will address the costs presented in the retail master plan and the meter replacement project.

4. Other Engineering Matters
