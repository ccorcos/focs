2. Hinkle Reservoir Rehabilitation Project (W)  
Director Miller had requested to discuss Consent Calendar Item 3 - Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project Design Services - under this agenda item. He inquired about the funding for the project, the interest rate for the loan, an update on the loan and who controls the payout during the construction phase of the project. Ms. Silva responded that the District is embarking on a very large project for the replacement of the liner and cover of the Hinkle Reservoir and the financial plan assumes that the District would seek out bond financing. However, at President Rich’s recommendation, staff has been researching the state’s Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund (SRF), which would be a cheaper alternative to issuing bonds.

Ms. Silva explained that there are two resolutions before the Board for the funding with the state’s Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund. One resolution states the Board’s intent to recover any costs that the District incurs on the project prior to signing the financing agreement to be able to get reimbursed for those costs out of the loan. The second resolution authorizes a District staff member to file applications and sign documents during the process; however, the Board will provide final approval before the staff member signs the final loan documents.

Ms. Silva informed the Board that the design for the Hinkle Reservoir project was budgeted and is funded from the Wholesale Capital Outlay Fund reserves, while the construction and other costs will be funded though financing, which might include some gap financing. She informed the Board that bond financing is about 3-4% right now while the SRF rate will be about half of that. In addition, she explained that some of the construction costs would most likely be paid for with gap financing with the District being reimbursed by the SRF loan. She informed the Board that the application process is about half done and she does not expect any issues with receiving funding through the state’s Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund.

Vice President Costa moved to adopt Reimbursement Resolution 19-05 stating San Juan Water District’s intent and reasonable expectation to be reimbursed for expenditures paid prior to the issuance of funds from the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund or the approval by the State Water Board of the project funds. Director Hanneman seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

Vice President Costa moved to adopt Authorizing Resolution 19-06 designating the Director of Finance or designee, as the authorized representative of the San Juan Water District to provide the assurances, certifications, and commitments required for the financial assistance application, including executing a financial assistance agreement from the

## V. NEW BUSINESS

1. **California Voting Rights Act and Elections (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker provided a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He reported that the City of Citrus Heights established five electoral divisions in June 2019, after they received a letter last year regarding the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA) and their at-large elections. He and Mr. Horowitz summarized the current status of elections by division for various agencies and the CVRA.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

To: Board of Directors  
From: Rob Watson, P.E., Engineering Services Manager  
Date: September 25, 2019  
Subject: Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project Design  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a recommendation from the Committee for a Board motion to approve entering into a Professional Services Agreement with HDR Engineering, Inc., for the Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project Design in the amount of $940,014.00 with a total authorized budget of $1,034,000.00 which includes a 10% contingency. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Engineering Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The existing Hinkle Reservoir Cover and Liner was originally installed during the 1979-1980 Hinkle Reservoir improvements construction project. This existing liner and cover has now reached the end of its useful lifespan and must be replaced. The design of the liner and cover replacement is to be completed in FY 19/20 with construction to be completed during the winter months of FY 20/21.  

**CURRENT STATUS**  
On August 15, 2019, the District issued an RFP requesting proposals for professional engineering services to complete the design of the liner and cover replacement. Twenty (20) engineering/design firms were directly informed of the project and invited to propose. On August 28, 2019, a pre-proposal meeting was held at the District to provide prospective firms to receive information about the project, ask questions and walk the site. Three firms attended the pre-proposal meeting. Two firms submitted proposals on September 16th, 2019. Each Technical Proposal was independently reviewed by members of a five person panel who ranked them on the basis of project-specific criteria such as; project understanding, work plan, experience and qualifications, and project schedule. The reviewers unanimously ranked HDR Engineering, Inc. as the top Technical Proposal. Subsequent to the technical ranking, the Cost Proposals were opened and reviewed. The following table summarizes the proposed costs from each firm.  

| Design Consulting Firm | Proposed Cost  |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| CDM Smith             | $1,098,536     |
| HDR Engineering, Inc. | $940,014       |

Based on the reviewer’s evaluation it was determined that interviews would not be necessary, and that HDR Engineering, Inc. is the recommended consultant to complete the project.  

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
The Project was budgeted at $785,100 in the District’s adopted FY 19/20 Wholesale Budget. The Hinkle Operational Planning task has already used $216,480 of that budget, leaving a remaining authorized budget amount of $568,620. This requested contract approval amount above will require adding $465,380 from the reserves to the authorized budgeted amount.

# STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** September 25, 2019  
**Subject:** Resolutions for Funding Hinkle Reservoir Rehabilitation Project Through the State Water Resources Control Board’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Approve resolutions 19-05 and 19-06.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
Hinkle Reservoir is a 62 million gallon earthen reservoir which is Hypalon lined and covered. Hypalon is a flexible membrane material used to protect the water from contamination. The reservoir serves as the clear well for treated water produced from the District’s Water Treatment Plant (WTP), as well as a facility for system storage. The WTP is operated at a constant flowrate and therefore, to meet fluctuating and peak water demands, the Hinkle Reservoir is used to store excess treated water with the water level rising and falling with changes in demand and production. The cover and liner were installed in 1981 with an estimated life of 25 years. Regular maintenance has extended its life an additional 13 years. In May 2016, an expert membrane consultant inspected and tested the cover and liner material and reported that, based upon its analysis of the cover’s and liner's current condition, the District should replace both within the next 2 to 5 years. The Hinkle Reservoir Rehabilitation Project also will rehabilitate the inlet and outlet structures, repair ancillaries as needed, and replace the approximate 11 acres of cover, liner and interior baffle wall material.

Consequently, a plan to replace the cover, liner and interior baffle wall material, and to rehabilitate the inlet and outlet structures and other ancillaries as needed, was incorporated into the District’s Capital Improvement Program in FY 2016/17, with design starting in FY 2019/20, and a scheduled construction start in fiscal year 2020/21.

Total project costs are estimated to be $14,720,000. District reserves are not adequate to fund the project. The District’s financial plan assumed a traditional bond issuance would be used to finance this project. However, the District has applied for lower cost financing through the State Drinking Water Revolving Fund administered by the State Water Resources Control Board. The application process includes the submittal of four different application packages:
<!-- Page 26 -->
![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

- General
- Environmental
- Financial Security
- Technical

The General Application was submitted in February 2019, and the Environmental Package was submitted in July 2019. Based on direction received from our state loan representative, the District is now working on the Financial Security Package.

**CURRENT STATUS**  
Two resolutions are required to be submitted as part of the Financial Security Package as follows:

- **Reimbursement Resolution No. 19-05** – this resolution states that the District intends to expend monies on the project prior to approval of the loan funds. By adopting this resolution, the Board is preserving the District’s ability to get reimbursed for these expenditures and have them be part of the overall financing. Due to the timeline required to get an approved agreement from the State, and the timeline of the project, staff anticipates that a significant portion of the project expenditures will be expended prior to final approval of the loan documents.

- **Authorizing Resolution** – this resolution names the Director of Finance as the authorized representative of the District for signing applications, certifications, and agreements related to the financing.

The resolutions are attached.

**Attachments:**  
Resolution 19-05 Reimbursement Resolution  
Resolution 19-06 Authorizing Resolution

# AGENDA ITEM V-1

**STAFF REPORT**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** September 25, 2019  
**Subject:** California Voting Rights Act and Elections Process  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Discussion  

**BACKGROUND**  
At the February 8, 2019, Legal Affairs Committee meeting, the committee discussed the then recent activity at the City of Citrus Heights to respond to a letter from the Shenkman Law Firm threatening litigation under the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA), if the City did not change their elections process from at-large to by-division. The City changed their elections process on June 27, 2019, via the establishment of five electoral divisions, which will be used starting with the November 2020 elections. Information about the requirements of the CVRA statute and the procedures for establishing electoral divisions is included in Attachment 1 “Discussion Points”.

The National Demographics Corporation tracks the revisions that cities and other public agencies in California are making to their electoral processes. Attachment 2 includes their current count of 195 jurisdictions that have changed from at-large voting. They count 8 special districts, which would include water districts.

We are currently aware of the following water districts that have made or are in the process of considering transitions from either complete or partial at-large voting:

| Agency                          | Date of Adoption     |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| Imperial Irrigation District     | November 17, 2015    |
| Cucamonga Valley Water District   | July 10, 2018        |

# DISCUSSION POINTS ON THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT  
San Juan Water District Legal Affairs Committee Meeting  
February 8, 2019  

- Cal. Voting Rights Act of 2001, as amended, is codified at Elections Code sections 14025 – 14032.  

- EC section 14027 sets the standard: An at-large method of election may not be used if it impairs the ability of a protected class to elect candidates of its choice or its ability to influence the outcome of an election. Impairment occurs “as a result of the dilution or the abridgment of the rights of voters who are members of a protected class.”  
  - A protected class is, “a class of voters who are members of a race, color, or language minority group” as further defined in the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965. (EC section 14026(d).)  

- A violation of the standard is established by showing that “racially polarized voting” exists. (EC section 14028(a).)  
  - “Racially polarized voting” means voting in which there is a difference between how members in the protected class votes versus the voting patterns of persons not in the protected class. (EC section 14026(e).)  
  - Whether racially polarized voting exists is determined by methodologies developed through appellate decisions decided in federal and state voting rights enforcement lawsuits. In general, the approved methodologies involve statistical analyses performed by expert statisticians and demographers.  
  - The analysis is not limited to the most recent election held by the agency against which a claim is filed. The analysis can look at historical trends in that agency’s elections, as well as trends in elections held by other agencies in the same general locality.  
  - Lack of intent is not a defense – this is a strict liability issue.  

- If a violation of the VRA is proven, a court may order the offending agency to change its voting system to “by division” (i.e., a Director must live in the division and is only voted for by voters residing in that division). The court also may award attorneys’ fees and costs. Public agencies that have tried to fight these claims generally have lost and, in some cases, have incurred several million dollars in attorneys’ fees.  

- If San Juan were to receive a letter from a law firm like the one received by Citrus Heights or other written notice, which is a requirement of the VRA before a claimant may file a lawsuit, the Cal. VRA provides a “safe harbor” process for avoiding substantial liability.  

{00123514.1}  
1  
<!-- Page 33 -->
- The “safe harbor” process requires the agency to change its voting system on a very short timeline, in exchange for which the agency’s liability is capped at the actual amount of attorneys’ fees spent by the claimant, or $30,000, whichever is less.

- Within 45 days of receiving a violation notice, the public agency must decide whether to defend the lawsuit or implement the process to voluntarily change its voting system. If the agency chooses to voluntarily convert, its governing body must adopt a resolution within the 45-day period stating that intent.

- The resolution must outline the steps the agency will take to convert its voting system to “by division” and must implement those steps within the additional 90-day period granted by the VRA to complete the conversion.

- There are a number of required meetings and milestones that the agency must comply with, but they are beyond the scope of this discussion and therefore are not detailed here.

➢ The agency also must map the proposed new divisions. The divisions must be drawn in accordance with established law to be reasonably equal in population, and the divisions must be as contiguous and compact as possible, taking into account the relevant practical geography and the need to preserve communities of interest within a single division.

➢ Using the safe harbor process does not disenfranchise incumbents. The VRA safe harbor process permits an agency to create an orderly process in which incumbents are permitted to serve out their existing terms.

- But the VRA cautions that elections using the new electoral divisions may not be unreasonably delayed for the convenience of incumbents. Thus, the agency generally must implement the by division voting system starting with the next general agency election.

- There are creative ways to ensure an orderly change for incumbents by trying to draw new divisions so that incumbents up for reelection in the next election reside in the new divisions, and then having the remaining incumbents stand for election (or withdraw if they reside in another incumbent’s division) in the following election.

➢ The Uniform District Election Law (EC sections 10500 and following) and CSD Law also provide a process for San Juan to change its election system voluntarily at any other time. If the Board desires to change its existing “at-large” system to a “by division” system in the near future to negate any possibility of a VRA claim, it may do so using this alternative process.

### Conclusion:
July through August water deliveries to the wholesale customer agencies exceeded expectations due to higher than anticipated demand from both Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks. However, total deliveries are 538 acre feet below expectations due to less than expected deliveries of PCWA water to the the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD). SSWD experienced a blown valve that necessitated them to reduce their taking of PCWA water. During the repair media was found in the line. SJWT has been working with SSWD to inspect the line to ensure no additional media is in the line. Once this work is complete it is anticipated that SSWD will increase the amount of PCWA water we are treating and delivering.

![Capital Region Climate Readiness Collaborative](https://www.climatereadiness.info)

**Creating a Climate-Ready Capital Region**  
The Capital Region Climate Readiness Collaborative (CRC) is a public, private, multi-sector network of organizations working together to advance climate resiliency efforts in our region. Together, through knowledge exchange, targeted learning opportunities, and project coordination, we advance innovative climate solutions.

---

**What is Climate Readiness**  
Climate readiness is about taking targeted action to preserve and improve our region’s economy, infrastructure, and resources while safeguarding our community members’ health, safety, and quality of life.

---

**The Need for Collaboration on Climate Change**  
From heat waves to flooding to agricultural productivity, a wide range of impacts threaten the Capital region. We are already seeing changes in our climate and environment, like extreme heat events, more extreme weather events, earlier snow melt, milder winter temperatures, longer fire seasons, and water shortages. These effects disrupt multiple sectors and highlight the importance of cross-regional and cross-sectoral collaboration to effectively build resilience in our communities and businesses.

Many organizations are already responding to these key vulnerabilities, but there is much more to be done. By developing and implementing a set of comprehensive adaptation strategies, our region can increase its resilience, protect its unique resources and assets, leverage new opportunities, and ensure a healthy and prosperous future.
<!-- Page 72 -->
# Rising to the Climate Challenge Together

Our purpose is to provide a forum for regional engagement for leaders from government, business, agriculture, academia, and community groups. The helps stakeholders come together across market and jurisdictional boundaries to share information and best practices, leverage efforts and resources, avoid duplication, identify critical needs and strategies, and develop funding strategies.

## Joint Fundraising Proposals

Through our multidisciplinary network, CRC paves the way for leaders in the Capital Region to pursue grant funding based on strong cross-sector or multi-jurisdictional partnerships, as State opportunities increasingly require. Robust collaboration ensures that we maximize climate investments for our region.

Most recently in 2018, CRC coordinated a grant application to Caltrans' SB-1 Transportation Adaptation Planning Grant program and was awarded nearly $500,000 to model the urban heat island effect in our 6-county region, develop heat mitigation and adaptation strategies, and engage with priority populations.

## Quarterly Information Exchanges

CRC organizes workshops with experts to ensure that our region’s planners, policymakers, advocates, and practitioners stay informed and identify opportunities for collaboration. Through interactive discussions, participants identify actionable strategies to move the needle on climate readiness.

Previous workshops have covered topics including the intersection of extreme heat, air quality, and the transportation sector; flood risks to our region; adaptation opportunities for natural and working lands, including carbon farming; and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and the mental health impacts of climate change.

## State Policy Engagement

CRC develops robust comment letters on State policies and funding guidelines collectively with our members, and also through the Alliance of Regional Collaboratives for Climate Adaptation, coordinating directly with key state agencies to create resilient and livable communities throughout California.

## Project Ideation and Design

CRC provides coordination and guidance to its members to help identify project concepts and support grant efforts that support CRC's mission of regional economic, ecological, and public benefits. CRC also provides support letters for members, showcasing strong regional and cross-sector support.

![Investing In Our Future: Natural Systems](https://www.climatereadiness.info)

**Investing In Our Future: Natural Systems**

The Capital Region is unique in its geographic diversity – from the Sierra Nevada to the rich agricultural valleys and the Delta wetlands. Our natural lands provide clean air and water, biodiverse forests and rivers, and a multitude of aesthetic, recreational, economic, and cultural benefits. While policies and investments have prioritized the built environment, safeguarding our natural systems can buffer communities against flood risks, extreme heat, drought, wildfire, and other impacts of climate change, improving resilience throughout the region.

---

**How Will Climate Change Affect Our Natural Environments?**

**Forests and Trees**  
Forests provide substantial ecosystem services and serve as critical carbon sinks. However, the stresses of drought and extreme heat, which accelerate the spread of disease and pests, have taken a deadly toll on California's forests. The extreme number of dead trees increase wildfire risk and they no longer can provide air quality, carbon sequestration, and cooling benefits.

**Air and Water Quality**  
The Sierra Nevada – our greatest source of freshwater – is at risk. Higher temperatures, decreased snowpack, and more frequent and intense wildfires are degrading the quantity and quality of water flowing downstream, as well as the water filtration and storage capacities of natural lands. Wildfire smoke also contributes to severe air pollution and diminished economic activity across the region.

**Biodiversity Loss**  
Warmer water temperatures in the Delta and our rivers are diminishing Chinook salmon runs and contributing to the endangerment of delta smelt. Ecosystems are vulnerable to rapid changes caused by climate change, urban development, and reduced biodiversity can trigger adverse economic impacts from lost job to decreased recreational opportunities.

**Rural Communities and Recreation**  
Climate impacts to natural environments threaten rural economies, where many jobs are closely tied to natural resources. The loss of scenic quality and recreational value also affects the tourism and outdoor recreation industry, which Sierra communities are already experiencing due to decreasing snowpack and shorter winter ski seasons.

---

**A Local Perspective**  
“Long-term, active stewardship of forest communities is critical for producing high-quality fresh water and slowing the devastating effects of air pollution. Through partnerships with agencies and private landholders, we are able to demonstrate how Maidu traditional ecology and contemporary ecological science can be woven together for the benefit of the land and all who share it.”  
— Ken Holbrook, Executive Director, Maidu Summit Conservancy

“Urban greenways are one of the best amenities in our region, providing flood control and wildlife habitat along with biking and walking trails. Our restoration work on the American River Parkway conserves these capabilities and creates harmony between natural ecosystems and our built environments.”  
— Diane Poggetto, Executive Director, American River Parkway Foundation

## Local Solutions for a Stronger Community
**An Innovative Approach to Leverage Agriculture for Habitat Conservation**

The Nigiri Project is a collaborative effort between rice farmers and researchers to help restore salmon populations in the largest floodplain of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta: the 60,000-acre Yolo Bypass. The project seeks to optimize habitat benefits for salmon and water birds, while also maintaining farming. With more than 95% of natural floodplain wetlands eliminated by the development of farms and houses, rice fields – which are typically flooded during the off-season – make an ideal habitat solution in the winter and spring for endangered fish. The Nigiri Project reintroduces juvenile salmon to flooded, dormant rice fields in the winter. After the first year, the salmon had a five-fold weight gain in only six weeks, which was among the highest growth rates recorded in Delta salmon research.

## CLIMATE CHANGE BY THE NUMBERS
- Sierra Nevada forests store enough carbon to offset the emissions of **108** coal-fired power plants.
- There are **129 million** dead and dying trees in California.
- The interception of stormwater by San Francisco's entire urban forest has an annual value to the city of **$467,000**.
- Trees may slow their growth for up to **four years** following a severe drought.

## Become a Leader
**Preserve natural lands:** Restricting development to within urban boundaries allows natural lands to collect stormwater, clean the air, support trees and biodiversity, and replenish other resources while preventing additional resource burdens and air pollution.

**Implement urban trees:** Trees provide a multitude of benefits including clean air, shading and cooling, stormwater capture and flood protection, increased property values, and crime reduction.

**Invest in ecosystem health:** Restoration of natural ecosystems, such as meadows, wetlands, streams, and forests, helps provide clean air and water to both urban and rural communities. Additionally, greater investments to restore the health of California’s forests are critical to reducing wildfire risk, sustaining biodiversity, and preserving the carbon storage potential of upland forests and agricultural lands.

# Health, Climate and Wetter Weather

## What’s Good for Health is Good for Climate
We care about healthy living in the Capital Region. OutsideIn means that the outside environment (climate) affects us on the inside (health). That is why we are concerned about climate change. Now is the time to come together as a community and talk about how hotter temperatures, more rain, and other changes to our environment are affecting our wellbeing. The good news is that many actions that help reduce climate change also improve the health of our families and community.

Changes to the Capital Region’s rainfall patterns will challenge our streets, water systems, and everyday lives. While drought is likely to be more common in the future, climate scientists predict that storms will be stronger, and rain-on-snow events will increase. There are likely to be more floods, and rising sea levels may result in more salt water getting into the Sacramento River and Delta areas. These threats to our water supply and water quality affect our health and way of life. The health effects from stronger storms include:
- Increased allergies from pollen, molds, and air pollution
- Injuries, illness, mental stress, and death from disasters
- Vector-borne diseases like West Nile Virus, Zika Virus, and Lyme disease
- Water-borne disease, such as diarrhea from dirty water
- Loss of housing and jobs, displacement, and economic impacts

## Being Healthy in Wetter Weather
### What we can do
- West Nile Virus and other diseases infect through mosquito bites. Rain followed by warmer weather leaves standing water that creates mosquito-breeding conditions.
- Always “Drain after the rain” to prevent mosquitoes from breeding.
- Wear long sleeves and pants, and use repellent when outdoors. Hard ticks can spread diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted fever. Mosquito and Vector Control Districts remind us to cover up when outdoors.
- Prepare your home and street before storms by clearing gutters and grates.
- Add drainage on the sides of your driveway, or consider replacing an asphalt or concrete driveway with gravel, permeable pavers, or other permeable materials.
- Sign up for emergency alert notifications such as Sacramento-Alert.org to quickly receive information on emergencies.
- Plan Ahead! Visit SacramentoReady.org for an Are You Prepared Guide and information on staying safe during storms.
- Use landscaping to protect your property and the environment. Reduce, divert, and filter storm runoff by creating a swale or rain garden, or using heavier mulch.
- Residents in the American River Basin can get a household rebate of up to $500 to install a rainwater catchment system. Check online to see if you qualify.
- Adopt environmentally friendly practices, and maintain social and support networks to cope with extreme events.
- Check on elderly, family and neighbors to see that they’re safe and have what’s needed.

1. **On-Call Engineering Support Services (R & W)**  
   Mr. Watson informed the committee that the Request for Proposals (RFP) for On-Call Engineering Support Services was issued and twelve (12) firms submitted proposals. He explained that staff recommends entering into contracts with the various firms since they will provide expertise in different and overlapping areas similar to last year.  

   Mr. Watson explained that each contract would be under the $50,000 per agreement amount that is within the General Manager’s spending authority; however, he wanted to make sure that the committee and Board understood the reason for having the separate consulting firms for engineering support. Mr. Helliker pointed out that the contracted expenses will remain within the FY2019-20 budget of $300,000. Director Rich agrees with staff’s recommendation and that it is in the best interest of the District.  

   **For information only; no action requested.**  

2. **Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project Design Services (W)**  
   Mr. Watson provided the committee with a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He informed the committee that the RFP to complete the design of the Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project was issued August 15, 2019, and twenty (20) firms were directly informed of the RFP. He explained that two (2) firms and one sub-contractor were present at the pre-proposal meeting, and both of those firms submitted proposals.  

   Mr. Watson informed the committee that the review panel ranked the technical proposal from HDR Engineering as the top proposal and then opened the cost proposals. He explained that based on these reviews, HDR Engineering is the recommended consultant to complete the project.

The Engineering Committee recommends approval of a contract with HDR Engineering, Inc., for the completion of the design of the Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project

In response to Director Rich’s question, Mr. Watson informed the committee that he and Ms. Silva met with the engineer from the state via teleconference a few weeks ago regarding the SRF application process. Mr. Watson explained that the project is projected to start in November 2020; however, the District might need to have a bridge loan in place for the construction phase in case the SRF loan is delayed. The committee discussed the project including smaller projects that might be included with the main project, and the history of Hinkle Reservoir.

3. Other Engineering Matters  
Mr. Barela provided an update on the SSWD Antelope Transmission Pipeline inspection regarding sand and anthracite material found by Sacramento Suburban Water District in the pipeline. He reported that the consultant inspected the pipeline and nothing was found. He informed the committee that SSWD is now receiving water through the pipeline. He also informed the committee that SSWD was sent the standard form regarding claims in case any customers find the material in their water.

Mr. Pierson reported that the Fair Oaks 40 pipeline rehabilitation was completed today with some of the punch list items finalized. Staff is satisfied with the work performed and the project is now complete. In addition, the Douglas Blvd. project is also complete.

4. Public Comment  
There were no public comments.

The meeting was adjourned at 10:09 a.m.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

To: Board of Directors  
From: Rob Watson, P.E., Engineering Services Manager  
Date: September 25, 2019  
Subject: Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project Design  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a recommendation from the Committee for a Board motion to approve entering into a Professional Services Agreement with HDR Engineering, Inc., for the Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project Design in the amount of $940,014.00 with a total authorized budget of $1,034,000.00 which includes a 10% contingency. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Engineering Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The existing Hinkle Reservoir Cover and Liner was originally installed during the 1979-1980 Hinkle Reservoir improvements construction project. This existing liner and cover has now reached the end of its useful lifespan and must be replaced. The design of the liner and cover replacement is to be completed in FY 19/20 with construction to be completed during the winter months of FY 21.  

**CURRENT STATUS**  
On August 15, 2019, the District issued an RFP requesting proposals for professional engineering services to complete the design of the liner and cover replacement. Twenty (20) engineering/design firms were directly informed of the project and invited to propose. On August 28, 2019, a pre-proposal meeting was held at the District to provide prospective firms to receive information about the project, ask questions and walk the site. Three firms attended the pre-proposal meeting. Two firms submitted proposals on September 16th, 2019. Each Technical Proposal was independently reviewed by members of a five person panel who ranked them on the basis of project-specific criteria such as; project understanding, work plan, experience and qualifications, and project schedule. The reviewers unanimously ranked HDR Engineering, Inc. as the top Technical Proposal. Subsequent to the technical ranking, the Cost Proposals were opened and reviewed. The following table summarizes the proposed costs from each firm.  

| Design Consulting Firm | Proposed Cost  |
|------------------------|----------------|
| CDM Smith              | $1,098,536     |
| HDR Engineering, Inc.  | $940,014       |

Based on the reviewer’s evaluation it was determined that interviews would not be necessary, and that HDR Engineering, Inc. is the recommended consultant to complete the project.  

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
The project was budgeted at $785,100 in the District’s adopted FY 19/20 Wholesale Budget. The Hinkle Operational Planning task has already used $216,480 of that budget, leaving a remaining authorized budget amount of $568,620. This requested contract approval amount above will require adding $465,380 from the reserves to the authorized budgeted amount.

# AGENDA ITEM VIII-2
**DRAFT**

**Finance Committee Meeting Minutes**  
**San Juan Water District**  
**September 24, 2019**  
**4:00 p.m.**

**Committee Members:**  
Ted Costa, Director (Chair)  
Ken Miller, Director  

**District Staff:**  
Paul Helliker, General Manager  
Donna Silva, Finance Director  

1. **Review General Manager Reimbursements (W & R)**  
   There was no reimbursement request from the General Manager.

2. **Review Check Register from August 2019 (W & R)**  
   The committee reviewed the August 2019 check registers and found them to be in order.

3. **Reserve Policy Status Update (W & R)**  
   Staff had asked the Board of Directors to consider an amendment to the District’s Reserve Policy at the June 29, 2019 Board Meeting. The amendment would have changed the allocation of property tax revenues between wholesale and retail. At the Board Meeting, Director Costa inquired as to whether or not the property taxes were voter approved and designated for debt repayment. Staff advised they would investigate and return with the results.  
   Ms. Silva advised that the Property Taxes had previously been pledged for repayment of a debt issuance, but that debt has long since been repaid. The property taxes are a general revenue source and the Board has full discretion on how to allocate and spend them. Mrs. Silva advised that staff no longer recommends the change to the allocation methodology as the retail service area benefits from the property taxes received from parcels in Citrus Heights, Fair Oaks and a portion of the City of Folsom, which offsets the approximate 7% of property taxes received from parcels in the retail service area which go to the Wholesale division as a result of the current 50-50 allocation.

4. **Other Finance Matters (W & R)**  
   Director Costa asked the General Manager to inquire into the opportunity for using property near the Antelope Pump Station, owned by the Sacramento Suburban Water District, for the purposes of installing and operating an injection well.

5. **Public Comment**  
   Tom Gray, General Manager of the Fair Oaks Water District and resident of the San Juan Water District Retail Service area, advised that the Fair Oaks Water District is currently working on constructing an ASR well and would potentially be interested in partnering with other agencies such as the San Juan Water District in an ASR project.

Tom Gray advised that approximately 10 years ago he advised that it appeared that all booster pump stations in the retail service area were previously owned by the wholesale division and now appear to be owned by retail, yet there does not appear to have been compensation provided for the exchange of assets. Mr. Gray said he would provide his research documentation to San Juan Water District for review. General Manager Paul Helliker said he would investigate and report back on the matter.

Tom Gray complimented the current management team at San Juan Water District for being respectful and professional.

The meeting was adjourned at 4:29 p.m.
