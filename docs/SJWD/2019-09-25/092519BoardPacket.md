President Rich called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m.

I. **ROLL CALL**  
The Board Secretary took a roll call of the Board. The following directors were present: Ted Costa, Marty Hanneman, Ken Miller, Dan Rich and Pam Tobin.

II. **PUBLIC FORUM**  
There were no public comments when the agenda item was opened. President Rich called for public comments later in the agenda. Tom Gray, Fair Oaks Water District General Manager, addressed the Board, provided a handout which was sent to GM Helliker and will be attached to the meeting minutes, and stated that he had four comments to submit from the FOWD Board: 1) Referencing a letter from FOWD Director Misha Sarkovich, dated August 15, 2019, which was addressed to Director Costa, GM Gray inquired if the letter and related comments from the other wholesale customer agencies, which are not on tonight’s agenda, would be addressed by the SJWD Board; 2) Inquired about the status and proposed action for agenda item VI-4 titled, “Approve Amendment to Reserve Policy” from the June 26th Board meeting since the meeting minutes stated that this item would be continued to the next meeting; 3) Inquired why the June 26th Board agenda item III-5 titled, “Regional Water Meter Replacement Program MOU – Amendment #1” was listed as both a wholesale and retail item; and 4) Would like to know why the “SSWD Antelope Transmission Pipeline Inspection”, which was on tonight’s Consent Calendar, was a wholesale project at almost $200,000, and not part of the Pump Back Project, which was paid by the agencies that participated in that project. President Rich directed GM Helliker to respond in writing to the questions from FOWD. GM Helliker commented that for item 1, the general managers will be meeting September 19th which will discuss that topic. Director Miller suggested that letters or inquiries from another agency should be addressed to the Board President, or the entire Board, and copied to the General Manager and to Legal Counsel (when it applies to contracts).

III. **CONSENT CALENDAR**  
All items under the consent calendar are considered to be routine and are approved by one motion. There will be no separate discussion of these items unless a member of the Board, audience, or staff request a specific item removed after the motion to approve the Consent Calendar.

GM Helliker informed the Board that the Engineering Committee reviewed the Consent Calendar items 5-10 on August 23, 2019, and recommended them for approval.

# IV. OLD BUSINESS

## 1. Compensation Policy (W & R)
Ms. Silva informed the Board that the Compensation Policy was reviewed and approved by the Board in September 2017. A staff report was included in the Board packet and will be attached to the meeting minutes. She explained that there are 3 changes that are being requested:
1. Amending the policy to reflect “market median”, instead of “market average”
2. Setting the comparator agencies
3. Minor edits and language changes to section 6.5.7 for clarity and readability, to help reduce the possibility of pension spiking

Director Costa voiced concern regarding how salary increases affect PERS unfunded liability, and Ms. Silva explained that PERS unfunded liability will not be affected by these changes. Director Costa inquired if employees were informed of tonight’s meeting and whether they had objections to the policy changes. GM Helliker informed the Board that he has met with employees, and they are glad that the comparator agencies will be kept constant.

Director Hanneman moved to approve proposed amendments to the Board of Directors’ Compensation Policy regarding market position and other matters. Director Costa seconded the motion and it carried with 4 Aye votes (Costa, Hanneman, Miller, Rich) and 1 No vote (Tobin).

## 2. Compensation Study – Approval of Compensation Schedules (W & R)
Ms. Silva informed the Board that Shellie Anderson, Bryce Consulting, will be presenting information on how the compensation schedules were developed after the Board selected market median as their target in June. A staff report was included in the Board packet and will be attached to the meeting minutes.

Ms. Anderson informed the Board that the compensation schedules were created based on market median of the 14 comparator agencies that were in the study. She explained that each classification was reviewed and the percentage difference under total compensation was then applied to the maximum base salary. She explained that this brought the District’s total compensation average to less than 1% from the market median.

Ms. Anderson informed the Board that a matrix of salary ranges was created to provide some consistency with regard to the minimum and maximum salary ranges. She explained that each classification maximum base salary was then
<!-- Page 8 -->
![August 28, 2019, Board Minutes Page 5](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=August+28%2C+2019%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+5)

compared to the matrix and the range closest to the maximum base salary was then selected for that classification. This process was used to create Compensation Schedule B.

Ms. Anderson informed the Board that there are two ways to handle classifications that are over the market median: 1) y-rate the classification until the market catches up; or 2) create two separate compensation schedules – one for existing employees (schedule A) and one for new employees (schedule B). She explained that, if the first option was used, an employee who earns a promotion from a level I to a level II within their classification might end up making less than what they were earning as a level I. She explained that, with two compensation schedules, compensation schedule A would be frozen for existing employees while schedule B would have COLAs applied to it; therefore, if positions on schedule A caught up with schedule B, those positions would be removed from schedule A. Therefore, she recommends that the District maintain two separate compensation schedules.

Director Hanneman moved to approve the San Juan Water District Compensation Schedules A and B. Director Miller seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

3. Collaboration/Integration Project Draft Request for Proposals (W & R)  
GM Helliker informed the Board that there are six agencies interested in participating in the Sacramento Region Water Utility Collaboration/Integration Study: Carmichael Water District (CWD), Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD), Rio Linda/Everett Community Water District (RLECWD), Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD), San Juan Water District (SJWD), and the City of Folsom (Folsom).

GM Helliker explained that one item in the RFP that the committee discussed was four meetings of all the participating agencies’ board of directors/city council. He commented that holding four meetings of all agencies would probably be very difficult to schedule; therefore, they will be recommending that only one final meeting be included in the scope of work for the consultant. In addition, each board can proceed with designating members to an ad hoc committee. He informed the Board that a per meeting cost will be obtained from the consultant in case the ad hoc committee requests more meetings. GM Helliker stated that if the Board was in agreement then the RFP will be revised. There were no objections.

GM Helliker informed the Board that the RFP will be released in a few weeks after the general managers confirm the revisions, the proposals will be received, a proposed cost allocation methodology will be developed, and the final contract will be brought back to the Board with the proposed cost allocation. He confirmed that the deliverables in the RFP did not change. He expects a contract will be in place with the consultant in November and the project should take about six months. In response to Director Costa’s question about the composition on the committee, GM Helliker explained that it will be the Board’s decision on who the
<!-- Page 9 -->
![August 28, 2019, Board Minutes Page 6](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=August+28%2C+2019%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+6)

representatives assigned to the committee are which could be two Board members or one Board member and a staff person.

In response to Director Miller’s questions, Director Hanneman informed the Board that the 2x2 SSWD/SJWD ad hoc committee is going dormant. GM Helliker responded that the contract for the consultant will be brought back to the Board for a decision to participate in the study and designation of representatives to a new committee. In addition, Director Miller voiced concern regarding the controlling committee and the cost allocation being wholesale not just retail. President Rich and GM Helliker confirmed that the whole Board will decide the District’s participation in the contract for the study. Director Hanneman explained that, by forming a new committee, the participating agencies will be brought into the discussions.

4. District Strategic Plan and FY 18-19 Operations Plan Report Card (W & R)  
GM Helliker informed the Board that the performance metrics in the Strategic Plan need to be updated since they pertain to FY 2018-19 targets once the 2019-20 Operations Plan is reviewed with the Board. He reported that the Strategic Plan goals and performance metrics continue to be relevant and more details regarding those items are included in the Operations Plan.

GM Helliker reported that the FY 2018-19 Operations Plan Report Card was included in the Board packet. He explained that there are some items that, for various reasons, were moved to the FY 2019-20 Operations Plan Report Card or changed such as the outsourcing of payroll.

V. NEW BUSINESS

1. FY 2019-20 Operations Plan (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed the FY 2019-20 Operations Plan, which will be attached to the Board minutes. He reported that the amendment to the Reserve Policy regarding property tax revenues was on the Operations Plan; however, at the request of Director Costa, this item was further researched and will be discussed at the Finance Committee meeting.

GM Helliker informed the Board that the Urban Water Management Plan is due in 2021 and the demand analysis project that is being worked on will help with that plan. He explained that the demand analysis project is a wholesale project because it pertains to treatment plant capacity.

2. ACWA Region Elections 2020-21 Term (W & R)  
GM Helliker informed the Board that the deadline to submit the ACWA Region elections ballot is September 30, 2019. He explained that the ballot contains the nominating committee’s recommended slate and an option to select specific candidates for each position. Director Tobin commented that by voting for her for Vice Chair would be consistent with the resolution that the Board adopted in support of her as Vice Chair for Region 4. The Board discussed the option to
<!-- Page 10 -->
![August 28, 2019, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=August+28,+2019,+Board+Minutes)

select individual candidates instead of voting for the nominating committee’s recommended slate.

Director Hanneman moved to cast a ballot for ACWA Region 4 with the following marked: Mark Emmerson for Chair; Pam Tobin for Vice Chair; and Bryan Busch, Thomas McGurk, John Mensinger, Kristin Sicke and Dan York for Board Members. Director Miller seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

Director Tobin commented that the nomination paperwork for the ACWA Board Vice President position is due September 3rd, and a copy of the documents were given to the Board. She commended Mr. Zlotnick and the Board Secretary for their assistance in this process. GM Helliker commented that the Region Board ballots will be tabulated in October and then announced, and Vice President candidate interviews are September 16th. Mr. Zlotnick commented that the nominating committee will announce their slate to the Board at the September board meeting. Mr. Zlotnick informed the Board that a candidate, who is not on the nominating committee’s recommended slate, could seek a floor nomination at the ACWA Fall Conference and there is a whole process to follow if that happens; otherwise, if there are no floor nominations then the nominating committee’s recommended slate is elected.

3. Active Shooter Training Update (W & R)  
Ms. Silva informed the Board that staff has undergone Active Shooter training as well as Workplace Violence training. She reviewed some high-level tips with the Board which includes the philosophy of “run, hide, fight” during an active shooter situation.

VI. INFORMATION ITEMS

1. GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT

1.1 General Manager’s Monthly Report (W & R)  
GM Helliker provided the Board with a written report for June and July which will be attached to the meeting minutes.

1.2 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence  
GM Helliker reported that Folsom Reservoir storage is about 78% full and 123% of average. He reported that the projected unimpaired inflow is 3.9 million acre feet (2.5 MAF is the average), which is 150% of normal.

GM Helliker reported that he and Mr. Zlotnick met with other participating agencies regarding the groundwater bank. He explained that one component of the regional water reliability plan was a recommendation to implement the groundwater bank and establish a governance committee. Therefore, Rob Swartz organized the meeting and they discussed the groundwater sustainability plan, which is on target to complete by 2022;
<!-- Page 11 -->
![Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=August+28%2C+2019%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+8)

sustainable operation of the aquifer; the groundwater bank relationships, rules and contracts; and federal acknowledgment of the groundwater bank.

GM Helliker reported that the State Water Board is proceeding with a draft regulation for monthly reporting which will require monthly production data and the percentage of residential. He explained that the residential data requirement is being objected to since R-GPCD is no longer relevant. In addition, it was pointed out to the State Water Board that many of their reporting requirements are redundant.

GM Helliker reported that there are many letters being submitted on the Resiliency Portfolio from ACWA, RWA, NCWA and other agencies around the state.

GM Helliker informed the Board that the managers and leads attended a two-day leadership training session, in house, at the suggestion of President Rich. The feedback received from those who attended the training was very positive, and the managers and leads will implement the tools that they learned.

GM Helliker informed the Board that Jim Peifer will discuss the RWA Strategic Plan at the next Board meeting and the ACWA Committee assignments will be finalized.

## 2. DIRECTOR OF FINANCE’S REPORT

### 2.1 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence
Ms. Silva reported that CalPERS announced a preliminary 6.7% return on investments for FY 2018-19, which is slightly below their target rate of 7%. She explained that they are on target for the long run on their newly reduced discount rate.

## 3. OPERATION MANAGER’S REPORT

### 3.1 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence
Mr. Barela reminded the Board that in February he discussed staffing and not meeting their goals, and the Board authorized staff to include funding in this year’s budget for outsourcing work for valve and hydrant maintenance. Therefore, staff has contracted with a company that will be performing maintenance work on approximately 300 hydrants and 300 valves. He reported that, with this additional assistance, staff is well on their way to reaching their five-year goals. In response to Director Tobin’s comment regarding loss of water on unauthorized use of hydrants, Ms. Silva informed the Board that staff is working on the fee schedule for fines on items such as this.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

To: Board of Directors  
From: Rob Watson, P.E., Engineering Services Manager  
Date: September 25, 2019  
Subject: Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project Design  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a recommendation from the Committee for a Board motion to approve entering into a Professional Services Agreement with HDR Engineering, Inc., for the Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project Design in the amount of $940,014.00 with a total authorized budget of $1,034,000.00 which includes a 10% contingency. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Engineering Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The existing Hinkle Reservoir Cover and Liner was originally installed during the 1979-1980 Hinkle Reservoir improvements construction project. This existing liner and cover has now reached the end of its useful lifespan and must be replaced. The design of the liner and cover replacement is to be completed in FY 19/20 with construction to be completed during the winter months of FY 20/21.  

**CURRENT STATUS**  
On August 15, 2019, the District issued an RFP requesting proposals for professional engineering services to complete the design of the liner and cover replacement. Twenty (20) engineering/design firms were directly informed of the project and invited to propose. On August 28, 2019, a pre-proposal meeting was held at the District to provide prospective firms to receive information about the project, ask questions and walk the site. Three firms attended the pre-proposal meeting. Two firms submitted proposals on September 16th, 2019. Each Technical Proposal was independently reviewed by members of a five person panel who ranked them on the basis of project-specific criteria such as; project understanding, work plan, experience and qualifications, and project schedule. The reviewers unanimously ranked HDR Engineering, Inc. as the top Technical Proposal. Subsequent to the technical ranking, the Cost Proposals were opened and reviewed. The following table summarizes the proposed costs from each firm.  

| Design Consulting Firm | Proposed Cost  |
|------------------------|----------------|
| CDM Smith              | $1,098,536     |
| HDR Engineering, Inc.  | $940,014       |

Based on the reviewer’s evaluation it was determined that interviews would not be necessary, and that HDR Engineering, Inc. is the recommended consultant to complete the project.  

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
The project was budgeted at $785,100 in the District’s adopted FY 19/20 Wholesale Budget. The Hinkle Operational Planning task has already used $216,480 of that budget, leaving a remaining authorized budget amount of $568,620. This requested contract approval amount above will require adding $465,380 from the reserves to the authorized budgeted amount.

# AGENDA ITEM IV-1

## Questions – Strategic Plan Update – San Juan answers

1. **What do you see as your agency’s greatest challenges right now and into the future?**
   - Repair/replacement of infrastructure
   - Water supply reliability and adaptation to climate change impacts
   - Increasing costs and declines in water sales (forced conservation, i.e. “efficiency”), combined with constant pressure to reduce or not raise rates
   - Increasing regulatory mandates from the State Water Board, including water loss regulations, water efficiency regulations, low-income rate assistance and potential impacts on water supplies from revisions to the Water Quality Control Plan

2. **What is your vision for the RWA?**
   - In the RWA strategic plan, RWA’s vision is defined to be: “Through regional cooperation and collaboration we improve our members’ abilities to effectively manage water resources to provide high quality water supplies to the public at a reasonable cost, to promote a sustainable environment, and to support a vibrant economy.”
   - This vision continues to be relevant and appropriate. SGA needs a similar strategic plan.

3. **RWA’s mission is to serve and represent the regional water supply interests, and to assist members in protecting and enhancing the reliability, availability, affordability, and quality of water resources. How do you think we are doing with respect to that mission? What more can be done?**
   - The mission is further defined in RWA’s strategic plan, via the four major goals (Planning, Implementation, Information/Education, Advocacy), with their related 13 Objectives and 38 Sub-objectives. As noted in the previous answer, SGA needs a strategic plan, as well, so that its mission, vision, goals and objectives can be defined in a similar manner, and the two plans can be considered together when assessing the performance of the jointly-managed RWA/SGA organizations. This is particularly true given that more and more of the priorities of the organizations are interrelated – for example, the top priority now for the Regional Water Reliability Plan developed by RWA is to implement the groundwater bank, to which the Groundwater Sustainability Plan being developed by SGA is directly related.

   - The following topics are high priority for RWA/SGA in the next few years (with references to elements in RWA’s strategic plan):
<!-- Page 18 -->
- Development and adoption of a Groundwater Sustainability Plan (Planning goal, Objective A, Subobjective 3; Planning goal, Objective B, Subobjective 4; Advocacy goal, Objective B, Subobjective 2)
- Legislation tracking and advocacy (Advocacy goal, Objective A, Subobjectives 1-5)
- Regulation tracking and advocacy – water efficiency standards and targets, water shortage contingency planning, water loss control (Implementation goal, Objective B, Subobjectives 1 and 3; Advocacy goal, Objective B, Subobjectives 1 and 3)
- Development and implementation of the regional groundwater bank (Planning goal, Objective A, Subobjectives 1 and 3; Planning goal, Objective B, Subobjective 4; Advocacy goal, Objective B, Subobjective 2)
- Climate change planning and adaptation strategies (Planning goal, Objective B, Subobjective 1)

4. If you could change anything about the RWA (and you did not need to rely on the votes) what would it be?
   
   Follow up question to question 3: Ask question three again with a focus towards:

   a. Governance  
   Ensure that the voices of all RWA/SGA member agencies are heard and perspectives considered. The HASTRART project in 2017 initially started out as an alternative to RWA’s work, but it was brought into the mix and ended up supporting RWA’s work on legislation.

   As more issues overlap between RWA and SGA (groundwater bank, climate change adaptation), ensure that the organizations are coordinated.

   b. Policy  
   Related to the comments on governance, ensure good coordination between RWA and SGA on policy positions and on organizational policies.

   c. Infrastructure  
   Not sure what this means – RWA’s facilities?

5. What do you think is the greatest value that you get from being a member of RWA?  
   A significant value that RWA provides is the role it serves of facilitating the development of a regional consensus on advocacy positions concerning legislation and regulations, which magnify the influence of any of its member agencies. RWA also provides good technical support and assists with funding opportunities on water use efficiency, water transfers and groundwater management, all of which are important facets of regional water supply reliability. SGA serves the important role of organizing the
<!-- Page 19 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

management of the region’s groundwater basin, a resource that is becoming more important by the day.

6. Where do you see opportunities internally within our region (for the region to work together)?  
   What can we do better collectively?  
   Regional water supply reliability planning and project implementation is an opportunity that would be helpful for the collection of agencies that compose RWA and SGA to continue to collaborate on. We are all connected via various infrastructure components, we jointly depend on two sources of water – the American River and the North American Groundwater Subbasin, and we collectively serve an integrated metropolitan region. Related to this is planning for climate change impacts, which RWA/SGA are better suited to do, rather than each member agency attempting to do so itself.

7. What do you see as the external threats to your water supply or your ability to serve water?  
   a. Possible follow up: Do you see a role for RWA in addressing the threat?  
   The primary threats to our water supply are variable climate (e.g., drought and floods), regulatory constraints, and aging infrastructure coupled with declining demand and increased costs in the face of constant downward political pressure on rates. RWA has been successful in organizing joint planning, fundraising and advocacy to address these threats. Perhaps an RWA organized and coordinated outreach campaign regarding “the value of water” would make sense in the not too distant future?

8. Do you feel that you are getting value relative to the dues that you pay to RWA?  
   a. What can we do to reduce costs to our member agencies?  
   Not much. There is considerable value beyond direct benefits provided in the coming together as a region and building relationships and increasing understanding of the unique circumstances of each member.

   b. How do these dues compare to other associations that you may belong to?  
   RWA (including water efficiency): $88,913  
   SGA: 10,100  
   RWA/SGA – groundwater bank ph. 1: 25,000  
   RWA – ASR project: 3,700  
   Water Forum: 14,426  
   ACWA: 21,213  
   CSDA: 7,252  
   Water Education Foundation: 9,000  
   NWRA: 2,000  
   AWWA/WRF: 28,119  
<!-- Page 20 -->
9. Considering the past strategic plan, what do you see that needs to be updated? What do you like about it? What don’t you like about it?

The functions and activities of SGA need to be addressed in a strategic plan, and given that SGA and RWA are both served by the same staff (and have significant overlap in the organizations that are members of each), having a coordinated or integrated strategic plan for both RWA and SGA is essential.

Many parts of the strategic plan continue to be important and are becoming even more so (see the answer to question 3). These should be renewed and potentially emphasized.

Some elements of the strategic plan, such as maintaining the integrated regional water management plan, collecting and publishing information about water usage by agencies, tracking progress with metering requirements are fading in importance as the programs/regulations that created those objectives/subobjectives are becoming dated.

a. Do you think goals are appropriate?  
See above

b. Do you think the objectives are appropriate?  
See above

# STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** September 25, 2019  
**Subject:** Resolutions for Funding Hinkle Reservoir Rehabilitation Project Through the State Water Resources Control Board’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Approve resolutions 19-05 and 19-06.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
Hinkle Reservoir is a 62 million gallon earthen reservoir which is Hypalon lined and covered. Hypalon is a flexible membrane material used to protect the water from contamination. The reservoir serves as the clear well for treated water produced from the District’s Water Treatment Plant (WTP), as well as a facility for system storage. The WTP is operated at a constant flowrate and therefore, to meet fluctuating and peak water demands, the Hinkle Reservoir is used to store excess treated water with the water level rising and falling with changes in demand and production. The cover and liner were installed in 1981 with an estimated life of 25 years. Regular maintenance has extended its life an additional 13 years. In May 2016, an expert membrane consultant inspected and tested the cover and liner material and reported that, based upon its analysis of the cover’s and liner's current condition, the District should replace both within the next 2 to 5 years. The Hinkle Reservoir Rehabilitation Project also will rehabilitate the inlet and outlet structures, repair ancillaries as needed, and replace the approximate 11 acres of cover, liner and interior baffle wall material.

Consequently, a plan to replace the cover, liner and interior baffle wall material, and to rehabilitate the inlet and outlet structures and other ancillaries as needed, was incorporated into the District’s Capital Improvement Program in FY 2016/17, with design starting in FY 2019/20, and a scheduled construction start in fiscal year 2020/21.

Total project costs are estimated to be $14,720,000. District reserves are not adequate to fund the project. The District’s financial plan assumed a traditional bond issuance would be used to finance this project. However, the District has applied for lower cost financing through the State Drinking Water Revolving Fund administered by the State Water Resources Control Board. The application process includes the submittal of four different application packages:
<!-- Page 22 -->
![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

- General
- Environmental
- Financial Security
- Technical

The General Application was submitted in February 2019, and the Environmental Package was submitted in July 2019. Based on direction received from our state loan representative, the District is now working on the Financial Security Package.

**CURRENT STATUS**  
Two resolutions are required to be submitted as part of the Financial Security Package as follows:

- **Reimbursement Resolution No. 19-05** – this resolution states that the District intends to expend monies on the project prior to approval of the loan funds. By adopting this resolution, the Board is preserving the District’s ability to get reimbursed for these expenditures and have them be part of the overall financing. Due to the timeline required to get an approved agreement from the State, and the timeline of the project, staff anticipates that a significant portion of the project expenditures will be expended prior to final approval of the loan documents.

- **Authorizing Resolution** – this resolution names the Director of Finance as the authorized representative of the District for signing applications, certifications, and agreements related to the financing.

The resolutions are attached.

**AGENDA ITEM V-1**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** September 25, 2019  
**Subject:** California Voting Rights Act and Elections Process  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Discussion  

**BACKGROUND**  
At the February 8, 2019, Legal Affairs Committee meeting, the committee discussed the then recent activity at the City of Citrus Heights to respond to a letter from the Shenkman Law Firm threatening litigation under the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA). If the City did not change their elections process from at-large to by-division, the City changed their elections process on June 27, 2019, via the establishment of five electoral divisions, which will be used starting with the November 2020 elections. Information about the requirements of the CVRA statute and the procedures for establishing electoral divisions is included in Attachment 1 “Discussion Points”.

The National Demographics Corporation tracks the revisions that cities and other public agencies in California are making to their electoral processes. Attachment 2 includes their current count of 195 jurisdictions that have changed from at-large voting. They count 8 special districts, which would include water districts.

We are currently aware of the following water districts that have made or are in the process of considering transitions from either complete or partial at-large voting:

| Agency                          | Date of Adoption     |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| Imperial Irrigation District     | November 17, 2015    |
| Cucamonga Valley Water District  | July 10, 2018        |
| Irvine Ranch Water District      | May 13, 2019         |
| Diablo Water District            | In process           |

# DISCUSSION POINTS ON THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT
## San Juan Water District Legal Affairs Committee Meeting
### February 8, 2019

- Cal. Voting Rights Act of 2001, as amended, is codified at Elections Code sections 14025 – 14032.

- EC section 14027 sets the standard: An at-large method of election may not be used if it impairs the ability of a protected class to elect candidates of its choice or its ability to influence the outcome of an election. Impairment occurs “as a result of the dilution or the abridgment of the rights of voters who are members of a protected class.”

  - A protected class is, “a class of voters who are members of a race, color, or language minority group” as further defined in the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965. (EC section 14026(d).)

- A violation of the standard is established by showing that “racially polarized voting” exists. (EC section 14028(a).)

  - “Racially polarized voting” means voting in which there is a difference between how members in the protected class votes versus the voting patterns of persons not in the protected class. (EC section 14026(e).)

  - Whether racially polarized voting exists is determined by methodologies developed through appellate decisions decided in federal and state voting rights enforcement lawsuits. In general, the approved methodologies involve statistical analyses performed by expert statisticians and demographers.

  - The analysis is not limited to the most recent election held by the agency against which a claim is filed. The analysis can look at historical trends in that agency’s elections, as well as trends in elections held by other agencies in the same general locality.

  - Lack of intent is not a defense – this is a strict liability issue.

- If a violation of the VRA is proven, a court may order the offending agency to change its voting system to “by division” (i.e., a Director must live in the division and is only voted for by voters residing in that division). The court also may award attorneys’ fees and costs. Public agencies that have tried to fight these claims generally have lost and, in some cases, have incurred several million dollars in attorneys’ fees.

- If San Juan were to receive a letter from a law firm like the one received by Citrus Heights or other written notice, which is a requirement of the VRA before a claimant may file a lawsuit, the Cal. VRA provides a “safe harbor” process for avoiding substantial liability. 

{00123514.1} 1
<!-- Page 29 -->
- The “safe harbor” process requires the agency to change its voting system on a very short timeline, in exchange for which the agency’s liability is capped at the actual amount of attorneys’ fees spent by the claimant, or $30,000, whichever is less.

- Within 45 days of receiving a violation notice, the public agency must decide whether to defend the lawsuit or implement the process to voluntarily change its voting system. If the agency chooses to voluntarily convert, its governing body must adopt a resolution within the 45-day period stating that intent.

- The resolution must outline the steps the agency will take to convert its voting system to “by division” and must implement those steps within the additional 90-day period granted by the VRA to complete the conversion.

- There are a number of required meetings and milestones that the agency must comply with, but they are beyond the scope of this discussion and therefore are not detailed here.

➢ The agency also must map the proposed new divisions. The divisions must be drawn in accordance with established law to be reasonably equal in population, and the divisions must be as contiguous and compact as possible, taking into account the extent of practical geography and the need to preserve communities of interest within a single division.

➢ Using the safe harbor process does not disenfranchise incumbents. The VRA safe harbor process permits an agency to create an orderly process in which incumbents are permitted to serve out their existing terms.

- But the VRA cautions that elections using the new electoral divisions may not be unreasonably delayed for the convenience of incumbents. Thus, the agency generally must implement the by division voting system starting with the next general agency election.

- There are creative ways to ensure an orderly change for incumbents by trying to draw new divisions so that incumbents up for reelection in the next election reside in the new divisions, and then having the remaining incumbents stand for election (or withdraw if they reside in another incumbent’s division) in the following election.

➢ The Uniform District Election Law (EC sections 10500 and following) and CSD Law also provide a process for San Juan to change its election system voluntarily at any other time. If the Board desires to change its existing “at-large” system to a “by division” system in the near future to negate any possibility of a VRA claim, it may do so using this alternative process.

### Conclusion:
July through August water deliveries to the wholesale customer agencies exceeded expectations due to higher than anticipated demand from both Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks. However, total deliveries are 538 acre feet below expectations due to less than expected deliveries of PCWA water to the the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD). SSWD experienced a blown valve that necessitated them to reduce their taking of PCWA water. During the repair media was found in the line. SJWT has been working with SSWD to inspect the line to ensure no additional media is in the line. Once this work is complete it is anticipated that SSWD will increase the amount of PCWA water we are treating and delivering.

---

1. **On-Call Engineering Support Services (R & W)**  
   Mr. Watson informed the committee that the Request for Proposals (RFP) for On-Call Engineering Support Services was issued and twelve (12) firms submitted proposals. He explained that staff recommends entering into contracts with the various firms since they will provide expertise in different and overlapping areas similar to last year.  

   Mr. Watson explained that each contract would be under the $50,000 per agreement amount that is within the General Manager’s spending authority; however, he wanted to make sure that the committee and Board understood the reason for having the separate consulting firms for engineering support. Mr. Helliker pointed out that the contracted expenses will remain within the FY2019-20 budget of $300,000. Director Rich agrees with staff’s recommendation and that it is in the best interest of the District.  

   *For information only; no action requested.*  

2. **Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project Design Services (W)**  
   Mr. Watson provided the committee with a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He informed the committee that the RFP to complete the design of the Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project was issued August 15, 2019, and twenty (20) firms were directly informed of the RFP. He explained that two (2) firms and one sub-contractor were present at the pre-proposal meeting, and both of those firms submitted proposals.  

   Mr. Watson informed the committee that the review panel ranked the technical proposal from HDR Engineering as the top proposal and then opened the cost proposals. He explained that based on these reviews, HDR Engineering is the recommended consultant to complete the project.

**Engineering Committee Meeting Minutes**  
**September 20, 2019**  
**Page 2**

The Engineering Committee recommends approval of a contract with HDR Engineering, Inc., for the completion of the design of the Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project

In response to Director Rich’s question, Mr. Watson informed the committee that he and Ms. Silva met with the engineer from the state via teleconference a few weeks ago regarding the SRF application process. Mr. Watson explained that the project is projected to start in November 2020; however, the District might need to have a bridge loan in place for the construction phase in case the SRF loan is delayed. The committee discussed the project including smaller projects that might be included with the main project, and the history of Hinkle Reservoir.

**3. Other Engineering Matters**  
Mr. Barela provided an update on the SSWD Antelope Transmission Pipeline inspection regarding sand and anthracite material found by Sacramento Suburban Water District in the pipeline. He reported that the consultant inspected the pipeline and nothing was found. He informed the committee that SSWD is now receiving water through the pipeline. He also informed the committee that SSWD was sent the standard form regarding claims in case any customers find the material in their water.

Mr. Pierson reported that the Fair Oaks 40 pipeline rehabilitation was completed today with some of the punch list items finalized. Staff is satisfied with the work performed and the project is now complete. In addition, the Douglas Blvd. project is also complete.

**4. Public Comment**  
There were no public comments.

The meeting was adjourned at 10:09 a.m.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

To: Board of Directors  
From: Rob Watson, P.E., Engineering Services Manager  
Date: September 25, 2019  
Subject: Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project Design  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a recommendation from the Committee for a Board motion to approve entering into a Professional Services Agreement with HDR Engineering, Inc., for the Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project Design in the amount of $940,014.00 with a total authorized budget of $1,034,000.00 which includes a 10% contingency. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Engineering Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The existing Hinkle Reservoir Cover and Liner was originally installed during the 1979-1980 Hinkle Reservoir improvements construction project. This existing liner and cover has now reached the end of its useful lifespan and must be replaced. The design of the liner and cover replacement is to be completed in FY 19/20 with construction to be completed during the winter months of FY 21.  

**CURRENT STATUS**  
On August 15, 2019, the District issued an RFP requesting proposals for professional engineering services to complete the design of the liner and cover replacement. Twenty (20) engineering/design firms were directly informed of the project and invited to propose. On August 28, 2019, a pre-proposal meeting was held at the District to provide prospective firms to receive information about the project, ask questions and walk the site. Three firms attended the pre-proposal meeting. Two firms submitted proposals on September 16th, 2019. Each Technical Proposal was independently reviewed by members of a five person panel who ranked them on the basis of project-specific criteria such as; project understanding, work plan, experience and qualifications, and project schedule. The reviewers unanimously ranked HDR Engineering, Inc. as the top Technical Proposal. Subsequent to the technical ranking, the Cost Proposals were opened and reviewed. The following table summarizes the proposed costs from each firm.  

| Design Consulting Firm | Proposed Cost  |
|------------------------|----------------|
| CDM Smith              | $1,098,536     |
| HDR Engineering, Inc.  | $940,014       |

Based on the reviewer’s evaluation it was determined that interviews would not be necessary, and that HDR Engineering, Inc. is the recommended consultant to complete the project.  

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
The project was budgeted at $785,100 in the District’s adopted FY 19/20 Wholesale Budget. The Hinkle Operational Planning task has already used $216,480 of that budget, leaving a remaining authorized budget amount of $568,620. This requested contract approval amount above will require adding $465,380 from the reserves to the authorized budgeted amount.
