# STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** January 11, 2022  
**Subject:** Selection of a New Board Member  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Direct staff to solicit applicants for the vacant seat on the San Juan Water District Board of Directors  

**BACKGROUND**  
On January 6, 2022, Director Marty Hanneman notified me and other representatives of the District that he was resigning from the Board of Directors, effective immediately. The Board must now determine the process it will use to replace Director Hanneman.

Pursuant to Government Code Section 1780, the Board may appoint a successor to Director Hanneman no later than 60 days after notice of the Board vacancy was received – which in this case would mean the deadline for a decision would be March 7. Government Code section 1780 does not specify a process for the Board to fill a vacancy, so that process may be structured as the Board chooses. Instead of appointing a successor to Director Hanneman, the Board could call a special election to fill the vacancy, which could occur no earlier than 130 days after the Board’s decision. If the Board decides on this course of action prior to January 28, the special election would occur during the June 7 primary election. After January 28, the election would occur as part of the November 8 general election, which would be the normal cycle for this position. Staff is investigating the cost of such a special election, but Sacramento County elections officials estimate that the cost of holding a special election just in that county to be over $1,000,000.

Should the Board decide to appoint the new Director, the Board would need to authorize the posting of a notice of the vacancy which would need to be displayed in three locations within the San Juan Water District service territory for no less than 15 days before it makes a selection. A copy of a draft notice is attached for the Board’s consideration. The notice would require that applicants submit a resume and a letter of interest.

**The following is a recommended schedule for this process:**

- January 11: Board authorizes staff to proceed with advertisement  
- February 11: Applications are due to the District  
- February 16: Board meeting – candidate interviews  
- February 22: Board meeting – candidate selection

**Staff Report: Selection of a New Board Member**  
**January 11, 2022**  
**p. 2**

Another option would be for the Board to appoint an ad hoc committee to review applications and recommend one or more candidates for the Board to interview and select.

Should the Board not act to either appoint a new Director or schedule a special election within 60 days of the notice of vacancy (March 7), the decision would then become the responsibility of the Board of Supervisors of Sacramento County because it is the county in which the larger portion of the District is located.

In order to be appointed to serve on the Board, applicants must be registered voters of the District. If the Board appoints someone to fill the vacancy, the appointee would hold office until the 2022 District election, which will be the first election in which the three seats on the ballot will be subject to the division-based elections process. The three divisions that will be on the ballot in that election will be Divisions 1, 3 and 5.
