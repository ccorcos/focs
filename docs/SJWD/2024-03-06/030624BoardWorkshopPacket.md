**STAFF REPORT**  
To: Board of Directors  
From: Paul Helliker, General Manager  
Date: March 6, 2024  
Subject: Strategic Plan – Update Process  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Discussion  

**BACKGROUND**  
In 2018, after six months of analysis, workshops, various iterations of a range of documents and support from a strategic planning consultant, the San Juan Board of Directors adopted a Strategic Plan (Plan) to guide the District’s operations. The Plan was intended to serve the District for a period of three to five years. Every year, staff prepare for Board approval an Operations Plan (Ops Plan), to complement the Plan, and define in more detail the specific priority tasks need to be accomplished in that year. Every quarter, the progress in accomplishing the tasks in the Ops Plan is reported via the Report Card prepared by District staff.

At the October 25, 2023, Board meeting, the Board agreed to update the strategic plan. The Board directed staff to review the current plan and propose revisions for the Board to consider. Staff have reviewed the current plan and believe that the foundation of the Plan is solid – the District’s mission, vision, values and high-level goals are not proposed to be changed. Staff reviewed the strategic plan objectives and propose various revisions. Staff also recommend deleting the metrics in the plan, as they have been superseded by the annual targets in the operations plans. At the January 24, 2024 Board meeting, the Board directed staff to set up a workshop to discuss potential revisions to the strategic plan, which has been scheduled for March 6, 2024.

The draft updated strategic plan is attached, for Board review and discussion.

![FOREWORD](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=FOREWORD)

Welcome to the San Juan Water District's Strategic Plan. With its 150+ year history and now more than 60 years of operation as San Juan Water District, the District continues to provide reliable water supply for communities in Sacramento and Placer Counties. Meeting the needs of our customers for reliable, high quality water supplies in an ever-changing regulatory and hydrologic environment can be challenging and requires thoughtful planning, as elucidated in this Strategic Plan.

Our mission, vision and values are the foundation for our operations and articulate our dedication to high quality service and environmental protection. The Strategic Plan encompasses these elements and outlines the goals and objectives that we will pursue to meet our mission and achieve our vision. The Plan incorporates the principles of fiscal responsibility, customer service and operational excellence.

This plan is our roadmap for the next two to five years, and will guide our decisions on annual budgets and operating plans. The Board of Directors and District management and staff will implement these plans to ensure efficient and effective operations that meet our commitment to our retail and wholesale customers, and our goal of protecting our water rights and supplies for years to come. The District adopts annual operating plans to implement this strategic plan, which include performance metrics and target dates.

President, Board of Directors

![District Overview](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
**DISTRICT OVERVIEW**  
The San Juan Water District (District) began as the North Fork Ditch Company, which started providing water to the area in 1854. The San Juan Water District, as it exists today, was formed as the result of petitions being presented to the Board of Supervisors of Sacramento and Placer Counties by Citrus Heights Water District, Fair Oaks Water District, Orange Vale Water Company, and a group of homeowners in South Placer County. An election was then held within the boundaries of the sponsoring petitioners on February 10, 1954. At this election, voters approved the formation of the San Juan Water District by nearly a two-thirds majority and elected five Directors. The District is a community services district formed under Section 60000 et seq., Title 5, Division 3 of the California Government Code.

The District provides both wholesale and retail water service. The wholesale area (which includes the District’s 17 square mile retail area) covers approximately 46 square miles in northeastern Sacramento and southeastern Placer Counties. The District wholesales water to San Juan Retail, Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks Water Districts, Orange Vale Water Company, and to the City of Folsom for its customers north of the American River. The District serves a population of approximately 150,000 within its wholesale service area.

The District’s existing water supply consists of three separate raw water contracts. The first source of water is a settlement contract with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) that provides, in perpetuity, for the delivery of 33,000 acre-feet of water from the American River based upon the District’s water rights, which date from 1853 and 1928. The second source is a permanent repayment term contract with Reclamation for 24,200 acre-feet of Central Valley Project water, that expires February 28, 2045, but which can be renewed. The third source is a contract with Placer County Water Agency for up to 25,000 acre-feet of water. All sources of surface water are either stored or flow through Folsom Lake and delivery is taken at Folsom Dam outlets, either by gravity or pumped by Reclamation’s Folsom Pumping Plant.

# SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT COLLABORATIONS

“Through Orange Vale Water Company's collaborative relationship with San Juan Water District, the Wholesale Metering Project was a huge success. The new meters provided greater accuracy in monitoring water supply and demand for our customers, enhancing overall customer confidence.” — Sharon Wilcox, Former General Manager, Orange Vale Water Company

“Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) has enjoyed a long and successful relationship with San Juan Water District (SJWD). The districts have worked together on multiple fronts for many decades. With the construction of the Cooperative Transmission Pipeline (CTP) in 1996, and its extension, the Antelope-Transmission Pipeline, the water transmission systems of both districts were connected. Since these transmission pipelines were built, SSWD has treated SJWD surface water and delivered it to SJWD as part of a successful SSWD-conjunctive use program. In 2014 and 2015, a pump station on the CTP was constructed allowing SSWD’s groundwater supplies to be pumped into SJWD in extraordinary drought and emergency situations.” — Dan Bills, Finance Director, Sacramento Suburban Water District

“San Juan Water District was a founding member of the Regional Water Authority in 2001 and remains a valued partner to this day.” — John Woodling, Executive Director, Regional Water Authority

“Through our yearlong efforts, San Juan Water District and South Placer Fire Protection District managed a successful multi-agency effort to redefine how residential fire sprinkler systems are designed and installed to provide greater confidence in their life safety operation while reducing possible cross-connection water quality concerns for all new developments.” — Chief Mike Ritter, South Placer Fire Protection District

![GOALS](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=GOALS)

The District has adopted the following goals to guide its operations. Each of these goals tells us what we want to achieve and where we are going. The objectives that relate to each goal define what we need to accomplish in the near term. Each year, District staff prepare a budget and operational plan for approval by the Board, which allocate the resources and specify the tasks necessary to achieve these objectives. Finally, performance metrics define the quantifiable indicators which we will use to measure our progress in meeting these goals.

- Ensure Water Supply Reliability
- Optimize Operations, Maintenance, and Delivery for High Quality and Reliable Water
- Ensure Customer Service through Consistent Access and Timely Responsiveness
- Operate the District Sustainably and in a Financially Sound Manner while Maintaining a Fair Rate Structure
- Provide a Capable High Quality Work Force and Ensure a Safe Work Environment
