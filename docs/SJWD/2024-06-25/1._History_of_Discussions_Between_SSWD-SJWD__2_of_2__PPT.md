# BACKGROUND

- Initially requested by SSWD in 2011
  - feasibility of consolidation of functions (e.g., inventory, purchases, etc.)
  - no additional functions were identified
- Previous effort spanned nearly 4 years
  - Better water management
  - Conjunctive use
  - Shortage conditions (e.g., 2015 Drought)
<!-- Page 14 -->
# PHASE 1
- SJWD and SSWD initiated conversations to identify possible functional reorganizations in 2011:
  - increase efficiency and effectiveness
  - functional items, such as purchasing, outsourcing, sharing of staff, etc.

  - Do nothing
  - Increase interagency cooperation
  - Consider organizational changes up to and including potential agency reorganization
- Initiated a Phase 1 Study
<!-- Page 15 -->
# PHASE I STUDY

- Very high level study focused on water resource management
- Three options for Better Water Management identified and studied:
  - Option 1 – continue as separate agencies without changes to water supply or outside agency approvals
  - Option 2 – remain separate agencies, but share resources through agreements that require outside agency approvals
  - Option 3 – Reorganizing the two districts
<!-- Page 16 -->
# PHASE I RECOMMENDATION
