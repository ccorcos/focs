President Zamorano closed the Public Hearing at 6:12 p.m.

In response to President Zamorano’s question, Mr. Barrett informed the Board that there is a 1% fee charged by Placer County and the District assesses a $27 late fee to the accounts. Both Vice President Costa and President Zamorano voiced concern about turning a customer’s water service off.

V. OLD BUSINESS

1. **Reduction in Take or Pay with Placer County Water Agency (W & R)**  
GM Helliker provided a staff report which was included in the Board packet. He explained that the District’s Urban Water Management Plan projects that the District’s future demand is approximately 32,000 acre-feet of water, which is below the 43,000 acre-feet of water supply that the District has as a minimum. In addition, there would be a savings of $62,500 – $75,000 annually with the reduction in the take or pay contract.

Director Rich moved to notify PCWA of San Juan’s reduction in its take-or-pay obligation by 2,500 AF to 10,000 AF, effective January 1, 2025, consistent with the terms of the entitlement contract. Director Miller seconded the motion and it carried with 4 Aye votes and 1 No vote (Director Tobin).

2. **Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)**

In addition, he reported that Orange Vale Water Company is still in the process of getting their project completed of adding the treatment system to their well.

GM Helliker reported that the water bank program committee meeting earlier this month was centered on previously banked water. He stated that the Sacramento Groundwater Authority’s water accounting showed that there has been over 400,000 acre-feet of water banked since 2010 and most of that by SSWD. However, there was a proposal at the last meeting to start with a zero balance for banked water, which SSWD and San Juan disagree with and SSWD estimates that there should be.

![June 26, 2024, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=June+26,+2024,+Board+Minutes)

at least 200,000 acre-feet of banked water accounted for. This topic will be discussed at the July meeting.

In response to Vice President Costa’s question, GM Helliker informed the Board that the 2x2 Ad Hoc Committee meetings with Fair Oaks Water District have been put on hold, as Chris Petersen (FOWD Board Member) mentioned at a previous San Juan Board meeting.

3. 2024 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed data which included the current reservoir storage levels across the state, data on releases, temperature and precipitation outlooks, and storage levels and projections at Folsom Reservoir.

GM Helliker reviewed DWR/Reclamation’s 90% and 50% exceedance forecasts regarding storage and releases. He informed the Board that there seems to be a discrepancy in the numbers which will be discussed with Reclamation. In addition, he reported that, even though this is a normal year for water, it is projected that Reclamation will not be able to meet the temperature requirements for the Biological Opinion standard of 65° at Watt Avenue. He stated that this is being discussed with Reclamation during the American River Group meetings.

VI. NEW BUSINESS

1. Introduction of Ordinance No. 24-02 Amending Ordinances 9000, 10000, 11000, 13000, 14000, 17000 and 18000 (W & R)  
GM Helliker informed the Board that Ordinance No. 24-02 is to amend ordinances 9000, 10000, 11000, 13000, 14000, 17000 and 18000. He reviewed the ordinance changes that were included in the staff report which was in the Board packet. He explained that staff reviewed the ordinances and provided recommendations for some changes which were then reviewed by the Legal Affairs Committee. In response to Director Tobin’s question, Legal Counsel Jones confirmed that he reviewed and agreed with the recommended changes.

In response to President Zamorano’s question, GM Helliker explained that if a customer has a leak, then they can request a one-time per owner leak adjustment credit. Mr. Barrett explained that the District receives approximately 10 requests for leak adjustments per month; however, since it is a one-time adjustment, some customers decline the adjustment after receiving the calculation that determines the credit, so there are probably only 1-2 leak adjustments applied to customer accounts per month. The Board requested that staff analyze leak adjustments and potential revenue loss should the policy be changed to allow more leak adjustments.

Director Tobin moved to introduce and waive the first reading of Ordinance No. 24-02 – An Ordinance of the Board of Directors of the San Juan Water District Amending Ordinances 9000, 10000, 11000, 13000, 14000, 17000 and 18000. Vice President Costa seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.
