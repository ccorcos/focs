# San Juan Water District
## Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget

### ABOUT THE DISTRICT
The San Juan Water District (District) initially began as the North Fork Ditch Company dating back to 1854 providing water to the area. The District, as in existence today, was formed as the result of petitions being presented to the Board of Supervisors of Sacramento and Placer Counties by Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD), Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD), Orange Vale Water Company (OVWC) and a group of homeowners in South Placer County. An election was then held within the boundaries of the sponsoring districts including the District’s current Placer County service area on February 10, 1954. At this election, voters approved the formation of the San Juan Water District by nearly a two-thirds majority and elected five Directors. The District is a Community Services District formed under Section 61000 et seq., Title 6, Division 3 of the California Government Code.

The District provides water on a wholesale and retail basis to an area of approximately 17 square miles for retail and 46 square miles for wholesale (which includes the retail area) in Sacramento and Placer Counties.

The District’s wholesale operations include: protecting access to reliable and sufficient water supplies; operating and maintaining a surface water treatment plant; operating and maintaining treated water storage; pumping and transmission facilities; delivering treated water to five retail agency customers (the District’s retail division, CHWD, FOWD, OVWC and the City of Folsom (Ashland)); and providing the administrative support necessary to successfully carry out those functions.

In addition, the District has a contract with the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) to treat and wheel water that they purchase from the Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) and/or the United States Bureau of Reclamation (215 Water). SSWD’s ability to purchase water from PCWA, diverted from Folsom Reservoir, is restricted to years when the unimpaired inflow to Folsom Lake exceeds a certain level. SSWD also at times accesses excess flows into Folsom made available by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Additionally, in 2020 the District began selling a portion of its water supplies to SSWD with such supplies generally available in all water year types. These agreements are negotiated on an annual basis.

The District’s retail operations consist of operating and maintaining storage, pumping, transmission and distribution facilities, which deliver water to approximately 10,900 retail service connections located in a portion of Northeast Sacramento County and the Granite Bay area of South Placer County, and providing the administrative, customer service, water efficiency, and engineering support necessary to successfully carry out those functions.

The District’s existing water supply consists of three separate raw water contracts. The first source of water comes from a settlement contract with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) whereby it is required to deliver the District’s pre-1914 and post-1914 water rights water from the American River, totaling 33,000 acre-feet, in perpetuity. The second source is a water repayment contract with Reclamation for 24,200 acre-feet.

## San Juan Water District
### Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget

- The District has access to 36,941 acre-feet of Central Valley Project water, also in perpetuity, subject to standard shortage policies. The third water source is a contract with PCWA for up to 25,000 acre-feet of water.

- All sources of surface water are either stored or flow through Folsom Lake with delivery taken from Folsom Dam outlets, either by gravity or pumped by Reclamation’s Folsom Pumping Plant. Total raw water delivery to the plant for the 2022-2023 fiscal year was 36,941 acre-feet and is anticipated to be 43,974 acre-feet for fiscal year (FY) 2023-24, and 40,662 for FY 2024-25.

- In response to the last drought and in preparation of future drought conditions, the District partnered with two nearby water districts, PCWA and SSWD, to construct inter-ties to allow water supplies to be shared and transferred if normally available supplies are reduced and/or inadequate to meet immediate demands for either district.

- The District has long been a proponent and practitioner of cost-effective water efficiency programs. The implementation of these programs has been highly successful, and the District complies with best management practices that are required by the Sacramento Area Water Forum Agreement, California legislation SBx7- (2009), the California Department of Water Resources, and the Central Valley Project Improvement Act.

### The District’s water efficiency programs include:

- **Water Awareness Poster Contest and Calendar** – Since 1992, the District and its wholesale agency customers, CHWD, FOWD and OWVC, have promoted water awareness at the elementary school level through an annual water awareness poster contest.

- **Rebate Program** – The District provides rebates for the purchase of high-efficiency washing machines, and hot water on-demand recirculation systems as well as weather-based irrigation timer rebates to both residential and non-residential customers.

- **Free Programs** – District staff provides free indoor and outdoor water audits, leak detection, and recommendations to improve irrigation system performance. Staff also creates landscape water budgets and irrigation schedules to improve efficiency. The District conducts and hosts a variety of workshops on drip systems and proper irrigation techniques, landscape design, soil health, tree maintenance, controller management and other water efficiency topics. A speakers’ bureau is available to talk to groups about water efficiency programs and water supply and reliability issues.

- **Water Efficient Landscape (WEL) Garden** – Located behind the District’s administrative office are gardens to inspire visitors to create a water efficient landscape that looks beautiful every season. The garden demonstrates efficient irrigation and non-water using materials to create a beautiful landscape.

The benefits of these programs include more cost-effective and efficient use of water and increased customer awareness on the importance of water efficiency to contribute to future reliability of water supplies.

The District’s water treatment facility, the Sidney N. Peterson Water Treatment Plant (Plant), was constructed in three phases beginning in 1975 and completed in 1983. The Plant includes two flocculation-sedimentation basins, two filter basins, an operations building and a covered 62-million-gallon storage reservoir. Major upgrades and improvements to the Plant have been made over the years, including increasing its maximum seasonal capacity (May 15th to September 30th) to 150 million gallons a day (mgd) from its original 100 mgd. The 62-million-gallon Hinkle Reservoir was rehabilitated in FY 2023-24. Those past upgrades, and ongoing efforts to identify and implement projects and process improvements to increase efficiency, cost effectiveness, and productivity, all contribute to the District’s success in reliably satisfying customer demands while continuing to meet or exceed all Federal and State regulatory requirements.

The Plant receives delivery of raw water directly from Folsom Dam outlets. The raw water undergoes an extensive water treatment process to ensure the highest quality of water for all customers. From the Plant, the water flows into the District’s 62-million-gallon Hinkle Reservoir for storage and distribution. The District maintains approximately 227 miles of transmission and distribution pipelines, which transport the high-quality treated water to wholesale and retail customers.

**Budget Purpose, Process and Control**  
The District operates on a fiscal year that runs from July 1 through June 30. The District adopts an annual operating budget and an annual capital improvement budget to ensure the adequacy of resources to meet District needs and to accomplish the District’s mission. California Government Code section 61110(c)(2)(f) requires the adoption of the final budget on or before September 1st of each year, however, the District strives to have an adopted budget by June 30th. As required by certain debt covenants, the annual operating budget is evaluated to ensure that net revenues, as defined by the various debt covenants, are equal to or exceed a minimum of 115 percent of the anticipated debt service for the budget year.

In March of 2018, the Board of Directors adopted a Strategic Plan which staff now uses as the guiding light in preparing an operations plan and annual budget. The Strategic Plan was updated in April 2024. Using the goals in the Strategic Plan, as well as direction received throughout the year from the Board of Directors, the Department Managers prepare and submit draft budgets to the Finance Department. The Finance Department prepares the revenue budget and reviews and compiles the various department budgets. A budget workshop is generally held in May of each year to present and discuss the draft budget with the Board of Directors and interested members of the public. Feedback from that meeting is used to adjust the draft budget, if necessary. A public hearing is then generally held in June after which the Board of Directors votes on budget adoption. The budget calendar, specific to the preparation of the FY 2024-25 budget, is presented below:

Budget to actual financial data is monitored continuously throughout the year by management and is reported on a monthly and annual basis to the Board of Directors. Beginning in February of each year, staff performs a mid-year budget review. The mid-year budget review process is an in-depth analysis of year-to-date budget to actual data, combined with a projection of financial activity through the end of the year. That is then compared to the adopted budget. If expenses, in total, are projected to be greater than the adopted budget, the board considers a budget amendment, or staff recommends budget cuts to ensure adherence to the adopted budget. The mid-year budget review is usually presented at the March Board meeting. The General Manager has the authority to move budget between specific lines within a fund, or between funds to correct posting errors. Transfers between funds, for purposes other than error correction, or to maintain required reserve levels, require approval from the Board of Directors.

# San Juan Water District
## Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget

### Budget Format
The budget is prepared on a modified accrual basis wherein revenues and expenses are reported when earned and incurred, respectively. The budget does not include amounts for depreciation, pension expense in accordance with GASB 68, retiree medical expenses in accordance with GASB 74/75, lease revenue/expense in accordance with GASB 87, compensated absences expense accrual and the amortization of premium or discount on debt issuances but does include an expenditure for debt principal and a revenue for any new debt issued. Therefore, the budget is not prepared in the same manner as the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR). The program budget format is used versus a line-item detail format to provide the most valuable information to the reader on all of the District’s major areas of service (Administration, Customer Service, Distribution, Engineering, Water Efficiency, and Water Treatment Plant). Expenditure data is also presented in a functional format (Salaries & Benefits, Materials & Supplies, etc.) to provide readers with an alternate view.

For financial reporting purposes, the District operates a single enterprise fund. However, for management of the two divisions, wholesale and retail, the District utilizes four distinct funds, one each for Operations and one each for Capital Outlay.

To ensure funds are available to meet both operating and capital needs, the District (for both Wholesale and Retail Operations) established a financial planning process with the development of a Master Plan that contains a review of current infrastructure, and that recommends projects for a twenty to thirty-year period. The District then estimates current and future operating needs and works with a rate consultant to develop a water rate study and financial plan.

The District updated its Wholesale Financial Plan and Rate study in 2023. The update resulted in a five-year rate plan, with the first rate increase effective January 2024. The rate schedule brings the fixed and variable components of the rate into alignment with the District’s fixed and variable rates, thus ensuring long term fiscal stability and rate certainty for the wholesale customers. The Wholesale Financial Plan recommends annual rate increases of approximately 4-5%, primarily due to expected inflation rates. The wholesale rate structure is currently being litigated by the Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks Water Districts. The District is confident that its rate schedule is fair, reasonable, responsible and prepared in accordance with the law.

The District completed a Retail Financial Plan and Rate Study in FY 2021-22, resulting in a 3-Year Rate Schedule. The new Retail Rate Schedule went into effect on February 1, 2022, and resulted in three successive 8% effective rate increases. In the previous five-year rate schedule, all rate increases were applied to the fixed base rate only, to bring stability to the rate structure and provide reliable funding to cover fixed operating costs. In the new rate schedule, this approach is taken for the first rate increase but the final two rate increases will apply to both the fixed and the volumetric rate as the District feels it has achieved equilibrium between rates and costs, to the greatest extent possible. The last rate increase under plan was implemented in January 2024. The District expects to begin an update to the Retail Financial Plan and Rate Schedule in calendar year 2025.

### Procurement Policy
The District’s procurement policy creates uniform procedures for acquiring equipment, and goods and services for its operations. The primary purpose of this policy is to provide for the purchase of materials and trade services with the objective that they will be available at the proper time, in the proper place, in the proper quantity, in the proper quality, and at the best available price, consistent with the needs of the District.

### Accounting System and Controls
The District uses the Tyler Technologies financial accounting system to record its financial transactions. Management has established a system of internal controls that provides a reasonable basis for protecting the District’s assets from loss, theft, and misuse, and that compiles sufficient reliable information for the preparation of the District’s financial statements. At the end of the year, the District prepares an ACFR consisting of management’s representations concerning the District’s finances. An independent auditing firm audits this report and examines District internal controls and provides an opinion on the financial reporting and provides suggestions on ways to improve the internal control processes of the District.

### Fund Structure and Descriptions
Legally, San Juan Water District is a single enterprise fund. For purposes of rate setting, reserve segregation and managerial reporting, the District utilizes four distinct funds as follows:

#### Enterprise Funds:
- Wholesale Operating Fund
- Retail Operating Fund

#### Capital Outlay Funds:
- Wholesale Capital Outlay Fund
- Retail Capital Outlay Fund

The funds are combined for the purpose of formal financial reporting (audited financial statements). Budgets and descriptions for these funds can be found starting on page 51.

### Budget Assumptions
A budget is an estimate of revenues and expenditures for a set period of time. The creation of estimates involves a set of assumptions. It is important that the reader of this budget understands the assumptions used in preparing the revenue and expenditures estimates contained herein. Listed below are the primary assumptions used in the creation of this budget:

- Wholesale rates increase in January 2024 and January 2025 in accordance with the Board approved Wholesale Rate Schedule.
- Retail rates increase effective January 1, 2024 (8.1% increase on both the volumetric and base rate). No retail rate increases for January 2025.
- **Wholesale water demand:**
  - No change in demand from regular wholesale water customers.
  - No water transfers.
  - 6,263 acre-feet of water being treated and delivered to the SSWD.
- No significant change in retail water demand.
- Property taxes increase 2%.
- Salaries prepared in accordance with Board Compensation Policy, utilizing CalPERS estimated wage growth.
- 11% increase in health care insurance costs.
- $200,000 supplemental payment to CalPERS towards unfunded pension liability.
- Property Insurance increase of 20% due to California wildfires.
- Liability insurance expected to increase by 10% due to claims experience and general industry cost increases.
- 28.99% increase in PG&E energy costs due to three rate increases from PG&E in 2024 thus far, and two more anticipated. 5% increase in SMUD energy costs.
- Absent costs from defending the District against the April 2024 lawsuit filed by the CHWD and FOWD, staff is projecting wholesale legal expenses to decline by 17.4% due to no anticipated activity on General American River issues and the winding up of the initial CHWD/FOWD litigation. Wholesale legal expenses will incorporate additional expenses due to the April 2024 lawsuit filed by CHWD and FOWD.

## Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget

### MAJOR REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES
In order to assist in understanding the fiscal trends facing the District, and the assumptions utilized in preparing this budget, the following discussion and analysis of the District’s major revenues and expenditures are presented.

#### Water Sales
Revenue from the sale of water accounts for 81% of all District revenues, excluding the proceeds from the issuance of debt. Water revenues are driven by two primary factors, the amount of water sold and the rate per unit. The Board of Directors considers and adopts rates through separate processes for wholesale and retail. Wholesale customers are presented with a rate study and are given 150 days to provide comments to the Board of Directors on proposed rate changes. After the 150-day comment period, the Board of Directors review the comments and decide on rates for the upcoming calendar year.

Retail rate setting is subject to the provision of Proposition 218 wherein customers are provided with information on proposed rate changes and are invited to attend a public hearing on the proposed changes. Proposed rate changes can be denied if a majority of ratepayers submit letters of protest. If a majority of rate payers do not protest, the Board of Directors will vote on the proposed rate increase and set the effective date for any proposed and approved changes.

The District completed a Retail Financial Plan and adopted a 3-Year Schedule for retail water rates in January 2022. A Wholesale Financial Plan and 5-year Rate Schedule was approved in December 2023.

The four charts below depict wholesale and retail water deliveries and revenues over time.

![San Juan Water District Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+Fiscal+Year+2024-25+Budget)

As a result of the 2012-2016 drought, wholesale water deliveries reached a low in FY 2015-16. With the drought “officially” over, the District experienced an uptick in wholesale water demand in FY 2015-16, which continued through FY 2020-21, reaching a peak of 37,633 acre-feet of deliveries. The increase in water demand in FY 2020-21 was due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. People were staying home and using more water. When they started to return to work in FY 2021-22 water demand fell. With the absence of drought messaging due to recent wet winters, we have seen water use inch back up to an estimated 33,500 acre-feet of demand in FY 2024-25.

In addition to delivering water to its regular wholesale customers, the District frequently treats and delivers water to SSWD, which has a contract with PCWA for raw water that is available in years when the unimpaired flows in the American River are above a specific threshold. Furthermore, in years when SSWD’s PCWA water is not available, SSWD has purchased treated water directly from the District. The chart below shows deliveries to SSWD since FY 2014-15.

**Chart 3**

As with wholesale deliveries, retail water deliveries hit a low in FY 2015-16 because of the 2012-2016 drought. Deliveries increased through FY 2017-18 leveling off through FY 2019-20. Retail water demand increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as people were largely staying home, presumably doing a lot of gardening, and otherwise using more water. Deliveries declined in FY 2021-22 as people started returning to the office and spending less time at home. Demand increased in FY 2023-24 due to wet winters and no drought messaging. That level of demand is expected to hold through FY 2024-25.

**Water Sale Revenues**  

Chart 4  

Wholesale water sale revenues increased steadily from a low in FY 2014-15 to a peak in FY 2018-19. This period of revenue growth occurred for several reasons:  
- Increased demand from wholesale customers.  
- Treatment of SSWD water. While revenues from the wholesale customer agencies increased over this time period, total revenues were further increased by revenues from the treatment of SSWD's PCWA water, as indicated by the difference between the dark and light blue lines in the graph above.  
- Increased rates. On January 11, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a 5-Year Rate Schedule, which allowed for a 16% effective increase to go into effect on January 1, 2017, 9% per year for January 2018 through January 2020 and 5% in January 2021.  

Wholesale water sale revenues declined in FY 2019-20, despite the rate increase and increased sales to the wholesale customer agencies, due to SSWD taking less PCWA water. In addition, wholesale water rates were reduced on July 1, 2019, to reflect savings incurred by refinancing a debt issuance in 2017. Wholesale water sale revenues held steady in FY 2020-21, despite a planned 5% effective rate increase on January 1, 2021. Due to hydrologic conditions, SSWD was not able to take its PCWA water. However, the two water districts entered into an agreement wherein SSWD is purchasing treated water directly from the District. While the District earns more money by selling its own water to the SSWD, as opposed to simply treating their PCWA water, the amount sold was 2,340 acre-feet less than what was treated in the prior year, resulting in a decline in revenues. Wholesale water sale revenues fell in FY 2021-22 due to a general decline in demand, most notably from CHWD and FOWD. The last of the rate increases from the 2017 Wholesale Financial Plan went into effect on January 1, 2021. Rates remained unchanged, in total, until January 2024. Therefore, changes in wholesale water sales revenues from FY 2021-22 through FY 2023-24 are due solely to the changes in demand discussed previously. Revenues are expected to increase slightly in FY 2024-25 due to scheduled inflationary rate increases in January of 2024 and 2025.

## Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget

In FY 2014-15, retail water use dropped significantly because of the drought and conservation mandates. The District restructured their rates and at the end of the fiscal year, in June 2015, implemented a retail drought surcharge. Revenues for FY 2014-15 fell 7.8% from the prior year.

In FY 2015-16, water use continued its sharp decline but due to the drought surcharge and a 15% rate increase in January 2016, revenues were almost restored to FY 2013-14 levels. The drought surcharge was removed April 1, 2016.

FY 2016-17 yielded a 10.4% increase in revenues, mostly from increased consumption from the end of the drought.

The Board of Directors approved a 5-Year Rate Schedule that resulted in an effective 8% rate increase on May 1, 2017, and a 9% rate increase on January 1, 2018. Those rate increases, combined with increased consumption produced a 19.9% increase in retail water sale revenues for FY 2017-18.

In FY 2018-19, there was an 8% effective rate increase on January 1, 2019, but consumption was down 0.46%, resulting in a revenue increase of 4.43%.

Water sale revenues increased 11.5% in FY 2019-20 due to the 8% effective rate increases on January 1, 2019, and 2020, and stable consumption (0.55% decline).

The effective 6% rate increase on January 1, 2021, was expected to be partially offset by a 10% decline in consumption, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a revenue increase of 3.48%. However, the pandemic resulted in an increase, not a decrease, in water sales and the FY 2020-21 retail water sales revenues increased by 9% from the prior year.

Despite lower demand, retail water sales revenues increased 2.88% in FY 2021-22 due to an 8% rate increase effective February 2022.

Retail water sale revenues increased in FY 2022-23, despite a 10% decline in deliveries due to back-to-back 8% rate increases.

The last of the District's approved retail rate increases went into effect on January 1, 2024. With demand expectations being held constant, the District is expecting retail water sale revenues to increase by 4%, because of the January 1, 2024, 8% rate increase.

### Property Tax
Representing about 9% of total District revenues, excluding the proceeds from the issuance of debt, Property Taxes are usually the second largest revenue source. Property Tax revenue is shared evenly between wholesale and retail and has been designated by the Board of Directors to be spent on capital projects, not operations.

### Property Tax Revenues

![Property Tax Revenue Chart](attachment)

Chart 5  
Property Tax revenues have been steadily increasing over the past eight years, a result of the rebound in the housing market after the Great Recession (see Chart 5). This budget anticipates a 2% increase in Property Tax revenues. Property taxes are set in January for the upcoming fiscal year, based on January property values. Neither the pandemic, nor the recent interest rate increases, appear to have had a negative effect on property values.

**Proceeds from the Issuance of New Debt**  
The San Juan Water District strives to be on a pay as you go basis for funding the capital program. This means the District needs to build up significant reserves so that cash is on hand when infrastructure needs to be replaced. Most of the capital replacement program is funded with accumulated reserves. The existing reserves of the District are not currently sufficient to fund two large infrastructure projects:

| Project                                   | Total Project Cost | FY 2024-25 Debt Financing |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Kokila Reservoir Replacement               | $ 13,167,000       | $ 12,110,000              |
| Retail Groundwater Production Facility/Capacity | $ 5,150,000        | $ 5,150,000               |

The District expects to utilize the State of California’s Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund, which offers project financing at lower than market rate, for the Kokila Reservoir project. The District secured a loan agreement at 1.2% interest and a repayment period of 30 years for the Hinkle Reservoir project and an interest rate of 1.1% over 30 years for the Eureka Road Transmission Pipeline Replacement project through this program. The loan application for the Kokila Reservoir Replacement project is in progress, as is a potential grant application for partial funding of the project.

The money planned for the Retail Groundwater Production Facility is not sufficient to purchase land and construct a well. Therefore, the District is working with SSWD to provide funding for them to expand their groundwater production capacity. In return, the District would get capacity rights in their system. Because you must own the underlying physical asset to utilize the Revolving Loan Fund, the District anticipates issuing a tax-exempt bond to finance this project.

# Salaries and Benefits
Aside from the Capital Improvement Program, Salaries and Benefits represent the largest operating expense of the District.

## Salaries and Benefits

Chart 6 depicts a spike in Salary and Benefit costs in FY 2016-17, followed by a decline through FY 2018-19, then relative stability through FY 2021-22, beginning an upward trend in FY 2022-23.

The FY 2016-17 spike is due to the Board of Director’s decision to pay down the District’s unfunded pension liability. The District paid $4,112,000 towards this liability in FY 2016-17 and remitted an additional $2,787,800 in FY 2017-18, which, combined with extra annual payments of $200,000 toward the liability through FY 2021-22, and with favorable returns in the CalPERS portfolio, eliminated the District’s unfunded pension liability in FY 2021-22, saving approximately $8.8 million over the next 25 years.

![Chart 6](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Chart+6)

<!-- Page 38 -->

It is normal and expected for the funded status of the pension to fluctuate over time. The pension plan expects an overall positive return on investments in the long run, but fluctuations from year to year will happen. Due to the loss in the pension fund portfolio in FY 2021-22, the District once again has an unfunded liability. Future market performance will dictate future pension funding status, but in years where the District has an unfunded liability it is the Board's policy to remit extra payments to pay it down. This benefits the ratepayers in the long run because CalPERS charges interest on unfunded liabilities.

Prior to 2019, the Board’s target for total compensation was 10% over the market average. In 2019, the Board reduced that target down to “market average”. As a result, many employees’ salaries were frozen, thus the stability in salaries and wages from 2019 through FY 2021-22. Between 2019 and July 2022 the District lost over 25% of its workforce, either through retirements, or other employment opportunities. The District struggled to fill those open positions. In July 2022, the Board reversed course and set the target for salaries at 5% over the market average. Since that time cost of living adjustments have been awarded to keep salaries up with inflation. These two changes are the primary reason for the upward trend of salaries and benefits that began in FY 2022-23.

Salaries and Benefits are expected to increase by 13.8% in FY 2024-25 or $944,300 due to the following factors:

- Two Temporary part-time positions. The California Environmental Protection Agency is requiring all California water districts to identify the material in each customer’s water service line and to inspect the pipelines at schools and daycare facilities. The District needs temporary labor to assist in this endeavor. CalPERS requires that any individual working more than 960 hours for a CalPERS enrolled employer must be enrolled in the pension pool and both employer and employee contributions must be made into the plan. Utilizing different temporary employees to keep them each under the 960-hour ceiling is not allowed if the nature of the work is the same. Therefore, the District must enroll these temporary employees in the pension plan, even if they are hired through a temporary employment agency. If hired through an agency the District ends up paying both the employer and the employee pension contribution, as the employment agency is not an enrolled employer and has no mechanism to collect and remit the employee contribution. Therefore, it is more cost effective for the District to directly hire these temporary employees so that the District can collect and remit the employee portion, rather than absorbing the cost. Outside of the employer pension contribution and a minimum amount of sick leave required to be offered by law, the temporary employees receive no other District benefits. These positions were included in the FY 2023-24 budget but were not filled during the year. They are included in FY 2024-25 in case they are needed.

- Increase of 11% in health benefit costs.

- The District's compensation policy requires the salary budget to be prepared utilizing the same assumptions about wage growth as that used by CalPERS. The application of those assumptions is the cause of the remainder of the increase. CalPERS assumes an average increase in wages of 7.5%. The District awards cost of living increases based on the March over March CPI for West Cities B, so long as the total increase stays within the budget prepared by utilizing the CalPERS wage growth assumptions.

### Water Supply Costs
The District’s existing water supply consists of three separate raw water contracts. The first source of water is 33,000 acre-feet of water rights on the American River. The second source is a contract with Reclamation for 24,200 acre-feet of Central Valley Project water. The third water source is a contract with PCWA for up to 25,000 acre-feet of water. All sources of surface water are either stored or flow through Folsom Lake and delivery is taken at Folsom Dam outlets, either by gravity or pumped by Reclamation’s Folsom Pumping Plant. Total water deliveries to the District from Reclamation for FY 2022-23 were 36,941 acre-feet and are anticipated to be 43,974 acre-feet for FY 2023-24, and 40,662 for FY 2024-25.

![Water Supply Costs](attachment://chart7.png)

As illustrated in Chart 7, water supply costs increased significantly in FY 2016-17 and again in FY 2018-19.

The FY 2016-17 costs increased for two primary reasons. First, in 2008 a surface water shortage and reimbursement agreement to provide groundwater supplies during times of surface water shortage was prepared and referenced in the signed 2008 Wholesale Water Supply Agreements. The District, in its capacity as the wholesale supplier, determined that there was a potential need for groundwater pumping between 2009 and 2013, and asked both CHWD and FOWD to maintain their readiness to supply groundwater. In 2014, due to a potential shortage in surface water supplies caused by a third year of drought, the District requested groundwater to be pumped. From 2009 to
<!-- Page 41 -->
![San Juan Water District Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget](https://example.com/image-url)  
2014, both districts maintained their readiness to supply groundwater, as requested; however, they did not submit invoices for the incremental cost until the District asked them to actually pump groundwater in 2014. At that time, the District was provided with a bill in the approximate amount of $4 million. The District disputed the amount, and the cost was settled in FY 2016-17 at $1,981,440, to be repaid over a 4-year period ending in FY 2019-20. The light blue bar on Chart 7 shows water supply costs for fiscal years 2016-17 through 2019-20 without the payment towards the groundwater reimbursement.

After removing the effect of the groundwater reimbursement, FY 2016-17 water supply cost were still higher than the prior year. The agreement with PCWA required the District to pay for 25,000 acre-feet of water, regardless of how much water the District actually took. However, in periods of drought, the District is allowed to pay for the greater of 10,000 acre-feet or the actual amount delivered. With the drought officially over in FY 2016-17, the reduced demand allowance ended and the cost of the PCWA contract rose accordingly.

Water supply costs decreased in FY 2017-18, despite increased demand. This was due to a reduction in the cost of water purchased from PCWA. Per the contract between the District and PCWA, the cost of PCWA water is calculated as the average of the District’s Central Valley Project rate and the Central Valley Project rate for the City of Rosville and PCWA. In addition, the District must pay Warren Act contract charges on the PCWA water it receives. Central Valley Project water rates and Warren Act charges are set annually by Reclamation. Due to an abundance of water supplies, Reclamation reduced the Central Valley Project rate by 35% for 2017, causing a like decrease in the District’s PCWA water rate. Additionally, in December of 2017, the District negotiated an amendment to the contract with PCWA wherein the take or pay amount was reduced from 25,000 acre-feet to 12,500 acre-feet. The District still has the option to take up to 25,000 acre-feet but is only required to pay for 12,500 acre-feet regardless of whether it takes the water or not. This cut the PCWA water supply cost to half of what it would have been otherwise.

The spike in costs in FY 2018-19 is a result of a groundwater substitution transfer. In FY 2018-19, the District sold 2,808 acre-feet of surface water to the Dudley Ridge Water District and the Kern County Water Agency. Both CHWD and FOWD used their groundwater instead of purchasing the District’s surface water. The District compensated them for the cost of the groundwater out of the transfer proceeds. The transaction yielded net revenues but increased the water supply cost in the process.

Water supply costs for FY 2019-20 were in line with FY 2017-18 with no groundwater substitution transfer and no substantial change in water demand.

The groundwater reimbursement payments to CHWD and FOWD were completed in FY 2019-20, reducing annual costs by $495,400. Thus, supply costs for FY 2020-21 decreased.
<!-- Page 42 -->
![San Juan Water District Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+Fiscal+Year+2024-25+Budget)

Water Supply costs for FY 2021-22 were lower than the prior year as the District is purchasing less water from PCWA thereby reducing the wheeling charges.

Costs rose slightly in FY 2022-23 due to an increase in the PCWA water and wheeling charges. The District anticipates paying approximately $20,000 in FY 2023-24 and $160,000 in FY 2024-25 for the environmental review necessary to renew the District’s Warrant Act (or wheeling) agreement with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.

The retail division purchases treated water from the wholesale division, the same as the other WCA’s. The green line shows retails’ water supply costs over the same time period as wholesales. The chart illustrates, in part, the difference in cost between raw water and treated drinking water.

## Capital Spending

### Capital Spending

| Year      | Amount         |
|-----------|----------------|
| FY 15-16  | $7,300,000     |
| FY 16-17  |                |
| FY 17-18  | $1,800,000     |
| FY 18-19  |                |
| FY 19-20  |                |
| FY 20-21  |                |
| FY 22-22  |                |
| FY 22-23  |                |
| FY 23-24 Est. |            |
| FY 24-25 Budget | $28,200,000 |

As illustrated in Chart 8 above, capital spending fluctuated from $7.3 million in FY 2015-16 to a low of $1.8 million in FY 2017-18 then increasing to a ten-year estimated high of $28.2 million.
<!-- Page 43 -->
![San Juan Water District Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget](https://example.com/image.png)

The large spike in FY 2022-23 capital spending was due to the Hinkle Reservoir Replacement Project. The Hinkle Reservoir is a 62-million gallon lined and covered earthen reservoir. The Water Treatment Plant operates at a constant flowrate and the reservoir is used to store excess treated water, with the water level rising and falling with changes in demand and production. In FY 2022-23 through FY 2023-24, the liner and cover were placed, the inlet and outlet structures were rehabilitated, and other ancillary repairs were made. Most of the project was completed in FY 2022-23 even though it will not be fully complete until the end of FY 2023-24. Total project costs are estimated to be approximately $25 million.

Another spike in capital spending is expected for FY 2024-25, this time due to retail capital projects, the largest of which is the planned replacement of the Kokila Reservoir. Kokila Reservoir is a 4.56-million gallon lined and covered earthen reservoir. The reservoir serves as an operational and emergency storage facility at a high elevation point in the District's retail service area. The cover and liner were installed in 1984 with an estimated life of 25 years. Regular maintenance has extended its life an additional 15 years. The cover and liner are now in need of replacement. The District intends to replace the Hypalon cover and liner with a concrete tank and is pursuing both a grant and a low interest rate loan from the State Water Resources Control Board's revolving loan fund to finance this project.

The remainder of the retail capital projects are a combination of adding or enlarging pipelines for better connectivity and fire flow, projects to increase operating efficiency at the District's various pump stations, and the purchase of capacity in a neighboring District’s groundwater system to increase the reliability of the District’s water supply to the retail service area.

A complete list of projects planned for FY 2024-25 can be found starting on pages 59 and 69 of this document.

## Reserve Summary
### Wholesale and Retail Total Reserves

**Chart 9**

The combination of the Great Recession, followed by the drought, resulted in the need to defer maintenance and capital projects, and utilize reserves to augment operations and critical capital projects. This is illustrated in Chart 9 by the sharp decline in District reserve balances between FY 2013-14 and 2016-17.

The District has taken several actions to improve its financial condition now and into the future, as described below:

- **Paid off Unfunded Pension Liability:** The Board authorized two large payments intended to pay off the District’s unfunded pension liability. The District was paying 7.5% interest on this liability, but only earning approximately 1.5% on its reserves. In May 2017, the District remitted $4,112,000, and in April 2018 the District paid $2,787,800. By drawing down reserves to pay down this debt, the District will save approximately $8.8 million through FY 2036-37, with annual savings of approximately $350,000. These savings will fund critical infrastructure needs which will help reduce upward pressure on rates. Through these efforts, the District was able to achieve a funded rate of approximately 95%, one of the highest funded rates in the State of California. With the pension plan’s FY 2020-21 investment return of 21.3%, the District’s pension liability converted to a pension asset. While this status is fluid, changing annually based on the performance of the CALPERS portfolio and subject to changing assumptions about future interest and mortality rates, it still signifies strong financial stewardship by the Board of Directors.
<!-- Page 45 -->
![San Juan Water District Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+Fiscal+Year+2024-25+Budget)

- **Debt Refinanced:** In May of 2017, the Board of Directors approved an advance refunding of the District’s Series 2009A Certificates of Participation. This refinancing will save the District approximately $11.2 million through FY 2038-39. The 2012 Refunding Bonds were refunded on February 1, 2022, with a private placement loan resulting in total interest savings of approximately $1.75 million through FY 2032-33.
  
- **Utilization of California State Water Resources Control Board’s Revolving Loan Fund Program (SRF):** The SRF grants low interest rate loans for drinking water capital improvement projects. While the process of obtaining the loan is long (up to two years or more), the low interest rate generates significant savings. For example, the District secured an SRF loan for the Hinkle Reservoir Replacement Project at 1.2% interest. If the District were to finance this project through a traditional bond issuance, the interest rate would have been closer to 4%, increasing debt service costs by at least $12 million over 30 years. The District utilized the SRF for the Eureka Road Pipeline Replacement project in FY 2023-24 and is working on a loan for the Kokila Reservoir Replacement project. The District intends to utilize the SRF program whenever possible.

- **Renegotiated Contract with PCWA:** In December of 2017, the District negotiated an amendment to its contract with PCWA wherein the take or pay amount was reduced from 25,000 acre-feet to 12,500 acre-feet. The District still has the option to take up to 25,000 acre-feet but is only required to pay for 12,500 acre-feet regardless of whether it takes the water or not. This cut the PCWA water supply cost in half, providing savings of approximately $275,000 per year, starting in FY 2018-19. The District had two take or pay contracts with the City of Roseville, totaling 4,000 AF per year. Under these agreements Roseville paid the District for 4,000 AF per year of the District’s 12,500 AF of PCWA water. The agreements terminated in FY 2022-23 and there are no plans for them to be renewed. Therefore, the District is considering further reductions to its take or pay contract with PCWA.

- **Adjustment to Rate Building Methodology:** Since completion of the 2017 Wholesale and Retail Financial Plans, the District has been slowly adjusting the rate structure so that the fixed portion of the rate is in better alignment with fixed costs. Structuring rates in this manner results in stable revenues that move with expenses and eliminates the need for unpopular special drought rates. The Board’s approval of these multi-year rate schedules has replenished reserves, ensuring that the District can continue its mission to deliver a reliable water supply of the highest quality at reasonable and equitable costs now and into the future.

- **Water Transfers:** As explained on page 9, SSWD’s ability to purchase surface water from PCWA or the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is constrained by the amount of unimpaired flow into Folsom Lake, and they are not able to purchase such water supplies in every year. In 2020, the two water agencies negotiated an agreement whereby SSWD purchased the District’s own treated water, which is generally available for sale in all water year types. The District sold roughly 4,768 AF to SSWD in FY 2020-21, 3,602 AF in FY 2021-22, and 3,170 AF in FY 2022-23. These water sales generated more than $2.5 million in treatment and wheeling revenue, as well as over $400,000 received for the water itself. In addition, the District has participated in regional groundwater substitution transfers in partnership with two of its Wholesale Customer Agencies – CHWD and FOWD. The first such transfer occurred in 2018 and another occurred in 2022. This latter transfer generated approximately $1.15 million in revenues for the wholesale division. All told, in the last two and a half years or so, these transfer activities undertaken by the District have generated approximately $4,000,000 in revenue for the wholesale division that otherwise would not have been received. This has been particularly helpful to stabilizing the budget because the treatment and wheeling revenue generated when SSWD is able to take PCWA water is subject to the vagaries of hydrology, which in recent years has not supported SSWD’s receipt of that water. The transfer revenues have been able to fill that hole and then some.

- **Salary Schedule Reduction:** The District has historically chosen to maintain salaries schedules that, when combined with benefits, put the District’s total compensation at 10% above average amongst the selected comparator agencies. In FY 2019-20, the Board of Directors reduced this target down to market median. Current employees were not subject to pay decreases, but their ability to receive future pay increases was substantially reduced. All new employees were hired into the new Compensation Schedule. Existing employees remained on their original pay scale until such a time as the new schedule was greater than their existing scale. The old pay scale was not able to receive cost of living adjustments, as it became obsolete. Given several factors, particularly the current tight labor market, the Board gave direction to staff to prepare a new salary schedule that is 5% above market median total cash. While these increased costs, there were significant savings in the three years prior and the District needs the increased salaries for retention and attraction of highly qualified employees.

While most of the District’s reserves are available to be used at the Board’s discretion there are a few reserves, recently established, that are restricted by law or agreement. The charts below illustrate the restricted portion of wholesale and retail reserves followed by explanatory text.

### Wholesale Reserves

| Year      | Capital      | Restricted   | Operating    |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| FY 2015-16| $11,203,318  | $5,859,912    |
| FY 2016-17| $6,708,354   | $2,175,888    |
| FY 2017-18| $510,012,861 | $2,390,365    |
| FY 2018-19| $16,168,310  | $1,784,360    |
| FY 2019-20| $16,890,133  | $1,733,735    |
| FY 2020-21| $16,281,430  | $1,834,921    |
| FY 2021-22| $18,784,423  | $2,053,361    |
| FY 2022-23| $2,729,455   | $2,101,691    |
| FY 2023-24 Est. | $25,881,827 | $2,001,891 |
| FY 2024-25 Budget | $29,999,627 | $2,306,191 |

Wholesale reserves peaked in FY 2021-22 just prior to the commencement of the Hinkle Reservoir Replacement Project, which has an estimated total cost of $25 million. The District secured a loan from the State Water Resources Control Board at a favorable interest rate of 1.2%, for most of the project costs. Due to delays at the State, most of the proceeds were not received until the middle of FY 2023-24. This will require the use of Capital reserves since most of the expenses were incurred prior to receiving the loan funds. This is the cause of the large dip in reserves illustrated above in FY 2022-23, and the increase in FY 2023-24. The loan agreement requires the District to hold one year’s worth of debit service (interest and principal) in reserve. This amount is shown in orange in the FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 bar of the graph. These funds will remain restricted and unavailable for use until the loan is paid off in 30 years. Wholesale capital projects are described in detail starting on page 59.

**Retail Reserves**

Retail reserves are anticipated to peak in FY 2023-24 as many of the planned projects got pushed into FY 2024-25 due to the time and attention needed by staff to finish the Hinkle Reservoir and Eureka Road Pipeline Replacement projects. There are a significant number of projects planned for FY 2024-25, thus the fall in capital reserves. Retail capital projects are further described starting on page 69.

The retail division has several restricted reserves. First is the Capital Facility Fee reserve. The District has established capital facility fees to ensure that new development either buys into the existing system, reimbursing existing rate payers for the investments previously made in the treatment and distribution system, or provides funding for the system to be expanded to support their development project, or a combination of both. On the wholesale side, the capital facility fee is 100% reimbursement or “buy-in”. But, on the retail side, the capital facility fee is a combination of buy-in and expansion. 70% of the retail capital facility fee is designed to fund future projects that have an expansionary component. If fees are collected in advance of project expenditures, then the District is required by California Government Code Section 66013 to hold the excess fees in reserve. The reserve was first established in FY 2021-22 and has grown due to a large amount of capital facility fees received in recent years.

Second, the loans for the Eureka Road Transmission Pipeline Replacement and the Kokila Reservoir Replacement projects both require the establishment of a reserve equal to one year of debt service (principal and interest) payments. This reserve must be maintained for the life of the loan.

## WHOLESALE CAPITAL PROJECTS FY 2024-25

### Water Treatment Plant (WTP) Improvements

#### Backwash Hood Rehabilitation and Rail Track Improvements
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2022-23  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $295,400  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $900,000  
- **Estimated Future Spending:** $900,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $2,095,400  

The final filtration of water occurs in the North and South basins which each have a series of filter cells along the bottom of the basin. Each basin has two backwash hoods that move across the basins to backwash (clean) the various filters. The backwash hoods suck water up through the filters and send the water back into the first treatment stage of the plant. Each basin currently has one new and one old backwash hood. This project assessed the structural integrity of the two old hoods and determined that they could be rehabilitated instead of being replaced (including the rail track upon which they move). One hood, and the rail track upon which it moves, will be rehabilitated this year and the other next year. This project will not materially affect ongoing operating costs.

#### Lime Tower Coating and Improvements
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2019-20  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $153,000  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $373,100  
- **Total Project Cost:** $526,100  

The lime tower stores and distributes lime into the treated water as it leaves the treatment plant. Lime is used in the treatment process to manage pH levels in the distribution system. The small amount of lime in the treated drinking water protects the District's entire distribution system from untimely corrosion. The lime tower is aged. The District commissioned a study in FY 2019-20 to determine its rehabilitation needs. The study recommends re-doing the interior and exterior coating. Design work started in FY 2022-23 and construction will commence in FY 2024-25.

#### Rehabilitation of 3 Backwash Pump Stations
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2027-28  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $0  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $58,000  
- **Estimated Future Spending:** $122,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $180,000  

The dirty water from the filters in the water treatment plant filter basis is sent to the EQ basin where it is pumped by the backwash pump stations back to the headwater of the treatment plant. The backwash pump stations are in need of rehabilitation. The District plans on rehabilitating one backwash pump station per year, for the next three years.

## Water Treatment Plant Improvements (con’t)

### Power Monitor for Hinkle Pump Station
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2023-24  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $10,000  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $53,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $63,000  

The District's power costs have more than doubled over the past two years. Power monitors allow the District to see how much energy is being utilized at a specific site in real time. The District intends to purchase power monitors for the Lower Granite Bay Pump Station, Hinkle Pump Station, and the American River South Pump Station. Once installed and activated, these monitors should result in lower energy costs than would otherwise be incurred. This is a shared project with the Retail division. Wholesale's share is for the Hinkle Pump Station.

### Fiber Optic Cabling to Solids Handling Building
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $0  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $30,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $30,000  

The current network connection between the solids handling facility at the water treatment plant consists of a single network cable stretched from the solids handling room to the operations room then connected to a switch which connects to the server room. It allows for one server connection with no redundancy. Installing fiber optic cabling from the solids handling building directly to the server room creates multiple connections to the server room with fiber optic cabling. This improvement will not affect future operating costs.

## Land Improvements

### Water Treatment Plant Site Paving, Slurry Seal and Re-Stripe
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2023-24  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $25,000  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $650,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $675,000  

This project will grind down and overlay the pavement surrounding the water treatment plant (approximately 48,000 square feet).

### Administration Building Deck and Shade Structure
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2023-24  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $20,400  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $148,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $168,400  

On January 3, 2023, during a rainstorm, a very large oak tree fell onto the deck of the Administration Building causing significant damage to the existing deck. Prior to falling, the oak tree had provided shade for the majority of the deck. This project will replace the damaged deck and install a shade structure in place of the fallen tree. Insurance proceeds were received for the deck replacement, but not for the cost of the shade structure. This represents the wholesale divisions share of the project costs.

The $38,000 budgeted in FY 2024-25 is for the condition assessment and potentially the design for the improvements needed. The $116,000 of estimated future spending is the anticipated costs when the District suspects will be needed.

### Evaluation of 60-inch Pipeline from Filter Gallery to Hinkle Reservoir Inlet Structure
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ -  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 25,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Future Spending:** TBD  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 25,000  

Clean drinking water is delivered from the filter gallery at the water treatment plant, to the Hinkle Reservoir through a 60-inch concrete lined pipeline. A small amount of lime is injected into the water in transit. While lime helps preserve concrete this pipeline, and there are no outside indications of degradation of the pipeline, there is a section that has never been relined. This evaluation is necessary to determine the condition of the entire pipeline and to determine if any sections need relining or other improvements.

### Evaluation of Powdered Activated Carbon System
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ 25,000  
- **Start Date:** FY 2023-24

- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Future Spending:** $ 1,804,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 1,854,000  

Cyanobacterial algae blooms (blue-green algae) occur in fresh water when the water is warm, stagnant, and rich in nutrients from sources such as fertilizer runoff. These blooms have been occurring in California's fresh water sources with increasing frequency. A powdered activated carbon system can effectively remove the toxins in the water supply from these algae blooms. The funding in FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 was and will be used to design such a system, if deemed efficient for the District's water treatment plant. If so, construction would occur in FY 2028-29. The effect on ongoing operating costs is not yet known.

Each of the District’s three thickener bases have an access ladder. For safety reasons these ladders need to be reconfigured and replaced. As currently installed, an employee has to climb over a railing at the top of the tank in order to access the ladder. The ladder terminates at the bottom of the tank, on a slope. These are unsafe conditions that need to be rectified. This project will redesign and install new ladders. Design was completed in FY 2022-23 and one ladder is expected to be installed by the end of FY 2023-24. The remaining two will be replaced in FY 2024-25. There will be no impact to ongoing operating costs.

#### Replace Plotter/Scanner in Engineering Department
- **Project Status:** Planned
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ -
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 7,500
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 7,500

The plotter/scanner in the Engineering Department is in need of replacement. The printer is no longer supported by the manufacturer and the computer that runs it is no longer compatible with the District's IT system. This equipment is used by both wholesale and retail therefore both divisions will contribute to the cost of the replacement. This represents the wholesales share.

### Buildings and Improvements

**Electrical Service Upgrade at Administration Building**  
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2021-22  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $41,706  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $169,300  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $211,006  

The electric panel for the Administration Building is antiquated and in need of replacement. During a test of the electric system, the main breaker failed, and the District was unable to shut off power to the building. A temporary panel has been installed to remedy the failed main breaker, but the entire service panel needs to be replaced. This project will bring the panel up to current standards and allow for future expansion of the building including the installation of electric vehicle charging stations. Design is complete and construction is expected to commence in FY 2023-24 and be complete in FY 2024-25.

### Vehicles

**GEM Replacement with new Utility Vehicle**  
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $0  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $26,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $26,000  

The existing GEM vehicle is at the end of its useful life. The District plans to replace it with a side by side off road utility vehicle, such as a Polaris. This vehicle is used solely on the District campus for transporting people and materials and supplies. The vehicles cost will be shared with the retail division.

### Software

**Back-Up Plant Pumps - SCADA Integration**  
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $0  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $20,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $20,000  

The District’s Crown Point pump station provides pressurized drinking water to the retail service area and the entire District campus, including the water treatment plant. That water is critical for maintaining water treatment plant operations as it is used in various treatment processes such as the chemical feed system, and the belt press process. The back-up plant pumps exist to provide pumping capabilities if/when the Crown Point pump station is offline. Historically the back-up pumps have had to be turned on manually. By integrating those pumps into the District’s SCADA system, the system will automatically switch the pumps on if Crown Point goes offline, either intentionally or unintentionally, greatly improving system reliability. Originally planned to be completed in Fiscal Year 2021-22, it has now been delayed until Fiscal Year 2024-25.

# RETAIL CAPITAL PROJECTS FY 2024-25

## Reservoirs and Improvements

### Kokila Reservoir Replacement
- **Project Status:** In Progress
- **Start Date:** FY 2019-20
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $306,999
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $12,860,000
- **Total Project Cost:** $13,166,999

Kokila Reservoir is a 4.56 million gallon lined and covered earthen reservoir. The reservoir serves as an operational and emergency storage facility at a high elevation point in the District's retail service area. The cover and liner were installed in 1984 with an estimated life of 25 years. Regular maintenance has extended its life an additional 15 years. The cover and liner are now in need of replacement. The District intends to replace the Hypalon cover and liner with a concrete tank. The District is pursuing both a grant and a low interest rate loan from the State Water Resources Control Board's revolving loan fund to finance this project.

## Mains/Pipelines and Improvements

- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $1,600,000
- **Total Project Cost:** $1,600,000

A service lateral is the pipeline that runs from the main line, in or next to the road, to individual water meters. In 2020 it was determined that the District’s service lateral failure rate is 35% worse than the national average. The District plans to replace 85 identified service laterals per year. The FY 2024-25 Service Lateral Replacement Program is focusing on the Hidden Lakes neighborhood. Replacing the service laterals will save the District money as less time will be spent responding to leaks and less water will be lost.

### FY 2024-25 Failed Service Lateral Replacements

### FY 2023-24 Service Lateral Replacements (ACE Hardware Shopping Center)
- **Project Status:** In Progress
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $23,100
- **Start Date:** FY 2023-24
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $750,000
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25
- **Total Project Cost:** $773,100

A service lateral is the pipeline that runs from the main line, in or next to the road, to individual water meters. In 2020 it was determined that the District's service lateral failure rate is 35% worse than the national average. The District plans to replace 85 identified service laterals per year. Instead of doing the planned 85 replacements in FY 2023-24, the District decided to replace and relocate the meters at the ACE Hardware Shopping Center on Auburn Folsom Road. The meters were originally installed by a private contractor and are located within the property boundary of the shopping center. The District does not have an easement for meter access. The meters were not installed properly resulting in the need to shut down water to the entire shopping center in order to repair or replace a single meter. This project will replace and relocate all of the meters to the District's mainline, just outside of the property boundary, but within the District's easement. The District is currently working on design. Construction will commence in FY 2024-25.

### FY 2024-25 Air/Vacuum Relief Valve Replacements
- **Project Status:** Planned
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $-
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $1,100,000
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25
- **Total Project Cost:** $1,100,000

An air release valve allows air to enter or leave pipelines as needed. Removing air pockets in a pipeline allows water to flow more freely. Allowing air to enter, if there is a leak or break, prevents the creation of a vacuum, which can cause a pipeline to collapse. California law requires the vent opening to be above grade, to minimize opportunities for water contamination. Most of the District's valves are in boxes in the street, below grade. The District plans to replace 45 per year, over a 20-year period, commencing with FY 2022-23. The program got off to a late start. The FY 2022-23 planned replacements were completed in the fall of 2023. The District anticipates completing design for the FY 2024-25 replacements this summer and hopes to have them completed in Spring of 2025.

### FY 2023-24 Air/Vacuum Relief Valve Replacements
- **Project Status:** In Progress
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $375,000
- **Start Date:** FY 2023-24
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $800,000
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25
- **Total Project Cost:** $1,175,000

An air release valve allows air to enter or leave pipelines as needed. Removing air pockets in a pipeline allows water to flow more freely. Allowing air to enter if there is a leak or break prevents the creation of a vacuum, which can cause a pipeline to collapse. California law requires the vent opening to be above grade, to minimize opportunities for water contamination. Most of the District's valves are in boxes in the street, below grade. Approximately 75 valves need to be relocated to the side of the road and vented above ground. The District plans to replace 45 per year, over a 20-year period, commencing with FY 2022-23. The program got off to a late start. The FY 2022-23 planned replacements were completed in the fall of 2023. Design for the FY 2023-24 replacements will be completed by the end of the fiscal year and construction will be completed over the summer/fall.

### Wharf Hydrant Replacements
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $292,632  
- **Start Date:** FY 2021-22  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $225,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2031-32  
- **Estimated Future Spending:** $1,856,368  
- **Total Project Cost:** $2,374,000  

The District is systematically replacing both aged and wharf style fire hydrants. Wharf style hydrants have less water capacity and are more likely to break than a standard hydrant. The District has approximately 100 wharf style hydrants in its distribution system. The District intends to replace 10 per year until they have all been replaced with standard hydrants.

### Fire Hydrant Replacements
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $465,710  
- **Start Date:** FY 2019-20  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $200,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2028-29  
- **Estimated Future Spending:** $946,290

### Douglas Blvd. and Auburn Folsom Road Pipeline Replacement Project
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $50,000  
- **Start Date:** FY 2023-24  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $200,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $250,000  

The steel pipeline that runs under and across the major intersection at Douglas Blvd. and Auburn Folsom Road (the intersection) is currently a temporary 6-inch PVC pipeline. In 2018, the District began replacing the entire aged steel pipeline from the Douglas Pump Station to Mooney Drive. To avoid closing the intersection the District attempted to pipe burst underground. This caused the pipe to start collapsing, which in turn caused the road to begin to lift. It was not cost effective to open up the ground in the intersection at the time, because the pavement was in good shape and Placer County would have required the District to pay for extensive repaving. Therefore, the District slip lined in temporary 6-inch PVC pipeline. Placer County has informed the District that they will be repaving the intersection this year. Therefore, the District will open up the roadway in the intersection and replace the temporary pipeline with 10-inch iron ductile pipe. By working collaboratively with the County, the District will realize significant project cost savings.

### Replace 950 Linear Feet of Pipeline from 7980 Hidden Lakes Drive to Haley Drive
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $75,000  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2026-27  
- **Estimated Future Spending:** $716,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $791,000  

There is a 950 linear foot section of 8-inch diameter pipeline in Hidden Lakes Drive from W Hidden Lakes to Haley Road. This project will replace the 8-inch pipeline with a 12-inch pipeline to increase fire flow capability and provide better connectivity to the Los Lago tank in and through lower Granite Bay.

# Pump Stations and Improvements (con’t)

## Canyon Falls Village Pressure Reducing Station Replacement
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ -  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 61,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 61,000  

This pump station is currently below grade which creates added costs and complexity in terms of operations and maintenance. This project brings the control valves above grade in an above ground enclosure. This will improve the safety environment for staff when performing maintenance and will reduce maintenance costs as confined space equipment and air quality testing will no longer be needed to perform basic and ongoing maintenance.

## Pump Station Pressure Transmitters
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ -  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 38,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 38,000  

In FY 2022-23, the District intended to replace 9 pressure transmitters at the Hinkle and Bacon Pump Stations. They ended up costing less than expected and instead of replacing them at Hinkle and Bacon, the transmitters were replaced at Sierra, ARC-North, ARC-S, Douglas, Los Lagos Tank and Mooney Tank as well as the suction pressure transmitter at Bacon a Pump Station. This year the District plans to replace the pressure transmitters at the Hinkle Pump Station and purchase two spares. The costs are similar as the installation of the transmitters at the Hinkle Pump Station will require conduit installation, thus increasing the costs. This project will not increase future operating costs.

## Replace 4 Check Valves with Pressure Control Valves at the American River South Pump Station
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ -  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 20,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 20,000  

There are 4 check valves at the American River South Pump Station. When a check valve closes, it does so quickly, causing a water hammer, which is loud and can burst pipes. A pressure control valve opens and closes slowly, preventing the pressure that can happen when a valve opens or closes quickly. The District intends to replace the 4 control valves with pressure control valves this year.

# Meters and Endpoints

## Meter Replacement Program
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2022-23 & Prior:** N/A  
- **Start Date:** FY 2021-22

The District’s meters were originally installed between 1997 and 2004. With a typical meter life of 20-25 years, the District started a meter replacement program in FY 2021-22. When the program started in 2021 the District had 10,779 total meters. 736 of them were manual read meters, 7,987 were touch read meters and 2,056 were radio read (drive-by only). The plan was to replace 515 (5%) of the meters each year, which results in a 20-year replacement cycle and to replace all end-points over 5 years (convert all to radio read), which equates to 2,118 per year. Due to supply chain issues, those goals varied from year to year based on what our vendors could supply. By the end of FY 2023-24 the District will be 83% radio read (drive-by only) and all of the manual read meters will have been upgraded. This budget funds the replacement of approximately 3,450 endpoints and 515 meters. During FY 2024-25, the District will reach one of the Meter Replacement Program Goals by becoming 100% radio read (drive-by only).

The District bundles all meter replacements in a given fiscal year into one capital asset for financial statement reporting purposes. In terms of program management, it is helpful for the planned replacements to be tracked separately from the replacements of meters that have been replaced due to discovery of meter failure. While it is impossible to know how many failed meters will be discovered and replaced in any given year based on past experience, the District is budgeting $170,000 for this activity in FY 2024-25.

### Failed Meter Replacements - 1.5-inch to 3-inch meters
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25

- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $15,800  
- **Total Project Cost:** $15,800  

The District bundles all meter replacements in a given fiscal year into one capital asset for financial statement reporting purposes. In terms of program management, it is helpful to distinguish between the planned replacements, the residential failed meters and the large meter failures separately. In FY 2024-25, the District will be testing 15 of the 80 3-inch and greater meters. If they fail, they will get rebuilt. Rebuilt meters are expected to last 10 years. In addition, we estimate that there will be 27 1.5-inch to 2.5-inch meters that will fail and need to be replaced.

## Land Improvements

The District has been working to improve the efficiency of its various pump stations. It recently became evident that instead of looking at one pump station at a time, it would be better to take a holistic approach and evaluate all the pump stations at once, as an entire system. This study will look at the existing condition and operating efficiency of every pump station in the retail division and the zone by zone system demands, to make recommendations on how to improve the overall pump station system efficiency. Ensuring the pump stations are operating as efficiently as possible will save money on future pump maintenance and replacement costs, as well as minimizing electric power needs which is particularly important given the continued rate increases being imposed by PG&E.

The District’s parts shelter was torn down in 2018. It was structurally unsound and it was more cost effective to replace, rather than improve the existing structure. The District budgeted to construct a movable 3-sided steel parts shelter in FY 2021-22; however, the Board of Directors did not approve construction and directed the District hold off until the larger District facilities renovation happens, currently slated for FY 2028-29. This storage facility is needed in the interim to house parts that would otherwise degrade quickly if left out in the elements. It was originally budgeted in FY 2022-23 but was not able to be procured by the end of the year.
