**V. OLD BUSINESS**

1. **Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker reported that after he and Mr. Zlotnick met with Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD), SSWD asked for the financial consultant to develop recommendations on the three alternatives – to buy into a well(s), buy capacity in the system and pay for water as needed, or buy water directly. He explained that once the financial information is received, Greg Zlotnick and he will have further discussions with SSWD. In addition, he reported that Orange Vale Water Company is still in the process of getting their project completed of adding the treatment system to their well, and may be interested in a partnership with a future well.

GM Helliker reported that the water bank program committee meeting was held last week where they decided to keep the water transfer language in the CEQA documents. He informed the Board that the District’s attorney is following up with RWA’s attorney to inform them of the language that the District would need in the document to protect the District from any adverse consequences for future water transfers that the District may conduct. In addition, the committee approved a leave-behind requirement and agreed that this would only apply to water that is banked and used for transfers out of the basin or to another subbasin within the Sacramento region. The committee still needs to decide when the accounting should be conducted.

GM Helliker informed the Board that Jim Peifer, RWA Executive Director, stated at that meeting that San Juan caused an extra $200,000 in expenses due to the District’s comments and participation. GM Helliker reported that the District and others provide comments as needed and Mr. Peifer’s attack on the District was

**2. 2024 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)**  
GM Helliker reviewed data which included the current reservoir storage levels across the state, data on releases, temperature and precipitation outlooks, and storage levels and projections at Folsom Reservoir. In response to Director Rich’s question, Mr. Greg Turner informed the Board that staff is not too concerned about algae this year since there is a lot of water and flow in the reservoir.

**VI. NEW BUSINESS**

1. **Calling for General District Election on November 5, 2024 (W & R)**  
President Zamorano informed the Board that a resolution is needed for the 2024 election. The Board Secretary informed the Board that the resolution contains a limit of 200 words in the Candidate Statement with the candidate paying for the Candidate Statement. The candidate filing opens July 15, 2024, and closes August 9, 2024, for Divisions 2 and 4.

President Zamorano moved to approve Resolution No. 24-02 Calling for General District Election (Sacramento County) and Resolution No. 24-03 Notice of Governing Board Member Election (Placer County). Director Tobin seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

2. **Potential Combination with SSWD (W & R)**  
GM Helliker reviewed a written staff report which was included in the Board packet. He reported that Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) sent a letter to San Juan, inquiring about the District’s interest in conducting further discussions with them about potential combination of SSWD and San Juan. He stated that staff recommends that the Board agree to such further discussions and request that a joint meeting of the two Boards of Directors be convened in the near future to define the scope and schedule of such discussions. He explained that should the Board decide to move forward after the joint board meeting, then the next step would be to conduct a business case analysis, which would serve as the basis for a resolution to LAFCo to initiate the formal combination process.

Vice President Costa would like to answer the letter and provide three dates that work for the Board to meet with SSWD and accomplish this in a timely manner. Director Miller inquired what the goal of the meeting would be, projected costs of a study, length of time needed to complete, financial implications, impact to ratepayers, and why another agency bowed out of consolidating with SSWD a couple of months ago. Director Tobin agreed and pointed out that the consultant should address all those concerns. GM Helliker explained that the Board voted to move to this next phase in 2015 and proceeded with the analysis that Director Tobin just mentioned. GM Helliker pointed out that the next step is not to merge but to analyze the pros and cons of a merger via a business case analysis.
<!-- Page 10 -->
![May 22, 2024, Board Minutes](https://example.com/image-url)

The Board discussed the topic and provided the following dates to hold a joint board meeting at SSWD at 6:00 pm: June 4, June 5 or June 25.

3. **Reduction in Take or Pay with Placer County Water Agency (W & R)**  
GM Helliker reviewed a written staff report which was included in the Board packet. He explained the history of the contract with Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) and the fact that the District does not use the full amount of water that the District is paying for in the take or pay element of the contract. Therefore, staff is proposing that the take or pay amount be reduced to 10,000 acre-feet, which would save the District up to $75,000 per year.

The Board discussed the proposal and voiced concern with reducing the District’s water supply. They requested to postpone discussion of this topic until the June Board meeting.

4. **Change in Board Meeting Day of the Month (W & R)**  
GM Helliker reported that Legal Counsel’s schedule has changed and requires him to attend a city council meeting on the 4th Wednesday of each month starting in July.

Director Rich moved to adopt Resolution No. 24-04 Changing the Date for its Regular Meetings and Approving a Conforming Amendment to the Board Rules. Director Miller seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

VII. **BUDGET WORKSHOP**  
1. **Review FY 2024-25 Proposed Wholesale and Retail Budget (W & R)**  
Ms. Silva conducted a presentation on the FY 2024-25 Proposed Wholesale and Retail Budget. A copy of the presentation will be attached to the meeting minutes.

Ms. Silva reviewed the budgets for the four District funds – Wholesale Operations, Retail Operations, and Retail Capital. She explained that the District, as a whole, has $53.1 million budgeted in revenue and $55.2 million in expenses, and should be ending the year with $44.4 million in available reserves.

Ms. Silva reviewed the projected wholesale and retail water deliveries and water sales revenue. She explained that the revenue from water sales to SSWD puts downward pressure on wholesale rates and had it not been for the sale of water to SSWD since 2017, the wholesale rates would be 16% higher today. In addition, she reviewed the projected property tax revenue, the projected debt issuance, and the budgeted expenditures for Salaries and Benefits, Wholesale Water Supply Costs, and Capital Spending.

Ms. Silva reviewed the District’s Labor Allocation Schedule and informed the Board that there is no significant change in staffing levels and there is no change in the allocation between wholesale and retail. She explained that the Salaries budget is based on the Board policy to utilize the CalPERS matrix for each employee.
<!-- Page 11 -->
![May 22, 2024, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=May+22,+2024,+Board+Minutes+Page+6)

Ms. Silva reviewed the Water Supply Costs and explained that the cost has increased due to the purchase of CVP water to create historical use, thus preserving our access to this water in drought years, and due to a contract for environmental documentation for the new long term Warrant Act contract.

Ms. Silva explained that the draft Operations Plan is included in the budget and is updated each year based on the Strategic Plan. In addition, she mentioned that the Quarterly Report Card, which shows the District’s performance measures, is driven by the Operations Plan and will be included in the annual budget.

Ms. Silva reviewed the Wholesale Operating Fund budget which shows revenues of $11.7 million and expenses of $11.5 million. She explained some of the increased costs for certain items. In addition, she explained that the Wholesale Operating fund is getting a transfer in from its capital fund which is needed to establish a debt service reserve and to bring the operating reserve to 20% of operating expenses per the reserve policy, and that this was anticipated in the wholesale financial plan.

Ms. Silva reviewed the Retail Operating Fund budget which shows revenues of $18.2 million and expenses of $15.5 million. She explained some of the increased costs for certain items. In addition, she explained that the Retail Operating fund is doing a transfer out to its capital fund.

Ms. Silva reviewed the budget for the wholesale and retail capital outlay funds. She pointed out that there are several pages in the budget document which contain the wholesale and retail projects in detail that are in the budget for FY 2024-25.

Ms. Silva informed the Board that she will modify the budget based on any feedback that she receives from this workshop. She informed the Board that the public hearing on the budget is scheduled for June 26th and she will highlight the changes that were made, then the Board will consider adoption of the budget at that time.

Approval of the 7th Amendment to the MOA with the City will result in the continuing reimbursement by the City to the District of 50% of that retainer, i.e., $3,000/month, after its expected reciprocal approval at an upcoming City Council meeting.  

Approval of the 3rd Amendment to the MOA with the CWD will result in the reimbursement by CWD to the District of its TFG retainer fee that was previously incorporated into the District’s agreement with TFG when the CWD provides its expected reciprocal approval.

# AGENDA ITEM III-4

**STAFF REPORT**

To: Board of Directors  
From: Paul Helliker, General Manager  
Date: June 26, 2024  
Subject: Approval of Interagency Cost-Sharing Agreement for Water Forum FY 2024-25 Expenses for Update of the Water Forum Agreement  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Authorize General Manager to sign an Interagency Cost-Sharing Agreement for Water Forum FY 2024-25 Expenses for Update of the Water Forum Agreement.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
San Juan has been providing an annual contribution to the Water Forum to pay for its share of the Water Forum Successor Effort expenses, in the amount of approximately $12,000 per year. The total budget for the Successor Effort is approximately $1 million, of which the City of Sacramento and Sacramento County pay $763,000. Those two agencies also pay for the full cost of the Habitat Management Element of the Water Forum, which runs about $750,000 per year.

For the past four years, the Water Forum signatories have been working on an update of the Water Forum agreement. The cost associated with this effort (facilitation and technical support) has been funded from Water Forum reserves and from contributions from various participants. For the Agreement update work in FY 2023-24, a different funding formula was developed to cover this cost, which is estimated to be $570,000, as shown in Table 1 of the attached funding agreement. The allocation of the contributions to fund this amount is based on tiers of agency sizes, which are defined by the number of retail connections. Because the Water Forum effort has been funded from San Juan’s wholesale budget, we agreed with our wholesale customer agencies that San Juan Wholesale would pay for all of their respective contributions, as shown in Table 3.

Some of the participants have agreed to provide a continuation of funding in FY 202425, as shown in Table 2. San Juan and its wholesale customer agencies committed to one year of funding in FY 2023-24, and now a second and final year of funding (in the same amount) is necessary to complete the agreement update.

Staff requests authorization to approve this funding agreement. Funds for this expenditure have been included in the FY 2024-25 San Juan budget.

![Water Forum 2.0 Scope and Budget](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Water+Forum+2.0+Scope+and+Budget)

**Water Forum 2.0 Scope and Budget**  
The Lower American River is one of the Sacramento region’s greatest treasures. In 2000, 40 agencies and businesses came together to sign the landmark Water Forum Agreement, a visionary long-term plan created to balance two coequal objectives: Provide a reliable and safe water supply for the region’s economic health and planned development through to the year 2030; and Preserve the fishery, wildlife, recreational, and aesthetic values of the lower American River. And now, after 20+ years of successful implementation, the Water Forum members have come together to negotiate a successor agreement that can guide the Water Forum’s efforts well into the future. The negotiating process is structured to foster an inclusive and transparent process that brings together affected parties in a collaborative and constructive dialogue. The process began in April 2020 and has been working diligently over the past several years to develop the framework for the negotiations. Water Forum members are now posed to dig into the negotiations and complete an agreement over the next two years.

**Scope of Work**  
The following scope of work outlines the tasks required for the proposed process to develop and formalize a new Water Forum Agreement for the greater Sacramento Region. The tasks are organized based on expertise and services required beyond the existing Water Forum staff. All staff time spent on Water Forum 2.0 will be covered in the Water Forum’s annual operating budget for fiscal years (FY) 23-24 and FY 24-25 and are not included in this scope.

**Task 1. Facilitation Services and Agreement Development**  
An expert team of facilitators will be available to guide and support the negotiation process to develop a new Water Forum Agreement. Facilitators will specifically be integral in the Working Group meetings, Negotiating Steering Committee (NSC), and Caucus meetings.

**Task 1.1 – Meeting Facilitation and Support:** This task will include preparing meeting agendas and summaries, meeting material development, organization, and distribution, and active facilitation within the meetings. The facilitation team will be responsible for developing and maintaining the meeting framework for the negotiations including meeting objectives and outcomes, schedules, and roles and responsibilities.

- **Working Group Meeting Support:** The working groups (2-4 at a time) will meet once per month focused on key topics for negotiation and will be reviewing draft agreement language for consideration of the Water Forum Plenary. It is expected that these meetings will be less frequent in the second fiscal year (FY24-25) as the draft agreement is finalized.

- **NSC Meeting Support:** The NSC will meet once per month to review progress of working groups and offer guidance on the Water Forum 2.0 process and milestones.

- **Caucus Meeting Support:** The four caucuses meet on a monthly basis and will serve as venue for working group members to solicit feedback from their fellow caucus members.

- **Plenary Meeting Support:** The Plenary (all four caucuses) meet every other month to review progress on Water Forum 2.0 process and take action on major work products and at specific milestones.

![Attachment 1. Water Forum 2.0 Project Scope and Budget](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+1.+Water+Forum+2.0+Project+Scope+and+Budget)

**Task 1.2 – Agreement Development:** The facilitation team, along with Water Forum staff and other consultants, will develop draft and final agreement language, including review and revisions based on feedback and input from Water Forum members during working group, NSC, and Caucus meetings. This includes development of individual sections, such as:

- Endorsed Solutions
- Metrics of Success
- Assurances and Caveats
- Implementing Agreements
- Purveyor Specific Agreements; and
- Funding Agreements.

Due to the iterative nature of the process, this is subject to change based on level of revisions from the caucuses. Water Forum staff and consultants will take the lead on drafting and revising to all documents.

**Task 1.3 – Strategic Planning and Coordination:** This task will allow for the facilitation team to coordinate with Water Forum staff and consultants on strategic planning for the Water Forum 2.0 process.

**Deliverables:** 1) Meeting agendas and summaries; 2) Meeting framework for negotiations; 3) Draft Elements of Agreement, Draft and Final Agreement Package

**Task 2. Technical Services**  
The Water Forum 2.0 process is expected to require support from technical experts to inform negotiators as to the potential benefits and costs of solution sets. The topics of needed expertise include hydrology, river hydraulics, fisheries biology, river ecology, CalSim modeling, temperature modeling, climate resiliency, state and federal regulatory process, and others. The technical experts will participate in working group meetings and provide valuable analysis as requested.

**Task 2.1 – Meetings and Coordination:** Key technical consultants will participate in working group meetings to serve as resources to support the discussions and to facilitate shared understanding of topics and solutions.

**Task 2.1 – Analysis and Documentation:** Technical staff will prepare analysis and related documentation, as needed for the negotiations. The extent of the technical analysis will be dependent on the discussions and needs of the working groups. However, the level of effort needed in the early phases of pre-negotiation and problem definition within the Water Forum 2.0 process provide a helpful guide in estimating the needs of the negotiations phase. The types of analysis anticipated include CalSim modeling, temperature modeling, analytical reviews of historical data, and others.

**Deliverables:** 1) Summary materials of analysis; 2) Technical Documentation (for all analyses completed)

**Back to Agenda**  
**AGENDA ITEM III-5**  

**STAFF REPORT**  

To: Board of Directors  
From: Donna Silva, Director of Finance and Human Resources  
Date: June 26, 2024  
Subject: Proposed Update to District Procurement Policy and Approval of Invoices/Purchase Orders in excess of $50,000  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to approve a proposed amendment to the Procurement Policy to increase the General Manager’s purchasing limit, exclude certain expenses from the procurement policy, add language allowing the use of other governmental procurement contracts and approve specific invoices/purchase orders paid/issued in Fiscal Year 2023-24 in excess of the purchasing authority in the current Procurement Policy. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Finance Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The General Manager’s purchasing authority has been $50,000 since at least July 28, 2006. Since then, general inflation has increased the Consumer Price Index by 55%, according to the CPI index for West – Size Class B/C as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To keep the expenditure authority up with inflation, and to be comparable to the District’s comparator agencies, staff recommends increasing the General Manager’s authority from $50,000 to $75,000 (a 50% increase).  

The General Manager, or City Manager’s expenditure authority of the District’s comparator agencies are as follows:  

| Agency | Expenditure Authority |
|--------|-----------------------|
| Sacramento Suburban Water District | Unlimited |
| Citrus Heights Water District | $175,000 Public Works Projects; $75,000 everything else |
| City of Vallejo | $100,000 |
| El Dorado Irrigation District | $100,000 |
| Carmichael Water District | $75,000 |
| City of Roseville | $75,000 (set by vote of the residents) |
| Placer County Water Agency | $75,000 |
| South San Joaquin Irrigation District | $75,000 |
| Stockton East Water District | $75,000 |
| City of Folsom | $70,952 adjusted annually for inflation |
| Elk Grove Water District | $50,000 |
| Fair Oaks Water District | $24,999 |
| City of Fairfield | Requested – no response received |

and that it would be received in time to be accounted for in the next pension liability valuation report, not remembering that Board approval was required. While this does not represent an additional expenditure, rather a reduction in the District’s liability, it is still subject to the requirements of the procurement policy as it is a “payment” in excess of $50,000.

In January 2021, staff requested a bid from Thirkettle Corporation (dba Aqua Metric Sales Company) for Sensus endpoints. They are the sole source provider of the endpoints compatible with our current meter reading and financial system. The bid received locked in pricing for two years and provided two additional years at prices linked to the producer price index. The Board approved the sole source bid and authorized the purchase of up to $324,360 plus taxes and freight, for a total of $356,800 for the 2022-23 fiscal year. Staff did not ask for Board approval for the first two years, just the first year. Due to the large volume needed for the meter replacement program, and the long lead times coming out of the pandemic, staff placed the next order in April 2023 in the amount of $765,000 plus tax. The endpoints were shipped at various times throughout the year, as they became available. Operations and Purchasing did not remember to obtain Board approval for the purchase, likely because pricing had already been locked in and the Board had approved the use of the vendor. The Director of Finance did not catch it prior to approving the purchase order, because all purchases of inventory require a purchase order from the accounting system to be received into inventory, and historically they have always been under $50,000. The Director of Finance will start paying closer attention to the dollar amount of inventory purchase orders to ensure this does not happen again. Staff is requesting retroactive Board approval for the FY 2023-24 endpoint purchases in the amount of $820,462.50 (includes taxes and shipping).

In January 2021, staff also solicited bids for meters, for the new meter replacement program. Three bids were received and taken to the Board of Directors on February 23, 2022. Per staff recommendation, the Board approved the purpose of 515 residential meters in an amount not to exceed $102,500 (including taxes and shipping). However, the purchase agreement with Badger Meters has a 4-year term. As with the purchasing agreement with Thirkettle, the agreement locked in pricing for year 1-2 and allowed for an increase in price for years 3 and 4 in accordance with an inflation index, in this case the 20-Cities ENR index. Like the situation with the purchase of endpoints from Thirkettle, staff placed orders with Badger Meter in July and August of 2023, in the gross amount of $133,450.65 (including tax and shipping) for meters for the FY 2023-24 Meter Replacement Program, without securing Board approval. The meters came in three shipments, two of which were within the General Manager’s expenditure authority, one of which was not. Staff is requesting Board approval for the entire year’s purchase of meters in the amount of $133,450.65.

Staff is seeking retroactive approval of two invoices from PG&E. The District receives monthly power bills from SMUD and PG&E for pump stations and facilities in the service area. Monthly bills are not received for the facilities that participate in the solar field project (Field Services Building/Hinkle Pump Station, Administration Building and Water Treatment Plant). PG&E tracks the energy used by these facilities, and the energy sold to them from the District’s solar field throughout the year and issues a bill each November for the net amount due for the previous 12 months. The bills for the Field Services Building/Hinkle Pump Station and the Water Treatment Plant are usually in excess of the General Manager’s spending authority and under the current procurement policy need Board approval. Staff is requesting retroactive approval of the annual bill paid in November 2023 for the
<!-- Page 54 -->
Field Services Building and Hinkle Pump Station in the amount of $104,357.85 and the annual bill paid in November 2023 for Water Treatment Plant in the amount of $76,825.73.

Lastly, staff is seeking retroactive approval for the payment of annual water system fees to the State Water Resources Control Board in the amount of $58,188.55. These fees are due pursuant to section 116565 of the Health and Safety Code. Historically they have been within the General Manager’s expenditure authority, but this year the invoice exceeded that limit. Staff would have taken this invoice to the Board for approval, but the due date was prior to the next meeting of the Board, and staff decided to pay the invoice and include the item in this request.

All expenses described above were included in the Adopted Budget for Fiscal Year 2023-24 and payments were reviewed by the Finance Committee and included in the Board agenda packets.

Subsequent to approval of the revised Procurement Policy staff will be conducting training for all finance, purchasing, managers and other employees with delegated expenditure authority to ensure all are aware of the provisions of the Procurement Policy and equipped to implement it correctly moving forward.

## Board Policy Manual

### Section FIN-5 Finance
**Approval Date:** 10/23/03  
**Policy:** FIN-5.7 Procurement Policy  
**Latest Revision:** 08/23/17  

## FIN-5.7 Procurement Policy

### Section 1. Purpose and Authority.
The purpose of this policy is to establish regulations and procedures governing District purchases of supplies and equipment, approval of contracts, and other expenditures. This policy is adopted pursuant to Government Code sections 54202 and 54204, Public Contract Code sections 20680 to 20683, and other applicable law.

### Section 2. Definitions.
A. **“Emergency”** means a sudden, unexpected occurrence or incident that poses a clear and imminent danger or threat, requiring immediate action to prevent or mitigate the loss or impairment of life, health, property, or essential public services.

B. **“Expenditure”** means any District expenditure, payment, purchase, contract or lease relating to a District expense or cost item, including, but not necessarily limited to, the purchase of Supplies; professional, consultant or service contracts; equipment service, maintenance or repair contracts; utility service accounts and contracts; procurement of insurance and bonds; purchase of fuel, oil or other vehicle maintenance supplies; and Public Works contracts.

C. **“Lowest Responsible Bidder”** means the bidder that timely submits a complete and fully responsive bid and that best responds in price, quality, service, fitness and capacity to meet the particular bid requirements. Price alone will not be the determinative factor, but will be considered along with other relevant bidder responsibility factors such as bidder reputation, qualifications and experience, ability of the bidder to deliver, quality of the Supplies, and availability of parts or service.

D. **“Public Works”** means the construction, alteration, reconstruction, installation or repair of District improvements, facilities, buildings or structures.

E. **“Supplies”** means supplies, materials, equipment, and merchandise, including vehicles, computers, other machines, equipment parts, office supplies, chemicals, tools, and furniture.

F. **“Piggyback Procurement”** shall mean utilizing another public agency’s contract or agreement to obtain more advantageous prices and terms than can be otherwise obtained on the open market.

![Page 2 of FIN-5.7 Procurement Policy](https://example.com/image-url)

**Section 3. Applicability.**  
This policy applies to District purchases of Supplies, approval of Public Works contracts and other contracts, and approval of other expenditures.

**Section 4. General Manager Duties.**  
The District General Manager shall have responsibility and authority in connection with purchasing Supplies, approving Public Works and other contracts, and approving other Expenditures in accordance with this policy. The General Manager may delegate to other District officers or employees the authority to make purchases, approve contracts and perform other duties in accordance with this policy. The General Manager may adopt rules and procedures to implement and supplement these regulations so long as they are consistent with this policy.

**Section 5. Expenditures Other Than Public Works Less Than $5075,000; General Manager Approval.**  
A. **Comparative Pricing Generally.** For an Expenditure of estimated value less than $5075,000 for which there are unappropriated funds available in the current approved District budget for the item, the General Manager may make the Expenditure on the open market or through the Internet by seeking the most favorable terms and price either through negotiation, comparative pricing or informal competitive bidding, whichever method the General Manager deems most appropriate in the circumstances. The General Manager may approve the Expenditure through a written invoice, purchase order, contract, or other appropriate bidding method.

B. **Exceptions.** Negotiation, comparative pricing or informal competitive bidding is not required for an Expenditure in the following situations:  
   (i) The amount of the Expenditure is less than $1,000;  
   (ii) The General Manager determines that the Supplies can be obtained reasonably and efficiently only from one vendor or supplier;  
   (iii) The General Manager determines that it is strongly preferred for efficient operations that the Supplies be of a particular model, brand or make in order to match and be compatible with the model, brand or make of existing in-use equipment or facility;  
   (iv) “Piggyback” purchases or leases, when the General Manager determines it is in the District’s best interest to utilize the contracts of other governmental agencies.  
   (v) The Supplies are to be purchased through or from the State of California or other federal, state or local government group sale program;  
   (vi) Professional service (e.g., architect, engineer, accountant, attorney, or environmental consultant) contracts;  
   (vii) The General Manager determines that the nature of the Expenditure is such that competitive proposals would not produce an advantage and negotiation, comparative pricing or informal competitive bidding therefore would be undesirable, impractical, unattainable, unfeasible or impossible;  
   (viii) An Emergency under section 9.

**Section 6. Expenditures Other than Public Works Over $5075,000; District Board Approval.**  
For an Expenditure of estimated value over $5750,000 not involving Public Works or an Expenditure of any amount for which there are not unappropriated funds within the current approved District budget, the Expenditure must be authorized by the Board (except for an Emergency under section 8). The General

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Mark Hargrove, Senior Engineer  
**Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Subject:** Air Release Valve Replacement Program Planning and Design Services for FY 2024-25  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to authorize the Director of Engineering Services to approve Amendment No. 2 to Bennett Engineering Services, Inc. (BEN) to provide planning and design services for the Air Release Valve Replacement Program (Project) for FY 2024-25 in the amount of $195,929 bringing their total contract amount to $532,390, with a total authorized budget of $585,629 which includes a 10% contingency. The staff recommendation will be reviewed by the Engineering Committee prior to the Board of Directors meeting.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
District staff has developed an Air Release Valve Replacement Program (Program) to replace/upgrade all of the existing air release valves (ARVs) that are currently deficient (i.e. broken, not found, cannot be repaired) and/or located within below grade boxes to above grade installations to be in compliance with California Code of Regulations, Title 22. The District currently has approximately 880 ARVs in the Retail distribution system with an estimated 750 of these valves venting below grade. Since the implementation of the District’s recurring 5-year ARV maintenance program in 2017 (160 ARV per year), 124 ARVs have been identified as being deficient. The Program will consist of replacing 45 ARVs per year over a 17-year period.

On June 2, 2022, the District issued an RFP requesting proposals for professional engineering services for the planning and design for the first 3 years of the Program. Firms were asked to submit cost proposals for only FY 2022-23 with the remaining years to be re-negotiated each year. In July 2022, the District executed a contract with BEN to evaluate and design the ARVs for the first year (FY 2022-23). In July 2023, the District executed Amendment No. 1 with BEN for the evaluation and design of ARVs for the second year (FY 2023-24) of the program. Construction of the ARVs for FY 2022-23 was completed in September 2023 and bids are due for the construction of ARVs for FY 2023-24 on July 8, 2024.

In May 2024, District staff met with BEN to discuss lessons learned from the previous fiscal year and the scope of work for next fiscal year’s ARV Replacement Program. The scope of work and budget amount included in this amendment reflect this discussion.

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Mark Hargrove, Senior Engineer  
**Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Subject:** WTP Filter Backwash Hood Facilities Rehabilitation, Pre-purchase of Electrical Equipment  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to authorize the Director of Engineering Services to approve a purchase agreement with Primex Controls (Primex) to furnish electrical Motor Control Panels (MCPs) and Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) for the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) Filter Backwash Hood Facilities Rehabilitation Project (Project) in the amount of $148,330 with a total authorized budget of $163,163 which includes a 10% contingency. The staff recommendation will be reviewed by the Engineering Committee prior to the Board of Directors meeting.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
In January 2023, the District's consultant Kennedy Jenks (KJ) started design for the WTP Filter Backwash Hood Facilities Rehabilitation Project. As part of their design tasks, KJ worked with the District to identify equipment and materials with long construction lead times that could affect the construction schedule. KJ identified the electrical MCPs and VFDs as being such items and recommended these items be pre-purchased by the District 5-6 months in advance of the anticipated construction start date of December 2024. KJ prepared a Bid set of plans and specifications for the purchase of the equipment so the District could solicit quotes from various suppliers. The Engineer’s estimate for the purchase of the equipment was approximately $185,000.

---

**CURRENT STATUS**  
On May 10, 2024, the District solicited quotes from three (3) suppliers and received only two (2) quotes by the May 24, 2024, deadline. The total amounts of the quotes from each supplier are listed in the table below.

| Supplier                | Quote Amount |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Primex Controls        | $148,330     |
| Technical Systems Inc. | $291,800     |

The quote amount totals include submittal preparations by supplier, 2 MCPs (1 for each Backwash Hood), 4 VFDs (2 for each Backwash Hood), factory testing, on-site inspections, warranties, taxes, and delivery costs. The total amount proposed by Primex appears reasonable and in line with the requested in the plans and specifications.

**AGENDA ITEM III-12**  

**STAFF REPORT**  
To: Board of Directors  
From: Adam Larsen, Field Services Manager  
Date: June 26, 2024  
Subject: Annual Installation Services Contract FY 2024-25  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to authorize the Field Services Manager to sign the Annual Installation Services Contract for FY 2024-25 with Flowline Contractors Inc. for installation services, in the amount of $1,135,000 plus a 10% contingency for a total authorized budget of $1,248,500. The staff recommendation will be reviewed by the Engineering Committee prior to the Board of Directors meeting.  

**BACKGROUND**  
On June 3, 2024, the District distributed an invitation to bid for Annual Installation Services for FY 2024-25. The District received three responsive bids and Flowline Contractors Inc. was the lowest bidder.  

| Bidder                     | Bid Total     | Difference   |
|---------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Flowline Contractors Inc.  | $2,157,239    | -            |
| Rawles Engineering Inc.    | $3,113,200    | $955,961     |
| TAK Communications CA      | $4,522,560    | $2,365,321   |

The bid total is not reflective of the budgeted total. The line items included in the bid schedule were overestimated compared to what will actually be completed during this fiscal year. Additionally, there were items included in the bid schedule that may not be completed under this contract but were included for emergency purposes, for example paving and slurry seal services.  

The initial contract duration is for FY 2024-25, with three optional one-year renewals. Flowline Contractors Inc. contract will be evaluated to the contract requirements and quality of work for annual renewals; at that time the District will assess any price increases.  

Staff is requesting Board authorization and approval for an authorized total budget of $1,248,500 (includes contingency) for FY 2024-25 requirements starting July 1, 2024. The contract value will be $1,248,500 after Board review and approval.  

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
This work is included in the FY 2024-25 retail operations budget, CIP retail budget, and wholesale operations budget.

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Greg Turner, Water Treatment Plant Manager  
**Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Subject:** Solar Field Monitoring, Operation and Maintenance Contract – Northstar Energy Management, LLC  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to authorize the Director of Operations to enter into a 5-year service contract for monitoring, operation, and maintenance of the District’s Solar Field to Northstar Energy Management, LLC dba Novasource Power Services in the amount of $103,760.49, including a 10% contingency of $10,400 for a total authorized budget of $114,161. The staff recommendation will be reviewed by the Engineering Committee prior to the Board of Directors meeting.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
In 2010, the District explored methods to enhance efficiency, reduce its carbon footprint, and delay electricity rate increases. In August of that same year, the District entered into a contract to build a 794 KW solar field, supplying power to both wholesale and retail facilities.

Ensuring the solar field operates at peak efficiency remains a priority for the District and its ratepayers. Historically, the District has achieved optimal value by contracting 24/7 monitoring and preventive maintenance to maintain efficiency. After our past provider (Sunpower) phased out their monitoring equipment in 2023, we upgraded our systems. However, due to the acquisition of Sunpower by another company, the monitoring contract was terminated. Consequently, we sought an alternative monitoring option. Novasource emerged as the best value for monitoring and preventive/operational maintenance. The District negotiated a multi-year contract for these services.

---

**STATUS**  
Currently, the District is relying on onsite observations and readings of solar productivity to gauge the efficiency of the facility. Approving the execution of the contract will re-establish continuous monitoring and decrease the annual operation and maintenance costs.

---

**BUDGET IMPACT**  
The 5-year project total is $103,760.49. The fiscal impacts start at $19,157 for FY 202425 and increase 4% annually for the duration of the contract. The contract costs will be split 53%/47% Retail/Wholesale.

# AGENDA ITEM IV-1

To: Board of Directors  
From: Donna Silva, Director of Finance and Human Resources  
Paul Helliker, General Manager  
Date: June 26, 2024  
Subject: Fiscal Year 2024-2025 Budget Adoption  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Conduct the legally required public hearing for budget adoption then approve Resolution 24-05 adopting the San Juan Water District Budget, Fiscal Year 2024-2025.

**BACKGROUND**  
The San Juan Water District prepares and adopts annual budgets for its Wholesale and Retail operations and capital programs. Best practices require budget adoption prior to the start of the fiscal year (July 1st), but the District is required by law to adopt a budget prior to September 1st of each year.

The assumptions used in the budget were discussed by the Board at the April 24, 2024, Board meeting. The draft budget was presented and discussed at the May 22, 2024, Board meeting. Since that time, changes have been made to the proposed budget as follows:

**Wholesale Capital:**
- Corrected description of the Backwash Hood Rehabilitation and Rail Track Improvements project. The original description said that two backwash hoods and their respective rail tracks were to be rehabilitated in FY 2024-25. The information has been corrected to reflect one being rehabilitated in FY 2024-25 and the other in FY 2025-26. The estimated future spending has been added, and the total project cost updated accordingly.
- Corrected description of the Lime Tower Coating and Improvements Project. The original description said that the project would add additional anchor bolts. It has since been determined that the additional anchor bolts are not needed. The description and project name have been edited to reflect this change.

**Net Effect on Transfers**  
None of the changes had an effect on the amount of the proposed budget nor the transfers in and out between funds.

The public hearing was duly noticed in the Sacramento Bee and the Proposed Budget has been available for review to the public. The proposed budget document is attached for review.

**Attachments:**

## Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget

June 26, 2024

Board of Directors  
Citizens of the San Juan Water District

On behalf of the San Juan Water District and its staff, I am pleased to present the Budget for Fiscal Year 2024-25. The Budget has been developed to be fiscally responsible in support of the District’s Mission Statement:

Our mission is to ensure the delivery of a reliable water supply of the highest quality at the lowest reasonable price.

Adoption and implementation of this budget will allow the District to accomplish major priorities in Fiscal Year 2024-25, detailed throughout this document.

The District just updated its Strategic Plan this year, and we have used that document to as part of the foundation for this budget. The plan can be found at the following link on the District’s website:

[Strategic Plan](https://www.sjwd.org/files/a3420933e/Strategic+Plan+Adopted+042424.pdf)

The District’s strategic goals are:
- Ensure Water Supply Reliability
- Optimize Operations, Maintenance and Delivery for High Quality and Reliable Water
- Provide Excellent Customer Service
- Operate the District Sustainably and in a Financially Sound Manner while Maintaining a Fair Rate Structure
- Provide a Capable High Quality Work Force and Ensure a Safe Work Environment
- Foster Collaborative Relationships with Regional and Statewide Partners

These strategic goals will guide our actions to respond to the following significant issues and priorities that we will face during fiscal year 2024-25, including, but not limited to the following:
- Addressing ongoing challenges to water supply reliability
- Development and adoption by the State of a new regulatory structure to implement water efficiency targets, pursuant to SB 606 and AB 1668
<!-- Page 80 -->
![San Juan Water District Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+Fiscal+Year+2024-25+Budget)

- Development of an update to the Water Quality Control Plan for the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta, and implementation of the Healthy Rivers and Landscapes Program by the District and neighboring agencies in the American River Basin
- Further deliberations on a Delta Conveyance project
- Implementation of the Groundwater Sustainability Plan and expansion of the Sacramento regional groundwater bank
- Updating the District’s retail financial plan
- Planning and executing significant infrastructure repair and replacement projects, including planning for the replacement of the cover and liner of Kokila Reservoir
- Successfully achieving distribution system maintenance goals, identifying and prioritizing repairs and replacements, and implementing the top priority projects
- Meeting current and evolving regulatory requirements for water quality, system operations, health and safety, human resources management, etc.

The District works hard to ensure that ratepayer dollars are used in the most cost-effective manner to provide reliable, clean water supplies to its customers. The District is implementing the new wholesale financial plan that it adopted in 2023 and will be updating the retail financial plan that it last adopted in early 2022. In preparing this budget, staff have reviewed the projections in the financial plans and have proposed a budget that is consistent with those plans.

I would like to thank District staff for their conscientious efforts in prudent management of District resources, enabling the District to reduce expenses whenever possible without reducing the levels of service necessary to meet the demands of good customer service and responsible facilities maintenance.

I want to thank the Board of Directors for their leadership and continued interest in prudent fiscal management.

Respectfully submitted,  
Paul Helliker  
General Manager

# San Juan Water District
## Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget

### ABOUT THE DISTRICT
The San Juan Water District (District) initially began as the North Fork Ditch Company dating back to 1854 providing water to the area. The District, as in existence today, was formed as the result of petitions being presented to the Board of Supervisors of Sacramento and Placer Counties by Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD), Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD), Orange Vale Water Company (OVWC) and a group of homeowners in South Placer County. An election was then held within the boundaries of the sponsoring districts including the District’s current Placer County service area on February 10, 1954. At this election, voters approved the formation of the San Juan Water District by nearly a two-thirds majority and elected five Directors. The District is a Community Services District formed under Section 61000 et seq., Title 6, Division 3 of the California Government Code.

The District provides water on a wholesale and retail basis to an area of approximately 17 square miles for retail and 46 square miles for wholesale (which includes the retail area) in Sacramento and Placer Counties.

The District’s wholesale operations include: protecting access to reliable and sufficient water supplies; operating and maintaining a surface water treatment plant; operating and maintaining treated water storage; pumping and transmission facilities; delivering treated water to five retail agency customers (the District’s retail division, CHWD, FOWD, OVWC and the City of Folsom (Ashland)); and providing the administrative support necessary to successfully carry out those functions.

In addition, the District has a contract with the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) to treat and wheel water that they purchase from the Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) and/or the United States Bureau of Reclamation (215 Water). SSWD’s ability to purchase water from PCWA, diverted from Folsom Reservoir, is restricted to years when the unimpaired inflow to Folsom Lake exceeds a certain level. SSWD also at times accesses excess flows into Folsom made available by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Additionally, in 2020 the District began selling a portion of its water supplies to SSWD with such supplies generally available in all water year types. These agreements are negotiated on an annual basis.

The District’s retail operations consist of operating and maintaining storage, pumping, transmission and distribution facilities, which deliver water to approximately 10,900 retail service connections located in a portion of Northeast Sacramento County and the Granite Bay area of South Placer County, and providing the administrative, customer service, water efficiency, and engineering support necessary to successfully carry out those functions.

The District’s existing water supply consists of three separate raw water contracts. The first source of water comes from a settlement contract with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) whereby it is required to deliver the District’s pre-1914 and post-1914 water rights water from the American River, totaling 33,000 acre-feet, in perpetuity. The second source is a water repayment contract with Reclamation for 24,200.

**Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget**

- The District has access to 36,941 acre-feet of Central Valley Project water, with a contract for an additional 25,000 acre-feet from PCWA.
- Water is sourced from Folsom Dam, with total raw water delivery anticipated to increase to 43,974 acre-feet for FY 2023-24 and 40,662 for FY 2024-25.
- In response to drought conditions, the District has partnered with nearby water districts to share and transfer water supplies.

**Water Efficiency Programs:**
- **Water Awareness Poster Contest and Calendar:** Promotes awareness at the elementary school level.
- **Rebate Program:** Offers rebates for high-efficiency washing machines and irrigation systems.
- **Free Programs:** Provides free water audits, leak detection, and workshops on irrigation efficiency.

**Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget**

The benefits of these programs include more cost-effective and efficient use of water and increased customer awareness on the importance of water efficiency to contribute to future reliability of water supplies.

The District’s water treatment facility, the Sidney N. Peterson Water Treatment Plant (Plant), was constructed in three phases beginning in 1975 and completed in 1983. The Plant includes two flocculation-sedimentation basins, two filter basins, an operations building and a covered 62-million-gallon storage reservoir. Major upgrades and improvements to the Plant have been made over the years, including increasing its maximum seasonal capacity (May 15th to September 30th) to 150 million gallons a day (mgd) from its original 100 mgd. The 62-million-gallon Hinkle Reservoir was rehabilitated in FY 2023-24. Those past upgrades, and ongoing efforts to identify and implement projects and process improvements to increase efficiency, cost effectiveness, and productivity, all contribute to the District’s success in reliably satisfying customer demands while continuing to meet or exceed all Federal and State regulatory requirements.

The Plant receives delivery of raw water directly from Folsom Dam outlets. The raw water undergoes an extensive water treatment process to ensure the highest quality of water for all customers. From the Plant, the water flows into the District’s 62-million-gallon Hinkle Reservoir for storage and distribution. The District maintains approximately 227 miles of transmission and distribution pipelines, which transport the high-quality treated water to wholesale and retail customers.

**Budget Purpose, Process and Control**  
The District operates on a fiscal year that runs from July 1 through June 30. The District adopts an annual operating budget and an annual capital improvement budget to ensure the adequacy of resources to meet District needs and to accomplish the District’s mission. California Government Code section 61110(c)(2)(f) requires the adoption of the final budget on or before September 1st of each year, however, the District strives to have an adopted budget by June 30th. As required by certain debt covenants, the annual operating budget is evaluated to ensure that net revenues, as defined by the various debt covenants, are equal to or exceed a minimum of 115 percent of the anticipated debt service for the budget year.

In March of 2018, the Board of Directors adopted a Strategic Plan which staff now uses as the guiding light in preparing an operations plan and annual budget. The Strategic Plan was updated in April 2022. Using the goals in the Strategic Plan, as well as direction received throughout the year from the Board of Directors, the Department Managers prepare and submit draft budgets to the Finance Department. The Finance Department prepares the revenue budget and reviews and compiles the various department budgets. A budget workshop is generally held in May of each year to present and discuss the draft budget with the Board of Directors and interested members of the public. Feedback from that meeting is used to adjust the draft budget, if necessary. A public hearing is then generally held in June after which the Board of Directors votes on budget adoption. The budget calendar, specific to the preparation of the FY 2024-25 budget, is presented below:

Budget to actual financial data is monitored continuously throughout the year by management and is reported on a monthly and annual basis to the Board of Directors. Beginning in February of each year, staff performs a mid-year budget review. The mid-year budget review process is an in-depth analysis of year-to-date budget to actual data, combined with a projection of financial activity through the end of the year. That is then compared to the adopted budget. If expenses, in total, are projected to be greater than the adopted budget, the board considers a budget amendment, or staff recommends budget cuts to ensure adherence to the adopted budget. The mid-year budget review is usually presented at the March Board meeting. The General Manager has the authority to move budget between specific lines within a fund, or between funds to correct posting errors. Transfers between funds, for purposes other than error correction, or to maintain required reserve levels, require approval from the Board of Directors.

# San Juan Water District
## Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget

### Budget Format
The budget is prepared on a modified accrual basis wherein revenues and expenses are reported when earned and incurred, respectively. The budget does not include amounts for depreciation, pension expense in accordance with GASB 68, retiree medical expenses in accordance with GASB 74/75, lease revenue/expense in accordance with GASB 87, compensated absences expense accrual and the amortization of premium or discount on debt issuances but does include an expenditure for debt principal and a revenue for any new debt issued. Therefore, the budget is not prepared in the same manner as the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR). The program budget format is used versus a line-item detail format to provide the most valuable information to the reader on all of the District’s major areas of service (Administration, Customer Service, Distribution, Engineering, Water Efficiency, and Water Treatment Plant). Expenditure data is also presented in a functional format (Salaries & Benefits, Materials & Supplies, etc.) to provide readers with an alternate view.

For financial reporting purposes, the District operates a single enterprise fund. However, for management of the two divisions, wholesale and retail, the District utilizes four distinct funds, one each for Operations and one each for Capital Outlay.

To ensure funds are available to meet both operating and capital needs, the District (for both Wholesale and Retail Operations) established a financial planning process with the development of a Master Plan that contains a review of current infrastructure, and that recommends projects for a twenty to thirty-year period. The District then estimates current and future operating needs and works with a rate consultant to develop a water rate study and financial plan.

The District updated its Wholesale Financial Plan and Rate study in 2023. The update resulted in a five-year rate plan, with the first rate increase effective January 2024. The rate schedule brings the fixed and variable components of the rate into alignment with the District’s fixed and variable rates, thus ensuring long term fiscal stability and rate certainty for the wholesale customers. The Wholesale Financial Plan recommends annual rate increases of approximately 4-5%, primarily due to expected inflation rates. The wholesale rate structure is currently being litigated by the Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks Water Districts. The District is confident that its rate schedule is fair, reasonable, responsible and prepared in accordance with the law.

The District completed a Retail Financial Plan and Rate Study in FY 2021-22, resulting in a 3-Year Rate Schedule. The new Retail Rate Schedule went into effect on February 1, 2022, and resulted in three successive 8% effective rate increases. In the previous five-year rate schedule, all rate increases were applied to the fixed base rate only, to bring stability to the rate structure and provide reliable funding to cover fixed operating costs. In the new rate schedule, this approach is taken for the first rate increase but the final two rate increases will apply to both the fixed and the volumetric rate as the District feels it has achieved equilibrium between rates and costs, to the greatest extent possible. The last rate increase under plan was implemented in January 2024. The District expects to begin an update to the Retail Financial Plan and Rate Schedule in calendar year 2025.

## Procurement Policy
The District’s procurement policy creates uniform procedures for acquiring equipment, and goods and services for its operations. The primary purpose of this policy is to provide for the purchase of materials and trade services with the objective that they will be available at the proper time, in the proper place, in the proper quantity, in the proper quality, and at the best available price, consistent with the needs of the District.

## Accounting System and Controls
The District uses the Tyler Technologies financial accounting system to record its financial transactions. Management has established a system of internal controls that provides a reasonable basis for protecting the District’s assets from loss, theft, and misuse, and that compiles sufficient reliable information for the preparation of the District’s financial statements. At the end of the year, the District prepares an ACFR consisting of management’s representations concerning the District’s finances. An independent auditing firm audits this report and examines District internal controls and provides an opinion on the financial reporting and provides suggestions on ways to improve the internal control processes of the District.

## Fund Structure and Descriptions
Legally, San Juan Water District is a single enterprise fund. For purposes of rate setting, reserve segregation and managerial reporting, the District utilizes four distinct funds as follows:

### Enterprise Funds:
- Wholesale Operating Fund
- Retail Operating Fund

### Capital Outlay Funds:
- Wholesale Capital Outlay Fund
- Retail Capital Outlay Fund

The funds are combined for the purpose of formal financial reporting (audited financial statements). Budgets and descriptions for these funds can be found starting on page 51.

## Budget Assumptions
A budget is an estimate of revenues and expenditures for a set period of time. The creation of estimates involves a set of assumptions. It is important that the reader of this budget understands the assumptions used in preparing the revenue and expenditures estimates contained herein. Listed below are the primary assumptions used in the creation of this budget:

- Wholesale rates increase in January 2024 and January 2025 in accordance with the Board approved Wholesale Rate Schedule.
- Retail rates increase effective January 1, 2024 (8.1% increase on both the volumetric and base rate). No retail rate increases for January 2025.
- Wholesale water demand:
  - No change in demand from regular wholesale water customers.
  - No water transfers.
  - 6,263 acre-feet of water being treated and delivered to the SSWD.
- No significant change in retail water demand.
- Property taxes increase 2%.
- Salaries prepared in accordance with Board Compensation Policy, utilizing CalPERS estimated wage growth.
- 11% increase in health care insurance costs.
- $200,000 supplemental payment to CalPERS towards unfunded pension liability.
- Property Insurance increase of 20% due to California wildfires.
- Liability insurance expected to increase by 10% due to claims experience and general industry cost increases.
- 28.99% increase in PG&E energy costs due to three rate increases from PG&E in 2024 thus far, and two more anticipated. 5% increase in SMUD energy costs.
- Absent costs from defending the District against the April 2024 lawsuit filed by the CHWD and FOWD, staff is projecting wholesale legal expenses to decline by 17.4% due to no anticipated activity on General American River issues and the winding up of the initial CHWD/FOWD litigation. Wholesale legal expenses will incorporate additional expenses due to the April 2024 lawsuit filed by CHWD and FOWD.

## Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget

### MAJOR REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES
In order to assist in understanding the fiscal trends facing the District, and the assumptions utilized in preparing this budget, the following discussion and analysis of the District’s major revenues and expenditures are presented.

### Water Sales
Revenue from the sale of water accounts for 81% of all District revenues, excluding the proceeds from the issuance of debt. Water revenues are driven by two primary factors, the amount of water sold and the rate per unit. The Board of Directors considers and adopts rates through separate processes for wholesale and retail. Wholesale customers are presented with a rate study and are given 150 days to provide comments to the Board of Directors on proposed rate changes. After the 150-day comment period, the Board of Directors review the comments and decide on rates for the upcoming calendar year.

Retail rate setting is subject to the provision of Proposition 218 wherein customers are provided with information on proposed rate changes and are invited to attend a public hearing on the proposed changes. Proposed rate changes can be denied if a majority of ratepayers submit letters of protest. If a majority of rate payers do not protest, the Board of Directors will vote on the proposed rate increase and set the effective date for any proposed and approved changes.

The District completed a Retail Financial Plan and adopted a 3-Year Schedule for retail water rates in January 2022. A Wholesale Financial Plan and 5-Year Rate Schedule was approved in December 2023.

The four charts below depict wholesale and retail water deliveries and revenues over time.

As a result of the 2012-2016 drought, wholesale water deliveries reached a low in FY 2015-16. With the drought “officially” over, the District experienced an uptick in wholesale water demand in FY 2015-16, which continued through FY 2020-21, reaching a peak of 37,633 acre-feet of deliveries. The increase in water demand in FY 2020-21 was due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. People were staying home and using more water. When they started to return to work in FY 2021-22 water demand fell. With the absence of drought messaging due to recent wet winters, we have seen water use inch back up to an estimated 33,500 acre-feet of demand in FY 2024-25.

In addition to delivering water to its regular wholesale customers, the District frequently treats and delivers water to SSWD, which has a contract with PCWA for raw water that is available in years when the unimpaired flows in the American River are above a specific threshold. Furthermore, in years when SSWD’s PCWA water is not available, SSWD has purchased treated water directly from the District. The chart below shows deliveries to SSWD since FY 2014-15.

As with wholesale deliveries, retail water deliveries hit a low in FY 2015-16 because of the 2012-2016 drought. Deliveries increased through FY 2017-18 leveling off through FY 2019-20. Retail water demand increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as people were largely staying home, presumably doing a lot of gardening, and otherwise using more water. Deliveries declined in FY 2021-22 as people started returning to the office and spending less time at home. Demand increased in FY 2023-24 due to wet winters and no drought messaging. That level of demand is expected to hold through FY 2024-25.

![Water Sale Revenues](https://example.com/image.png)

**Chart 4**

Wholesale water sale revenues increased steadily from a low in FY 2014-15 to a peak in FY 2018-19. This period of revenue growth occurred for several reasons:
- Increased demand from wholesale customers.
- Treatment of SSWD water. While revenues from the wholesale customer agencies increased over this time period, total revenues were further increased by revenues from the treatment of SSWD's PCWA water, as indicated by the difference between the dark and light blue lines in the graph above.
- Increased rates. On January 11, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a 5-Year Rate Schedule, which allowed for a 16% effective increase to go into effect on January 1, 2017, 9% per year for January 2018 through January 2020 and 5% in January 2021.

Wholesale water sale revenues declined in FY 2019-20, despite the rate increase and increased sales to the wholesale customer agencies, due to SSWD taking less PCWA water. In addition, wholesale water rates were reduced on July 1, 2019, to reflect savings incurred by refinancing a debt issuance in 2017. Wholesale water sale revenues held steady in FY 2020-21, despite a planned 5% effective rate increase on January 1, 2021. Due to hydrologic conditions, SSWD was not able to take its PCWA water. However, the two water districts entered into an agreement wherein SSWD is purchasing treated water directly from the District. While the District earns more money by selling its own water to the SSWD, as opposed to simply treating their PCWA water, the amount sold was 2,340 acre-feet less than what was treated in the prior year, resulting in a decline in revenues. Wholesale water sale revenues fell in FY 2021-22 due to a general decline in demand, most notably from CHWD and FOWD. The last of the rate increases from the 2017 Wholesale Financial Plan went into effect on January 1, 2022. Rates remained unchanged, in total, until January 2024. Therefore, changes in wholesale water sales revenues from FY 2021-22 through FY 2023-24 are due solely to the changes in demand discussed previously. Revenues are expected to increase slightly in FY 2024-25 due to scheduled inflationary rate increases in January of 2024 and 2025.

## Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget

In FY 2014-15, retail water use dropped significantly because of the drought and conservation mandates. The District restructured their rates and at the end of the fiscal year, in June 2015, implemented a retail drought surcharge. Revenues for FY 2014-15 fell 7.8% from the prior year.

In FY 2015-16, water use continued its sharp decline but due to the drought surcharge and a 15% rate increase in January 2016, revenues were almost restored to FY 2013-14 levels. The drought surcharge was removed April 1, 2016.

FY 2016-17 yielded a 10.4% increase in revenues, mostly from increased consumption from the end of the drought.

The Board of Directors approved a 5-Year Rate Schedule that resulted in an effective 8% rate increase on May 1, 2017, and a 9% rate increase on January 1, 2018. Those rate increases, combined with increased consumption produced a 19.9% increase in retail water sale revenues for FY 2017-18.

In FY 2018-19, there was an 8% effective rate increase on January 1, 2019, but consumption was down 8.46%, resulting in a revenue increase of 4.43%.

Water sale revenues increased 11.5% in FY 2019-20 due to the 8% effective rate increases on January 1, 2019, and 2020, and stable consumption (0.55% decline).

The effective 6% rate increase on January 1, 2021, was expected to be partially offset by a 10% decline in consumption, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a revenue increase of 3.48%. However, the pandemic resulted in an increase, not a decrease, in water sales and the FY 2020-21 retail water sales revenues increased by 9% from the prior year.

Despite lower demand, retail water sales revenues increased 2.88% in FY 2021-22 due to an 8% rate increase effective February 2022.

Retail water sale revenues increased in FY 2022-23, despite a 10% decline in deliveries due to back-to-back 8% rate increases.

The last of the District’s approved retail rate increases went into effect on January 1, 2024. With demand expectations being held constant, the District is expecting retail water sale revenues to increase by 4%, because of the January 1, 2024, 8% rate increase.

## Property Tax
Representing about 9% of total District revenues, excluding the proceeds from the issuance of debt, Property Taxes are usually the second largest revenue source. Property Tax revenue is shared evenly between wholesale and retail and has been designated by the Board of Directors to be spent on capital projects, not operations.

### Property Tax Revenues

![Property Tax Revenue Chart](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Property+Tax+Revenue+Chart)

Chart 5  
Property Tax revenues have been steadily increasing over the past eight years, a result of the rebound in the housing market after the Great Recession (see Chart 5). This budget anticipates a 2% increase in Property Tax revenues. Property taxes are set in January for the upcoming fiscal year, based on January property values. Neither the pandemic, nor the recent interest rate increases, appear to have had a negative effect on property values.

### Proceeds from the Issuance of New Debt
The San Juan Water District strives to be on a pay as you go basis for funding the capital program. This means the District needs to build up significant reserves so that cash is on hand when infrastructure needs to be replaced. Most of the capital replacement program is funded with accumulated reserves. The existing reserves of the District are not currently sufficient to fund two large infrastructure projects:

| Project                                   | Total Project Cost | FY 2024-25 Debt Financing |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Kokila Reservoir Replacement               | $ 13,167,000        | $ 12,110,000              |
| Retail Groundwater Production Facility/Capacity | $ 5,150,000         | $ 5,150,000               |

The District expects to utilize the State of California’s Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund, which offers project financing at lower than market rate, for the Kokila Reservoir project. The District secured a loan agreement at 1.2% interest and a repayment period of 30 years for the Hinkle Reservoir project and an interest rate of 1.1% over 30 years for the Eureka Road Transmission Pipeline Replacement project through this program. The loan application for the Kokila Reservoir Replacement project is in progress, as is a potential grant application for partial funding of the project.

The money planned for the Retail Groundwater Production Facility is not sufficient to purchase land and construct a well. Therefore, the District is working with SSWD to provide funding for them to expand their groundwater production capacity. In return, the District would get capacity rights in their system. Because you must own the underlying physical asset to utilize the Revolving Loan Fund, the District anticipates issuing a tax-exempt bond to finance this project.

### Salaries and Benefits
Aside from the Capital Improvement Program, Salaries and Benefits represent the largest operating expense of the District.

#### Salaries and Benefits

![Chart 6](attachment_url)

Chart 6 depicts a spike in Salary and Benefit costs in FY 2016-17, followed by a decline through FY 2018-19, then relative stability through FY 2021-22, beginning an upward trend in FY 2022-23.

The FY 2016-17 spike is due to the Board of Director's decision to pay down the District's unfunded pension liability. The District paid $4,112,000 towards this liability in FY 2016-17 and remitted an additional $2,787,800 in FY 2017-18, which, combined with extra annual payments of $200,000 toward the liability through FY 2021-22, and with favorable returns in the CalPERS portfolio, eliminated the District's unfunded pension liability in FY 2021-22, saving approximately $8.8 million over the next 25 years.

<!-- Page 107 -->
![San Juan Water District Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+Fiscal+Year+2024-25+Budget)

It is normal and expected for the funded status of the pension to fluctuate over time. The pension plan expects an overall positive return on investments in the long run, but fluctuations from year to year will happen. Due to the loss in the pension fund portfolio in FY 2021-22, the District once again has an unfunded liability. Future market performance will dictate future pension funding status, but in years where the District has an unfunded liability it is the Boards policy to remit extra payments to pay it down. This benefits the ratepayers in the long run because CalPERS charges interest on unfunded liabilities.

Prior to 2019, the Board’s target for total compensation was 10% over the market average. In 2019, the Board reduced that target down to “market average”. As a result, many employees’ salaries were frozen, thus the stability in salaries and wages from 2019 through FY 2021-22. Between 2019 and July 2022 the District lost over 25% of its workforce, either through retirements, or other employment opportunities. The District struggled to fill those open positions. In July 2022, the Board reversed course and set the target for salaries at 5% over the market average. Since that time cost of living adjustments have been awarded to keep salaries up with inflation. These two changes are the primary reason for the upward trend of salaries and benefits that began in FY 2022-23.

Salaries and Benefits are expected to increase by 13.8% in FY 2024-25 or $944,300 due to the following factors:

- Two Temporary part-time positions. The California Environmental Protection Agency is requiring all California water districts to identify the material in each customer’s water service line and to inspect the pipelines at schools and daycare facilities. The District needs temporary labor to assist in this endeavor. CalPERS requires that any individual working more than 960 hours for a CalPERS enrolled employer must be enrolled in the pension pool and both employer and employee contributions must be made into the plan. Utilizing different temporary employees to keep them each under the 960-hour ceiling is not allowed if the nature of the work is the same. Therefore, the District must enroll these temporary employees in the pension plan, even if they are hired through a temporary employment agency. If hired through an agency the District ends up paying both the employer and the employee pension contribution, as the employment agency is not an enrolled employer and has no mechanism to collect and remit the employee contribution. Therefore, it is more cost effective for the District to directly hire these temporary employees so that the District can collect and remit the employee portion, rather than absorbing the cost. Outside of the employer pension contribution and a minimum amount of sick leave required to be offered by law, the temporary employees receive no other District benefits. These positions were included in the FY 2023-24 budget but were not filled during the year. They are included in FY 2024-25 in case they are needed.

- Increase of 11% in health benefit costs.

- The District’s compensation policy requires the salary budget to be prepared utilizing the same assumptions about wage growth as that used by CalPERS. The application of those assumptions is the cause of the remainder of the increase. CalPERS assumes an average increase in wages of 7.5%. The District awards cost of living increases based on the March over March CPI for West Cities B, so long as the total increase stays within the budget prepared by utilizing the CalPERS wage growth assumptions.

### Water Supply Costs
The District’s existing water supply consists of three separate raw water contracts. The first source of water is 33,000 acre-feet of water rights on the American River. The second source is a contract with Reclamation for 24,200 acre-feet of Central Valley Project water. The third water source is a contract with PCWA for up to 25,000 acre-feet of water. All sources of surface water are either stored or flow through Folsom Lake and delivery is taken at Folsom Dam outlets, either by gravity or pumped by Reclamation’s Folsom Pumping Plant. Total water deliveries to the District from Reclamation for FY 2022-23 were 36,941 acre-feet and are anticipated to be 43,974 acre-feet for FY 2023-24, and 40,662 for FY 2024-25.

### Water Supply Costs
| Year     | Cost         |
|----------|--------------|
| FY 14-15 | $            |
| FY 15-16 | $            |
| FY 16-17 | $            |
| FY 17-18 | $            |
| FY 18-19 | $            |
| FY 19-20 | $            |
| FY 20-21 | $            |
| FY 21-22 | $            |
| FY 22-23 | $            |
| FY 23-24 Est. | $      |
| FY 24-25 Budget | $      |

As illustrated in Chart 7, water supply costs increased significantly in FY 2016-17 and again in FY 2018-19.

The FY 2016-17 costs increased for two primary reasons. First, in 2008 a surface water shortage and reimbursement agreement to provide groundwater supplies during times of surface water shortage was prepared and referenced in the signed 2008 Wholesale Water Supply Agreements. The District, in its capacity as the wholesale supplier, determined that there was a potential need for groundwater pumping between 2009 and 2013, and asked both CHWD and FOWD to maintain their readiness to supply groundwater. In 2014, due to a potential shortage in surface water supplies caused by a third year of drought, the District requested groundwater to be pumped. From 2009 to
<!-- Page 110 -->
![San Juan Water District Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget](https://example.com/image.png)

2014, both districts maintained their readiness to supply groundwater, as requested; however, they did not submit invoices for the incremental cost until the District asked them to actually pump groundwater in 2014. At that time, the District was provided with a bill in the approximate amount of $4 million. The District disputed the amount, and the cost was settled in FY 2016-17 at $1,981,440, to be repaid over a 4-year period ending in FY 2019-20. The light blue bar on Chart 7 shows water supply costs for fiscal years 2016-17 through 2019-20 without the payment towards the groundwater reimbursement.

After removing the effect of the groundwater reimbursement, FY 2016-17 water supply cost were still higher than the prior year. The agreement with PCWA required the District to pay for 25,000 acre-feet of water, regardless of how much water the District actually took. However, in periods of drought, the District is allowed to pay for the greater of 10,000 acre-feet or the actual amount delivered. With the drought officially over in FY 2016-17, the reduced demand allowance ended and the cost of the PCWA contract rose accordingly.

Water supply costs decreased in FY 2017-18, despite increased demand. This was due to a reduction in the cost of water purchased from PCWA. Per the contract between the District and PCWA, the cost of PCWA water is calculated as the average of the District’s Central Valley Project rate and the Central Valley Project rate for the City of Roseville and PCWA. In addition, the District must pay Warren Act contract charges on the PCWA water it receives. Central Valley Project water rates and Warren Act charges are set annually by Reclamation. Due to an abundance of water supplies, Reclamation reduced the Central Valley Project rate by 35% for 2017, causing a like decrease in the District’s PCWA water rate. Additionally, in December of 2017, the District negotiated an amendment to the contract with PCWA wherein the take or pay amount was reduced from 25,000 acre-feet to 12,500 acre-feet. The District still has the option to take up to 25,000 acre-feet but is only required to pay for 12,500 acre-feet regardless of whether it takes the water or not. This cut the PCWA water supply cost to half of what it would have been otherwise.

The spike in costs in FY 2018-19 is a result of a groundwater substitution transfer. In FY 2018-19, the District sold 2,808 acre-feet of surface water to the Dudley Ridge Water District and the Kern County Water Agency. Both CHWD and FOWD used their groundwater instead of purchasing the District’s surface water. The District compensated them for the cost of the groundwater out of the transfer proceeds. The transaction yielded net revenues but increased the water supply cost in the process.

Water supply costs for FY 2019-20 were in line with FY 2017-18 with no groundwater substitution transfer and no substantial change in water demand.

The groundwater reimbursement payments to CHWD and FOWD were completed in FY 2019-20, reducing annual costs by $495,400. Thus, supply costs for FY 2020-21 decreased.
<!-- Page 111 -->
![San Juan Water District Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+Fiscal+Year+2024-25+Budget)

Water Supply costs for FY 2021-22 were lower than the prior year as the District is purchasing less water from PCWA thereby reducing the wheeling charges.

Costs rose slightly in FY 2022-23 due to an increase in the PCWA water and wheeling charges. The District anticipates paying approximately $20,000 in FY 2023-24 and $160,000 in FY 2024-25 for the environmental review necessary to renew the District’s Warrant Act (or wheeling) agreement with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.

The retail division purchases treated water from the wholesale division, the same as the other WCA’s. The green line shows retail’s water supply costs over the same time period as wholesales. The chart illustrates, in part, the difference in cost between raw water and treated drinking water.

## Capital Spending

### Capital Spending

| Year      | Amount          |
|-----------|-----------------|
| FY 15-16  | $7,300,000      |
| FY 16-17  | (data not shown)|
| FY 17-18  | $1,800,000      |
| FY 18-19  | (data not shown)|
| FY 19-20  | (data not shown)|
| FY 20-21  | (data not shown)|
| FY 21-22  | (data not shown)|
| FY 22-23  | (data not shown)|
| FY 23-24 Est. | (data not shown)|
| FY 24-25 Budget | $28,200,000 |

As illustrated in Chart 8 above, capital spending fluctuated from $7.3 million in FY 2015-16 to a low of $1.8 million in FY 2017-18 then increasing to a ten-year estimated high of $28.2 million.
<!-- Page 112 -->
![San Juan Water District Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget](https://example.com/image.png)

The large spike in FY 2022-23 capital spending was due to the Hinkle Reservoir Replacement Project. The Hinkle Reservoir is a 62-million gallon lined and covered earthen reservoir. The Water Treatment Plant operates at a constant flowrate and the reservoir is used to store excess treated water, with the water level rising and falling with changes in demand and production. In FY 2022-23 through FY 2023-24, the liner and cover were placed, the inlet and outlet structures were rehabilitated, and other ancillary repairs were made. Most of the project was completed in FY 2022-23 even though it will not be fully complete until the end of FY 2023-24. Total project costs are estimated to be approximately $25 million.

Another spike in capital spending is expected for FY 2024-25, this time due to retail capital projects, the largest of which is the planned replacement of the Kokila Reservoir. Kokila Reservoir is a 4.56-million gallon lined and covered earthen reservoir. The reservoir serves as an operational and emergency storage facility at a high elevation point in the District's retail service area. The cover and liner were installed in 1984 with an estimated life of 25 years. Regular maintenance has extended its life an additional 15 years. The cover and liner are now in need of replacement. The District intends to replace the Hypalon cover and liner with a concrete tank and is pursuing both a grant and a low interest rate loan from the State Water Resources Control Board's revolving loan fund to finance this project.

The remainder of the retail capital projects are a combination of adding or enlarging pipelines for better connectivity and fire flow, projects to increase operating efficiency at the District's various pump stations, and the purchase of capacity in a neighboring District’s groundwater system to increase the reliability of the District’s water supply to the retail service area.

A complete list of projects planned for FY 2024-25 can be found starting on pages 59 and 69 of this document.

# Reserve Summary
## Wholesale and Retail Total Reserves

| Fiscal Year | Retail      | Wholesale   |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| FY 2014-15  | $12,960,     | $14,474,    |
| FY 2015-16  | $11,296,     | $13,022,    |

| FY 2024-25 Budget | $23,662,4 | $27,218,0   |

The combination of the Great Recession, followed by the drought, resulted in the need to defer maintenance and capital projects, and utilize reserves to augment operations and critical capital projects. This is illustrated in Chart 9 by the sharp decline in District reserve balances between FY 2013-14 and 2016-17.

The District has taken several actions to improve its financial condition now and into the future, as described below:

- **Paid off Unfunded Pension Liability:** The Board authorized two large payments intended to pay off the District’s unfunded pension liability. The District was paying 7.5% interest on this liability, but only earning approximately 1.5% on its reserves. In May 2017, the District remitted $4,112,000, and in April 2018 the District paid $2,787,800. By drawing down reserves to pay down this debt, the District will save approximately $8.8 million through FY 2036-37, with annual savings of approximately $350,000. These savings will fund critical infrastructure needs which will help reduce upward pressure on rates. Through these efforts, the District was able to achieve a funded rate of approximately 95%, one of the highest funded rates in the State of California. With the pension plan’s FY 2020-21 investment return of 21.3%, the District’s pension liability converted to a pension asset. While this status is fluid, changing annually based on the performance of the CalPERS portfolio and subject to changing assumptions about future interest and mortality rates, it still signifies strong financial stewardship by the Board of Directors.
<!-- Page 114 -->
![San Juan Water District Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget](https://example.com/image-url)

- **Debt Refinanced:** In May of 2017, the Board of Directors approved an advance refunding of the District’s Series 2009A Certificates of Participation. This refinancing will save the District approximately $11.2 million through FY 2038-39. The 2012 Refunding Bonds were refunded on February 1, 2022, with a private placement loan resulting in total interest savings of approximately $1.75 million through FY 2032-33.

- **Utilization of California State Water Resources Control Board’s Revolving Loan Fund Program (SRF):** The SRF grants low interest rate loans for drinking water capital improvement projects. While the process of obtaining the loan is long (up to two years or more), the low interest rate generates significant savings. For example, the District secured an SRF loan for the Hinkle Reservoir Replacement Project at 1.2% interest. If the District were to finance this project through a traditional bond issuance, the interest rate would have been closer to 4%, increasing debt service costs by at least $12 million over 30 years. The District utilized the SRF for the Eureka Road Pipeline Replacement project in FY 2023-24 and is working on a loan for the Kokila Reservoir Replacement project. The District intends to utilize the SRF program whenever possible.

- **Renegotiated Contract with PCWA:** In December of 2017, the District negotiated an amendment to its contract with PCWA wherein the take or pay amount was reduced from 25,000 acre-feet to 12,500 acre-feet. The District still has the option to take up to 25,000 acre-feet but is only required to pay for 12,500 acre-feet regardless of whether it takes the water or not. This cut the PCWA water supply cost in half, providing savings of approximately $275,000 per year, starting in FY 2018-19. The District had two take or pay contracts with the City of Roseville, totaling 4,000 AF per year. Under these agreements Roseville paid the District for 4,000 AF per year of the District’s 12,500 AF of PCWA water. The agreements terminated in FY 2022-23 and there are no plans for them to be renewed. Therefore, the District is considering further reductions to its take or pay contract with PCWA.

- **Adjustment to Rate Building Methodology:** Since completion of the 2017 Wholesale and Retail Financial Plans, the District has been slowly adjusting the rate structure so that the fixed portion of the rate is in better alignment with fixed costs. Structuring rates in this manner results in stable revenues that move with expenses and eliminates the need for unpopular special drought rates. The Board’s approval of these multi-year rate schedules have replenished reserves, ensuring that the District can continue its mission to deliver a reliable water supply of the highest quality at reasonable and equitable costs now and into the future.

- **Water Transfers:** As explained on page 9, SSWD’s ability to purchase surface water from PCWA or the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is constrained by the amount of unimpaired flow into Folsom Lake, and they are not able to purchase such water supplies in every year. In 2020, the two water agencies negotiated an agreement whereby SSWD purchased the District’s own treated water, which is generally available for sale in all water year types. The District sold roughly 4,768 AF to SSWD in FY 2020-21, 3,602 AF in FY 2021-22, and 3,170 AF in FY 2022-23. These water sales generated more than $2.5 million in treatment and wheeling revenue, as well as over $400,000 received for the water itself. In addition, the District has participated in regional groundwater substitution transfers in partnership with two of its Wholesale Customer Agencies – CHWD and FOWD. The first such transfer occurred in 2018 and another occurred in 2022. This latter transfer generated approximately $1.15 million in revenues for the wholesale division. All told, in the last two and a half years or so, these transfer activities undertaken by the District have generated approximately $4,000,000 in revenue for the wholesale division that otherwise would not have been received. This has been particularly helpful to stabilizing the budget because the treatment and wheeling revenue generated when SSWD is able to take PCWA water is subject to the vagaries of hydrology, which in recent years has not supported SSWD’s receipt of that water. The transfer revenues have been able to fill that hole and then some.

- **Salary Schedule Reduction:** The District has historically chosen to maintain salaries schedules that, when combined with benefits, put the District’s total compensation at 10% above average amongst the selected comparator agencies. In FY 2019-20, the Board of Directors reduced this target down to market median. Current employees were not subject to pay decreases, but their ability to receive future pay increases was substantially reduced. All new employees were hired into the new Compensation Schedule. Existing employees remained on their original pay scale until such a time as the new schedule was greater than their existing scale. The old pay scale was not able to receive cost of living adjustments, as it was frozen until all employees migrated to the new pay scale, at which time it became obsolete. Given several factors, particularly the current tight labor market, the Board gave direction to staff to prepare a new salary schedule that is 5% above market median total cash. While this increased costs, there were significant savings in the three years prior and the District needs the increased salaries for retention and attraction of highly qualified employees.

While most of the District’s reserves are available to be used at the Board’s discretion there are a few reserves, recently established, that are restricted by law or agreement. The charts below illustrate the restricted portion of wholesale and retail reserves followed by explanatory text.

### Wholesale Reserves

| Year      | Capital      | Restricted   | Operating     |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| FY 2015-16| $11,033,318  | $6,708,354   | $3,859,912    |
| FY 2016-17| $510,102,861 | $16,168,310  | $2,175,888    |
| FY 2017-18| $16,890,133  | $2,390,365   | $1,784,360    |
| FY 2018-19| $16,281,430  | $1,733,755   | $1,843,921    |
| FY 2019-20| $18,784,423  | $2,053,361   | $2,101,691    |
| FY 2020-21| $2,729,485   | $2,581,827   | $2,306,191    |
| FY 2021-22| Est. $2,999,621 |              |               |
| FY 2022-23| $591,200     | $591,200     |               |
| FY 2023-24|               |              |               |
| FY 2024-25|               |              |               |

Wholesale reserves peaked in FY 2021-22 just prior to the commencement of the Hinkle Reservoir Replacement Project, which has an estimated total cost of $25 million. The District secured a loan from the State Water Resources Control Board at a favorable interest rate of 1.2%, for most of the project costs. Due to delays at the State, most of the proceeds were not received until the middle of FY 2023-24. This will require the use of Capital reserves since most of the expenses were incurred prior to receiving the loan funds. This is the cause of the large dip in reserves illustrated above in FY 2022-23, and the increase in FY 2023-24. The loan agreement requires the District to hold one year’s worth of debit service (interest and principal) in reserve. This amount is shown in orange in the FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 bar of the graph. These funds will remain restricted and unavailable for use until the loan is paid off in 30 years. Wholesale capital projects are described in detail starting on page 59.

**Retail Reserves**

| Fiscal Year | Capital        | Restricted | Operating     |
|-------------|----------------|------------|---------------|
| FY 2015-16  | $8,618,422     | $ -        | $2,678,017    |
| FY 2016-17  | $6,444,253     | $ -        | $2,610,923    |
| FY 2017-18  | $6,921,960     | $ -        | $1,973,484    |
| FY 2018-19  | $5,419,940     | $ -        | $2,858,680    |
| FY 2019-20  | $8,027,851     | $ -        | $2,525,341    |
| FY 2020-21  | $11,778,99     | $ -        | $2,691,098    |
| FY 2021-22  | $14,880,13     | $ -        | $2,699,655    |
| FY 2022-23  | $18,493,73     | $ -        | $2,923,210    |
| FY 2023-24 Est. | $16,607,07 | $ -        | $2,673,410    |
| FY 2024-25 Budget | $15,014,27 | $ -      | $3,099,910    |

Retail reserves are anticipated to peak in FY 2023-24 as many of the planned projects got pushed into FY 2024-25 due to the time and attention needed by staff to finish the Hinkle Reservoir and Eureka Road Pipeline Replacement projects. There are a significant number of projects planned for FY 2024-25, thus the fall in capital reserves. Retail capital projects are further described starting on page 69.

The retail division has several restricted reserves. First is the Capital Facility Fee reserve. The District has established capital facility fees to ensure that new development either buys into the existing system, reimbursing existing rate payers for the investments previously made in the treatment and distribution system, or provides funding for the system to be expanded to support their development project, or a combination of both. On the wholesale side, the capital facility fee is 100% reimbursement or “buy-in”. But, on the retail side, the capital facility fee is a combination of buy-in and expansion. 70% of the retail capital facility fee is designed to fund future projects that have an expansionary component. If fees are collected in advance of project expenditures, then the District is required by California Government Code Section 66013 to hold the excess fees in reserve. The reserve was first established in FY 2021-22 and has grown due to a large amount of capital facility fees received in recent years.

Second, the loans for the Eureka Road Transmission Pipeline Replacement and the Kokila Reservoir Replacement projects both require the establishment of a reserve equal to one year of debt service (principal and interest) payments. This reserve must be maintained for the life of the loan.

### OPERATING FUNDS
The Wholesale and Retail Operating Funds account for the operations of the District. Department operating costs are shared and split between wholesale and retail based upon the proportionate benefit received by each, which can differ from person to person, department to department and expense to expense. The major projects for the budget years are discussed in detail in the Operations Plan, which can be found on page 46.

The District is comprised of the following functional areas or departments:

#### Administration and General
The functional area of Administration and General is a combination of the following departments: Board of Directors, Executive, Finance, Administration, Human Resources, and Information Technology. Overall District costs related to general operations, legal, insurance, and office expenses are recorded in this category.

# WHOLESALE CAPITAL PROJECTS FY 2024-25

## Water Treatment Plant (WTP) Improvements

### Backwash Hood Rehabilitation and Rail Track Improvements
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2022-23  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $295,400  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $900,000  
- **Estimated Future Spending:** $900,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $2,095,400  

The final filtration of water occurs in the North and South basins which each have a series of filter cells along the bottom of the basin. Each basin has two backwash hoods that move across the basins to backwash (clean) the various filters. The backwash hoods suck water up through the filters and send the water back into the first treatment stage of the plant. Each basin currently has one new and one old backwash hood. This project assessed the structural integrity of the two old hoods and determined that they could be rehabilitated instead of being replaced (including the rail track upon which they move). One hood, and the rail track upon which it moves, will be rehabilitated this year and the other next year. This project will not materially affect ongoing operating costs.

### Lime Tower Coating and Improvements
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2019-20  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $153,000  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $373,100  
- **Total Project Cost:** $526,100  

The lime tower stores and distributes lime into the treated water as it leaves the treatment plant. Lime is used in the treatment process to manage pH levels in the distribution system. The small amount of lime in the treated drinking water protects the District's entire distribution system from untimely corrosion. The lime tower is aged. The District commissioned a study in FY 2019-20 to determine its rehabilitation needs. The study recommends re-doing the interior and exterior coating. Design work started in FY 2022-23 and will finish in early FY 2023-24 and construction will commence in FY 2024-25.

### Rehabilitation of 3 Backwash Pump Stations
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2027-28  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $0  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $58,000  
- **Estimated Future Spending:** $122,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $180,000  

The dirty water from the filters in the water treatment plant filter basis is sent to the EQ basin where it is pumped by the backwash pump stations back to the headwater of the treatment plant. The backwash pump stations are in need of rehabilitation. The District plans on rehabilitating one backwash pump station per year, for the next three years.

## Water Treatment Plant Improvements (con’t)

### Power Monitor for Hinkle Pump Station
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2023-24  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $10,000  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $53,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $63,000  

The District's power costs have more than doubled over the past two years. Power monitors allow the District to see how much energy is being utilized at a specific site in real time. The District intends to purchase power monitors for the Lower Granite Bay Pump Station, Hinkle Pump Station, and the American River South Pump Station. Once installed and activated, these monitors should result in lower energy costs than would otherwise be incurred. This is a shared project with the Retail division. Wholesale's share is for the Hinkle Pump Station.

### Fiber Optic Cabling to Solids Handling Building
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ -  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $30,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $30,000  

The current network connection between the solids handling facility at the water treatment plant consists of a single network cable stretched from the solids handling room to the operations room then connected to a switch which connects to the server room. It allows for one server connection with no redundancy. Installing fiber optic cabling from the solids handling building directly to the server room creates multiple connections to the network, thus creating redundancy. The solids handling facility is the only location not connected to the server room with fiber optic cabling. This improvement will not affect future operating costs.

## Land Improvements

### Water Treatment Plant Site Paving, Slurry Seal and Re-Stripe
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2023-24

- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $650,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $675,000  

This project will grind down and overlay the pavement surrounding the water treatment plant (approximately 48,000 square feet).

### Administration Building Deck and Shade Structure
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2023-24  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $20,400  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $148,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $168,400  

On January 3, 2023, during a rainstorm, a very large oak tree fell onto the deck of the Administration Building causing significant damage to the existing deck. Prior to falling, the oak tree had provided shade for the majority of the deck. This project will replace the damaged deck and install a shade structure in place of the fallen tree. Insurance proceeds were received for the deck replacement, but not for the cost of the shade structure. This represents the wholesale divisions share of the project costs.

Cyanobacterial algae blooms (blue-green algae) occur in fresh water when the water is warm, stagnant, and rich in nutrients from sources such as fertilizer runoff. These blooms have been occurring in California's fresh water sources with increasing frequency. A powdered activated carbon system can effectively remove the toxins in the water supply from these algae blooms. The funding in FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25 was and will be used to design such a system, if deemed efficient for the District's water treatment plant. If so, construction would occur in FY 2028-29. The effect on ongoing operating costs is not yet known.

### Three Thickener Access Ladders
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ 104,713  
- **Start Date:** FY 2022-23  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 200,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 304,713  
- Each of the District’s three thickener bases have an access ladder. For safety reasons these ladders need to be reconfigured and replaced. As currently installed, an employee has to climb over a railing at the top of the tank in order to access the ladder. The ladder terminates at the bottom of the tank, on a slope. These are unsafe conditions that need to be rectified. This project will redesign and install new ladders. Design was completed in FY 2022-23 and one ladder is expected to be installed by the end of FY 2023-24. The remaining two will be replaced in FY 2024-25. There will be no impact to ongoing operating costs.

### Replace Plotter/Scanner in Engineering Department
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ -  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 7,500  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25

### Buildings and Improvements

**Electrical Service Upgrade at Administration Building**  
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2021-22  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $41,706  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $169,300  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $211,006  

The electric panel for the Administration Building is antiquated and in need of replacement. During a test of the electric system, the main breaker failed, and the District was unable to shut off power to the building. A temporary panel has been installed to remedy the failed main breaker, but the entire service panel needs to be replaced. This project will bring the panel up to current standards and allow for future expansion of the building including the installation of electric vehicle charging stations. Design is complete and construction is expected to commence in FY 2023-24 and be complete in FY 2024-25.

### Vehicles

**GEM Replacement with new Utility Vehicle**  
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $0  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $26,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $26,000  

The existing GEM vehicle is at the end of its useful life. The District plans to replace it with a side by side off road utility vehicle, such as a Polaris. This vehicle is used solely on the District campus for transporting people and materials and supplies. The vehicles cost will be shared with the retail division.

### Software

**Back-Up Plant Pumps - SCADA Integration**  
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $0  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $20,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $20,000  

The District’s Crown Point pump station provides pressurized drinking water to the retail service area and the entire District campus, including the water treatment plant. That water is critical for maintaining water treatment plant operations as it is used in various treatment processes such as the chemical feed system, and the belt press process. The back-up plant pumps exist to provide pumping capabilities if/when the Crown Point pump station is offline. Historically the back-up pumps have had to be turned on manually. By integrating those pumps into the District’s SCADA system, the system will automatically switch the pumps on if Crown Point goes offline, either intentionally or unintentionally, greatly improving system reliability. Originally planned to be completed in Fiscal Year 2021-22, it has now been delayed until Fiscal Year 2024-25.

### Retail Capital Outlay Fund
This fund was created in FY 2015-16 to receive and separately account for revenues that are designated by the Board of Directors to be utilized solely for retail capital expenditures and to account for the acquisition of retail capital assets, including large scale maintenance of capital assets and improvements made to such assets. Capital reserves were transferred out of operating into this new fund upon fund creation. This fund now holds and is used to report on all retail capital reserves. Details on the projects can be found starting on page 69.

## Reservoirs and Improvements

### Kokila Reservoir Replacement
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2019-20  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ 306,999  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 12,860,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 13,166,999  

Kokila Reservoir is a 4.56 million gallon lined and covered earthen reservoir. The reservoir serves as an operational and emergency storage facility at a high elevation point in the District's retail service area. The cover and liner were installed in 1984 with an estimated life of 25 years. Regular maintenance has extended its life an additional 15 years. The cover and liner are now in need of replacement. The District intends to replace the Hypalon cover and liner with a concrete tank. The District is pursuing both a grant and a low interest rate loan from the State Water Resources Control Board's revolving loan fund to finance this project.

## Mains/Pipelines and Improvements

### FY 2024-25 Planned Service Lateral Replacements (Hidden Lakes)
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ -  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 1,600,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 1,600,000  

A service lateral is the pipeline that runs from the main line, in or next to the road, to individual water meters. In 2020 it was determined that the District’s service lateral failure rate is 35% worse than the national average. The District plans to replace 85 identified service laterals per year. The FY 2024-25 Service Lateral Replacement Program is focusing on the Hidden Lakes neighborhood. Replacing the service laterals will save the District money as less time will be spent responding to leaks and less water will be lost.

### FY 2024-25 Failed Service Lateral Replacements
- **Project Status:** Anticipated  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ -  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 435,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 435,000  

A service lateral is the pipeline that runs from the main line, in or next to the road, to individual water meters. In 2020, it was determined that the District’s service lateral failure rate is 35% worse than the national average. The District plans to replace 85 identified service laterals per year. In addition to those planned replacements, the District replaces service laterals when they are determined to be leaking. Based on prior year experience the District anticipates this level of spending to replace failed service laterals.

### FY 2023-24 Service Lateral Replacements (ACE Hardware Shopping Center)
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ 23,100  
- **Start Date:** FY 2023-24  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 750,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 773,100  

A service lateral is the pipeline that runs from the main line, in or next to the road, to individual water meters. In 2020 it was determined that the District’s service lateral failure rate is 35% worse than the national average. The District plans to replace 85 identified service laterals per year. Instead of doing the planned 85 replacements in FY 2023-24 the District decided to replace and relocate the meters at the ACE Hardware Shopping Center on Auburn Folsom Road. The meters were originally installed by a private contractor and are located within the property boundary of the shopping center. The District does not have an easement for meter access. The meters were not installed properly resulting in the need to shut down water to the shopping center in order to repair or replace a single meter. This project will replace and relocate all of the meters to the District’s mainline, just outside of the property boundary, but within the District’s easement. The District is currently working on design. Construction will commence in FY 2024-25.

### FY 2024-25 Air/Vacuum Relief Valve Replacements
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ -  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 1,100,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 1,100,000  

An air release valve allows air to enter or leave pipelines as needed. Removing air pockets in a pipeline allows water to flow more freely. Allowing air to enter, if there is a leak or break, prevents the creation of a vacuum, which can cause a pipeline to collapse. California law requires the vent opening to be above grade, to minimize opportunities for water contamination. Most of the District’s valves are in boxes in the street, below grade. The District plans to replace 45 per year, over a 20-year period, commencing with FY 2022-23. The program got off to a late start. The FY 2022-23 planned replacements were completed in the fall of 2023. The District anticipated completing design for the FY 2024-25 replacements this summer and hopes to have them completed in Spring of 2025.

### FY 2023-24 Air/Vacuumed Relief Valve Replacements
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24:** $ 375,000  
- **Start Date:** FY 2023-24  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 800,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 1,175,000  

An air release valve allows air to enter or leave pipelines as needed. Removing air pockets in a pipeline allows water to flow more freely. Allowing air to enter if there is a leak or break prevents the creation of a vacuum, which can cause a pipeline to collapse. California law requires the vent opening to be above grade, to minimize opportunities for water contamination. Most of the District’s valves are in boxes in the street, below grade. Approximately 75 valves need to be relocated to the side of the road and vented above ground. The District plans to replace 45 per year, over a 20-year period, commencing with FY 2022-23. The program got off to a late start. The FY 2022-23 planned replacements were completed in the fall of 2023. Design for the FY 2023-24 replacements will be completed by the end of the fiscal year and construction will be completed over the summer/fall.

### Mains/Pipelines and Improvements (con’t)

#### Wharf Hydrant Replacements
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2021-22  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2031-32  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $292,632  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $225,000  
- **Estimated Future Spending:** $1,856,368  
- **Total Project Cost:** $2,374,000  

The District is systematically replacing both aged and wharf style fire hydrants. Wharf style hydrants have less water capacity and are more likely to break than a standard hydrant. The District has approximately 100 wharf style hydrants in its distribution system. The District intends to replace 10 per year until they have all been replaced with standard hydrants.

#### Fire Hydrant Replacements
- **Project Status:** In Progress

#### Douglas Blvd. and Auburn Folsom Road Pipeline Replacement Project
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Start Date:** FY 2023-24  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $50,000  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $200,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $250,000  

The steel pipeline that runs under and across the major intersection at Douglas Blvd. and Auburn Folsom Road (the intersection) is currently a temporary 6-inch PVC pipeline. In 2018, the District began replacing the entire aged steel pipeline from the Douglas Pump Station to Mooney Drive. To avoid closing the intersection the District attempted to pipe burst underground. This caused the pipe to start collapsing, which in turn caused the road to begin to lift. It was not cost effective to open up the ground in the intersection at the time, because the pavement was in good shape and Placer County would have required the District to pay for extensive repaving. Therefore, the District slip lined in temporary 6-inch PVC pipeline. Placer County has informed the District that they will be repaving the intersection this year. Therefore, the District will open up the roadway in the intersection and replace the temporary pipeline with 10-inch iron ductile pipe. By working collaboratively with the County, the District will realize significant project cost savings.

This pump station is currently below grade which creates added costs and complexity in terms of operations and maintenance. This project brings the control valves above grade in an above ground enclosure. This will improve the safety environment for staff when performing maintenance and will reduce maintenance costs as confined space equipment and air quality testing will no longer be needed to perform basic and ongoing maintenance.

### Pump Station Pressure Transmitters
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ -  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 38,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 38,000  

In FY 2022-23, the District intended to replace 9 pressure transmitters at the Hinkle and Bacon Pump Stations. They ended up costing less than expected and instead of replacing them at Hinkle and Bacon, the transmitters were replaced at Sierra, ARC-North, ARC-S, Douglas, Los Lagos Tank and Mooney Tank as well as the suction pressure transmitter at Bacon a Pump Station. This year the District plans to replace the pressure transmitters at the Hinkle Pump Station and purchase two spares. The costs are similar as the installation of the transmitters at the Hinkle Pump Station will require conduit installation, thus increasing the costs. This project will not increase future operating costs.

### Replace 4 Check Valves with Pressure Control Valves at the American River South Pump Station
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ -  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 20,000  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 20,000  

There are 4 check valves at the American River South Pump Station. When a check valve closes, it does so quickly, causing a water hammer, which is loud and can burst pipes. A pressure control valve opens and closes slowly, preventing the pressure that can happen when a valve opens or closes quickly. The District intends to replace the 4 control valves with pressure control valves this year.

## Meters and Endpoints

### Meter Replacement Program
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2021-22  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2022-22 & Prior:** N/A

The District’s meters were originally installed between 1997 and 2004. With a typical meter life of 20-25 years, the District started a meter replacement program in FY 2021-22. When the program started in 2021 the District had 10,719 total meters. 736 of these were manual read meters, 7,987 were touch read meters and 2,056 were radio read (drive-by only). The plan was to replace 515 (5%) of the meters each year, which results in a 20-year replacement cycle and to replace all end-points for 5 years (convert all to radio read), which equates to 2,118 per year. Due to supply chain issues, those goals varied from year to year based on what our vendors could supply. By the end of FY 2023-24 the District will be 83% radio read (drive-by only) and all of the manual read meters will have been upgraded. This budget funds the replacement of approximately 3,450 endpoints and 515 meters. During FY 2024-25, the District will reach one of the Meter Replacement Program Goals by becoming 100% radio read (drive-by only).

- **Total Project Cost:** $15,800  

The District bundles all meter replacements in a given fiscal year into one capital asset for financial statement reporting purposes. In terms of program management, it is helpful to distinguish between the planned replacements, the residential failed meters and the large meter failures separately. In FY 2024-25, the District will be testing 15 of the 80 3-inch and greater meters. If they fail, they will get rebuilt. Rebuilt meters are expected to last 10 years. In addition, we estimate that there will be 27 1.5-inch to 2.5-inch meters that will fail and need to be replaced.

## Land Improvements

The District’s parts shelter was torn down in 2018. It was structurally unsound and it was more cost effective to replace, rather than improve the existing structure. The District budgeted to construct a movable 3-sided steel parts shelter in FY 2021-22; however, the Board of Directors did not approve construction and directed the District hold off until the larger District facilities renovation happens, currently slated for FY 2028-29. This storage facility is needed in the interim to house parts that would otherwise degrade quickly if left out in the elements. It was originally budgeted in FY 2022-23 but was not able to be procured by the end of the year.

# AGENDA ITEM IV-2  
## STAFF REPORT  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Devon Barrett, Customer Service Manager  
**Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Subject:** Liens for Delinquent Charges  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION  
Adopt Resolution 24-06 (Sacramento County) and Resolution 24-07 (Placer County) approving and confirming the Report of Delinquent Utilities Charges (Exhibit A) and requesting the respective county place such charges on the respective tax roll.  

### BACKGROUND  
Property owners with active service in the District are billed on a bi-monthly basis on the first Wednesday of the month. Every property owner is either mailed a printed invoice or delivered an electronic notification via email. Bills are due upon presentation and considered late after 21 days. 14 days after the due date, accounts with an unpaid balance are mailed a “Friendly Reminder” notice to all mailing addresses on file.  

Historically, Staff would deliver a final notice of “Intent to Disconnect” service to the property. 63 days from the billing date, any account with a balance greater than $100 would be disconnected until the delinquent balance and all fees were paid in full. However, due to safety concerns and legislative changes that made the legacy process uncertain, Staff brought a policy change to the Board for review. On August 23, 2023, a 4-1 vote of the Board approved Resolution 23-01, amending Ordinance 18000 to allow for the collection of delinquent charges on the Property Tax Roll, as allowed by Government Code Section 61115.  

### CURRENT STATUS  
On April 12, 2024, Staff mailed an initial notice of delinquency to all addresses on record for accounts delinquent by more than 90 days. On June 6, 2024, Staff mailed a second notice to the owner of each affected parcel the date and time of the Public Hearing to offer property owners the opportunity to object or protest the report, as specified in Government Code Section 61115 (b). At the time this report was written, Staff had received no protest but had arranged payment plans for customers who’ve requested extra time to pay. Staff remains committed to working with customers to bring their account current and avoid a Tax Roll Lien.  

For the property owners that have not responded to letters, as of June 19, 2024, Staff has reviewed all outstanding accounts and identified 95 that have been delinquent for...

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT+Liens+for+Delinquent+Charges+Devon+Barrett)

more than 90 days and have a balance greater than $100. Delinquent charges for these accounts amount to $73,162.10. Sacramento County accepts Direct Levy listing until July 26th and Placer County has a deadline of the July 24th. Both agencies require Board approved resolutions to be accepted. Even with these deadlines, both counties allow accounts to be removed from the listing through the first week of September. Staff will continue to work to resolve as many delinquencies as possible but is seeking the approval of Resolutions 24-06 and 24-07 to ensure the collection of outstanding revenue.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The District will collect delinquent revenue of up to $73,162.10.

**Back to Agenda**  
**AGENDA ITEM V-1**  

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Greg Zlotnick, Water Resources Manager  
**Date:** June 26, 2024  
**Subject:** Reduction of Take-or-Pay Obligation to Placer County Water Agency  

**ISSUE**  
Should San Juan Water District (“San Juan” or “District”) reduce its annual take-or-pay (“ToP”) obligation to Placer County Water Agency (“PCWA”) from 12,500 acre-feet (AF) to 10,000 AF.  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Direct staff to notify PCWA of San Juan’s reduction in its take-or-pay obligation by 2,500 AF to 10,000 AF, effective January 1, 2025, consistent with the terms of the entitlement contract.  

**HISTORY**  
San Juan’s initial ToP obligation to PCWA, as set forth in the contract “For A Water Supply” (“Contract”) entered into in 2006, was for all of the 25,000 AF entitlement.  

In 2015, the first Amendment to the Contract reduced the ToP obligation under drought conditions consistent with the Water Forum’s then existing operational commitments tied to the unimpaired inflow (UIF) to Folsom Reservoir. Notably, the minimum delivery commitment, which would only occur if the UIF was 400,000 AF or less, was 10,000 AF.  

Since the first amendment was signed in 2015, there have been no years when material reductions have become operative because San Juan’s current Water Forum Purveyor Specific Agreement has not required them and the 400,000 AF UIF threshold has never been reached.  

A second Amendment to the Contract was entered into at the end of 2017 whereby the ToP amount was reduced from 25,000 AF to 12,500 AF. This action resulted in ongoing annual savings to San Juan Wholesale of approximately $312,500 - $375,000 based on an average water rate of $25-$30/AF. This second Amendment maintained San Juan’s access to “up to” 25,000 AF from PCWA, but required prior approval by PCWA of any deliveries above 12,500 AF.  

Shortly before the second Amendment was enacted, San Juan and Roseville agreed that Roseville would compensate San Juan for 4,000 AF of San Juan’s 12,500 AF ToP obligation to PCWA beginning July 1, 2018. This effectively reduced San Juan’s revised ToP obligation to PCWA to 8,500 AF.  

At the end of May 2023, Roseville terminated the 2004 agreement that had been amended in 2017 to have Roseville pay for 4,000 AF of San Juan’s ToP obligation to PCWA as set forth in the preceding paragraph. Consequently, as of the start of the current fiscal year, San Juan has been paying the full current 12,500 AF ToP obligation to PCWA.  

In late 2020, a third Amendment to the Contract extended its term through 2041.

**Staff Report – Reduction of Take-or-Pay Obligation to PCWA**  
June 26, 2024  

---

**DISCUSSION**

Should the ToP obligation be reduced from 12,500 AF to 10,000 AF, the annual savings based on the estimated average water rate of $25-$30/AF would range from $62,500 - $75,000.

The PCWA entitlement water, with rare exception, exclusively used in San Juan’s Placer County retail service area because if it is used in the District’s Sacramento County service area, there is an additional 75% rate premium that has to be paid for the water. If the water is transferred outside our service area, 95% of any revenue generated must go to PCWA per the terms of the Contract. Consequently, there would generally not use PCWA water in amounts beyond our Placer County usage.

Our average deliveries to Placer County over the last ten years have been approximately 9,116 AF. With implementation of the new conservation regulations, it is likely that deliveries will be reduced to our Placer County customers because of reduced budgets for deliveries for indoor and outdoor usage.

Overall, based on our 2020 Urban Water Management Plan, San Juan’s total retail deliveries are estimated to increase by 200 AF, from 11,300 AF in 2025 to 11,500 AF in 2045. Over the last five years, the split between Placer County and Sacramento County retail customers has been approximately 76% to 24% respectively. Applying those proportions to the estimated 200 AF increase in San Juan’s retail demands in 2045 would result in approximately a 152 AF increase in our Placer County service area. Adding that to the ten-year average Placer County deliveries would be 9,268 AF, leaving a buffer of 732 AF under a 10,000 AF ToP supply, not accounting for the expected reduction in usage resulting from the new conservation regulations.

With regard to San Juan’s total wholesale demands, average deliveries over the last five years have been 32,613 AF, inclusive of deliveries to Placer County.

Prior to Roseville terminating its agreement to pay for 4,000 acre-feet of the 12,500 acre-feet of take-or-pay water, San Juan’s take-or-pay allotment was 8,500 acre-feet. This amendment will actually increase San Juan’s annual take-or-pay entitlement to 10,000 acre-feet.

Adding a 10,000 AF ToP supply from PCWA to our 33,000 AF of water rights supplies, provides San Juan with a minimum of 43,000 AF of supply. Moreover, our Central Valley Project (CVP) contract is for 24,200 AF. Last year and this year we have and will take CVP water to build up our “historic use” to provide access to additional supplies from the CVP during future drought allocations under the CVP’s Shortage Policy. We are planning to continue to build our “historic use” to try to ensure access to CVP water under a shortage allocation of at least 2,500 AF or more. Taken together, San Juan’s minimum expected available supplies would be 45,500 AF to meet an estimated demand of between 30,000 AF – 35,000 AF.

Based upon the above analysis, reducing the ToP obligation to PCWA would not put San Juan’s ability to meet dry year demands at risk, and would preserve a minimum buffer of about 10,000 AF of available supplies. Moreover, with access to CVP supplies during wetter years, there would be plentiful supplies available to expand groundwater banking activities using those CVP supplies, including outside our service area, once the Sacramento Regional Groundwater Bank receives federal acknowledgement.

San Juan is unique in having access to highly reliable and sufficient water supplies during drier years, coupled with a CVP Contract to provide additional supplies during wetter years for banking purposes. Reducing the ToP obligation to PCWA from 12,500 AF to 10,000 AF will not change that reality. However, reducing the ToP obligation by 2,500 AF will save San Juan Wholesale an estimated $62,500 - $75,000 annually.

# 10000.012  Privately-Owned Water Lines

The District assumes no responsibility for the delivery of water through privately-owned pipelines or systems, nor shall the District assume any responsibility for damages resulting from the operation of any such system even though water may be received from a District water distribution system. In cases where a District water meter is installed at some point on a privately-owned water line, the District is liable only for the water meter, meter box, and the fittings required to attach and operate the meter. The fact that a water meter is installed on a privately-owned water line does not create an express or implied dedication to public use of a private water line or impose any obligation or liability on the District to operate, maintain, repair, remove, or replace any portion of that water line. In the cases where the meter is located on a private water line, other than the appurtenances listed above, District responsibility ends on the Customer's side of the isolation valve at the main to the premises.

If meters are located on a private line, the District may, at its discretion, relocate the meter adjacent to the property line within the public right of way with the appropriate backflow and isolation facilities. The District will be required to reconnect the piping at the location of the old meter and will guarantee the work for one (1) year upon completion. The District will not take responsibility for the condition or workmanship of the private line on either side of old meter installation or the work completed. If the existing private line is not in a condition to accept the repair connections, the Customer will be required to upgrade the private line as directed by the District.

# 10000.028  Water Pressure Regulation

## 10000.023.1  Customer Responsibility

The District shall assume no responsibility for water pressure regulation within a Customer's service area. The Customer shall be responsible for providing adequate safeguard measures for the Customer's water system wherever pressure regulation is necessary. The Customer shall be required to install an appropriate pressure regulation device for such service where static pressure exceeds 80 psi at the service connection (UPC Code 1007 and California State Plumbing Code).

District employees will not make adjustments to Customer-owned pressure regulators.

## 10000.023.2  Requirement for Installation in New Construction

Customers making application for water service for new construction for residential, commercial or industrial use shall be required to install an approved meter and appropriate pressure regulation device for such service where static pressure exceeds 80 psi at the service connection (UPC Code 1007 and California State Plumbing Code).

## 10000.023.3  Pressure Regulators within District Owned Meter Box

A. An “Application for Single Service - Initial Review” shall be completed by the Applicant to enable the District to determine appropriate meter size.

B. An “Application for Single-Service - Connection” shall be completed by the Applicant to enable the District to establish a water account and document fees paid.

By signing the Application, it shall signify the Applicant's willingness and agreement to comply with this Code and other codes, rules and regulations relating to regular water service and to make payment for water service as required. Water service shall not be provided until after the District has approved the Application. Water meters shall be required on all new service connections.

In order for an Application to be approved for service, the Applicant and proposed service must comply with the following:

A. The Applicant's real property must be within the District. If applicable, annexation proceedings must be complete and annexation fees paid before the Application will be approved.

B. An Application shall not be approved unless payment in full has been made for any service previously rendered to the Applicant by the District on any active, closed or discontinued account in the Applicant’s name within the District Service Area, as well as payment of all current applicable deposits, fees and charges. If after one year from the date of application the Applicant has not connected to the District water system, the Application shall become void and all fees paid by the Applicant will be refunded to the Applicant.

C. The Applicant's real property or easement for receiving District water fronts or abuts an existing water main with adequate capacity and pressure to provide safe and reliable water service, as determined by the District.

D. The District possesses an adequate treated water supply, as determined by the District and evidenced by a Will-Serve Letter for a Single Service Connection.

E. All applicable provisions of this Code and other District rules, regulations and policies, and federal and state law.

In determining the adequacy of the existing facilities and supplies, the District will consider all factors such as the water requirements of the proposed new service, anticipated future land uses, flows and pressures required for regular service and fire protection, cross connection, desirability of looping water mains to ensure reliability.

If inadequate, additional capital facilities fees at the rate applicable at the time of the requested change shall be due before the District will accept any facilities and commence water service.

### 13000.01.3 Failure to File an Application for Water Service
Failure by any Person requesting or receiving water service to file an Application shall constitute a violation of this Code. Connection fees at the rate applicable at the time of discovery will become due and payable by the current owner of the property upon which water service has been connected without authorization.

### 13000.01.4 Applications Requiring Conveyance Agreement

As a condition for use of a smaller meter, the Applicant shall make the request in writing, which shall be a part of the Applicant's permanent application for service. In such application the Applicant shall acknowledge that the smaller size meter is authorized for the service requested. If, after authorization for use of a smaller meter, it is determined by the District that the size is insufficient due to higher water use than submitted by the Applicant or for any other reason, the Applicant shall pay the current cost of the new meter plus any applicable fees for improvements required for the new service. An Applicant who has been authorized to use a smaller meter pursuant to this paragraph shall be obligated to notify any purchaser of the property, or subsequent water user, of the above conditions imposed for use of the smaller meter.

**Ordinance Type:** District Operations  
**Date Adopted:** June 28, 2006  
**Ordinance Number & Title:** 14000 - Connection Fees for Water Service  
**Date Amended:** June 25, 2008  

### 14000.01 Determination of Connection Fees

**Basis for determination:** A connection fee shall be paid by the Applicant at the time of connection to the District’s water system to a specified parcel of land or address. The connection fee shall, at a minimum, consist of a capital facilities fee, annexation fees (if applicable), a meter installation inspection fee and a deposit for installing a service tap (as applicable). The amount of fees and charges shall be determined according to rates set by the Board of Directors and set forth in the District’s current Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits. All fees paid are applicable to the parcel, and remain with the parcel upon sale of the parcel.

Prior to August 1, 2008, the District may have accepted connection fees without requiring the Applicant to connect to the District’s water system. In these situations, if the full connection fee amount was paid by a Developer or Applicant and a meter was installed at the service connection, then no additional connection fee shall be considered to be due. If a connection fee was paid by a Developer or Applicant and they did not install a meter and connect to the District’s water system, the Applicant desiring to connect to the District’s water system shall be required to pay the current connection fees and previously-paid fees, with the appropriate documentation, shall be credited against the amount due.

Presently, prior to any service activation or re-activation, all differential amounts, or outstanding fees and charges must be made current. Connection fees shall be paid in accordance with the following:

A. For a new service, the connection fee is derived from the then-current Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits.  
B. For a service where prior connection fees were paid but the service was not activated, was abandoned, or there were no billings or billings were not paid, the differential between the prior amount(s) documented as paid and the current amount due for a new connection shall be paid, irrespective as to whether or not a meter is installed.  
C. For a service that had been activated and at least one billing occurred and was paid, was subsequently inactivated or abandoned, and there is a request for re-activation where the service has been inactive for more than one (1) year, the connection fee amount shall be calculated as the difference between the then-current connection fees per the Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits, and the connection fees at the time the Customer inactivated or abandoned the service. If the inactive period is less than a year, re-activation shall be in accordance with Ordinance Numbers 17000, 18000 and other applicable Ordinances which may also apply.

Payment of Capital Facilities Fees shall be as outlined in Ordinance 14000. Other conditions as outlined in Ordinance Numbers 12000, 13000, 17000 and other applicable Ordinances may also apply.

![Page 2 - Ordinance 14000 - Connection Fees for Water Service](https://example.com/image-url)

14000.02 Request for a Will Serve Letter for New Service Connections  
Upon receiving a written request for a Will Serve Letter (or Letter of Water Availability), the District shall issue a letter giving the current status of availability of treated water supply and facilities to serve a proposed development project on a particular parcel or parcels of land. A Will Serve Letter shall be only a statement of supply and capacity conditions as of the date of the letter. A Will Serve Letter shall not be deemed a contract or a binding commitment to provide water connections or service to any particular development project or property. A Will Serve Letter shall be valid for a maximum period of three one years.

14000.03 Application for a Will Serve Letter for a Development Project  
Any Developer or Applicant desiring a Will Serve Letter (or Letter of Water Availability) for any development project shall submit an application to the District in a form and content as determined by the District. Upon receipt of a full and complete Will-Serve Letter application and payment of all applicable fees, the District shall issue a brief Will-Serve Letter stating (1) whether, as of the date of the letter, treated water supply and facilities are available to serve the development project, and (2) that water connections and service shall be subject to applicable District Codes, resolutions, policies, fees and charges. The Will-Serve Letter shall be in a form and content approved by the General Manager or the Board of Directors. A Will Serve Letter shall not be issued for property located outside of the District boundaries. A Will Serve Letter shall be only a statement of supply and capacity conditions as of the date of the letter. A Will Serve Letter shall not be deemed a contract or a binding commitment to provide water connections or service to any particular development project or property. A Will Serve Letter shall be valid for a maximum period of three one years.

14000.04 Capital Facilities Fees  
Capital facilities fees are classified as the “backbone” of the system and are included in the District’s master plan. Their purpose is to provide revenues to treat, distribute, and store water for individual properties within the District. Bond sales, assessments, general District funds, and other financing vehicles also are used to fund capital facilities. Capital facilities fees for single connections shall be paid no later than at the time of connection or reconnection to the District water system, at the then-applicable rate. Capital Facilities Fees for parcel splits or sub-divisions shall be paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of a Conveyance Agreement, and under all circumstances must be fully paid prior to the District issuing written notice of Project Acceptance. Capital Facilities Fees are based on the amount of system capacity that could be used by a specific parcel, which is based on meter size. The fees are included in the District’s current Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits.

Prior to August 1, 2006 capital facilities fees were based on estimated water usage, and acreage agreements were entered into between eCustomers and the District to allow eCustomers who agreed to restricted water use to pay a reduced portion of capital facilities fees. These acreage agreements are not applicable with the revised capital facilities fees based on meter size, and new agreements will not be entered into by the District. However, while acreage agreements are still in force, the following paragraphs apply.

When the General Manager approved a capital facilities fee reduction for a project involving use of water on a portion of a parcel, the Applicant signed an Acreage Agreement in a form

Connection fees for non-enterprise parks, libraries, school districts, and fire departments shall be waived.

In non-emergency situations, upon receipt of two days' notice by the owner, either in writing, by phone, or in person, water service will be turned off and locked by the District without charge. All water charges up to and including the date of disconnection must be paid before service will be turned off and locked. Voluntary disconnection and subsequent reconnection or re-activation of a service may be subject to then current fees and charges. See District's current Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits, as well as Ordinance 14000 for additional pertinent information.

17000.075.2 Request for Turn-Off Without Notice  
Where notice is not given, the Owner will be required to pay for water service until two days after the District has actual knowledge that the Customer has vacated the Premises or otherwise discontinued water service.

17000.05.2 Reconnect Fee  
Before service is restored, a reconnect fee will be required. See District's current Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits.

17000.075.3 Request for Turn-Off by Landlord  
A Landlord may not request a service turn-off on any occupied leased or rented dwelling unit where water charges are paid current, except for emergency turn-offs related to public health or safety or to prevent loss of life or property damage.

## 17000.05.4 Extended Discontinuance or Inactive Service
A service that has been turned-off, discontinued, disconnected, terminated, or otherwise inactivated for an extended period can be considered to be abandoned or inactive and subject to fees and charges for re-activation including connection fees in accordance with Section 14000.01 and other applicable sections that may also apply.

## 17000.06.8 Reading of Meters
Meters shall be read every other calendar month or at a frequency established by the District to permit the computation, preparation and mailing of bills as soon thereafter as practicable.

Meters also are read when ownership of a property transfers from one Customer to another, when water service is discontinued and then restored, when maintenance is required at the meter, or when the Customer has requested assistance with irrigation problems or locating leaks. When the District does not receive advance notice of a change of ownership and the meter is not read when ownership transfers, the District shall estimate water use based on the Customer’s historical consumption.

## 17000.06.9 Adjustment for Meter Inaccuracies

### 17000.06.9.1 Failure of Meter to Register During Service
Should any meter in service fail to register during a billing period, a bill will be issued by the District for the estimated amount of water used during the period of the meter failure based on prior use under that account.

### 17000.06.9.2 Meter Testing
Initial Test: Prior to installation, each meter may be tested by the manufacturer or by the District.

Customer Request: A Customer may, giving not less than one week’s notice, request the District to test the meter serving the Customer’s Premises. The District will require the Customer to deposit the current fee to cover the cost of the test. See District’s current Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits.

The deposit will be returned if the meter is found to register more than three percent error. The Customer will be notified not less than two days in advance of the time and place of the test. The Customer shall have the right to be present or to be represented by a designated representative. A written report, giving the results of the test, will be given to the Customer within 14 days after completion of the test. When, upon testing, a meter is found to be registering more than three percent higher than actual usage under conditions of normal operation, the District will repair or replace the meter and refund to the Customer the full amount of the overcharge based on estimation of corrected meter readings for
<!-- Page 212 -->
![Page 4](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+4)

17000.07.1  
Upon written request from the Customer, the District will consider a one-time credit during a single billing period for excessive consumption due to a leak in Customer's service line. The Customer's written request shall describe the leak situation, include date(s) of leak, and must affirm that the leak has been repaired. Credits are based on the Customer's historical consumption and shall be determined by the District on a case-by-case basis.

17000.108  
Meter or Service Connection Downsizing or Upsizing

17000.108.1  
Voluntary:  
Customers may request the downsizing, but in no case smaller than one inch, or upsizing of their meter or service size. If the District approves a Customer's upsizing or downsizing request, the Customer shall pay for all costs of the conversion on a time and material basis. In addition, if a larger meter is desired, the Customer shall pay the difference between the current connection fee for the larger meter and the current connection fee for the existing meter size. The District will provide the Customer with a cost estimate. The Customer must pay the difference in connection fee and provide the District a deposit in the amount of the cost estimate for time and materials prior to the District starting work. If the change in water service requested would require a meter or service connection of a smaller size, no refund shall be due or payable for fees previously paid, including capital facilities fees.

17000.108.2  
Involuntary:  
Pursuant to Section 13000.02, if the size or water demand of the parcel(s) receiving water service does not qualify for the current size of meter or service connection, the District reserves the right to involuntarily decrease or increase the size of meter or service connection and backflow prevention assembly. The District will make every attempt to notify the Customer in advance and schedule the work at the Customer's convenience. However, if after thirty days following notice from the District the Customer has not responded or taken action to correct the problem, the District will schedule and complete the work as stated in the notice and charge all costs and fees owing for the work to the Customer.

# 17000.1109 Recommended Flows for District Meters

Customers are cautioned to control rates of flow of water through District meters. Customer-caused damage to a water meter is subject to a District charge to repair or replace a damaged meter. The District may terminate water service if a customer fails to pay any charges for meter repair or replacement or to correct a continuing flow problem. Operation of a meter that flows in excess of the manufacturer's recommendation can cause severe damage to operating parts. Rated capacities for meters used in the District are as follows:

| Maximum Rate per Meter  | Maximum Rate per Meter  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Size (size in inches)   | Gallons per Minute      |

# 17000.120 Damaging or Tampering with Meters

Ordinance 17000 - Metered Services  
Page 5
<!-- Page 214 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Whenever the District has determined that a water meter has been wilfully damaged or tampered with in such a manner that the meter does not properly register the consumption of water, the meter shall be locked or removed and the water service terminated. The meter shall not be opened or reinstalled for service until all of the following charges have been paid:

A. Outstanding water bills for the Premises being served by that meter;

B. An unauthorized connection fee as set forth in the District’s current Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits, if applicable;

C. A charge for servicing, repairing, or replacing the meter equal to the District expense for time and materials;

D. A meter installation fee in accordance with Section 12000.03; and

E. A charge for estimated quantity of water consumed but not paid for since the last regular correct reading, which shall be determined on the basis of prior use under the Customer’s account for the damaged or tampered meter.

### 17000.134 Angle Stop

Every service connection is equipped with an angle stop valve on the inlet side of the meter. The District’s responsibility for maintenance terminates at the Customer’s side of the water service meter box. The angle stops are for the exclusive use of the District in controlling use of the water through the service connection and/or meter. If the angle stop should be damaged or worn out through use by a Customer to an extent requiring replacement or repair, the District shall charge the Customer for such replacement and/or repair.

### 17000.142 Customer Responsibility

The District assumes no responsibility for maintenance and operation of the Customer’s water system beyond the service connection. The Customer assumes all liability and responsibility of every kind to the end that the District shall be kept whole and harmless at all times of any claim resulting from matters involving quantities, quality, time or occasion of delivery, or any other phase of the maintenance, operation and service of the Customer’s water system.

The District recommends for convenience and safety that the water system on the Customer’s Premises be equipped with a wheel shutoff valve for the customer’s use to isolate their water system and turn off their water supply. The wheel shutoff valve shall be placed at some known accessible location between the meter and the building.

### 17000.13 Service/Meter Enhancements

Any Customer desiring to make any improvements or changes requiring cutting, refitting, raising, lowering or relocating service connections shall make an application to the District. Upon approval of the application by the District, deposits will be required prior to the work commencing. District personnel at approved locations shall perform all work. Should the deposit be in excess of the actual cost, the difference shall be refunded. Should the cost exceed the deposit, the additional amount due will be payable in full to the District upon presentation of the bill.

![17000.154 Minimum Pressure](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

17000.154 Minimum Pressure  
The District ordinarily will provide a minimum of 20-psi residual pressure at the meter/service connection. When a Customer’s Premises would be serviced at an expected minimum pressure of less than 20-psi, the District agrees to pay for, construct and maintain a booster pump facility and a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device, per Section 10000.04 prior to or at the District’s service of water to the Premises. Only District employees shall be permitted to operate booster pumping equipment and any unauthorized use of such equipment may be grounds for termination of water service.

17000.165 Maximum Pressure  
Whenever the District provides pressure greater than 80-psi, the customer will install, adjust, and maintain a pressure regulator controlling the pressure on their premises per the California State Plumbing Code.

**Ordinance Type:** District Operations  
**Date Adopted:** June 28, 2006  
**Ordinance Number & Title:** 18000 - Bills for Water Service  
**Date Amended:** February 1, 2020  

### 18000.01 Bills For Water Service

#### 18000.01.1 Issuance of Bills
Bills for water service or other charges will be mailed or presented in the month following the water meter reading and/or the applicable charges have been determined. Issuance shall be every other month. Final bills for sale of property are exempt from this billing cycle.

#### 18000.01.2 Fixed Base Charge
Billing for water service includes a fixed base charge that primarily funds fixed costs. This typically includes facilities, infrastructure maintenance, debt service, customer service, and other similar needs that have to be paid for regardless of how much water is delivered to customers. The fixed base charge is due regardless of whether any water is actually used. Customers whose service has been discontinued in accordance with section 18000.03 or has requested that their service be discontinued in accordance with District ordinance section 17000.05 will not be assessed the fixed base charge for months subsequent to discontinuance.

#### 18000.01.3 Consumption Charge
Billing for water service includes a consumption charge that primarily funds the expenses to the District necessary for the purchase and distribution of water to customers. The consumption charge, as set forth in the District’s most current rate study, is assessed for each one-hundred cubic feet (CCF) of water actually consumed.

#### 18000.01.4 Billing Periods
Bills for general water service generally will be rendered bi-monthly by the District. Bills for special water services (temporary water service, construction water, fire hydrant use) may be rendered more frequently. Special meter readings will be made for opening or closing billing purposes.

**Page 1**
<!-- Page 217 -->
![18000.01.5 Billing on Non-Owner-Occupied Residences](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
California Government Code section 53447 authorizes public agencies to collect charges from property owners for services to tenants on those properties. Therefore, with the property owner’s authorization, evidenced by a signed Landlord/Tenant Agreement from the legal owner of the property, and a deposit that meets the requirements of District ordinance section 15000.01, the District shall provide a bill copy to the service address for water service. However, the property owner shall be responsible to pay any charges not paid by the tenant. The District shall not share any account information with the tenant, other than the outstanding balance, in the absence of a completed Landlord/Tenant Agreement application which imposes primary responsibility to pay the water bill on the tenant.

![18000.01.6 Back Billing](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
If a eCustomer uses water for which no bills have been issued for more than one billing cycle, and a beginning meter reading is not available, the eCustomer will be billed the fixed base charge for the period plus a consumption charge calculated from the average water usage over the most recent six billing cycles. This amount, which shall not be less than the base charge if no billing history is available, will be billed to the eCustomer based on the number of billing cycles the eCustomer has been occupying or in possession of the premises without paying bills.

![18000.01.7 Refunds](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
If a eCustomer is erroneously overcharged for service, the District may refund any overage paid by the eCustomer up to two years.

![18000.01.8 Disputed Charges](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
When a eCustomer disputes the amount of a bill for any reason, the eCustomer should contact the District office. If the bill is disputed, to avoid discontinuance of water service, the eCustomer must deposit at the District office, before the disconnect date, the full amount of the disputed bill or proof of previous payment of the disputed bill with a letter setting forth the basis for the dispute and requesting a review by the Finance Director or General Manager. The Finance Director or General Manager’s findings and decisions will be final and binding. If the eCustomer’s complaint concerns the meter, he or she may request that his or her meter be tested pursuant to Section 17000.07.2 Meter Testing of the District’s most current water ordinance. Nothing in this section is intended to affect a eCustomer’s rights under Health & Safety Code section 116900 and following and the District’s Policy on Discontinuation of Residential Water Service for Nonpayment (“Policy”) implementing those rights.

![Ordinance 18000 - Bills for Water Service](https://example.com/image-url)

18000.01.9  Bill Adjustment for Leaks  
Upon a Customer’s submission of a consumption credit form, the District will consider a one-time credit for water consumption resulting from a leak in a Customer’s internal water system or when there is significant unexplained usage. Credits are determined by comparing the Customer’s water use during the period in which the leak occurred to their historical water use for that same period and splitting the difference (resulting in a credit of 50% of the above average usage at the current volumetric rate). The Customer has the right to accept the credit or save the one-time credit allowance for future use. All Customer requests for a credit will be considered on a case by case basis and the District reserves the right to approve or deny any request.

18000.01.10  Due Date  
Each statement issued by the District for such charges shall be due and payable on the date of issuance or other presentation to the Customer.

18000.01.11  Final Payment Date  
Bills become delinquent and subject to discontinuation of service if not paid within 60 days from the bill issuance date.

18000.02  Payment of Charges  
A. Payment Responsibility: The District is required to continue providing water service to each Premises or Parcel connected to the District water system as long as each Premises or Parcel pays its fair share of the costs of receiving the service and such fair share of costs are chargeable to and run with each Premises or Parcel receiving District water service. Therefore, payment of all water service rates, fees and charges shall be the responsibility of the owner of record of the subject Premises or Parcel and payment of all charges is an obligation of ownership of a Premises or Parcel. As such, any subsequent owner of a Premises or Parcel is responsible for paying any unpaid or delinquent fees, rates and charges due on a Premises or Parcel that are in any way connected to District water service as a condition of service being continued to the Premises or Parcel. A change in ownership does not terminate any outstanding rates, fees and charges due for previous water service to said parcel, whether or not those rates, fees and charges were incurred by the present Premises or Parcel owner or a previous owner or tenant.

B. Crediting of Payment: Payments shall be credited to a Customer’s account when cash, an electronic funds transfer, a check drawn on an account with sufficient funds a money order or a Visa or MasterCard payment has been received by the District at the District business office during regular office hours. Deposit of payment in the mail shall be credited to a Customer’s account when received at the District’s business office.
<!-- Page 219 -->
C. **Dishonored Payment Charge:** A returned item charge as set forth in the District’s current Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits shall be added to a Customer’s account in each instance where payment has been made to the District that has been returned to the District by the bank upon which it is drawn.

D. The District offers an average monthly or equalized payment plan to balance water bills that can fluctuate seasonally. The equalized amount is based on the Customer’s average consumption during the current 12-month period. Average monthly or equalized payment plans are reconciled annually and adjusted as needed.

E. The District offers online bill presentment and payment to Customers who wish to view their bill and/or pay by check or Visa or MasterCard via the internet.

F. Customers may make payment arrangements with the District. Defaulting on a payment arrangement may lead to disconnection of service.

### 18000.03 Delinquent Accounts

#### 18000.03.1 For Non-Payment of Charges
Except as otherwise prohibited by law, a delinquent account from a premises within the District will be applied to a new account opened by the same Customer for a different premises, and the District may require payment of the delinquent amount (plus penalties and interest) as a condition of opening the new account, or the District may pursue any other remedy for collection of delinquent accounts provided for in this Code or other District rule, regulation or policy, or applicable state and federal law.

#### 18000.03.2 Late-Payment Charge
A late-payment charge shall be added to each delinquent account upon preparation of an Intent to Disconnect Notice. When a late-payment charge is imposed, such charge shall be added to the account as of the date the notice is prepared, and such charge shall become part of the amount due at that time. The current late-payment fee amount is set forth in the District’s Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits. The District may, at its discretion, apply a late-payment charge upon other reasonable notification to Customer for connections where a door hanger cannot be delivered (i.e. connections for irrigation service or for residences or commercial buildings under construction).

#### 18000.03.3 Partial Payment on Delinquent Accounts
A partial payment on a delinquent account may be accepted and credited to a Customer’s account. The partial payment shall not cause removal of the account from an existing delinquent status or preclude assessment of fees and charges for delinquent payment, nor shall the partial payment

18000.03.4 Discontinuation of Service to Delinquent Accounts  
A. Discontinuation of Service: Continuation of service to a delinquent account will be permitted only as set forth in the Policy, adopted and amended from time to time by the Board of Directors, if financial arrangements have been established in accordance with the Policy.  
B. Requirement of Deposit: If a Customer permits his or her account to become delinquent, the General Manager or his/her designee may require the Customer to make a deposit in accordance with the provisions of Section 15000 of this Code.  

18000.03.5 Lien for Delinquent Charges  
1. To the extent permitted by law, the District may file with the Placer or Sacramento County Recorder a Notice of Lien (whichever is the County in which the property is located), setting forth the legal description of the property, the amount of the obligation owed, specifying that the same is owed to the District, and that all delinquent service charges, together with late fees, penalties and interest, are a lien against the Premises to which service was provided in accordance with Government Code Section 54354.  
2. All outstanding account balances, interest and lien release charges (if applicable) must be paid in full prior to re-establishing service in the owner’s name at the same, or different property within the boundaries of the District.  
3. Current accounts that have incurred a large amount of fines, or the owner that maintains the account has refused to pay any balance owed and the District may be placed in a position of incurring bad debt may have a lien placed against the property being served by the District until the balance associated with those charges is paid in full.  

18000.03.6 Reinstatement of Water Service Under Delinquent Accounts  
Water service accounts terminated for non-payment shall be reinstated as provided in the Policy.  

18000.04 Termination of Master Meter Accounts  
This Section applies to termination of water service through a master meter, or through individually-metered service in a multi-unit residential structure or mobile home park, where the owner or manager, is listed by the District as the Customer of record of the service. Termination and reinstatement of such accounts will be in accordance with the Policy. A Person subject to a master metered account that was not directly billed by the District, who opens an individual service accounts after the termination of a

Deliveries to SSWD are 94.0% greater than anticipated for this point in the year and deliveries to Citrus Heights Water District are 11.7% higher than anticipated.

The 22.4% positive variance in deliveries results in year to date revenues that are 13.2% greater than anticipated in the budget for this point in the year.

# AGENDA ITEM VII-2.1

Davis Farr LLP  
18201 Von Karman Avenue | Suite 1100 | Irvine, CA 92612  
Main: 949.474.2020 | Fax: 949.263.5520  

June 11, 2024  
Board of Directors  
Granite Bay, California  

This letter is provided in connection with our engagement to audit the financial statements of the San Juan Water District (the District) as of and for the year ending June 30, 2024. Professional standards require that we communicate with you certain items including our responsibilities with regard to the financial statement audit and the planned scope and timing of our audit, including significant risks we have identified. Additionally, as a part of our audit, we inquire with those whose duties include oversight of the financial reporting process (review and acceptance of audit reports, etc.) to ascertain whether or not anyone on the Board has knowledge of matters that might have a bearing on the auditor’s risk assessment for the District’s annual audit.

Example of these matters are:

- Known or suspected instances of employee fraud
- Areas in which the internal controls of the District are thought by the Board of Directors to be weak
- Known or suspected misstatements in the accounting records of the District
- Known or suspected use of improper accounting practices by the District
- Any awareness of pressure upon the District or District management with respect to achieving certain financial results
- Matters that warrant particular attention during the audit
- Information about unusual transactions or other matters relevant to the audit

Generally, the scope of the audit is limited to matters involving amounts that would be significant to the financial statements of the District taken as a whole. If additional time is required to respond to the concerns of the Board of Directors, we will estimate for the District the costs involved.

Please respond within 45 days from the date of this letter if the Board of Directors has any matters to report that meet the above criteria.
<!-- Page 252 -->
![Our Responsibilities](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Our+Responsibilities)

**Our Responsibilities**

As stated in our engagement letter dated May 15, 2024, we are responsible for conducting our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and in accordance with Government Auditing Standards for the purpose of forming and expressing an opinion about whether the financial statements that have been prepared by management, with your oversight, are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our audit does not relieve you or management of your respective responsibilities.

Our responsibility relating to other information, whether financial or nonfinancial information (other than financial statements and the auditor’s report thereon), included in the District’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) includes only the information identified in our report. We have no responsibility for determining whether the Introductory Section or Statistical Section is properly stated. We require that we receive the final version of the ACFR in a timely manner prior to the date of the auditor’s report, or if that is not possible, as soon as practicable and, in any case, prior to the entity’s issuance of such information.

**Planned Scope of the Audit**

Our audit will include examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; therefore, our audit will involve judgment about the number of transactions to be examined and the areas to be tested. Our audit is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement, whether due to error, fraudulent financial reporting, misappropriation of assets, or violations of laws or governmental regulations. Because of this concept of reasonable assurance and because we will not examine all transactions, there is a risk that material misstatements may exist and not be detected by us.

Our audit will include obtaining an understanding of the entity and its environment, including its internal control, sufficient to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements and as a basis for designing the nature, timing, and extent of further audit procedures, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control over financial reporting. However, we will communicate to you at the conclusion of our audit any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies identified. We will also communicate to you:

- Any violation of laws or regulations that come to our attention;
- Our views relating to qualitative aspects of the entity’s significant accounting practices, including accounting policies, accounting estimates, and financial statement disclosures;
- Significant difficulties, if any, encountered during the audit;
- Disagreements with management, if any, encountered during the audit;
- Significant unusual transactions, if any;
<!-- Page 253 -->
- The potential effects of uncorrected misstatements on future-period financial statements; and
- Other significant matters that are relevant to your responsibilities in overseeing the financial reporting process.

We performed preliminary audit procedures in June 2024 and will return to perform the final audit in October 2024 with the plan of completing the audit and finalizing the ACFR in December 2024.

**Audit Approach**

In addition to our standard audit approach, we have identified significant audit risk areas for the San Juan Water District and plan to modify our audit approach as follows:

- **New SRF loan transactions:** We will evaluate new debt transactions including reviewing the agreements and journal entries to ensure they are recorded properly and the footnotes contain complete and accurate disclosures.

- **Federal grant compliance:** Due to federal grant expenditures exceeding $750,000, the District will be subject to a federal Single Audit for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. We will perform testing in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget Uniform Guidance.

- **Each year we are required to incorporate an element of unpredictability into our audit approach.** This year, we plan to select a sample of payments to vendors and review compliance with the District’s purchasing policy.

If any member of the Board of Directors has information relevant to our audit (matters involving amounts that would be significant to the financial statements of the District taken as a whole), please contact the undersigned at (949) 783-1740 or JFarr@davisfarr.com.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Farr  
Partner

# AGENDA ITEM VIII-3

June 26, 2024

Director Tobin’s Report  
ACWA

## The State Water Resources Control Board

On July 3 will hold a board meeting to consider adoption of the proposed Making Conservation a California Way of Life regulation.

The regulation outlines water uses efficiency goals for each urban retail water supplier, including urban water use efficiency standards, variances, an urban water use objective, and commercial, industrial, and institutional (CII) performance measures.

The State Water Board on June 14 released the fourth version of the revised draft regulation for Making Conservation a California Way of Life with written comments due by noon on July 1.

ACWA, its member agencies, and coalition partners have been highly engaged on the state’s pre-rulemaking efforts to inform the Making Conservation a California Way of Life Regulation. ACWA continues to advocate for a water use efficiency framework that is feasible and cost-effective and does not impair water agencies’ ability to make long-term investments for climate resilience. More information is available on ACWA’s Water Use Efficiency web page.

## State Must Re-Engage on the Voluntary Agreements

Public water agencies across California call on Governor Newsom and his administration to re-engage in negotiations with the federal administration and stakeholders to successfully complete the Voluntary Agreements (VAs).

The Water Resilience Portfolio is intended to provide a blueprint to meet the water needs of California’s communities, economy, and the environment through the 21st century. It includes several actions to support the VAs to meet the goal of protecting and enhancing natural ecosystems, including to “bring together regulators, tribes, water users, public water agencies, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders to develop innovative, voluntary solutions to water supply, water quality, and ecosystem protection”.

The Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA) are expressing strong opposition to any reduction or reversion of previously committed funding for water resilience projects related to the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Bay-Delta).
<!-- Page 255 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

Specifically, the Legislature is proposing to rescind critical funding that is currently available to support no-regrets habitat and water supply projects that are already providing drought resiliency for the environment, farms, and people. While these critical projects support early implementation of the Agreements to Support Healthy Rivers and Landscapes (Agreements), formerly referred to as the Voluntary Agreements, these types of projects are urgently needed regardless of what decision the State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) may make regarding the updated Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan.

## Federal Support for Voluntary Agreements

The Biden Administration Should Embrace the Voluntary Agreements Public water agencies across California call on the Biden Administration to embrace the Voluntary Agreements (VAs) and engage in negotiations with the Newsom Administration and stakeholders to successfully complete the VAs. To implement this modern water management approach, the Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA) asks the Biden Administration to take the following actions:

1. Resolve the litigation between the federal government, State of California, public water agencies and NGOs regarding the Incidental Take Permit and the Biological Opinion. Support and assist water agencies that have proposed early implementation projects to accelerate improvements for fish and wildlife, including with direct funding, a mechanism to collect fees and streamlined permitting processes.
2. Work with California to convene all parties to complete the VAs and the related efforts to advance the implementation of the State’s Water Quality Control Plan through the VAs.
3. Support and assist water agencies that have proposed early implementation projects to accelerate improvements for fish and wildlife, including with direct funding.

ACWA Region 2 June 27, 2024 is hosting a program and tour to highlight the resilience and revival of the town of Paradise, in the wake of the devastating 2018 Camp Fire. This comprehensive tour and program will delve into the multifaceted aspects of recovery, focusing on mitigation and fire prevention initiatives spearheaded by the Paradise Irrigation District, as well as the remarkable economic resurgence and the ongoing rebuild of the town of Paradise.

# OTHER JUNE NEWS

- **SANTA CLARITA VALLEY WATER AGENCY – JUNE 11, 2024**

Part of its commitment to restoring local groundwater reliability, SCV Water will soon begin construction of a new treatment facility to remove per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and restore three wells to service that are currently offline due to PFAS detection. The proposed facility will also remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from two additional wells. Construction on the facility, which will be added to the current Rio Vista Intake Pump Station on Bouquet Canyon Road near the Lowe’s shopping center, will begin in the summer of 2024. Construction is anticipated to take 18 months to complete.

- **BILL THAT WOULD HAVE BANNED SOME NEW GROUNDWATER WELLS FAILS TO PASS OUT OF SENATE COMMITTEE JUNE 12, 2024**

AB 2079 (Bennett), which would have banned local agencies from permitting some new groundwater wells, failed to pass out of the Senate Natural Resources and Water Committee on Tuesday, effectively stopping the bill.

ACWA’s State Legislative Committee adopted an oppose-unless-amended position due to concerns over the moratorium on new wells throughout much of the state and the potential legal liability it created for local agencies. The bill would have prohibited well-permitting agencies from approving applications for agricultural and industrial wells in basins that experienced more than half a foot of subsidence since 2015, or if the well was within a quarter mile of a domestic well.

ACWA participated in a large coalition of associations, water agencies, business and agricultural interests in opposing the bill, and ACWA Senior State Relations Advocate Kristopher Anderson testified Tuesday, encouraging the committee to vote against the bill.

- **EMMY AWARDS PRESENTED TO RANCHO WATER AND POST AND JAM FOR PSA JUNE 20, 2024**

The Rancho California Water District (Rancho Water/District) and Post and Jam LLC (Post and Jam) media productions company were the recipients of Emmy Awards at the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS) ceremony on Saturday, June 15, 2024. The Pacific Southwest (PSW) chapter presented both agencies with awards for the category of Public Service Announcement for the “Be a Water Hero” communications campaign.

The “Be a Water Hero” campaign includes commercials in English and Spanish which have aired locally in theatres and via digital streaming and promote the idea of being water efficient every day even when the region is drought-free. Commercials were

written and produced by Rancho Water’s Public Affairs Manager Kimberly Wall and directed and edited by Post and Jam’s owner and director Warren Burley.

“I am so honored to be the recipient of this prestigious Emmy Award on behalf of Rancho Water and am thankful for our wonderful partnership with Warren and his team at Post and Jam,” said Kimberly Wall, Rancho Water Public Affairs Manager. “The district is committed to promoting water efficiency and providing excellence in communications for our community, so being presented with this award is truly humbling.”

Post and Jam’s Director Warren Burley stated, “Post and Jam is thrilled to celebrate almost a decade of successful collaboration with Rancho Water. Our partnership has been a source of immense pride and excitement, consistently yielding creative and innovative outcomes. Each project undertaken with Rancho Water has been a testament to the synergy and dedication we share. Winning an Emmy together with Rancho Water was a well-deserved honor that underscores the excellence and creativity of our joint efforts. We look forward to many more years of groundbreaking projects and mutual growth.”

With almost 700 members, NATAS PSW serves television professionals in San Diego, Bakersfield, Las Vegas, Palm Springs, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Santa Maria, and has awarded Emmys since 1974. The winning commercial for “Be a Water Hero” can be found on Rancho Water’s website at RanchoWater.com/waterhero.

**WRD AWARDED $25 MILLION WATERSMART GRANT FOR BRACKISH GROUNDWATER CLEANUP PROJECT JUNE 20, 2024**

The Water Replenishment District (WRD) has been awarded a $25 million WaterSMART grant from the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation for the construction of a groundwater desalination project – the largest desalination grant awarded in this round.

This project will significantly increase the locally sustainable drinking water supply for the South Bay by doubling the capacity of WRD’s Desalter located in the city of Torrance. The Torrance Groundwater Desalter Expansion project will be designed to extract and purify approximately 10 million gallons a day from a salty groundwater plume. The removal of this salty groundwater will create groundwater storage capacity for excess local freshwater and recycled water for the region to use in future drought years.

The saline plume located under the South Bay is the result of the over-extraction of groundwater in the early 1900s. This caused seawater to intrude into the groundwater basin where it mixed with freshwater; making that groundwater too salty to be used. The expansion will create a new source of clean drinking water for the region.
<!-- Page 258 -->
The Water Replenishment District of Southern California is the regional groundwater management agency that protects and preserves the quantity and quality of groundwater for two of the most utilized urban basins in the State of California. The service area is home to over ten percent of California’s population residing in 43 cities in southern Los Angeles County

# FRIANT-KERN CANAL FIX CELEBRATES MILESTONE JUNE 25, 2024

The Bureau of Reclamation, Friant Water Authority, and California Department of Water Resources on June 21 cut the ribbon to celebrate completion of Phase 1 of the Friant-Kern Canal Middle Reach Capacity Correction Project. The project will restore capacity to 33 miles of the existing Friant-Kern Canal damaged from subsidence—a sinking of the earth from groundwater removal.

The 152-mile Friant-Kern Canal plays a critical role in delivering water to 1 million acres of highly productive farmland and more than 250,000 people from Fresno to Bakersfield in Central California. Since the canal’s construction in 1951, more than 50% of its original conveyance capacity in the middle reach has been lost due to land subsidence. Phase 1 of the project focused on the construction of 10 miles of new concrete-lined canal to replace one of the worst pinch points of the canal’s subsiding middle reach.

“Today’s ribbon cutting celebration is a shining example of what can happen when federal, state, and local agencies partner together in pursuit of future water security,” said Reclamation Regional Director Karl Stock. “This celebration marks an important milestone for one of Reclamation’s most critical priorities: to provide water supply reliability to one of the most productive agriculture regions in the nation.”

“There are few bigger priorities in water management than readying ourselves to move and store water when it’s wet. It takes partnerships like this between federal, state, and local governments to make sure our infrastructure is up to the task,” said DWR Director Karla Nemeth. “That’s why DWR is so excited to celebrate today’s milestone on the federal Friant-Kern Canal. We look forward to similar partnerships to ensure that the California Aqueduct and Delta Mendota Canal are rehabilitated to meet the challenges of weather whiplash that lie ahead.”

“Nelson Mandela once said, ‘it always seems impossible until it’s done,’ and there’s no better way to describe the efforts of all the partners involved in the Friant-Kern Canal Middle Reach Capacity Project,” said Friant Water Authority Chief Executive Officer Jason Phillips. “The completion of Phase 1 will provide incalculable benefits for the farms, communities, and people of the Friant Division for decades. The Friant Water Authority looks forward to working with our project partners to protect the enormous investment made and to ensure that those benefits can be realized long after we are all gone.”

The project was funded by Reclamation, Friant Water Authority, and DWR. Phase 2 of the project will address correcting subsidence-related deficiencies in the portion of the Middle Reach section not addressed in Phase 1. Phase 2 of the project has been awarded more than $22 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law through President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda for planning and design.

The canal, part of the Central Valley Project’s Friant Division, is owned by the federal government; Friant Water Authority operates and maintains it under contract with Reclamation. The canal’s diminished capacity has resulted in up to 300,000 acre-feet of reduced water deliveries in certain water years with effects most prominent in the middle reach of the canal (milepost 88 to milepost 121). The Middle Reach Capacity Correction Project will restore conveyance capacity from the current estimated 1,600 cubic-feet-per-second to the original 4,000 cubic-feet-per-second in the most critical area near the Deer Creek check structure (milepost 103). Reclamation signed the Record of Decision for the project in November 2020.

**BUREAU INCREASES SOUTH-OF-DELTA ALLOCATION JUNE 26, 2024**

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on June 25 announced another increase in the Central Valley Project 2024 water supply allocation for south-of-Delta contractors.

While all north-of-Delta Central Valley Project contractors are currently at 100% of their allocations, south-of-Delta agricultural contractors are being increased from 40% to 50%. All other Central Valley Project contract allocations remain the same, per the March 22 water supply update. Initial contract allocations were announced on Feb. 21 and updated in March and April.

“With the current and forecasted conditions that factor into Central Valley Project allocations, in particular, a greater than expected rate of exports during the month of June, we are pleased to be able to provide an additional increase to south-of-Delta agricultural contractors,” California-Great Basin Regional Director Karl Stock stated in a Bureau news release.

In a news release, Westlands Water District welcomed the increase and called it clearly justified, but also described it as long overdue, especially given the current favorable water conditions throughout the state.

“This announcement provides much-needed relief and is good news for our growers. Even so, the low water supply allocations announced earlier in this contract year, after a relatively wet winter that filled the reservoirs and lifted the state officially out of drought conditions, single-handedly demonstrate the critical and urgent need to improve water management transparency and accountability in the state of California,” Westlands Water District General Manager Allison Febbo stated in the release. “We need a more collaborative and transparent approach to regulatory decisions that affect our water.”

**supply, and we urge the five agencies responsible for making these decisions to rely more effectively on sound data and information. Every drop of CVP water allocation given to Westlands Water District growers is food grown, jobs produced, and groundwater saved.”**

1. **Review General Manager Reimbursements (W & R)**

2. **Review Check Register from May 2024 (W & R)**

3. **Proposed Update to District Procurement Policy and Approval of Invoices/Purchase Orders in excess of $50,000 (W & R)**  
   Ms. Silva reviewed a written staff report which will be included in the Board packet. She explained that the General Manager’s purchasing authority has been $50,000 since at least July 28, 2006. Since then, general inflation has increased the Consumer Price Index by 55%; and she is recommending that the General Manager’s purchasing authority be commensurately increased. She reviewed the list of comparator agencies which showed their purchasing authority and suggested that the General Manager’s purchasing authority be increased by 50% from $50,000 to $75,000. The committee agreed with staff’s recommendation.

   Ms. Silva explained that the District’s procurement policy applies to certain expenses that are not discretionary, such as regulatory fees and utility payments. In addition, she recommends that the Procurement Policy be changed to allow the District to piggyback on another government’s contract, as described in the staff report. The committee discussed the proposed changes to the policy and agreed with staff’s recommendations.

   Ms. Silva informed the committee that staff performed a review of all expenses made this year in excess of $50,000 (the General Manager’s current expenditure authority). She reviewed the list of invoices that were paid that were in excess of the General Manager’s expenditure authority and that did not receive Board approval; therefore, staff is requesting that the committee recommend that the Board approve specific.

invoices/purchase orders paid/issued in Fiscal Year 2023-24 in excess of the purchasing authority in the current Procurement Policy. The committee agreed with staff's recommendation.
