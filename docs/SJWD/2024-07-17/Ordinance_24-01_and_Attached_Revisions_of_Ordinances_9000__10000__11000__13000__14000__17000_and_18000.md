The District assumes no responsibility for the delivery of water through privately-owned pipelines or systems, nor shall the District assume any responsibility for damages resulting from the operation of any such system even though water may be received from a District water distribution system. In cases where a District water meter is installed at some point on a privately-owned water line, the District is liable only for the water meter, meter box, and the fittings required to attach and operate the meter. The fact that a water meter is installed on a privately-owned water line does not create an express or implied dedication to public use of a private water line or impose any obligation or liability on the District to operate maintain, repair, remove, or replace any portion of that water line. In the cases where the meter is located on a private water line, other than the appurtenances listed above, District responsibility ends on the Customer's side of the isolation valve at the main to the premises.

If meters are located on a private line, the District may, at its discretion, relocate the meter adjacent to the property line within the public right of way with the appropriate backflow and isolation facilities. The District will be required to reconnect the piping at the location of the old meter and will guarantee the work for one (1) year upon completion. The District will not take responsibility for the condition or workmanship of the private line on either side of old meter installation or the work completed. If the existing private line is not in a condition to accept the repair connections, the Customer will be required to upgrade the private line as directed by the District.

# 10000.028  Water Pressure Regulation

## 10000.023.1  Customer Responsibility

The District shall assume no responsibility for water pressure regulation within a Customer's service area.

The Customer shall be required to install an appropriate pressure regulation device for such service where static pressure exceeds 80 psi at the service connection (UPC Code 1007 and California State Plumbing Code).

District employees will not make adjustments to Customer-owned pressure regulators.

## 10000.023.2  Requirement for Installation in New Construction

Customers making application for water service for new construction for residential, commercial or industrial use shall be required to install an approved meter and appropriate pressure regulation device for such service where static pressure exceeds 80 psi at the service connection (UPC Code 1007 and California State Plumbing Code).

**Ordinance Type:** District Operations  
**Date Adopted:** June 28, 2006  
**Ordinance Number & Title:** 14000 - Connection Fees for Water Service  
**Date Amended:** June 25, 2008  

### 14000.01 Determination of Connection Fees

**Basis for determination:** A connection fee shall be paid by the Applicant at the time of connection to the District’s water system to a specified parcel of land or address. The connection fee shall, at a minimum, consist of a capital facilities fee, annexation fees (if applicable), a meter installation inspection fee and a deposit for installing a service tap (as applicable). The amount of fees and charges shall be determined according to rates set by the Board of Directors and set forth in the District’s current Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits. All fees paid are applicable to the parcel, and remain with the parcel upon sale of the parcel.

Prior to August 1, 2008, the District may have accepted connection fees without requiring the Applicant to connect to the District’s water system. In these situations, if the full connection fee amount was paid by a Developer or Applicant and a meter was installed at the service connection, then no additional connection fee shall be considered to be due. If a connection fee was paid by a Developer or Applicant and they did not install a meter and connect to the District’s water system, the Applicant desiring to connect to the District’s water system shall be required to pay the current connection fees and previously-paid fees, with the appropriate documentation, shall be credited against the amount due.

Presently, prior to any service activation or re-activation, all differential amounts, or outstanding fees and charges must be made current. Connection fees shall be paid in accordance with the following:

A. For a new service, the connection fee is derived from the then-current Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits.  
B. For a service where prior connection fees were paid but the service was not activated, was abandoned, or there were no billings or billings were not paid, the differential between the prior amount(s) documented as paid and the current amount due for a new connection shall be paid, irrespective as to whether or not a meter is installed.  
C. For a service that had been activated and at least one billing occurred and was paid, was subsequently inactivated or abandoned, and there is a request for re-activation where the service has been inactive for more than one (1) year, the connection fee amount shall be calculated as the difference between the then-current connection fees per the Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits, and the connection fees at the time the Customer inactivated or abandoned the service. If the inactive period is less than a year, re-activation shall be in accordance with Ordinance Numbers 17000, 18000 and other applicable Ordinances which may also apply.

Payment of Capital Facilities Fees shall be as outlined in Ordinance 14000. Other conditions as outlined in Ordinance Numbers 12000, 13000, 17000 and other applicable Ordinances may also apply.

14000.02 Request for a Will Serve Letter for New Service Connections  
Upon receiving a written request for a Will Serve Letter (or Letter of Water Availability), the District shall issue a letter giving the current status of availability of treated water supply and facilities to serve a proposed development project on a particular parcel or parcels of land. A Will Serve Letter shall be only a statement of supply and capacity conditions as of the date of the letter. A Will Serve Letter shall not be deemed a contract or a binding commitment to provide water connections or service to any particular development project or property. A Will Serve Letter shall be valid for a maximum period of three one years.

14000.03 Application for a Will Serve Letter for a Development Project  
Any Developer or Applicant desiring a Will Serve Letter (or Letter of Water Availability) for any development project shall submit an application to the District in a form and content as determined by the District. Upon receipt of a full and complete Will-Serve Letter application and payment of all applicable fees, the District shall issue a brief Will-Serve Letter stating (1) whether, as of the date of the letter, treated water supply and facilities are available to serve the development project, and (2) that water connections and service shall be subject to applicable District Codes, resolutions, policies, fees and charges. The Will-Serve Letter shall be in a form and content approved by the General Manager or the Board of Directors. A Will Serve Letter shall not be issued for property located outside of the District boundaries. A Will Serve Letter shall be only a statement of supply and capacity conditions as of the date of the letter. A Will Serve Letter shall not be deemed a contract or a binding commitment to provide water connections or service to any particular development project or property. A Will Serve Letter shall be valid for a maximum period of three one years.

14000.04 Capital Facilities Fees  
Capital facilities fees are classified as the “backbone” of the system and are included in the District’s master plan. Their purpose is to provide revenues to treat, distribute, and store water for individual properties within the District. Bond sales, assessments, general District funds, and other financing vehicles also are used to fund capital facilities. Capital facilities fees for single connections shall be paid no later than at the time of connection or reconnection to the District water system, at the then-applicable rate. Capital Facilities Fees for parcel splits or sub-divisions shall be paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of a Conveyance Agreement, and under all circumstances must be fully paid prior to the District issuing written notice of Project Acceptance. Capital Facilities Fees are based on the amount of system capacity that could be used by a specific parcel, which is based on meter size. The fees are included in the District’s current Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits.

Prior to August 1, 2006 capital facilities fees were based on estimated water usage, and acreage agreements were entered into between eCustomers and the District to allow eCustomers who agreed to restricted water use to pay a reduced portion of capital facilities fees. These acreage agreements are not applicable with the revised capital facilities fees based on meter size, and new agreements will not be entered into by the District. However, while acreage agreements are still in force, the following paragraphs apply.

When the General Manager approved a capital facilities fee reduction for a project involving use of water on a portion of a parcel, the Applicant signed an Acreage Agreement in a form

# Ordinance 17000 - Metered Services

## 17000.05.4 Extended Discontinuance or Inactive Service
A service that has been turned-off, discontinued, disconnected, terminated, or otherwise inactivated for an extended period can be considered to be abandoned or inactive and subject to fees and charges for re-activation including connection fees in accordance with Section 14000.01 and other applicable sections that may also apply.

## 17000.06.8 Reading of Meters
Meters shall be read every other calendar month or at a frequency established by the District to permit the computation, preparation and mailing of bills as soon thereafter as practicable.

Meters also are read when ownership of a property transfers from one Customer to another, when water service is discontinued and then restored, when maintenance is required at the meter, or when the Customer has requested assistance with irrigation problems or locating leaks. When the District does not receive advance notice of a change of ownership and the meter is not read when ownership transfers, the District shall estimate water use based on the Customer’s historical consumption.

## 17000.06.9 Adjustment for Meter Inaccuracies

### 17000.06.9.1 Failure of Meter to Register During Service
Should any meter in service fail to register during a billing period, a bill will be issued by the District for the estimated amount of water used during the period of the meter failure based on prior use under that account.

### 17000.06.9.2 Meter Testing
Initial Test: Prior to installation, each meter may be tested by the manufacturer or by the District.

Customer Request: A Customer may, giving not less than one week’s notice, request the District to test the meter serving the Customer’s Premises. The District will require the Customer to deposit the current fee to cover the cost of the test. See District’s current Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits.

The deposit will be returned if the meter is found to register more than three percent error. The Customer will be notified not less than two days in advance of the time and place of the test. The Customer shall have the right to be present or to be represented by a designated representative. A written report, giving the results of the test, will be given to the Customer within 14 days after completion of the test. When, upon testing, a meter is found to be registering more than three percent higher than actual usage under conditions of normal operation, the District will repair or replace the meter and refund to the Customer the full amount of the overcharge based on estimation of corrected meter readings for

**Meter or Service Connection Downsizing or Upsizing**

17000.108.1  
**Voluntary:**  
Customers may request the downsizing, but in no case smaller than one inch, or upsizing of their meter or service size. If the District approves a Customer's upsizing or downsizing request, the Customer shall pay for all costs of the conversion on a time and material basis. In addition, if a larger meter is desired, the Customer shall pay the difference between the current connection fee for the larger meter and the current connection fee for the existing meter size. The District will provide the Customer with a cost estimate. The Customer must pay the difference in connection fee and provide the District a deposit in the amount of the cost estimate for time and materials prior to the District starting work. If the change in water service requested would require a meter or service connection of a smaller size, no refund shall be due or payable for fees previously paid, including capital facilities fees.

17000.108.2  
**Involuntary:**  
Pursuant to Section 13000.02, if the size or water demand of the parcel(s) receiving water service does not qualify for the current size of meter or service connection, the District reserves the right to involuntarily decrease or increase the size of meter or service connection and backflow prevention assembly. The District will make every attempt to notify the Customer in advance and schedule the work at the Customer's convenience. However, if after thirty days following notice from the District the Customer has not responded or taken action to correct the problem, the District will schedule and complete the work as stated in the notice and charge all costs and fees owing for the work to the Customer.

# 17000.1109 Recommended Flows for District Meters

Customers are cautioned to control rates of flow of water through District meters. Customer-caused damage to a water meter is subject to a District charge to repair or replace a damaged meter. The District may terminate water service if a customer fails to pay any charges for meter repair or replacement or to correct a continuing flow problem. Operation of a meter that flows in excess of the manufacturer's recommendation can cause severe damage to operating parts. Rated capacities for meters used in the District are as follows:

| Maximum Rate per Meter  | Maximum Rate per Meter  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Size (size in inches)   | Gallons per Minute      |
| 1                       | 50                      |

# 17000.120 Damaging or Tampering with Meters

Ordinance 17000 - Metered Services  
Page 5
<!-- Page 29 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Whenever the District has determined that a water meter has been wilfully damaged or tampered with in such a manner that the meter does not properly register the consumption of water, the meter shall be locked or removed and the water service terminated. The meter shall not be opened or reinstalled for service until all of the following charges have been paid:

A. Outstanding water bills for the Premises being served by that meter;

B. An unauthorized connection fee as set forth in the District’s current Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits, if applicable;

C. A charge for servicing, repairing, or replacing the meter equal to the District expense for time and materials;

D. A meter installation fee in accordance with Section 12000.03; and

E. A charge for estimated quantity of water consumed but not paid for since the last regular correct reading, which shall be determined on the basis of prior use under the Customer’s account for the damaged or tampered meter.

17000.134 Angle Stop

Every service connection is equipped with an angle stop valve on the inlet side of the meter. The District’s responsibility for maintenance terminates at the Customer’s side of the water service meter box. The angle stops are for the exclusive use of the District in controlling use of the water through the service connection and/or meter. If the angle stop should be damaged or worn out through use by a Customer to an extent requiring replacement or repair, the District shall charge the Customer for such replacement and/or repair.

17000.142 Customer Responsibility

The District assumes no responsibility for maintenance and operation of the Customer’s water system beyond the service connection. The Customer assumes all liability and responsibility of every kind to the end that the District shall be kept whole and harmless at all times of any claim resulting from matters involving quantities, quality, time or occasion of delivery, or any other phase of the maintenance, operation and service of the Customer’s water system.

The District recommends for convenience and safety that the water system on the Customer’s Premises be equipped with a wheel shutoff valve for the customer’s use to isolate their water system and turn off their water supply. The wheel shutoff valve shall be placed at some known accessible location between the meter and the building.

17000.13 Service/Meter Enhancements

Any Customer desiring to make any improvements or changes requiring cutting, refitting, raising, lowering or relocating service connections shall make an application to the District. Upon approval of the application by the District, deposits will be required prior to the work commencing. District personnel at approved locations shall perform all work. Should the deposit be in excess of the actual cost, the difference shall be refunded. Should the cost exceed the deposit, the additional amount due will be payable in full to the District upon presentation of the bill.

![17000.154 Minimum Pressure](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

17000.154 Minimum Pressure  
The District ordinarily will provide a minimum of 20-psi residual pressure at the meter/service connection. When a Customer’s Premises would be serviced at an expected minimum pressure of less than 20-psi, the District agrees to pay for, construct and maintain a booster pump facility and a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device, per Section 10000.04 prior to or at the District’s service of water to the Premises. Only District employees shall be permitted to operate booster pumping equipment and any unauthorized use of such equipment may be grounds for termination of water service.

17000.165 Maximum Pressure  
Whenever the District provides pressure greater than 80-psi, the customer will install, adjust, and maintain a pressure regulator controlling the pressure on their premises per the California State Plumbing Code.

![Code of Ordinances](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Code+of+Ordinances)

**Ordinance Type:** District Operations  
**Date Adopted:** June 28, 2006  
**Ordinance Number & Title:** 18000 - Bills for Water Service  
**Date Amended:** February 1, 2020  

### 18000.01 Bills For Water Service

#### 18000.01.1 Issuance of Bills
Bills for water service or other charges will be mailed or presented in the month following the water meter reading and/or the applicable charges have been determined. Issuance shall be every other month. Final bills for sale of property are exempt from this billing cycle.

#### 18000.01.2 Fixed Base Charge
Billing for water service includes a fixed base charge that primarily funds fixed costs. This typically includes facilities, infrastructure maintenance, debt service, customer service, and other similar needs that have to be paid for regardless of how much water is delivered to customers. The fixed base charge is due regardless of whether any water is actually used. Customers whose service has been discontinued in accordance with section 18000.03 or has requested that their service be discontinued in accordance with District ordinance section 17000.05 will not be assessed the fixed base charge for months subsequent to discontinuance.

#### 18000.01.3 Consumption Charge
Billing for water service includes a consumption charge that primarily funds the expenses to the District necessary for the purchase and distribution of water to customers. The consumption charge, as set forth in the District’s most current rate study, is assessed for each one-hundred cubic feet (CCF) of water actually consumed.

#### 18000.01.4 Billing Periods
Bills for general water service generally will be rendered bi-monthly by the District. Bills for special water services (temporary water service, construction water, fire hydrant use) may be rendered more frequently. Special meter readings will be made for opening or closing billing purposes.

![18000.01.5 Billing on Non-Owner-Occupied Residences](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
California Government Code section 53447 authorizes public agencies to collect charges from property owners for services to tenants on those properties. Therefore, with the property owner’s authorization, evidenced by a signed Landlord/Tenant Agreement from the legal owner of the property, and a deposit that meets the requirements of District ordinance section 15000.01, the District shall provide a bill copy to the service address for water service. However, the property owner shall be responsible to pay any charges not paid by the tenant. The District shall not share any account information with the tenant, other than the outstanding balance, in the absence of a completed Landlord/Tenant Agreement application which imposes primary responsibility to pay the water bill on the tenant.

![18000.01.6 Back Billing](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
If a eCustomer uses water for which no bills have been issued for more than one billing cycle, and a beginning meter reading is not available, the eCustomer will be billed the fixed base charge for the period plus a consumption charge calculated from the average water usage over the most recent six billing cycles. This amount, which shall not be less than the base charge if no billing history is available, will be billed to the eCustomer based on the number of billing cycles the eCustomer has been occupying or in possession of the premises without paying bills.

![18000.01.7 Refunds](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
If a eCustomer is erroneously overcharged for service, the District may refund any overage paid by the eCustomer up to two years.

![18000.01.8 Disputed Charges](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
When a eCustomer disputes the amount of a bill for any reason, the eCustomer should contact the District office. If the bill is disputed, to avoid discontinuance of water service, the eCustomer must deposit at the District office, before the disconnect date, the full amount of the disputed bill or proof of previous payment of the disputed bill with a letter setting forth the basis for the dispute and requesting a review by the Finance Director or General Manager. The Finance Director or General Manager’s findings and decisions will be final and binding. If the eCustomer’s complaint concerns the meter, he or she may request that his or her meter be tested pursuant to Section 17000.07.2 Meter Testing of the District’s most current water ordinance. Nothing in this section is intended to affect a eCustomer’s rights under Health & Safety Code section 116900 and following and the District’s Policy on Discontinuation of Residential Water Service for Nonpayment (“Policy”) implementing those rights.

18000.01.9  Bill Adjustment for Leaks  
Upon a Customer’s submission of a consumption credit form, the District will consider a one-time credit for water consumption resulting from a leak in a Customer’s internal water system or when there is significant unexplained usage. Credits are determined by comparing the Customer’s water use during the period in which the leak occurred to their historical water use for that same period and splitting the difference (resulting in a credit of 50% of the above average usage at the current volumetric rate). The Customer has the right to accept the credit or save the one-time credit allowance for future use. All Customer requests for a credit will be considered on a case by case basis and the District reserves the right to approve or deny any request.

18000.01.109  Due Date  
Each statement issued by the District for such charges shall be due and payable on the date of issuance or other presentation to the Customer.

18000.01.110  Final Payment Date  
Bills become delinquent and subject to discontinuation of service if not paid within 60 days from the bill issuance date.

18000.02  Payment of Charges  
A. Payment Responsibility: The District is required to continue providing water service to each Premises or Parcel connected to the District water system as long as each Premises or Parcel pays its fair share of the costs of receiving the service and such fair share of costs are chargeable to and run with each Premises or Parcel receiving District water service. Therefore, payment of all water service rates, fees and charges shall be the responsibility of the owner of record of the subject Premises or Parcel and payment of all charges is an obligation of ownership of a Premises or Parcel. As such, any subsequent owner of a Premises or Parcel is responsible for paying any unpaid or delinquent fees, rates and charges due on a Premises or Parcel that are in any way connected to District water service as a condition of service being continued to the Premises or Parcel. A change in ownership does not terminate any outstanding rates, fees and charges due for previous water service to said parcel, whether or not those rates, fees and charges were incurred by the present Premises or Parcel owner or a previous owner or tenant.

B. Crediting of Payment: Payments shall be credited to a Customer’s account when cash, an electronic funds transfer, a check drawn on an account with sufficient funds a money order or a Visa or MasterCard payment has been received by the District at the District business office during regular office hours. Deposit of payment in the mail shall be credited to a Customer’s account when received at the District’s business office.
<!-- Page 34 -->
C. **Dishonored Payment Charge:** A returned item charge as set forth in the District’s current Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits shall be added to a Customer’s account in each instance where payment has been made to the District that has been returned to the District by the bank upon which it is drawn.

D. The District offers an average monthly or equalized payment plan to balance water bills that can fluctuate seasonally. The equalized amount is based on the Customer’s average consumption during the current 12-month period. Average monthly or equalized payment plans are reconciled annually and adjusted as needed.

E. The District offers online bill presentment and payment to Customers who wish to view their bill and/or pay by check or Visa or MasterCard via the internet.

F. Customers may make payment arrangements with the District. Defaulting on a payment arrangement may lead to disconnection of service.

### 18000.03 Delinquent Accounts

#### 18000.03.1 For Non-Payment of Charges
Except as otherwise prohibited by law, a delinquent account from a premises within the District will be applied to a new account opened by the same Customer for a different premises, and the District may require payment of the delinquent amount (plus penalties and interest) as a condition of opening the new account, or the District may pursue any other remedy for collection of delinquent accounts provided for in this Code or other District rule, regulation or policy, or applicable state and federal law.

#### 18000.03.2 Late-Payment Charge
A late-payment charge shall be added to each delinquent account upon preparation of an Intent to Disconnect Notice. When a late-payment charge is imposed, such charge shall be added to the account as of the date the notice is prepared, and such charge shall become part of the amount due at that time. The current late-payment fee amount is set forth in the District’s Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges, and Deposits. The District may, at its discretion, apply a late-payment charge upon other reasonable notification to Customer for connections where a door hanger cannot be delivered (i.e. connections for irrigation service or for residences or commercial buildings under construction.)

#### 18000.03.3 Partial Payment on Delinquent Accounts
A partial payment on a delinquent account may be accepted and credited to a Customer’s account. The partial payment shall not cause removal of the account from an existing delinquent status or preclude assessment of fees and charges for delinquent payment, nor shall the partial payment

18000.03.4 Discontinuation of Service to Delinquent Accounts  
A. Discontinuation of Service: Continuation of service to a delinquent account will be permitted only as set forth in the Policy, adopted and amended from time to time by the Board of Directors, if financial arrangements have been established in accordance with the Policy.  
B. Requirement of Deposit: If a Customer permits his or her account to become delinquent, the General Manager or his/her designee may require the Customer to make a deposit in accordance with the provisions of Section 15000 of this Code.  

18000.03.5 Lien for Delinquent Charges  
1. To the extent permitted by law, the District may file with the Placer or Sacramento County Recorder a Notice of Lien (whichever is the County in which the property is located), setting forth the legal description of the property, the amount of the obligation owed, specifying that the same is owed to the District, and that all delinquent service charges, together with late fees, penalties and interest, are a lien against the Premises to which service was provided in accordance with Government Code Section 54354.  
2. All outstanding account balances, interest and lien release charges (if applicable) must be paid in full prior to re-establishing service in the owner’s name at the same, or different property within the boundaries of the District.  
3. Current accounts that have incurred a large amount of fines, or the owner that maintains the account has refused to pay any balance owed and the District may be placed in a position of incurring bad debt may have a lien placed against the property being served by the District until the balance associated with those charges is paid in full.  

18000.03.6 Reinstatement of Water Service Under Delinquent Accounts  
Water service accounts terminated for non-payment shall be reinstated as provided in the Policy.  

18000.04 Termination of Master Meter Accounts  
This Section applies to termination of water service through a master meter, or through individually-metered service in a multi-unit residential structure or mobile home park, where the owner or manager, is listed by the District as the Customer of record of the service. Termination and reinstatement of such accounts will be in accordance with the Policy. A Person subject to a master metered account that was not directly billed by the District, who opens an individual service accounts after the termination of a
