In response to President Zamorano’s question, Mr. Barrett informed the Board that there is a 1% fee charged by Placer County and the District assesses a $27 late fee to the accounts.

**V. OLD BUSINESS**

1. **Reduction in Take or Pay with Placer County Water Agency (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker provided a staff report which was included in the Board packet. He explained that the District’s Urban Water Management Plan projects that the District’s future demand is approximately 32,000 acre-feet of water, which is below the 43,000 acre-feet of water supply that the District has as a minimum. In addition, there would be a savings of $62,500 – $75,000 annually with the reduction in the take or pay contract.

   Director Rich moved to notify PCWA of San Juan’s reduction in its take-or-pay obligation by 2,500 AF to 10,000 AF, effective January 1, 2025, consistent with the terms of the entitlement contract. Director Miller seconded the motion and it carried with 4 Aye votes and 1 No vote (Director Tobin).

2. **Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker reported that he is waiting to hear back from Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) regarding the financial arrangements on the three alternatives. He explained that once the financial information is received, Mr. Zlotnick and he will have further discussions with SSWD. In addition, he reported that Orange Vale Water Company is still in the process of getting their project completed of adding the treatment system to their well.

   GM Helliker reported that the water bank program committee meeting earlier this month was centered on previously banked water. He stated that the Sacramento Groundwater Authority’s water accounting showed that there has been over 400,000 acre-feet of water banked since 2010 and most of that by SSWD. However, there was a proposal at the last meeting to start with a zero balance for banked water, which SSWD and San Juan disagree with and SSWD estimates that there should be.
<!-- Page 10 -->
![June 26, 2024, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=June+26,+2024,+Board+Minutes+Page+6)

at least 200,000 acre-feet of banked water accounted for. This topic will be discussed at the July meeting.

In response to Vice President Costa’s question, GM Helliker informed the Board that the 2x2 Ad Hoc Committee meetings with Fair Oaks Water District have been put on hold, as Chris Petersen (FOWD Board Member) mentioned at a previous San Juan Board meeting.

3. 2024 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed data which included the current reservoir storage levels across the state, data on releases, temperature and precipitation outlooks, and storage levels and projections at Folsom Reservoir.

GM Helliker reviewed DWR/Reclamation’s 90% and 50% exceedance forecasts regarding storage and releases. He informed the Board that there seems to be a discrepancy in the numbers which will be discussed with Reclamation. In addition, he reported that, even though this is a normal year for water, it is projected that Reclamation will not be able to meet the temperature requirements for the Biological Opinion standard of 65° at Watt Avenue. He stated that this is being discussed with Reclamation during the American River Group meetings.

VI. NEW BUSINESS

1. Introduction of Ordinance No. 24-02 Amending Ordinances 9000, 10000, 11000, 13000, 14000, 17000 and 18000 (W & R)  
GM Helliker informed the Board that Ordinance No. 24-02 is to amend ordinances 9000, 10000, 11000, 13000, 14000, 17000 and 18000. He reviewed the ordinance changes that were included in the staff report which was in the Board packet. He explained that staff reviewed the ordinances and provided recommendations for some changes which were then reviewed by the Legal Affairs Committee. In response to Director Tobin’s question, Legal Counsel Jones confirmed that he reviewed and agreed with the recommended changes.

In response to President Zamorano’s question, GM Helliker explained that if a customer has a leak, then they can request a one-time per owner leak adjustment credit. Mr. Barrett explained that the District receives approximately 10 requests for leak adjustments per month; however, since it is a one-time adjustment, some customers decline the adjustment after receiving the calculation that determines the credit, so there are probably only 1-2 leak adjustments applied to customer accounts per month. The Board requested that staff analyze leak adjustments and potential revenue loss should the policy be changed to allow more leak adjustments.

Director Tobin moved to introduce and waive the first reading of Ordinance No. 24-02 – An Ordinance of the Board of Directors of the San Juan Water District Amending Ordinances 9000, 10000, 11000, 13000, 14000, 17000 and 18000. Vice President Costa seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

**Back to Agenda**  
**AGENDA ITEM III-2**  

**STAFF REPORT**  

To: Board of Directors  
From: Mark Hargrove, Senior Engineer  
Date: July 17, 2024  
Subject: Air Release Valve Replacement Program 2023/2024 – Construction Contract  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to authorize the Director of Engineering Services to execute a construction contract with TAK Broadband CA, LLC (TAK) for the amount of $697,927.40 with a construction contingency of $69,792.74 (10%) for a total authorized budget of $767,720.14.  

**BACKGROUND**  
District staff has developed an Air Release Valve Replacement Program (Program) to replace/upgrade all of the existing air release valves (ARVs) that are currently deficient (i.e. broken, not found, cannot be repaired) and/or located within below grade valve boxes to above grade installations to be in compliance with California Code of Regulations, Title 22. The District currently has approximately 880 ARVs in the Retail distribution system with an estimated 750 of these valves venting below grade. Since the implementation of the District’s recurring 5-year ARV maintenance program in 2017 to test and exercise 160 ARVs per year and develop a deficiency list of ARVs, so far 124 ARVs have been identified as being deficient. The Program will consist of replacing 45 ARVs per year over a 17-year period.  

This construction contract is for the second set of 45 ARV replacements in the Program.

# I N T R O D U C T I O N

Established by a vote of citizens in 1954, San Juan Water District (District) provides reliable, high-quality water service to retail and wholesale customers in eastern Sacramento and southern Placer counties. On an annual basis, the District treats and delivers more than 40,000 acre-feet of water to approximately 150,000 residents and thousands of local businesses.

As part of its commitment to provide high quality water services that meet the varied needs of its customers, San Juan Water District regularly engages customers through community outreach, social media, and other communications activities and receives periodic feedback regarding its performance. Although these informal feedback mechanisms are a valuable source of information for the District in that they provide timely and accurate information about the opinions of specific customers, they do not necessarily provide an accurate picture of residential customers as a whole. Informal feedback mechanisms typically rely on the customer to initiate the feedback, which creates a self-selection bias. The District receives feedback only from those customers who are motivated enough to initiate the feedback process. Because these individuals tend to be those who are either very pleased or very displeased with their service, their collective opinions are not necessarily representative of residential customers in the District’s service area as a whole.

## PURPOSE OF STUDY

The motivation for the current study was to design and employ a methodology that would avoid the self-selection bias noted above and thereby provide statistically reliable measures of residential customers’ perceptions, opinions, and satisfaction as they relate to the District and the services it provides. Ultimately, the survey results and analyses presented in this report provide the District with information that can be used to make sound, strategic decisions in a variety of areas including measuring and tracking internal performance, planning, program development, community outreach, and budgeting. To assist in this effort, San Juan Water District selected True North Research to design the research plan and conduct the study. Broadly defined, the study was designed to:

- Measure residential customers’ familiarity with San Juan Water District and their opinions of the District;
- Gauge customers’ satisfaction with the water services their household receives;
- Profile customers’ interactions with the District and their customer service experiences;
- Explore how customers view the District’s communication efforts, as well as preferred methods of communication; and
- Gather relevant background and demographic information.

## OVERVIEW OF METHODOLOGY

A full description of the methodology used for this study is included later in this report (see Methodology on page 30). In brief, the survey was administered to a random sample of 519 residential customers who receive water services from the District. The survey followed a mixed-method design that employed multiple recruiting methods (email, text, and phone) and multiple data collection methods (phone and online). Administered in English and Spanish between June 13 and June 16, 2024, the average interview was 14 minutes in length.

# Introduction

## STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Many figures and tables in this report present the results of questions asked in 2024 alongside the results found in a prior survey (2018) for identical questions. In such cases, True North conducted the appropriate tests of statistical significance to identify changes that likely reflect actual changes in public opinion between the 2018 and 2024 surveys—as opposed to being due to chance associated with selecting two samples independently and at random. Differences between the two studies are identified as statistically significant if we can be 95% confident that the differences reflect an actual change in customer opinion. Statistically significant differences within response categories over time are denoted by the † symbol which appears in the figure next to the appropriate response value for 2024.

## ORGANIZATION OF REPORT
This report is designed to meet the needs of readers who prefer a summary of the findings as well as those interested in the details of the results. For those who seek an overview, the section titled Key Findings is for you. It provides a summary of the most important findings and a discussion of their implications. This section is followed by a more detailed question-by-question discussion of the results from the survey by topic area (see Table of Contents), and a description of the methodology employed for collecting and analyzing the data. For the truly ambitious reader, the full questionnaire is included at the back of this report (see Questionnaire & Toplines on page 33) and a complete set of crosstabulations for the survey results is contained in Appendix A.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
True North thanks San Juan Water District for the opportunity to conduct the study and for contributing valuable input during the design of this study. The District’s engagement, along with local knowledge from community representatives and staff, improved the overall quality of the research presented here. A special thanks also to Lori Prosio and Lindsay Pangburn (Prosio Communications) for contributing to the design of the study.

# K E Y  F I N D I N G S

As noted in the Introduction, this study was designed to provide San Juan Water District with a statistically reliable understanding of customers’ perceptions, opinions, and satisfaction as they relate to the District and the services it provides. Whereas subsequent sections of this report are devoted to conveying the detailed results of the survey, in this section we attempt to ‘see the forest through the trees’ and note how the collective results of the survey answer some of the key questions that motivated the research.

## To what extent are customers familiar with San Juan Water District, and what are their opinions of the District?

Special districts and sub-agencies often operate in relative obscurity from the public’s perspective. Although virtually all residents can identify their city and, to a lesser extent, their local school district, special districts or municipal sub-agencies are often not on the average resident’s radar. It is for this reason that residential customers’ familiarity with San Juan Water District stands out as exceptional, as three-quarters of respondents reported that they were either very familiar (33%) or somewhat familiar (42%) with the District, and an additional 20% indicated they were a little familiar with the District. Moreover, when compared to the 2018 survey results, there was a statistically significant increase (+7%) in the percentage of respondents who reported being very familiar with the District in 2024.

Of course, being familiar with San Juan Water District does not necessarily translate into having an opinion of the agency. That said, this is another area of good news for the District in 2024. Although the overall percentage of respondents with a favorable opinion of the District in 2024 matched that recorded in the 2018 survey (72%), the percentage that indicated they had a very favorable opinion of San Juan Water District was significantly higher (+7%) in 2024.

## How well is San Juan Water District performing in meeting the needs of customers?

Residential customers are generally quite satisfied with San Juan Water District’s efforts to provide water services to their households. Overall, 85% of customers indicated they were either very (50%) or somewhat (35%) satisfied with the District’s performance in this respect, whereas just 9% were dissatisfied and 6% were unsure or unwilling to share their opinion. When compared with the findings of the 2018 study, there was also a statistically significant increase in the percentage very satisfied (+8%) in 2024.

Although satisfaction with their water services was widespread across customer subgroups, it was notably higher among those who primarily drink unfiltered tap water at home, residents of Folsom, those living in households earning at least $60,000 annually, and Caucasians. Interestingly, satisfaction did not bear a consistent relationship to the amount of customers’ bi-monthly water bills—meaning that those with comparatively high bills were just as satisfied with the District’s performance as those with lower bills.

![San Juan Water District Key Findings](https://example.com/image-url)

The high level of satisfaction expressed with San Juan Water District's performance in general was also mirrored in respondents’ agreement with various performance-related statements, including **San Juan Water District does a good job of providing a reliable water supply** (94% strongly or somewhat agree), **The water pressure in my home is consistently strong** (86%), **The water we receive from San Juan Water District is safe to drink** (86%), **San Juan Water District provides adequate payment options** (71%), and **San Juan Water District keeps us well-informed about capital improvement projects, including improvements to the water treatment plant, pipelines and other portions of the water system, and how these improvements benefit customers** (70%).

### How do customers rate San Juan Water District’s customer service?
One of the objectives of this study was to profile the opinions of customers who had reason to contact San Juan Water District during the two years prior to taking the survey—focusing in particular on how they assess the customer service they received.

Approximately 41% of customers surveyed reported that they had contacted San Juan Water District during the two years prior to taking the survey, which is significantly lower than the 54% reported in the 2018 survey. Among customers in this group, 85% indicated they were satisfied with the service they received, with 61% indicating they were very satisfied. Moreover, San Juan Water District’s service representatives were given high marks for their performance during these interactions, with more than eight-in-ten respondents rating their performance as excellent or good on every performance dimension tested including professionalism (92% excellent or good), courtesy (91%), timeliness (87%), competence (84%), knowledge (83%), and willingness to help (82%).

### How well is San Juan Water District communicating with customers?
Keeping up with the challenge of communicating with customers has been difficult for many public agencies in recent years. As the number of information sources and channels available to the public have dramatically increased, so too has the diversity in where customers regularly turn for their information. Not only have entirely new channels arisen to become mainstream and nearly ubiquitous (e.g., social media), within these channels there exists a proliferation of alternative services. To add to the challenge, public preferences for information sources are also dynamic—subject to change as new services are made available while others may fade in popularity—making thorough, effective communication a moving target for public agencies.

Against this backdrop of challenges, the survey reveals that San Juan Water District appears to be doing a solid job communicating with residential customers, as nearly two-thirds (65%) of respondents indicated that the amount of information being provided by the District is about right. For those who were looking for more information from the District...

![Key Findings](https://via.placeholder.com/1000x768.png?text=Key+Findings)

District, the most common topics of interest were future/current capital improvement projects (23%), costs/rate/billing (21%), water quality/water sources (18%), and conservation programs/rebates (18%).

Looking forward, customers were also clear about which methods would be the most effective for San Juan Water District to communicate with them in the future, with email (83% very or somewhat effective), water bill inserts (76%), electronic newsletters (71%), direct mailings separate from their water bill (69%), and the District’s website (66%) topping the list of options.

The opening section of the survey was designed to measure customers' familiarity with San Juan Water District, their opinions of the District, as well as their satisfaction with the District's performance in providing water services.

## WHO PAYS THE UTILITY BILLS? 
The first question in this series sought to understand the respondent's role in paying their household's utility bills. As shown in Figure 1, approximately nine-in-ten respondents in 2024 indicated that they pay their household's utility bills (78%) or share that responsibility with someone else (13%). Just 8% of respondents indicated that they have no role in paying the utility bills for their household, while 2% preferred to not answer the question. The results of this question in 2024 match closely those found in the District's prior survey (2018).

### Question 1 
To begin, who typically pays the utility bills in your household? Is it you, someone else, or do you share that responsibility?

## FIGURE 1  Hsld Member In Charge Of Paying Utility Bill By Study Year

| % Respondents | 2024 | 2018 |
|---------------|------|------|
| Self          | 77.5 | 77.8 |
| Someone else   | 8.0  | 7.1  |
| Shared responsibility | 13.0 | 15.2 |
| Prefer not to answer | 2.0  | -    |

Figures 2-4 on the next page show how the responsibility for paying their household's utility bills varied by the type of water they primarily drink at home, city of residence, gender, household income, the amount of their average bi-monthly water bill, age, and ethnicity. More than eight-in-ten respondents in every subgroup indicated they had either sole or shared responsibility for paying their household's utility bills.

**FAMILIARITY WITH SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT**  
Regardless of their role in paying their household’s utility bills, all respondents were next asked to describe their familiarity with the San Juan Water District. As shown in Figure 5, approximately three-quarters of respondents reported that they were either very familiar (33%) or somewhat familiar (42%) with San Juan Water District, and an additional 20% indicated they were a little familiar with the District. Just 5% of respondents stated they were not at all familiar with San Juan Water District, were unsure, or preferred to not answer the question. When compared to the 2018 survey results, there was a statistically significant increase in the percentage of respondents who reported being very familiar with the District, which was offset by a decline in the percentage who described themselves as somewhat familiar.

**Question 2**  
How familiar are you with the San Juan Water District? Would you say you are very familiar, somewhat familiar, a little familiar, or not at all familiar?

**FIGURE 5**  
**FAMILIAR WITH SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT BY STUDY YEAR**

| Not sure/Prefer not to answer | - | - |

† Statistically significant change (p < 0.05) between the 2018 and 2024 studies.

When compared to their respective counterparts, individuals who primarily drink unfiltered tap water at home, residents of Granite Bay, males, seniors, and customers who identified as Caucasian or ‘other’ ethnicity were the most likely to report being at least somewhat familiar with San Juan Water District (see figures 6-8).

![FAVORABILITY Respondents who indicated they were at least a little familiar with San Juan Water District were subsequently asked whether they held a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the District. Overall, more than seven-in-ten customers indicated they had a very favorable (33%) or somewhat favorable (39%) opinion of San Juan Water District in 2024, whereas 15% offered an unfavorable opinion and 13% were unsure (Figure 9). Although the overall percentage of respondents with a favorable opinion of the District in 2024 matched that recorded in the 2018 survey, the percentage that indicated they had a very favorable opinion of San Juan Water District was significantly higher in 2024. Figures 10-12 demonstrate that those who primarily drink unfiltered tap water at home, residents of Folsom, males, customers 50+ years of age, and Asian Americans were the most likely among their peers to report having a favorable opinion of San Juan Water District. It is also noteworthy that opinions of the District were not systematically related to the amount of customers’ bi-monthly water bills.**

**OVERALL SATISFACTION**  
The next question in this series asked respondents to indicate if, overall, they were satisfied or dissatisfied with the job the San Juan Water District is doing to provide water services to their household. Because this question does not reference a specific program, facility, or service and requested that the respondent consider the District’s performance in general, the findings of this question may be regarded as an overall performance rating for San Juan Water District.

As shown in Figure 13 on the next page, 85% of customers indicated they were either very (50%) or somewhat (35%) satisfied with San Juan Water District’s efforts to provide water services. Approximately 9% were very or somewhat dissatisfied, and 6% were unsure or unwilling to share their opinion. Compared with the findings of the 2018 study, there was a statistically significant increase in the percentage very satisfied and unsure, and a drop in the percentage who were somewhat satisfied.

| Somewhat satisfied |  |  |
| Very satisfied |  |  |

† Statistically significant change (p < 0.05) between the 2018 and 2024 studies.

Although satisfaction with the services provided by San Juan Water District was widespread, it was notably higher among those who primarily drink unfiltered tap water at home, residents of Folsom, those living in households earning at least $60,000 annually, and Caucasians. Interestingly, satisfaction did not bear a consistent relationship to the amount of customers’ bi-monthly water bills—meaning that those with comparatively high bills were just as satisfied with the District’s performance as those with lower bills.

**PERFORMANCE STATEMENTS**  
Having measured respondents’ overall satisfaction with San Juan Water District’s performance in providing services, the survey next sought to profile their opinions of the District’s performance in more specific areas including water reliability, payment options, and cost. The structure of Question 5 was straightforward: for each of the statements shown in truncated form on the left of Figure 17 on the next page, respondents were simply asked the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with each statement about San Juan Water District. The statements are sorted from high to low in the figure based on the percentage of respondents who agreed (strongly or somewhat) with the statement.

Among the statements tested, respondents expressed the highest levels of agreement with: **San Juan Water District does a good job of providing a reliable water supply** (94% strongly or somewhat agree), **The water pressure in my home is consistently strong** (86%), and **The water we receive from San Juan Water District is safe to drink** (86%). More than two-thirds of respondents also agreed that **San Juan Water District provides adequate payment options** (71%) and **San Juan Water District keeps us well-informed about capital improvement projects, including improvements to the water treatment plant, pipelines and other portions of the water system, and how these improvements benefit customers** (70%).

True North later reviewed the verbatim responses and grouped them into the categories shown in Figure 28.

Among the specific topics requested, the most common were information about future/current capital improvement projects (23%), costs/rate/billing (21%), water quality/water sources (18%), and conservation programs/rebates (18%).

## Question 10
**What types of information would you like to receive more of from your water district?**

### FIGURE 28
**TYPE OF INFORMATION DESIRE FROM WATER DISTRICT**

- Future, current capital improvements, projects: 22.6%
- Cost, rate increases, billing info: 21.1%
- Water quality, where it comes from: 17.9%
- Conservation, programs, rebates: 17.6%
- Not sure / Cannot think of anything specific: 16.3%
- Everything pertinent, general water info: 8.5%
- District fiscal management, budgeting: 5.1%
- Testing of minerals, chemicals: 5.0%
- Water usage: 4.8%
- Leak detection: 2.0%
- Advance notices for water service shutdown, interruptions: 2.0%
- Irrigation services: 1.4%

Having provided respondents with an open-ended opportunity to suggest specific topics they would like to receive more information about from the District in Question 10, the survey next presented all respondents with the items shown on the left of Figure 29 and asked the degree to which they would be interested in receiving information on this type of service from the District. The vast majority of respondents indicated they would be very or somewhat interested in receiving notification when there are spikes in their household’s water usage (87%) and information about water efficiency resources such as workshops, kits, rebates, and free irrigation audits (74%). Most respondents also expressed interest in community education events such as tours or open houses at water district facilities (55%). Approximately one-third of respondents (33%) were interested in receiving information about discounts for low-income customers. The level of interest in receiving information on these topics did not change significantly between 2018 and 2024 (Table 7), but did vary across customer subgroups (see tables 8-11).

**COMMUNICATION METHODS**  
The next question in this series presented respondents with each of the methods shown to the left of Figure 30 and simply asked, for each, whether it would be an effective way for San Juan Water District to communicate with them. Overall, respondents indicated that email was the most effective method (83% very or somewhat effective), followed by water bill inserts (76%), electronic newsletters (71%), direct mailings separate from their water bill (69%), and the District’s website (66%). In comparison, less than half of respondents characterized virtual town halls (47%), Nextdoor (38%), social media (32%), and newspapers (25%) as very or somewhat effective methods for the District to communicate with them. Tables 12-15 show the perceived effectiveness of each communication method for various subgroups, with the top three rated methods highlighted in green for each subgroup.

**Question 12**  
As I read the following ways that the water district can communicate with customers, I’d like to know if you think they would be a very effective, somewhat effective, or not at all effective way for the District to communicate with you.

S T R A I G H T, F I L T E R E D, O R B O T T L E D?  
The final substantive question of the survey asked customers to indicate whether they primarily drink water straight from the faucet, filtered water from the faucet, or bottled water when they are at home. More than half (58%) of respondents indicated they primarily drink filtered tap water when home, and an additional 28% stated they drink water straight from the tap. Approximately 13% of respondents offered that they primarily drink bottled water when home, whereas 1% were unsure or unwilling to share their opinion. When compared to the 2018 survey findings, the percentage who indicated they drink unfiltered tap water declined significantly, with a corresponding increase in the percentage who reported drinking filtered tap water. Figures 33-35 show how the responses to Question 14 varied by customer characteristics.

**Question 14** What kind of water do you primarily drink at home? Unfiltered tap water, filtered tap water, or bottled water?

M E T H O D O L O G Y  
The following sections outline the methodology used in the study, as well as the motivation for using certain techniques.

**QUESTIONNAIRE DEVELOPMENT**  
Dr. McLarney of True North Research worked closely with San Juan Water District to develop a questionnaire that covered the topics of interest and avoided many possible sources of systematic measurement error, including position-order effects, wording effects, response-category effects, scaling effects, and priming. Several questions included multiple individual items. Because asking items in a set order can lead to a systematic position bias in responses, items were asked in random order for each respondent.

Some questions asked in this study were presented only to a subset of respondents. For example, only respondents who indicated that they were familiar with San Juan Water District (Question 2) were asked if they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the District (Question 3). The questionnaire included in this report (see Questionnaire & Toplines on page 33) identifies the skip patterns used during the interview to ensure that each respondent received the appropriate questions.

**PROGRAMMING, PRE-TEST & TRANSLATION**  
Prior to fielding the survey, the questionnaire was CATI (Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing) programmed to assist interviewers when conducting the phone interviews. The CATI program automatically navigates the skip patterns, randomizes the appropriate question items, and alerts interviewers to certain types of keypunching mistakes should they happen during the interview. The survey was also programmed into a passcode-protected online survey application to allow online participation for sampled customers. The integrity of the questionnaire was pre-tested internally by True North and by dialing into random homes in the District’s service area prior to formally beginning the survey. The final questionnaire was also professionally translated into Spanish to allow for data collection in English and Spanish.

**SAMPLE, RECRUITING & DATA COLLECTION**  
Using the District’s customer database as a starting point, customers were first stratified by area of residence and the amount of their average bi-monthly bill, then randomly selected for inclusion in the sample. This ensured that all customers had an equal probability of being included in the study, while also maintaining the proper balance of customers by geography and how much they pay for water services. Once selected, customers were recruited to participate in the survey through multiple recruiting methods. Customers were initially invited to participate in the survey online at a secure, passcode-protected website designed and hosted by True North. Individuals were recruited using email invitations and text invitations, and each customer was assigned a unique passcode to ensure that only San Juan Water District customers who received an invitation could access the online survey site, and that the survey could be completed only one time per passcode. Email reminder notices were also sent to encourage participation among those who had yet to take the survey. Following a period of online data collection, True North placed telephone calls to land lines and cell phone numbers of customers who had yet to participate in the online survey or for whom only telephone contact information was available.

Telephone interviews averaged 14 minutes in length and were conducted during weekday evenings (5:30PM to 9PM) and on weekends (10AM to 5PM). It is standard practice not to call during the day on weekdays because most working adults are unavailable and thus calling during those hours would bias the sample. A total of 519 completed surveys were gathered between June 13 and June 16, 2024.

**MARGIN OF ERROR DUE TO SAMPLING**  
The results of the survey can be used to estimate the opinions of all customer households within the District’s service area. Because not every customer in the service area participated in the survey, however, the results have what is known as a statistical margin of error due to sampling. The margin of error refers to the difference between what was found in the survey of 519 customers for a particular question and what would have been found if all 10,992 retail residential accounts had been interviewed.¹

Figure 36 provides a plot of the **maximum margin of error** in this study. The maximum margin of error for a dichotomous percentage result occurs when the answers are evenly split such that 50% provide one response and 50% provide the alternative response. For this survey, the maximum margin of error is ± 4.2% for questions answered by all 519 respondents.

**FIGURE 36 MAXIMUM MARGIN OF ERROR**

| Sample Size (Number of Respondents) | Margin of Error |
|--------------------------------------|------------------|
| 0                                    | 0%               |
| 100                                  | 10%              |

| 900                                  | 2%               |
| 1000                                 | 1%               |
| 1100                                 | 1%               |
| 1200                                 | 1%               |
| 1300                                 | 1%               |
| 1400                                 | 1%               |
| 1500                                 | 1%               |
| 1600                                 | 0%               |

Within this report, figures and tables show how responses to certain questions varied by customer characteristics such as most recent bill, age, and number of household members. Figure 36 is thus useful for understanding how the maximum margin of error for a percentage estimate will grow as the number of individuals asked a question (or in a particular subgroup) shrinks. Because the margin of error grows exponentially as the sample size decreases, the reader should...

¹ This figure is estimated based on the number of residential customer accounts in San Juan Water District’s customer database, which is a proxy for households.

use caution when generalizing and interpreting the results for small subgroups as the margin of error for small subgroups can be ± 10% or more.

**DATA PROCESSING** Data processing consisted of checking the data for errors or inconsistencies, coding and recoding responses, categorizing verbatim responses, weighting, and preparing frequency analyses and crosstabulations.

**ROUNDING** Numbers that end in 0.5 or higher are rounded up to the nearest whole number, whereas numbers that end in 0.4 or lower are rounded down to the nearest whole number. These same rounding rules are also applied, when needed, to arrive at numbers that include a decimal place in constructing figures and tables. Occasionally, these rounding rules lead to small discrepancies in the first decimal place when comparing tables and charts for a given question. Due to rounding, some figures and narrative include numbers that add to more than or less than 100%.

**AGENDA ITEM V-2**  

**STAFF REPORT**  

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Greg Zlotnick, Water Resources Manager  
**Date:** July 17, 2024  
**Subject:** Proposed Agreement Between San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District to Provide Conserved Surface Water Supplies to Enhance Groundwater Stabilization  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
(1) Approve the Initial Study/Negative Declaration [CEQA]; (2) make a formal finding concurring with staff’s analysis, that the proposed transfer water would be surplus to the needs of the Wholesale Customer Agencies in accordance with their Wholesale Water Supply Agreements; and (3) Authorize the General Manager to sign the Proposed Agreement Between San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District to Provide Surface Water Supplies to Enhance Groundwater Stabilization  

---

**BACKGROUND**  
To optimize the utilization of San Juan Water District’s (District) surface water supplies; generate revenue for the District’s wholesale enterprise; increase regional conjunctive use; and enhance groundwater stabilization in Sacramento Suburban Water District’s (SSWD) northern service area, the District and SSWD seek to enter into an agreement whereby the District may sell up to 4,000 acre-feet (AF) of conserved pre-1914 water right to SSWD for the limited period between August 1, 2024, and February 28, 2025. The Proposed Agreement has no effect on the District’s water rights.  

The Proposed Agreement is for a single transfer. As explicitly stated in the Proposed Agreement, entering into this Proposed Agreement does not commit, nor indicate an intent by the District, to undertake future transfers to SSWD. The proposed transfer represents the whole of the contemplated action and is not part of a larger project or plan. No future transfer, activity or action, or expansion of a transfer, activity or action is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the Proposed Agreement. Moreover, the proposed transfer is independent of, and not a previously contemplated part of any past transfers. Although past transfers to SSWD involved transfer of the same pre-1914 water, each prior transfer occurred under separately negotiated agreements that contain different terms and were separately approved by the Board. The District did not enter a transfer agreement with SSWD last year. The Proposed Agreement uses similar terms as were included in previous limited, one-time agreements, but which have been adjusted to use current rates.

The Wholesale Customer Agencies were informed by emailed correspondence, on March 29, 2024, of staff’s intent to bring this Proposed Agreement to the Board in accordance with the Wholesale Contract. That communication included the determination that the transfer water is available as surplus to WCA surface water demands, which were maximally estimated to be 10% over the average aggregate WCA total over the last three years.

Notably too, the Proposed Agreement includes a failsafe mechanism that in the unlikely occurrence the District could not continue to transfer water to SSWD while still meeting WCA demands, the transfer will be halted.

If the full 4,000 AF of water is transferred to SSWD, the District will receive over $1,060,000 in payments as compensation for treatment and wheeling of that water. The charge per AF for treatment is the same as the District charges SSWD for treating Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) water it receives in years, such as this year, when the unimpaired inflow to Folsom Reservoir is 1.6 million AF or more.

The water rate SSWD will pay, exclusive of treatment and wheeling, is $36.82/AF, which would generate $147,280 if all 4,000 AF is transferred. Of that amount, the District will net a minimum of approximately $10.04/AF, which would total $40,160 for 4,000 AF.

Another benefit of the proposed transfer is the District will use more of its “take-or-pay” to meet demands in the Placer County retail service area, which will reduce the amount of PCWA entitlement water being left “on the table” as a “sunk” cost.

In total, then, it is expected that this agreement to transfer up to 4,000 AF could result in over $1,100,000 in positive revenue impact to the District’s wholesale enterprise.

**CEQA AND PUBLIC COMMENT**

Staff previously determined that adopting and implementing this Proposed Agreement is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for the following separate and independent reasons. The water transfer is eligible for a Class 1 categorical exemption under CEQA Guidelines section 15301 because it does not involve the construction of any new facilities or modification or expansion of capacity of existing facilities and only involves water supplies that have historically been consumptively used by the District prior to undertaking conservation actions. As a separate and independent basis, the water transfer is exempt from CEQA based on the common sense exemption in CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3) because it can be determined with certainty that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment. Nonetheless, an Initial Study/Negative Declaration (IS/ND) was prepared out of an abundance of caution to consider whether any potential environmental impacts could result from the Proposed Agreement.

The attached IS/ND was prepared and circulated for comment on June 5, 2024. Based on various assessments and other information included in the IS, there is no potential for the Proposed Agreement to have a significant effect on the environment. The public comment period on the proposed IS/ND closed on July 5, 2024, and two comment letters were received (attached), one each from the Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD) and from the Fair Oaks Water District (concurrencing with and joining in CHWD’s comments). CEQA does not require preparation of a formal response to the comments. The comments do not present any evidence to contradict the analysis and conclusions in the IS that no significant environmental effects will result from the transfer.

Additionally, CHWD misconstrues the financial details of the transaction in its letter – the financial benefit to the District’s wholesale enterprise could exceed $1,000,000, depending on the actual amount of water purchased by SSWD, combining revenue received for the water and for treatment and wheeling charges. Because transfer activity is irregular, District practice is to not include uncertain transfer revenue in the District’s current year budget, however, the revenue received is incorporated into the Wholesale enterprise’s accounts, and per the Wholesale Water Supply agreement, offsets the costs of Wholesale Customer Agencies. Because the associated revenue is uncertain, irregular, and not included in budget calculations, transfer activity has no relationship to the Wholesale rate study.

# APPENDIX G: ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST FORM

1. **Project title:**  
   2024 Conserved Water Transfer of Pre-1914 Water Rights water to Sacramento Suburban Water District

2. **Lead agency name and address:**  
   San Juan Water District, located at 9935 Auburn Folsom Rd, Granite Bay, CA 95746

3. **Contact person and phone number:**  
   Greg Zlotnick, Water Resources and Strategic Affairs – (916) 791-6933

4. **Project location:**  
   San Juan Water District (San Juan) facilities in northeastern Sacramento County and southeastern Placer County will be used to receive, treat, and convey conserved pre-1914 water right water to Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) in Sacramento County.

5. **Project sponsor's name and address:**  
   San Juan Water District, located at 9935 Auburn Folsom Rd, Granite Bay, CA 95746

6. **General plan designation:**  
   Not applicable.

7. **Zoning:**  
   Not applicable.

8. **Description of project:**  
   San Juan will make available for transfer up to 6,000 acre-feet of its pre-1914 water right water to SSWD, conserved pursuant to Water Code § 1011 (Project). San Juan will report and account for this conserved water in its 2024/2025 Statement of Diversion and Use (SODU). San Juan calculates its total volume of conserved water available for transfer based on San Juan’s implementation of numerous conservation programs as compared to its SB X7- baseline historic usage, across all of its supply sources. The conserved water made available for transfer to SSWD is less than approximately one-third of San Juan’s total volume of conserved water available for transfer. The Project includes a short-term agreement to transfer water to SSWD for the limited period of August 1, 2024 through February 28, 2025. The Project does not involve the construction of any new facilities or the modification or expansion of capacity of existing facilities. San Juan will benefit from the Project by applying conserved pre-1914 water to beneficial use, as well as receiving revenue that will improve its wholesale enterprise’s financial position and reduce upward pressure on wholesale water rates. SSWD will benefit from the receipt of surface water to improve the conjunctive management and health of the North American Groundwater Subbasin (NASb).

9. **Surrounding land uses and setting:**  
   The San Juan Water District provides retail and wholesale water service to customers in northeastern Sacramento County and southeastern Placer County.

| I. AESTHETICS. Except as provided in Public Resources Code Section 21099, would the project: |                               |                                                  |                              |           |
| a) Have a substantial adverse effect on a scenic vista?                | ☐                             | ☐                                                | ☐                            | ☒         |
| b) Substantially damage scenic resources, including, but not limited to, trees, rock outcroppings, and historic buildings within a state scenic highway? | ☐                             | ☐                                                | ☐                            | ☒         |
| c) In nonurbanized areas, substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of public views of the site and its surroundings? (Public views are those that are experienced from publicly accessible vantage point). If the project is in an urbanized area, would the project conflict with applicable zoning and other regulations governing scenic quality? | ☐                             | ☐                                                | ☐                            | ☒         |
| d) Create a new source of substantial light or glare which would adversely affect day or nighttime views in the area? | ☐                             | ☐                                                | ☐                            | ☒         |

**Discussion**

a-d. The proposed Project involves the approval and implementation of an option Agreement to transfer conserved pre-1914 water right water to SSWD. It will be treated at San Juan’s existing water treatment plant and conveyed to SSWD through the existing Cooperative Transmission Pipeline (CTP), just as both San Juan water and SSWD’s Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) entitlement water has been delivered to SSWD in the past. This Project will be implemented by operation of existing facilities and does not involve the construction of any new structures or facilities. Consequently, it would have no impact on views to or from any scenic vistas, nor would it alter the visual character of the area. Additionally, the Project would not create any new sources of light or glare. Therefore, no impact would occur.

| II. AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY RESOURCES. In determining whether impacts to agricultural resources are significant environmental effects, lead agencies may refer to the California Agricultural Land Evaluation and Site Assessment Model (1997) prepared by the California Dept. of Conservation as an optional model to use in assessing impacts on agriculture and farmland. In determining whether impacts to forest resources, including timberland, are significant environmental effects, lead agencies may refer to information compiled by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection regarding the state’s inventory of forest land, including the Forest and Range Assessment Project and the Forest Legacy Assessment project; and forest carbon measurement methodology provided in Forest Protocols adopted by the California Air Resources Board.

**Discussion**

a-b. The water San Juan is transferring does not currently serve prime farmland or any other agricultural land of significance. The Project will utilize current facilities without the need for constructing new structures or facilities in an entirely urban area, ensuring that prime farmland and agricultural land of significance will not be converted as a result of the Project. Transferring water to SSWD will allow groundwater levels to be augmented through in-lieu recharge in the central area of the North American Subbasin (NASb), which will support the retention of agricultural activities that rely upon groundwater within the basin. In addition, the Project will improve conjunctive management and enhance groundwater stabilization in the northern portion of SSWD’s service area. The Project will not conflict with agricultural zoning or existing Williamson Act properties. Therefore, **no impact** would occur.

c-e. In addition, the Project will not lead to forest land loss or its conversion to non-forest use because the water supply involved in this transaction is not utilized to serve forested areas. There will be no conflict with existing zoning or rezoning of forest land as the Project area is entirely within an urban land use designation. Historically, the groundwater resources of the Central area of the NASb were heavily extracted to support agricultural and urban development, resulting in a cone of depression by the mid-1960s. By improving conjunctive management and groundwater stabilization in the SSWD portion of the Project area, the Project will contribute to maintaining and improving the overall health and sustainability of the NASb, a goal that has been achieved since then. Therefore, **no impact** would occur.

| a) Conflict with or obstruct implementation of the applicable air quality plan? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☑ |
| b) Result in a cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant for which the project region is non-attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air quality standard? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☑ |

| c) Expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations? |  |  | ☒ |
| d) Result in other emissions (such as those leading to odors) adversely affecting a substantial number of people? |  |  | ☒ |

**Discussion**

a. The Project does not involve any changes to current air district regulations or plans. Water will be transferred from San Juan using the existing CTP and is intended to support conjunctive management and enhance groundwater stabilization in SSWD’s service area. This initiative will utilize current facilities without the need for constructing new structures or facilities. Therefore, **no impact** would occur.

b-c. The Project is a temporary transfer of conserved pre-1914 surface water San Juan is otherwise entitled to use under its pre-1914 water right because of its water conservation efforts (Water Code § 1011). Raw water is delivered either by gravity or pumped, depending on lake levels, from the United States Bureau of Reclamation’s pumping plant at Folsom Reservoir. It then flows to San Juan’s Sidney N. Peterson Water Treatment Plant and to the CTP. The total amount of raw water diverted to San Juan, including any transfer water, will remain well below San Juan’s historic level of deliveries from Folsom Reservoir. This transfer and corresponding electricity needs will be met by existing facilities operating in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local air quality regulations, ensuring no violation of air quality standards. Accordingly, **no impact** would occur.

d. The Project involves the movement of water from its usual point of delivery at San Juan’s water treatment plant to SSWD’s service area via the CTP. Objectionable odors will not be created due to the incremental increase in water amounts flowing from the point of delivery to the new temporary place of use. Therefore, **no impact** would occur.

**Discussion**

a. The Project involves the temporary transfer of conserved pre-1914 water from San Juan via Folsom Dam into San Juan’s water treatment plant (WTP) and thence to and through the CTP to SSWD’s service area, adhering to current state and federal regulatory requirements. San Juan is otherwise entitled to use the conserved pre-1914 water made available for this transfer as a result of San Juan’s prior water conservation efforts (Water Code § 1011). San Juan’s total diversions, including any Project transfer water, will remain well below San Juan’s historic amount of diversion and use. Consequently, the habitat in the lower American River is not reliant upon the conserved water being made available for this transfer. Moreover, Reclamation’s existing operations requirements for the American River will not be impacted by the Project. Accordingly, no species or habitat are affected by this transfer and **no impact** would occur.

SSWD’s service area overlies the NASb. According to the NASb Groundwater Sustainability Plan (GSP), an analysis of groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) was conducted to evaluate groundwater dependent vegetation and the potential presence of critical fauna, endangered, and threatened species in the basin. This analysis categorizes potential GDEs into priority classifications: "Likely", "Less likely", and "Not likely" GDEs. It was found that 71% of the subbasin, including the Project service areas, fall under the "Not likely" classification. Areas receiving this designation lack the presence of critical species and show no identified groundwater dependent vegetation. Therefore, **no impact** would occur.

b, c. This Project will not disrupt any riparian or sensitive habitat, as it involves no alterations to the natural or built environment. Furthermore, per the NASb GSP, all high priority, critical species, and diverse vegetation areas are located outside of SSWD’s and San Juan’s service areas. All flows for the Project are derived from water San Juan is otherwise entitled to use because of its conservation efforts under San Juan’s pre-1914 water right (Water Code § 1011), and delivered from Folsom Reservoir, ensuring minimal disturbance to surrounding habitats. No wetlands will be disturbed as a result of this Project. Therefore, **no impact** would occur.

d. The American River serves as a migratory route for anadromous salmon and steelhead. However, due to the presence of Nimbus Dam, located approximately 7 miles downstream from Folsom Dam, all upstream migrations are obstructed. Consequently, migratory species do not occur in the Project vicinity. The transferred water will be derived from conserved pre-1914 water supplies delivered from Folsom Reservoir. Reclamation’s

e, f. The Project will not interfere with any established Habitat Conservation Plan or conflict with tree preservation or other local ordinances and policies. Therefore, no impact would occur.

| V. CULTURAL RESOURCES. Would the project: | | | | |
| a) Cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource pursuant to § 15064.5? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |
| b) Cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of an archaeological resource pursuant to § 15064.5? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |
| c) Disturb any human remains, including those interred outside of dedicated cemeteries? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |

**Discussion**

a-c. CEQA provides that a project may lead to a significant environmental effect if it could cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical or cultural resource (Public Resources Code, Section 21084.1). CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5 defines "substantial adverse change" in the significance of a historical resource as "physical demolition, destruction, relocation, or alteration of the resource or its immediate surroundings such that the significance of a historical resource would be materially impaired" (CEQA Guidelines, Section 15064.5[b][1]). There are no historical resources impacted by this transfer and no archaeological sites impacted by this transfer. The Project involves the temporary transfer of water through an existing pipeline. There are no human remains interred outside of dedicated cemeteries or other cultural resources affected as there will be no ground disturbance in this Project. Therefore, no impact would occur.

**Discussion**  
a-b. The Project will not result in wasteful, inefficient or unnecessary consumption of energy in furtherance of the Project because the conserved pre-1914 water temporarily transferred under this Project will flow by gravity to SSWD for enhanced conjunctive management and stabilization of the groundwater basin underlying its northern service area, and the energy needed to deliver the water is a necessary component of the Project. All water management processes, including diversion, conveyance, placement into storage, treatment, and distribution will be comparable to historic processes and the energy intensity previously reported. Therefore, no impact would occur.

**Discussion**

a-f. The Project is a temporary water transfer involving the diversion of conserved pre-1914 water from Folsom Reservoir into the existing WTP, then to and through the CTP for delivery to SSWD’s service area. SSWD will reduce groundwater pumping by an equivalent amount, improve conjunctive management, and enhance groundwater stabilization in the northern portion of its service area. No additional groundwater pumping will occur in San Juan’s service area to offset the transfer of San Juan’s conserved pre-1914 surface water supplies that San Juan would otherwise be entitled to use (Water Code § 1011). This temporary transfer does not necessitate any new facilities; hence no ground disturbance, drilling, or excavation will be required. Given that there will be no ground disturbance, 

**Initial Study (6-1-24) Page 13**

| b) Conflict with an applicable plan, policy or regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |

**Discussion**

a,b. The Project includes the temporary transfer of conserved pre-1914 water right water that San Juan is otherwise entitled to use under its pre-1914 water right because of its water conservation efforts (Water Code § 1011). The Project does not involve any construction-related activities. Moreover, water deliveries to San Juan from Folsom are primarily via gravity flow, and when pumping is required the energy used to do so would be negligible within the total energy use for normal water deliveries, considering annual delivery fluctuations. Furthermore, the transfer will result in reduced pumping of groundwater by SSWD, reducing demand for electrical energy during the transfer, thereby reducing the associated GHG emissions. Consequently, the Project would not generate new GHG emissions. Therefore, no impact would occur.

**Discussion**

a-c. The Project only involves the transport and pumping of water through the existing Folsom Reservoir, WTP and CTP facilities. No significant hazard to the public or the environment will be created through the routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materials. There will be no hazardous emissions or materials handled within one-quarter mile of an existing or proposed school. Furthermore, no construction activities will occur that might inadvertently pose risks to the public or the environment. Therefore, no impact would occur.

d. The State Water Resources Control Board provides information required under Government Code § 65962.5 on GeoTracker, which is the Water Boards' data management system for sites that impact, or have the potential to impact, water quality in California. According to the GeoTracker GIS interface, the water conveyance facilities are not in close proximity to any open Cleanup Program Sites, LUST Cleanup Sites, or Military Cleanup Sites. Therefore, the Project is not located on a site that is listed with hazardous materials under Government Code § 65962.5, and no impact would occur.

e-g. The Project is not located within two miles of an airport and would not change the routine operations of SSWD’s water system in any way that would result in a safety hazard or excessive noise. The Project will not expose people or structures to risk due to wildfires or interfere with emergency response initiatives. Therefore, no impact would occur.

**Discussion**

a. San Juan will temporarily transfer conserved water under their pre-1914 water right, that is diverted from Folsom Reservoir, to be released either by gravity or pumped (depending on lake levels) from Folsom Dam into San Juan’s water treatment plant before being conveyed into the CTP to SSWD’s service area. The quality of water supplied by San Juan after treatment at its water treatment plant meets or exceeds drinking water standards, and appropriate water quality monitoring will be incorporated into the implementation of this Project by San Juan and SSWD. Therefore, **no impact** would occur.

b, e. The purpose of the Project is to temporarily supply conserved surface water from San Juan’s pre-1914 water right to enhance conjunctive management and support groundwater stabilization in SSWD’s northern service area. The temporary transfer of conserved pre-1914 water will allow for SSWD to supplement its pumped groundwater and to utilize surface water supplies and reduce reliance on groundwater. The Project may transfer up to 6,000 acre-feet of surface water from Folsom Reservoir to fulfill SSWD’s needs, leaving an equivalent amount of groundwater available in the basin for future use. As the Central area of the NASb was historically depleted from agricultural and urban development, these actions will contribute to the overall health and sustainability of the NASb. The Project will provide in-lieu recharge to augment groundwater levels in the basin, and there will be no substantial decrease in groundwater supplies as a result of this Project. Furthermore, the NASb GSP concludes that the basin is not experiencing any undesirable results, and this is expected to remain throughout the GSP’s 2042 planning horizon. This projection is based on planned growth and land use changes. To avoid any future undesirable results, the GSP recognizes that additional conjunctive use will be important to pursue as part of the operation of urban municipal supply distribution systems. This Project will increase regional conjunctive use and enhance groundwater stabilization in the NASb. Therefore, **no impact** would occur.

c, d. The Project will rely on diversions to San Juan from Folsom Reservoir for the temporary transfer of conserved pre-1914 water to SSWD. No noticeable alteration to lake levels will occur as a result of this Project. There will also be no impact to local drainage or contribution to erosion in the area.

Neither San Juan nor the SSWD service areas are located within an area that would be affected by a seiche, tsunami, or mudflow, and the Project will not contribute to an increased risk of same. Therefore, no impact would occur.

| a) Physically divide an established community? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |
| b) Cause a significant environmental impact due to a conflict with any land use plan, policy, or regulation adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |

**Discussion**

a, b. The Project would not divide an established community due to the fact that there will be no alterations to the existing infrastructure. Furthermore, there will be no conflict with any land use plan or habitat conservation plan, as the water will be conveyed within existing operational criteria that adhere to all applicable land use and environmental laws, regulations, permits, and approvals through existing facilities such as Folsom Dam and the CTP. Therefore, no impact would occur.

| a) Result in the loss of availability of a locally important mineral resource recovery site delineated on a local general plan, specific plan or other land use plan? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |
| **Discussion** | | | | |
| a, b. The Project will utilize the existing Folsom Reservoir, Folsom Dam, and CTP facilities. No land will be disturbed by this Project, and the implementation of this Project will not involve or impact any known mineral resources of regional, state, or local significance. Therefore, no impact would occur. | | | | |
| **XIII. NOISE.** Would the project result in: | | | | |

**Discussion**

a,b. No construction will occur as part of this Project. Noise levels would remain consistent with current levels occurring during operations of existing conveyance facilities when delivering the transfer water. Therefore, **no impact** would occur.

c. The Project is not located within an airport land use plan or in the vicinity of a private airstrip. Therefore, **no impact** would occur.

| b) Displace substantial numbers of existing people or housing, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |

**Discussion**

a,b. San Juan’s temporary transfer to SSWD will provide conserved surface water supplies to enhance groundwater stabilization. The temporary transfer is not anticipated to contribute to population growth in the receiving region because SSWD will be using this temporary (one year) supply to replace groundwater resources it would otherwise pump to meet customer demands in the northern service area. The temporary supply provided by San Juan is not a reliable, long-term supply that could serve as a basis for long-term planning and management by SSWD. Infrastructure already exists for the Project, so no persons or housing will be displaced. Therefore, **no impact** would occur.

| Schools? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |
| Parks? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |
| Other public facilities? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |

**Discussion**

a. The water supplies provided by San Juan are being transferred to optimize the utilization of San Juan’s surface water supplies, increase regional conjunctive use, and to enhance groundwater stabilization in SSWD’s northern service area. As a result, no change is required to the built environment to support the Project. For the same reasons, there will be no need for additional police, fire, school, or park services to facilitate the transport of the water. No public facilities will be impacted, as the proposed transfer will solely utilize existing capacity within the conveyance facilities. In addition, no other public services would be harmed from the transfer of the conserved pre-1914 water as San Juan is otherwise entitled to use this water because of its water conservation efforts (Water Code § 1011). Therefore, no impact would occur.

☐ ☐ ☐ ☑

**Discussion**  
a-d. The Project will not affect traffic or transportation in any manner. Section 15064.3 of CEQA notes that “vehicle miles traveled” is the most appropriate measure for assessing transportation impacts, with subsection (b) outlining criteria for such analysis. Given that no changes will be made to any transportation systems, the Project is consistent with the applicable CEQA Guidelines. In addition, there will be no changes to geometric design of any transportation features or change any emergency access. As a result, the Project will not affect traffic or transportation in any manner. Therefore, **no impact** would occur.

Discussion

a. No Tribal Cultural Resources have been identified in the Project area, and no ground-disturbing activities are proposed with the Project. In addition, water will be transferred using existing infrastructure. It is not anticipated that the proposed Project would cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a Tribal Cultural Resource given that water transferred is the result of conservation efforts and would be within historical ranges; water would be transferred using existing infrastructure, and water delivered to SSWD would be used to enhance sustainable groundwater management in the NASb. Section 21808.3.1(b) of the Public Resources Code states that prior to the release of a negative declaration, the lead agency shall begin consultation with a California Native American Tribe that wishes to be notified of projects within its geographic area. No Native American tribe has requested consultation with San Juan regarding projects in its service area under Public Resources Code Section 21082.3.1.

| e) Comply with federal, state, and local management and reduction statutes and regulations related to solid waste? |   |   |       |  ☒  |

**Discussion**

a, c. Conserved water temporarily transferred to SSWD will enhance groundwater stabilization in its northern service area by delivering San Juan’s conserved surface water in lieu of pumped groundwater. This will not result in the expansion or relocation of new facilities; no construction will occur as part of this Project. All wastewater will be consistent with expected flows under normal water supply conditions for SSWD and would not require the expansion of capacity in any water or wastewater treatment plant. All existing wastewater facilities will continue to be operated consistent with wastewater treatment standards and requirements. Therefore, **no impact** would occur.

b. San Juan is entitled to use conserved pre-1914 water right surface water supplies to accommodate this temporary transfer (Water Code § 1011). San Juan also possesses other rights and entitlements sufficient to meet its own demands. Conservation efforts from the San Juan Water District and its customers have resulted in significant water conservation savings over the past two decades as compared to its SB7X-7 baseline historic usage. The temporary transfer will not be used as a long-term water supply. Therefore, **no impact** would occur.

d,e. Nothing in this Project will generate any additional solid waste that would differ from existing local standards and expectation. Nothing in this Project will require development or design of additional water distribution facilities or wastewater facilities. Therefore, **no impact** would occur.

| c) Require the installation or maintenance of associated infrastructure (such as roads, fuel breaks, emergency water sources, power lines or other utilities) that may exacerbate fire risk or that may result in temporary or ongoing impacts to the environment? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |
| d) Expose people or structures to significant risks, including downslope or downstream flooding or landslides, as a result of runoff, post-fire slope instability, or drainage changes? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |

**Discussion**

a-d. The Project would not alter any emergency response plan, emergency evacuation plan, or any similar plan in San Juan or SSWD service areas. There will be no new Project occupants exposed to pollutant concentrations from a wildfire or the uncontrolled spread of a wildfire. No other infrastructure (such as roads, emergency water sources, power lines, or other utilities) that may exacerbate fire risk or result in temporary or ongoing impacts to the environment are proposed. The proposed Project does not have the potential to expose people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects from post-fire flooding, landslides, or slope instability. Therefore, no impact would occur.

| b) Does the project have impacts that are individually limited, but cumulatively considerable? (“Cumulatively considerable” means that the incremental effects of a project are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects.) | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |
| c) Does the project have environmental effects which will cause substantial adverse effects on human beings, either directly or indirectly? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☒ |

Discussion

a-c. The Project would not result in significant impacts associated with the CEQA mandatory findings of significance. Based on the analysis provided in this Initial Study, the temporary water transfer of conserved pre-1914 surface supplies from San Juan to SSWD would not substantially degrade or reduce fish or wildlife species habitat. It would not cause a decline in fish or wildlife populations to unsustainable levels, jeopardize the existence or plant or animal species, substantially restrict the range of rare or endangered plant or animal species, or eliminate significant examples of the major periods in California’s history.

# SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT  
**[Proposed] NEGATIVE DECLARATION**

Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and CEQA Guidelines, the San Juan Water District hereby adopts a Negative Declaration for the following project:

**PROJECT TITLE:**  
2024 Conserved Water Transfer of Pre-1914 Water Rights water to Sacramento Suburban Water District.

**PROJECT PROPONENT AND LEAD AGENCY:**  
San Juan Water District  
9935 Auburn Folsom Road, Granite Bay, CA 95746; Principal Contact:  
Greg Zlotnick, Water Resources and Strategic Affairs,  
916-791-6933

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION**  
San Juan Water District (San Juan or SJWD) is proposing to enter into an Agreement to temporarily transfer up to 6,000 acre-feet (AF) of its pre-1914 appropriative water rights water supplies, conserved pursuant to Water Code §1011, to Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) (hereafter, “Project”).

Pursuant to a settlement agreement, the United States Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) will divert San Juan’s water right water from Folsom Reservoir; it will be treated at San Juan’s Water Treatment Plant; and it will be conveyed through the Cooperative Transmission Pipeline (CTP) for delivery into SSWD’s northern service area.

SJWD provides wholesale and retail water service to customers in northeastern Sacramento County and southwestern Placer County. San Juan’s pre-1914 water rights water supplies have an 1853 priority date, have been quantified and recorded, and are made available on an annual basis by Reclamation. The water supply is reliable.

Numerous water conservation actions have made a portion of San Juan’s pre-1914 appropriative water supplies available for this proposed transfer. These activities have resulted from implementation of SB X7-7, the Water Conservation Act of 2009, that required urban water purveyors to conserve 20% of their water supplies by 2020. San Juan complied with this legislative requirement as shown in its 2020 Urban Water Management Plan, and continues to preserve its conserved water supplies for use and transfer. San Juan is exercising its right to transfer this conserved water to SSWD pursuant to Water Code § 1011.

SSWD is a retail water supplier with no surface water supplies of its own, but it provides both surface and groundwater supplies to its urban customers by entering into agreements with surface water suppliers to enhance conjunctive management and sustainability of its groundwater aquifer. SSWD serves water to areas in Sacramento County, with its headquarters located at 3701 Marconi Avenue, Sacramento, CA. 95821. SSWD will receive San Juan’s conserved pre-1914 appropriative water rights supplies through the CTP for service to its existing customers. SSWD will forego pumping an equivalent amount of groundwater.

from the North American Subbasin (NASb) as the amount of surface water it receives through this proposed conserved water transfer.

For more information concerning the Project, see the Initial Study 2024 Temporary Water Transfer of Pre-1914 Water Rights to Sacramento Suburban Water District (the "Initial Study"), which is available for review and copying during regular business hours at San Juan’s District office at 9935 Auburn Folsom Road, Granite Bay, CA 95746. The Initial Study is also posted online at www.sjwd.org.

## PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR THE PROPOSED PROJECT

The purpose and need for the Project is to facilitate efficient delivery and re-allocation of water between a willing seller and willing buyer under California law. SSWD will reduce its groundwater pumping and take delivery of conserved surface water supplies made available by San Juan. SSWD will use these transferred surface water supplies to help meet its urban demands.

San Juan is making up to 6,000 acre-feet of its pre-1914 water rights available for transfer to the SSWD with that availability based upon its prior and ongoing water conservation actions. San Juan has the right to transfer a portion of its pre-1914 water right supply, identified as having been conserved in the transfer year, under Water Code sections 1011 and 1706, which permits a change in the place of use, purpose of use or point of diversion or rediversion, as long as the transfer would not cause injury to another party that has a legal right to that water and SJWD complies with the requirements of CEQA.

## BACKGROUND INFORMATION

### San Juan Water District (San Juan)

San Juan’s predecessor in interest, the North Fork Ditch Company, was established in 1854, after it had established its first water right claim in 1853. San Juan was formed in 1954 as California’s first community services district. San Juan’s wholesale area covers approximately 46 square miles and serves a population of approximately 151,000. San Juan’s water supply sources are: (1) a settlement contract with Reclamation that provides, in perpetuity without reductions, for the delivery of 33,000 acre-feet of water from the American River based upon the District’s water rights, which have priority dates of 1853 and 1928; (2) a permanent repayment contract with Reclamation for 24,200 acre-feet of Central Valley Project water; and, (3) a contract with Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) for up to 25,000 acre-feet of water. All sources of surface water are either temporarily held in or flow through Folsom Lake and delivery is taken at Folsom Dam outlets, either by gravity or pumped by Reclamation’s Folsom Pumping Plant.

### Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD)

SSWD serves approximately 175,000 people within its service area boundary. SSWD comprises two service areas – the North Service Area and South Service Area – that resulted from the combination of two previously independent water service systems. SSWD serves its customers both surface and groundwater supplies within the entirety of its service area boundary. SSWD serves approximately 35,000 acre-feet of water annually to its customers derived from its surface and groundwater supply portfolio.
<!-- Page 96 -->
![FINDINGS](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=FINDINGS)

San Juan has directed the preparation of an Initial Study on the Project in accordance with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The Initial Study has been prepared to assess the Project’s potential effects on the environment and the significance of those effects. Based on the Initial Study, and the findings below, San Juan finds that there is no substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before the San Juan, that the Project may have a significant effect on the environment. This conclusion is supported by the following findings:

- The water made available for this water transfer resulted from water conservation actions required by SB X7-7, the Water Conservation Act of 2009, as well as subsequent and ongoing conservation actions. San Juan’s conserved water is protected for use and transfer under Water Code section 1011. San Juan has the legal right to transfer its Pre-1914 water right water under Water Code section 1706. The proposed project will not preclude San Juan from meeting the water demands of its customers. The conserved surface water that San Juan will transfer to SSWD is within the aggregate baseline amount of water delivered to San Juan’s customers prior to SB X7-7 and implementation of the conservation actions associated with it and those that have also been carried out subsequently.

- The proposed short-term water conservation transfer will offset groundwater pumping that would otherwise occur in SSWD’s service area. Neither conveyance of the transfer water to SSWD, nor use of the transfer water within SSWD’s service area, results in a change in physical environment. The transfer will not result in any significant impact to streams or habitat for listed species, nor result in any growth-inducing impacts in SSWD’s service area.

- There will be no impact on the environment because the transfer water complies with all laws and regulations applicable to the transfer of conserved water derived from a pre-1914 appropriative water right and SSWD will reduce use of groundwater by using the transferred conserved surface water supply.

- There will be no significant environmental impact on the operation of Folsom Reservoir, which has a capacity of nearly one million AF, resulting from this Project. Reclamation has been operating the reservoir since 1954 in part to divert, temporarily store as needed, and deliver water to San Juan under its existing water rights and contractual entitlements. There would be no change in Reclamation’s operations of Folsom Reservoir resulting from this Project.

- There are no significant direct, indirect, or cumulative impacts from implementation of the Project.

- There are no construction-related activities related to the Project.

- The Project would not substantially degrade the quality of the environment, substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species, cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below self-sustaining levels, reduce the number or restrict the range of a special-status species, or eliminate important examples of California history or prehistory.

Negative Declaration

<!-- Page 97 -->
- The Project would not achieve short-term environmental goals to the disadvantage of long-term environmental goals.

- The Project would not have environmental effects that are individually limited but cumulatively considerable.

- The Project would not have environmental effects that would cause substantial adverse effects on human beings, either directly or indirectly.

- The Project is limited to the single, short-term water transfer, which represents the whole of the contemplated action. The Project is separate and independent, and not related to or part of any past activities, including past water transfer agreements. The Project does not contemplate any future activities or water transfers and does not commit the District to any future activities or water transfers.

- The Negative Declaration reflects the independent judgment of the Lead Agency.

In accordance with Section 21082.1 of CEQA, San Juan has independently reviewed and analyzed the Initial Study and Negative Declaration for the Project and finds that the Initial Study and Negative Declaration reflect the independent judgment of San Juan. Based on a review of Project impacts above, it is anticipated that there will be no significant environmental impacts as a result of this Project. Therefore, no mitigation is required, and the Project is hereby approved.

Re: Initial Study and Negative Declaration for 2024 Conserved Water Transfer of Pre-1914 Water Rights water to Sacramento Suburban Water District project  

Dear Mr. Zlotnick:  

Citrus Heights Water District (“Citrus Heights”) received San Juan Water District’s (“SJWD”) Notice of Intent to adopt a Negative Declaration for its proposed 2024 Conserved Water Transfer of Pre-1914 Water Rights water to Sacramento Suburban Water District project (“Project”). Through the Project, SJWD proposes the transfer and sale of up to 6,000 AF of pre-1914 water rights water to Sacramento Suburban Water District (“SSWD”) between August 1, 2024 through February 28, 2025 (“Project”). Citrus Heights submits these comments in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”) and the other areas of law and policy addressed below.  

CEQA Comments  

Historically, SJWD does not appear to have conducted any substantive CEQA review for its previous transfers of pre-1914 water rights water to SSWD. It thus appears that SJWD’s decision to prepare the Initial Study and Negative Declaration (“IS/ND”) is in response to Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks Water District’s 2023 legal challenge to SJWD’s illegal delegation of authority regarding the water transfers, and Citrus Heights’ April 22 and 23, 2024 comments objecting to SJWD’s contemplated use of an exemption for the Project. Although Citrus Heights appreciates SJWD’s attempt to comply with CEQA, the IS/ND is legally insufficient and fails to satisfy CEQA’s mandate to fully inform the public and decision-makers about the environmental consequences of the Project.  

Inaccurate Project Description  

Every CEQA project must be adequately described. (Stopthemillenniumhollywood.com v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 1, 16.) “[A]n accurate description of the project is necessary in order to decide what kind of environmental impact statement needs to be prepared.”

Page 2  

(County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192-194.) An accurate and complete project description is “necessary for an intelligent evaluation of the potential environmental impacts of the agency’s action. ‘Only through an accurate view of the project may affected outsiders and public decision-makers balance the proposal’s benefit against its environmental cost, consider mitigation measures, … and weigh other alternatives in the balance.’” (City of Redlands v. County of San Bernardino (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 398, 406.) In determining the adequacy of the Project’s description, “the governing principal is whether the project description may have thwarted the public’s ability to participate in the process and comment meaningfully on the [environmental review document]. Inadequate or unstable descriptions … may mislead the public and thwart” the CEQA process. (Save Our Capitol! v. Dept. of General Services (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 655, 673.)

Here, the Project description is both inaccurate and incomplete. The IS/ND states repeatedly that the transfer is temporary or short-term and relies on the allegedly temporary and short term nature of the Project as the basis for its impact conclusions. (E.g., IS/ND, pp.8, 10, 12, 17, 18, 20.) The Project, however, is neither temporary nor short-term. SJWD has been transferring pre-1914 water rights water to SSWD on a yearly basis since at least 2020. (See SJWD Proposed Budget FY 2024-2025, p. 37 (June 26, 2024 SJWD Board packet).) Transfers that have been occurring on a yearly basis for at least four years are not temporary or short-term, making the Project description factually inaccurate.

The Project description is also incomplete because it omits any mention of the prior yearly transfers. This omission misleads the public into thinking that the proposed Project is a “one-off,” rather than the yearly transfer that it actually is.

The failure to accurately describe the Project directly translates into a failure to accurately identify and disclose the Project’s potentially significant direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts as well as its potentially significant cumulative impacts. The IS/ND must be revised to accurately describe the Project and a new initial study must be prepared to analyze impacts from the accurately-described Project.

Illegal Piecemealing

CEQA’s “requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces, which individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the environment … .” (Plan for Arcadia, Inc. v. City Council of Arcadia (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 712, 726.) Instead, CEQA requires evaluation of the “whole of the action.” (CEQA Guidelines § 15378, subd. (a).)

The whole of the action here is a long-term water transfer—not a temporary, short term transfer as the IS/ND mischaracterizes it. The IS/ND must be revised to analyze the potentially significant environmental impacts that would result from the long-term yearly transfers of pre-1914 water rights water.

There is a fair argument the Project may have significant impacts on the environment

CEQA creates a “low threshold” for preparation of an environmental impact report. (Preserve Poway v. City of Poway (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 560, 575-576.) SJWD may rely on a negative declaration only if there is “no substantial evidence, in light of the whole record … that the project may have a significant effect on the environment.” (Public Resources Code § 21080, subd. (c)(1); see also, CEQA Guidelines § 15070, subd. (a).) If there is a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the lead agency shall prepare an EIR. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064, subd. (f)(1).)

The IS/ND implausibly concludes that the Project would have no impacts whatsoever on the environment. However, the discussion of Project impacts is both cursory and conclusory, with no supporting evidence. Expert reports from hydrologists, biologists and other experts are necessary to analyze the Project’s direct, reasonably foreseeable indirect and cumulative impacts on sensitive hydrological and biological resources. Yet, SJWD did not conduct any expert studies and so there is no evidence to support SJWD’s conclusion that the Project will have no impacts on the environment. SJWD has an obligation to investigate and it cannot simply refuse to conduct feasible studies and then declare, without any substantial evidence, that there will be no impacts. Citrus Heights should conduct the necessary hydrological and biological studies (as well as any other necessary studies) and make them available to Citrus Heights and the public. The IS/ND should be re-done after these necessary studies have been completed.

As noted above, a negative declaration may only be adopted if there is no substantial evidence that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. The IS/ND, with its lack of any meaningful and substantive analysis or expert reports, does not meet this standard. The IS/ND also asserts—again without evidentiary support—that the Project will have beneficial impacts on groundwater recharge. But “[a]ny potential significant effect triggers the EIR requirement, even if” the Project would “provide a ‘net’ or overall positive for the environment.” (Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1197.)

Even worse, the no impacts conclusion is largely based on the false premise that the transfer is temporary and short term (IS/ND, pp. 8, 10, 12, 17, 18, 20). This premise in turn derives from the inaccurate and incomplete Project description. The inaccurate Project description—which omits the crucial fact that these are actually long-term yearly transfers— precludes disclosure and analysis of the Project’s impacts on the environment, particularly its potentially significant cumulative impacts and potentially direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect significant impacts on biological resources, hydrology, population and housing, growth inducement and utilities. This could lead to increased reliance on surface water, which could also result in significant direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts and cumulative impacts, particularly to biological and hydrological resources. Because the IS/ND omits critical information about the Project, the public is not able to meaningfully comment on the Project and its potentially significant environmental impacts.

Re: Initial Study and Negative Declaration for 2024 Conserved Water Transfer of Pre-1914 Water Rights water to Sacramento Suburban Water District project  

Dear Mr. Zlotnick:  

Citrus Heights Water District (“Citrus Heights”) received San Juan Water District’s (“SJWD”) Notice of Intent to adopt a Negative Declaration for its proposed 2024 Conserved Water Transfer of Pre-1914 Water Rights water to Sacramento Suburban Water District project (“Project”). Through the Project, SJWD proposes the transfer and sale of up to 6,000 AF of Pre-1914 water rights water to Sacramento Suburban Water District (“SSWD”) between August 1, 2024 through February 28, 2025 (“Project”). Citrus Heights submits these comments in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”) and the other areas of law and policy addressed below.  

**CEQA Comments**  

Historically, SJWD does not appear to have conducted any substantive CEQA review for its previous transfers of pre-1914 water rights water to SSWD. It thus appears that SJWD’s decision to prepare the Initial Study and Negative Declaration (“IS/ND”) is in response to Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks Water District’s 2023 legal challenge to SJWD’s illegal delegation of authority regarding the water transfers, and Citrus Heights’ April 22 and 23, 2024 comments objecting to SJWD’s contemplated use of an exemption for the Project. Although Citrus Heights appreciates SJWD’s attempt to comply with CEQA, the IS/ND is legally insufficient and fails to satisfy CEQA’s mandate to fully inform the public and decision-makers about the environmental consequences of the Project.  

**Inaccurate Project Description**  

Every CEQA project must be adequately described. (Stopthemillenniumhollywood.com v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 1, 16.) “[A]n accurate description of the project is necessary in order to decide what kind of environmental impact statement need be prepared.”

There is a fair argument the Project may have significant impacts on the environment  

CEQA creates a “low threshold” for preparation of an environmental impact report. (Preserve Poway v. City of Poway (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 560, 575-576.) SJWD may rely on a negative declaration only if there is “no substantial evidence, in light of the whole record ... that the project may have a significant effect on the environment.” (Public Resources Code § 21080, subd. (c)(1); see also, CEQA Guidelines § 15070, subd. (a).) If there is a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the lead agency shall prepare an EIR. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064, subd. (f)(1).)  

The IS/ND implausibly concludes that the Project would have no impacts whatsoever on the environment. However, the discussion of Project impacts is both cursory and conclusory, with no supporting evidence. Expert reports from hydrologists, biologists and other experts are necessary to analyze the Project’s direct, reasonably foreseeable indirect and cumulative impacts on sensitive hydrological and biological resources. Yet, SJWD did not conduct any expert studies and there is no evidence to support SJWD’s conclusion that the Project will have no impacts on the environment. SJWD has an obligation to investigate and it cannot simply refuse to conduct feasible studies and then declare, without any substantial evidence, that there will be no impacts. Citrus Heights requests that SJWD conduct the necessary hydrological and biological studies (as well as any other necessary studies) and make them available to Citrus Heights and the public. The IS/ND should be re-done after these necessary studies have been completed.  

As noted above, a negative declaration may only be adopted if there is no substantial evidence that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. The IS/ND, with its lack of any meaningful and substantive analysis or expert reports, does not meet this standard. The IS/ND also asserts—again without evidentiary support—that the Project will have beneficial impacts on groundwater recharge.

City of Santa Cruz (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1197.)  

Even worse, the no impacts conclusion is largely based on the false premise that the transfer is temporary and short term (IS/ND, pp. 8, 10, 12, 17, 18, 20). This premise in turn derives from the inaccurate and incomplete Project description. The inaccurate Project description—which omits the crucial fact that these are actually long-term yearly transfers—precludes disclosure and analysis of the Project’s impacts on the environment, particularly its potentially significant cumulative impacts and potentially direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect significant impacts on biological resources, hydrology, population and housing, inducement and utilities. This could lead to increased reliance on surface water, which could also result in significant direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts and cumulative impacts, particularly to biological and hydrological resources. Because the IS/ND omits critical information about the Project, the public is not able to meaningfully comment on the Project and its potentially significant environmental impacts.

In short, the IS/ND’s omission of information necessary for informed public participation and informed decision-making thwarts CEQA’s statutory purpose and constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion. (Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line Construction Authority (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 463). SJWD must revise the IS/ND to accurately define the Project as a long-term series of yearly water transfers and conduct new analysis and investigation of potentially significant impacts that could result from these transfers.  

**Financial Impacts of the Proposed Transfer**  

Citrus Heights remains confounded by the alleged financial benefits to wholesale of the proposed transfer of pre-1914 water supplies to SSWD. During the SJWD April 24, 2024 SJWD Board meeting, one or more SJWD Directors alleged that Citrus Heights would receive an approximate $400,000 benefit through SJWD’s receipt of $1.1 million in payments from SSWD for the Project. (See SJWD 4/24/24 Board packet, Staff Report for Agenda Item VI-3, p. 2.) That staff report states that while the gross revenue from the sale of 4,000 acre feet to SSWD would be $1,060,000, the net revenue (aka, the profit) would amount to only $36.82 per acre foot, or $147,000, after wheeling and treatment costs are deducted. The staff report is confusing in that it also states the net revenue to SJWD would be only $40,160 for 4,000 acre feet. Regardless of whether the alleged net “profit” to wholesale from the proposed sale to SSWD is $147,000 or $40,160, it certainly does not equate to a $400,000 wholesale benefit to Citrus Heights, as alleged by SJWD’s Directors. And, it is also unclear whether SJWD staff time and CEQA document preparation costs are included in the net figures, thus further reducing any alleged financial benefit of the transaction. Moreover, it is also not clear how the proposed charges to SSWD conform to SJWD’s new wholesale water rates, thus driving further questions about whether there is any “profit” at all associated with the water sale.  

**Conclusion**  

From the perspective of Citrus Heights, the proposed transfer of pre-1914 water to SSWD is not worth the alleged financial benefit, if it generates any “profit” at all, particularly given the exposure created for SJWD on the deficient CEQA documentation and the potential erosion of the pre-1914 water rights in favor of the wholesale customer agencies. Citrus Heights has repeatedly shared that SJWD should focus on delivering pre-1914 and 1928 water supplies to the wholesale customer agencies, so that we may enjoy the reliability, low cost and other benefits of the water rights acquired with the foresight and at the sole expense of customers of the wholesale service area.

**FOREWORD**

This document composes the Operations Plan for the San Juan Water District for Fiscal Year 2024-25. It defines the major actions that we plan to undertake during this coming fiscal year, to achieve the goals and strategic objectives laid out in the District’s Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan encompasses our mission, vision and values, and outlines the goals and objectives that we will pursue to meet our mission and achieve our vision. The Strategic Plan incorporates the principles of fiscal responsibility, customer service and operational excellence.

This Operations Plan is organized in sections that correspond to the District’s different functional groups. The actions are not in priority order, but the Goals and Strategic Objectives in the Strategic Plan that are related to these actions are noted. A target date for accomplishing the action is also listed, and District staff will be reporting regularly on the status of completing each action.

### Conclusion:
FY 2023-24 deliveries were higher than anticipated by 9,647 acre feet or 25.5%. As shown in the table above the main driver of the positive variance is deliveries to SSWD of their PCWA water, although all wholesale customers took more water than anticipated in the budget. Excluding deliveries to SSWD, deliveries were 7.8% greater than anticipated, and revenues were 1.1% below expectations.

Overall, the 25.5% positive variance in deliveries results in year to date revenue that is 13% greater than anticipated in the budget.
