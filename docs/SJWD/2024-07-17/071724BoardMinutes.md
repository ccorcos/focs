## V. NEW BUSINESS

1. **Customer Service Satisfaction Survey Results (R)**  
   Mr. Barrett introduced Dr. Timothy McLarney, True North Research, Inc., who conducted the survey and compiled the report. Dr. McLarney conducted a presentation which will be attached to the meeting minutes. Dr. McLarney provided background information about True North Research and the work that they perform.

   Dr. McLarney reviewed the Methodology of Study, informed the Board that there were 519 participants instead of the proposed 400, then proceeded to review the results of each question, which included the results from the 2018 survey as well. He informed the Board that the results were very positive for the District. He reviewed the Key Findings which were:

   **Positive Report Card on the District’s Performance**
   - Familiarity with District is high and increasing
   - Favorability is high and growing
   - Overall customer satisfaction is high and strengthening
   - Customer Service Representatives received high marks
   - District appears to be striking the right balance in terms of communicating with customers

   **Opportunity Areas**
   - Educate customers on the true cost of water – it changes their opinion about value of service
   - Educate customers on the availability of rebate programs for water efficient appliances
   - Text messaging for important, time-sensitive notifications

   The Board thanked Dr. McLarney for conducting the survey and providing the report results. In addition, the Board thanked the Customer Service Department for their hard work in providing great customer service.

2. **2024 Water Transfer (W)**  
   GM Helliker informed the Board that the purpose of the proposed water transfer to Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) is to optimize the use of the District’s surface water, generate some revenue for the District, and establish a foundation for the opportunity to participate in the Voluntary Agreement. He reviewed the written report which was included in the Board packet.
<!-- Page 4 -->
![July 17, 2024, Board Minutes Page 4](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+not+available) 

GM Helliker reported that a Negative Declaration was prepared and circulated for comment on June 5, 2024, with the comment period closing on July 5, 2024. He reported that two comment letters were received, one from Citrus Heights Water District and one from Fair Oaks Water District. After review of the comment letters, it was determined that the comments do not present any evidence to contradict the analysis and conclusions in the Initial Study that no significant environmental effects will result from the transfer. In addition, he reviewed the Board actions that staff are recommending.

Vice President Costa inquired of Legal Counsel if the District approved the transfer and, then was sued, could the action be defended. Legal Counsel Ewens informed the Board that this should be discussed in Closed Session, which is on the agenda. In response to Vice President Costa’s comment, GM Helliker informed the Board that the wholesale mailer that was recently sent out, noted the cost savings to the wholesale customer agencies as a result of water transfers to SSWD. The data shows that the wholesale rates would have been 16% higher had there been no water deliveries to SSWD.

In response to Director Tobin’s question, Legal Counsel Ewens informed the Board that her firm worked on the CEQA documentation for the District. In addition, she directed the Board to the staff report that is responsive to the project falling within two exemptions under CEQA. Director Tobin inquired if this agenda item should be brought back after the Closed Session. Legal Counsel Ewens deferred to the Board’s discretion on whether they would prefer to wait to take any action until after the Closed Session. The Board discussed postponing the action until after the Closed Session.

President Zamorano opened the floor for public comment. There were no public comments made.

VI. OLD BUSINESS

1. FY 2023-24 Operations Plan Report Card (W & R)  
   GM Helliker reviewed the 4th quarter progress on the FY 2023-24 Operations Plan Report Card. He noted a few delays in the plan which are shown in the report card, but most items are complete. Mr. Andrew Pierson reported that the Kokila Reservoir Project will go out to bid in the Fall and EPA Grant funds will be used for that project.

2. FY 2024-25 Operations Plan (W & R)  
   GM Helliker reviewed the FY 2024-25 Operations Plan, which will be attached to the Board minutes. He explained that the Operations Plan shows some of the larger or more significant items to track for the current year.

3. Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)  
   GM Helliker reported that the Water Bank Program Committee meeting was held today, and they discussed previously banked water. He explained that they
<!-- Page 5 -->
![July 17, 2024, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=July+17,+2024,+Board+Minutes)

**Page 5**

discussed how to capture the groundwater banking activity that has occurred over the past twenty years and apply it to the water bank. For some of the activities, they all agreed that there was a zero balance in the system for those items; however, for other activities they are still debating on how to account for that water in the water accounting framework.

4. **2024 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)**  
GM Helliker reviewed data which included the current reservoir storage levels across the state, data on releases, temperature and precipitation outlooks, and storage levels and projections at Folsom Reservoir.

VII. **INFORMATION ITEMS**

1. **GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT**

   1.1 **General Manager’s Monthly Report (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker provided the Board with a written report for June which was included in the Board packet.

   1.2 **Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence**  
   GM Helliker reported that the State Water Board adopted the Conservation Regulations on July 3rd. He informed the Board that a fifth comment period was opened up that should not affect the substance of the regulations. He reviewed some data regarding irrigated vs irrigable landscape and the impact to various agencies including San Juan. He explained that with the recently adopted regulations, San Juan will have to meet a 23% reduction in deliveries by 2040 based on irrigated landscape as opposed to 1% if the regulation was based on the irrigable landscape specification in the statute.

   GM Helliker reported that the Water Forum agreement update is almost complete after four years. He informed the Board that the conservation element in the agreement is still being discussed. In addition, he reported that Sacramento County sent a letter to the Water Forum last October stating that their contribution was being reduced from approximately $1 million per year to $800,000; however, they recently stated that they want to reduce their contribution to zero. GM Helliker reviewed a table that showed the amounts which the agencies would be charged with San Juan paying $10,000 for the Sacramento County area in addition to the $15,000 that the District already pays.

2. **DIRECTOR OF FINANCE AND HUMAN RESOURCES’ REPORT**
