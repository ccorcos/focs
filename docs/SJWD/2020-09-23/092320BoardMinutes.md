Page 3  

committee briefed on the report last month and comments submitted to the consultant in August. The managers are meeting on September 24th to review the input that the consultant received.

GM Helliker reviewed the timeline to date and explained that the previous 2x2 committee was placed in a dormant status in 2019 so that the Collaboration/Integration Project could move forward. In addition, he explained that there are no discussions with Sacramento Suburban Water District regarding merger at this time. The Board discussed the timeline of the current study and GM Helliker informed the Board that the consultant is on schedule with the study.

GM Helliker provided information from Sacramento and Placer LAFCo regarding the topic of creating a separate retail agency which is included in his staff report. President Costa commented that customers should initiate this process and if enough signatures are collected for the petition, then the Board should consider this at that time. Ms. Buckman informed the Board that this is a legal process and recommended that it not be considered until after the transition to division-based elections process is complete.

3. Regional Water Bank Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed the North American sub-basin map which shows the GSAs along with the water depth contours of the groundwater basin. He explained that there is approximately two million acres of storage available in this basin. In addition, he stated that the region is very capable of banking groundwater through various methods such as use of surface water instead of groundwater or through the use of injection using aquifer storage and recovery wells.

GM Helliker informed the Board that there is approximately 389,147 acre-feet of water banked in the SGA Central Area. In addition, he reviewed the water bank development phases and explained that phase 1 is complete and the region is entering phase 2. He explained that phase 2 focuses on getting the groundwater bank acknowledged by the federal government, which would allow the District to store its CVP water, as well as the region being able to bank and deliver CVP water supplies from other agencies. He explained that Reclamation established groundwater banking guidelines in 2019 to incentivize and facilitate the use of groundwater banks to store CVP water on a multiple year basis.

GM Helliker reported that $90,000 of the $500,000 was not spent in Phase 1 and will be applied to Phase 2. He explained that the District’s portion was 6% ($25,000) for Phase 1.

GM Helliker informed the Board that there is still a lot of information and analysis that needs to be completed in order to have a fully operational groundwater bank. He reviewed the Phase 2 activities which covers a two to three year period with an approximate cost of $1.2 million for the region. He estimates that the District’s share will be $72,000 - $90,000 over the next few.

# AGENDA ITEM III-6

## STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Andrew Pierson, Engineering Services Manager  
**Date:** September 23, 2020  
**Subject:** Granite Bay Pump Station Low Flow Pump Improvements Project  

---

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Staff recommends a motion to award a construction contract to Division 5-15 for the amount of $224,295 with a construction contingency of $22,430 (10%) for an authorized total construction budget of $246,725. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Engineering Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.

### BACKGROUND
This project involves the installation of two new low flow pumps in both the Upper and Lower Granite Bay Booster Pump Stations, and the installation of a motorized operated valve actuator to an existing valve located between the Lower Granite Bay and Crown Point Booster Pump Stations. The Upper and Lower Granite Bay Pump Stations were originally designed or sized based on actual and projected demands during the District’s last Retail Master Plan in 2000. Due to ongoing droughts and conservation efforts, water demand has fallen significantly. The existing pumps are oversized for the demand and do not operate efficiently, especially during the low demand winter months, resulting in added mechanical wear and higher energy use. The new low flow pumps were appropriately sized based on current winter demands and will reduce operating costs during low demand periods. The installation of the motorized operated valve actuator will provide an emergency connection between both the Lower Granite Bay and Crown Point Pump Stations allowing for back-up distribution to each pressure zone.

### STATUS
The Project was advertised for bidding on August 6, 2020. Bids for the project were received on September 2, 2020, and are summarized as follows:

| Bidder                     | Bid Amount  |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Division 5-15             | $224,295    |
| GSE Construction           | $282,400    |
| Auburn Constructors        | $301,300    |
| Sierra National Construction| $369,800   |
| Mountain Cascade           | $386,100    |

Division 5-15 was the lowest responsive, responsible bidder. Division 5-15’s bid documents were reviewed and found to be complete and in order, including license, insurance, and bonds.

### FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The Project was included in the District’s approved Retail CIP budget for Fiscal Year 2020-2021, and the approval of the Project is within the authorized budget.

**AGENDA ITEM IV-2**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** September 23, 2020  
**Subject:** Collaboration/Integration Project and Potential Creation of a New Retail Water District  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Information  

**COLLABORATION/INTEGRATION PROJECT**  

In late April of this year, the Collaboration/Integration project consulting team (Raftelis and Tully and Young) kicked off the project with an initial meeting of the Management Committee. Subsequent to that meeting, Raftelis conducted at least two interviews with management teams from each of the seven participating agencies – focused on communications and operations. They also collected from each agency a variety of documents and information, including budgets, master plans, CIP documents, staffing information, regional organizations and collaborations, and so on.

The Raftelis team completed the draft Activity 1 report and reviewed it with both the Management Committee on July 22 and the Ad Hoc Board/Council Member Advisory Committee on July 28. I reviewed Raftelis’ presentation to the Ad Hoc Committee with our Board on August 19, and proposed six topics as priorities for analysis in Activity 3, which we submitted to Raftelis with our comments on the Activity 1 draft on August 20:

- Groundwater Sustainability Plan – governance  
- Water banking and transfers  
- Water supply reliability/optimization of resources  
- Distribution system operations and maintenance  
- Administrative functions (HR, Finance, Purchasing, IT)  
- Customer service operations/conservation programs  

Raftelis collected similar input from the other participants, and the compiled list of priority topics will be provided at the Board meeting.

With respect to the discussions about merger with Sacramento Suburban Water District, both agencies created a new 2x2 ad hoc committee which met four times during 2018 and 2019. The committee decided to go dormant in August of 2019, to allow the two Districts to focus on the collaboration/integration project.

**POTENTIAL CREATION OF A NEW RETAIL DISTRICT**

Partly as a result of inquiries from some of the District’s customers, members of the Board requested information about the process and potential impacts on our operations of forming a new water district to serve San Juan retail customers. We have consulted with both Sacramento and Placer County LAFCOs, and are collecting further information. However, the basic process is:

- Submit an application to form a new district (this could be either via a petition of at least 25% of the registered voters in the retail area, or via resolution from the District)
- LAFCO conducts a hearing to consider the application
- If there are protests, a special election will be held (to be paid for by either proponents via the signature process or by the District via the resolution process)

As part of the application process, both a CEQA analysis and a financial analysis would need to be completed. The financial analysis would need to evaluate how the current retail functions would be conducted by the new agency (or pursuant to a contract between the new agency and the District). An organization chart of the district staff which shows how time and costs are allocated to either retail or wholesale funds is included as Attachment 2.

If the District opposes the formation of a new retail water district, the process terminates.

**Conclusion:**
Water sales in the first two months of the fiscal year have been strong, relative to the budget. The budget anticipated a 10% decline in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic but in fact water deliveries for July and August, excluding SSD, are higher this year than last, by 368 acre feet. Actual deliveries exceed the budget by 25%, resulting in a 15.6% increase in revenues.

**ACWA**
- Members converting to virtual events share their experiences and discuss the possibility of retaining elements of virtual engagement after the pandemic shutdown ends.
- ACWA’s Pres. Steve Lamar & V.P., Pam Tobin launches a “Leadership to Leadership” initiative to further engage member agencies and gather their input. This was Pam’s brainchild and it has been rec’d with favorable comments from those attendees. Two meeting a month with members, one in the North and one in the South happened to discuss issues related to water agencies and areas where ACWA can assist.
- This past week a press release and a column from the President and Vice President of ACWA that calls on the state to define hydropower as zero-carbon energy for the energy security of our state went out to local news media.

  ➢ Zoom meeting today to discuss resources that are available to water agencies. ACWA identified resources and supplies, or expertise from other agencies that have weathered the same crises. Cal OES, FEMA, CA State Public Health & Environmental Health and CALWarn.org were identified as resources for water agencies recovering from wildfires.

  ➢ There will be a hearing this Thursday on Sen. Feinstein and Sen. Danes proposed bill addressing wildfires. Senator Feinstein opinion piece in LA Times today on climate change, mentions fire bill with Senator Daines. California’s burning landscape is more proof of climate change [https://edition.pagesuite.com/popovers/dynamic_article_popover.aspx?qui d=58697b28-efe0-4cc5-ae6e-acdb987073d4&v=sdk](https://edition.pagesuite.com/popovers/dynamic_article_popover.aspx?qui d=58697b28-efe0-4cc5-ae6e-acdb987073d4&v=sdk)

  ➢ AB 3030, by Assembly member Ash Kalra (D-San Jose), bill failed. It would have broadened authority for state agencies for managing CA’s Natural resources. It also cited the potential impact on water right other costs could be hundreds of millions of dollars with regards to statutory commitment to CA to protect 30% of its land areas and waters by 2030.

- The Water Supply Subcommittee will meet Wednesday, September 23 at 10:30am (PST). [https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/460384365](https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/460384365)
