XII. Open Session  
XIII. Adjourn  

President Zamorano called the meeting to order at 6:00 p.m.

I. ROLL CALL  
The Board Secretary took a roll call of the Board. The following directors were present in the Boardroom: Ted Costa, Ken Miller, Dan Rich, Pam Tobin and Manuel Zamorano.  

Vice President Costa requested that the Agenda Item VI-2 “Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update” be amended to include “or action”. General Counsel Jones stated that the agenda cannot be amended unless there were new facts that came up since the agenda was posted and suggested that this request wait until the agenda item is discussed.

II. PUBLIC FORUM  
Mr. Gary Dahlbeck addressed the Board and stated that he heard about the merger with Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) and wanted to know if that was true and why the District would want to do that. GM Helliker offered to talk to him after the meeting since his response will be limited. GM Helliker stated that there have been discussions with SSWD since 2011 and a Business Case Analysis (BCA) has been approved by the Boards, which he will report on during his agenda item. GM Helliker stated that the BCA will look at the pros and cons of merging the two agencies and should be completed in about six months.  

Mr. Dahlbeck also voiced concern about subsidizing rate payers and increasing rates in order to fund a Low Income Rate Assistance Program. Ms. Silva responded that staff is investigating a Low Income Rate Assistance Program and will provide more information at the October Board meeting.  

Mr. Tom Gray addressed the Board as a Granite Bay community resident and rate payer. He stated that his interactions with the community lead him to see a concern regarding the SJWD electoral divisions and the proposed merger with SSWD which may result in a reduction of representation for Granite Bay residents. In addition, he asked if Directors Miller and Tobin would advocate for the community of Granite Bay to have its own retail water district. President Zamorano informed Mr. Gray that since this wasn’t on the agenda that there could be no discussion, but if he wanted it to be on a future agenda to let him know. Director Rich commented that this was looked into a few years ago and the analysis showed significant financial implications. GM Helliker commented that he will look for the staff report regarding this and also mentioned that LAFCO is not really interested in increasing the number of water agencies, but quite the opposite.

III. CONSENT CALENDAR  
All items under the Consent Calendar are considered to be routine and are approved by one motion. There was no separate discussion of these items unless a member of the
<!-- Page 7 -->
![September 18, 2024, Board Minutes](https://example.com/image.png)

Board, audience, or staff requested a specific item removed. Consent Calendar item documents are available for review in the Board packet.

Director Tobin requested that Consent Calendar Item 2 be removed from the agenda until she can provide information regarding New Business item #3 “Comments on Brown Act” from the August 29, 2024, Special Board meeting minutes. General Counsel Jones suggested that the Board remove Consent Calendar Item 2 for discussion and vote on the other two Consent Calendar items.

1. **Minutes of the Board of Directors Special Meeting, August 26, 2024 (W & R)**  
   **Recommendation:** Approve draft minutes

2. **Minutes of the Board of Directors Special Meeting, August 29, 2024 (W & R)**  
   **Recommendation:** Approve draft minutes

3. **Tree Pro Tree Services – On-Call Contract (W/R)**  
   **Recommendation:** Authorize the Director of Operations to enter into a 4-year on-call contract with Tree Pro Tree Services, Inc. to provide tree removal and maintenance services

Director Rich moved to approve the Consent Calendar items 1 and 3. President Zamorano seconded the motion, and it carried unanimously.

Director Tobin explained that she wanted Consent Calendar Item 2 pulled since she was not given the opportunity to provide the document that she wanted added to the administrative record. General Counsel Jones stated that she could provide the document. In response to Director Rich’s question, Director Tobin stated that there is nothing incorrect about the minutes of the August 29, 2024; however, what was stated in the meeting was wrong.

Director Rich moved to approve the Minutes of the Board of Directors Special Meeting, August 29, 2024. Director Miller seconded the motion, and it carried unanimously.

IV. **PUBLIC HEARING**

1. **Ordinance No. 24-03 Amending Ordinances 2000 and 5000 (W & R)**

President Zamorano opened the Public Hearing at 6:23 p.m.

The Public Hearing was duly posted and published. There were no formal written or verbal comments received.

Ms. Silva reported that, at the last staff meeting, the Board introduced and waived the first reading of Ordinance 24-03 which amends Ordinances 2000 and 5000.
<!-- Page 8 -->
![September 18, 2024, Board Minutes Page 4](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=September+18,+2024,+Board+Minutes+Page+4)

President Zamorano opened the floor for public comment. In response to Mr. Canfield’s question, Ms. Silva explained that the two ordinances reference the Policies and Procedures Manual, which has since been superseded by the Personnel Manual and therefore needs to be updated.

President Zamorano closed the Public Hearing at 6:26 p.m.

Vice President Costa moved to waive the second reading of Ordinance No. 24-03 and adopt Ordinance No. 24-03 – An Ordinance of the Board of Directors of the San Juan Water District Amending Ordinances 2000 and 5000. Director Tobin seconded the motion, and it carried unanimously.

V. NEW BUSINESS

1. COTP Transmission Capacity Contract (W)  
GM Helliker reviewed the staff report which was provided in the Board packet. He explained that the District purchased 1 MW of transmission capacity in the California-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP) and later leased another 1 MW of capacity from Trinity Public Utilities District. The District’s current lease, now with SMUD, expires at the end of this year and staff is recommending that the District accept the joint offer from the Turlock Irrigation District and City of Roseville to purchase the District’s 1 MW of transmission capacity in the COTP for $150,000 since SMUD is not renewing the lease.

GM Helliker reviewed the District’s cost and revenue from the project, which shows the District’s return on investment of $547,320 should the Board accept the $150,000 offer from the two agencies. President Zamorano commended GM Helliker and Mr. Zlotnick for their work on this and mentioned that he had staff’s analysis of this reviewed by an independent expert who agreed with the analysis and noted that the District is not an electrical company and needs to focus on water. Director Miller commented that it was he and Vice President Costa who were involved in the 1986 decision to be involved with the COTP Project and is happy to hear about the positive financial results and understands that it is now time to move on.

Director Miller moved to accept the joint offer from the Turlock Irrigation District (TID) and the City of Roseville (Roseville) for the purchase of the District’s 1 MW of transmission capacity in the California-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP) for $150,000. Director Rich seconded the motion, and it carried unanimously.

Vice President Costa stated that the District was formed to provide water and power, and voiced concern that staff did not inform the Board regarding their work on the COTP lease. President Zamorano mentioned a discussion he had with the expert he referred staff to regarding this topic and they discussed the possibility of installing inline generators on the pipelines. President Zamorano informed the Board that the expert’s opinion was that it was too costly and that the District has the best prices.

with WAPA for the power. GM Helliker informed the Board that Mr. Barela will be providing more information at the October Board meeting regarding inline generators (turbines).

Mr. Mike McRae addressed the Board (he had technical difficulties, and his connection dropped during the public comment period, so President Zamorano allowed his comment after the next agenda item was completed) and inquired if the transmission line capacity was offered to multiple providers. GM Helliker reported that staff worked with the Transmission Authority of Northern California (TANC) to identify potential interested parties and was directed to the two agencies and there were no other offers.

VI. OLD BUSINESS  

1. Lime Silo Recoating Project (W)  
Mr. Pierson reviewed the staff report which was provided in the Board packet. He explained that the Lime Silo needs to have a second coat of paint applied to protect the structure and additional funds are needed. Therefore, a contract amendment is requested in the amount of $6,554, bringing the total construction budget to $110,456.  

Director Tobin moved to authorize a contract amendment to the construction contract with River City Painting, Inc.. Vice President Costa seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.  

2. Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed the staff report which was provided in the Board packet. His report covered Previously-Banked Water, Additional Funding Request, and Individual Partnerships. He informed the Board that the Groundwater Bank Program Committee met today and discussed previously-banked water. In addition, Paul Selsky, SGA Chair, created an ad hoc committee to discuss this topic and GM Helliker will be meeting with him on Friday to discuss having the meeting open to the public. He noted that there are agencies that want their previously-banked water accounted for in the new water bank.  

GM Helliker reviewed the Sacramento Regional Water Bank funding since 2019 for Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the project. He informed the Board that they want additional funding for Phase 3 of the project in the amount of $629,000. He explained what the funds would be used for, and that the District’s portion of the funding would be approximately $40,000. In addition, he explained that if the District does not contribute then the District will not be part of the deliberations going forward; therefore, he highly recommends that the District continue to participate in the program. In response to Director Rich’s question, GM Helliker informed the Board that the EIR is targeted for completion in the middle of 2025. In response to Director Tobin’s question, Ms. Silva informed the Board that she does have the opportunity to review funding requests with the General Manager and he is correct that there are
<!-- Page 10 -->
![September 18, 2024, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=September+18%2C+2024%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+6)

wholesale funds available to cover this project. Vice President Costa voiced concern that it would be a taking if the agencies were not allowed to show their banked water in the new water bank since they have been banking water and spending funds over many years.

GM Helliker provided an update on the individual partnerships with Fair Oaks, Citrus Heights and Sacramento Suburban Water Districts and Orange Vale Water Company. He explained that since the District is discussing a merger with SSWD, he does not expect to finalize the financial arrangement discussion with SSWD regarding the options prior to finalizing the merger discussions.

The Board discussed groundwater wells including the wholesale customer agency wells and independent District wells. President Zamorano expressed his desire to construct wells within the District boundaries. Director Tobin mentioned that there is funding available for new projects. Director Rich voiced concern on the cost of constructing a new well. Director Miller voiced concern about discussing the construction of a new well while the District is in the process of discussing a merger with an agency that already has over 75 wells. Director Rich commented that the District will need to figure out what the best option is with SSWD whether it’s a merger or a partnership, or if the District should construct its own wells. Director Miller pointed out that there are three Board members who expressed some level of non-support of a merger and he is concerned about moving forward and spending money on a study.

In response to Vice President Costa’s comment about already completing studies with SSWD and that the process has been very slow, GM Helliker pointed out that the District has not completed a Business Case Analysis. Director Tobin commented that it is important for Board members to attend ACWA region events in order to gain information about topics that are relevant to the District, such as the recent Region 5 event which discussed a $600 million new project which obtained federal and state funding to cover the project completely. GM Helliker pointed out that the District is receiving $1.4 million from EPA for the Kokila Reservoir Project, and that there is funding for other projects as long as they are ready to go.

In response to President Zamorano’s comment about delays, GM Helliker pointed out that, for the last two years, he has reported monthly to the Board regarding the discussions between staff and SSWD regarding groundwater production capacity. President Zamorano requested that, at the next Board meeting, the Board discuss hiring a consultant to evaluate the possibility of installing a well. GM Helliker voiced concern that the District would have to spend millions of dollars and spend over ten years to complete a well installation, when an agreement with SSWD would likely be within a year.

Director Tobin mentioned that should the Special District Grant Accessibility Act pass, then special districts will have access to various forms of federal funding. GM Helliker commented that funding is usually at 50% for federal funding and they are

Those proposals will be reviewed by staff prior to interviews on September 30th, with staff’s recommendation to be presented at the Joint Board meeting on October 3rd.

   GM Helliker reported that the State Water Board adopted the Conservation Regulations in July but they have not yet been approved by the Office of Administrative Law. It is expected that the standards will be approved later this month and go into effect in January. The projected reduction in deliveries that the District will have to meet is a minimum of 23% by 2040. He informed the Board that he will review the options to take regarding the Conservation Standards at the next Board meeting.

   GM Helliker reported that Sacramento County announced that they would be reducing their funding for the Water Forum from $800,000 to their proportional share, yet to be determined. He stated that the District and other agencies in Sacramento County will now have the prospect of making up the difference. He commented that the region needs the Water Forum because they are included in the activities that will be funded by the Voluntary Agreement and they do a good job managing the habitat projects and we will benefit from their work.

Mr. Barela reported that over the last year, the Water Treatment Plant operations team conducted multiple manual operations exercises related to emergency response.

He commended the Water Treatment Plant team for their excellent training and gave an extra shout out to Greg Turner, WTP Manager, and Mike Spencer, WTP Chief Operator, and the Board concurred.

4. DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERING SERVICES’ REPORT

**Back to Agenda**  
**AGENDA ITEM III-2**  

**STAFF REPORT**  

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance and Human Resources  
**Date:** October 1, 2024  
**Subject:** Amendment to Board Policy HR-6.1 for Adjustment to Cash In Lieu of Healthcare Stipend

Staff requests a Board motion approving an amendment to section 6.1.15 of Board Policy HR-6.1 Employee Compensation and Benefits.

The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Personnel Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.  

**BACKGROUND**  
On September 13, 2017, the Board approved policy HR-6.1 Employee Compensation and Benefits. Section 6.1.15 of this policy, titled “Cash in Lieu of Medical Insurance”, created a Cash in Lieu of Medical Insurance stipend of $450. Under this policy, any employee who is eligible for coverage under the District's medical plan but can prove they have coverage elsewhere, can elect to NOT be covered by the District’s medical plan and in return receive a monthly stipend of $450. At the time, $450 represented approximately 50% of the monthly premium of the maximum District contribution towards health care insurance for an employee with no spouse or dependents.  

The District’s maximum contribution towards health care insurance is tied to the monthly premium for the Blue Shield Access Plus plan offered through CalPERS. The actual amount depends upon the employee’s spousal and dependent status. For example, if the employee is single, with no dependents, then the maximum contribution is the corresponding rate for “employee only” for the Blue Shield Access Plus plan. If the employee is married, with children, the district’s contribution is tied to the “family” rate for the Blue Shield Access Plus plan.  

Staff is recommending a change to the cash in lieu of medical insurance stipend for two reasons. The first reason is to maintain its relativity to the Blue Shield Access Plus plan premium. The stipend began at 50% of the premium for a single employee. Because the Blue Shield Access Plus plan premium has increased over time, the stipend now only represents 41.79% of the premium for a single employee with no dependents, making it less attractive to employees. Second, since creating the stipend, it has only been utilized by one employee. Creating a stipend with a range to match the employee’s spousal and dependent status may make the stipend more attractive to more employees thereby creating a greater benefit for the employees while decreasing costs for the District.

# HR-6.1 Employee Compensation Policy

## 6.1.1 COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY
It is the intention of the District to recruit and retain talented, results-driven employees to support the District’s mission, values and goals. A compensation program is necessary to provide each employee with fair and equitable compensation for the skills the employee brings to the District and the position in which they serve. In order to provide each employee with fair and equitable compensation, the District has developed a systematic method to establish and maintain a compensation program by defining the process and clarifying the role and responsibility of the General Manager in that process. Pursuant to California Government Code section 61051(d) and 61060(f), the General Manager has the responsibility to determine the compensation of employees subject to approval by the Board as given during the annual budget process.

## 6.1.2 PROCESS
To ensure consistency in setting compensation, it is necessary to compare the District to other survey agencies in the appropriate labor market. In order to achieve that goal, the District will conduct a compensation survey with oversight and approval by the Personnel Committee at regular intervals (approximately every four years or sooner as deemed necessary or as directed by the Board). Following the methodology prescribed below, the standard process will consist of:
- Selection of a study lead (consultant, agency, staff member, etc.);
- Determination of classes to be surveyed (or all as required);
- Prepare survey criteria and contact survey agencies;
- Collect, analyze and determine comparability of survey data; and
- Present recommendations of study lead.
  
Recommendations will be evaluated and implemented at the Board of Directors’ discretion, taking to account the District’s standard methodology criteria as outlined in section 6.1.3.

## 6.1.3 SURVEY AGENCIES
To ensure consistency from one compensation survey to another the District will utilize the following survey agencies:
- Carmichael Water District
- Citrus Heights Water District
- Elk Grove Water District
- Fair Oaks Water District

### 6.1.4 METHODOLOGY
- In order to maintain a fair and equitable compensation program, the District has established a standard methodology to be used in conducting compensation studies. Total compensation program includes: base salary; longevity and other specialized pay (such as, but not limited to auto allowance and incentives); District contribution towards health, dental, or vision insurance(s); and District payment of employee retirement or deferred compensation contribution. In addition, studies may include life insurance, short and long term disability, retirement formula, paid time off (holidays, vacation, sick and administrative leave) and training/educational programs. The total compensation program will be used when comparing the District’s pay level to survey agencies as described below, which may include public and private sector when data is available. The intent of utilizing total compensation is to determine modifications other than salary which may be determined necessary.

- Survey agencies will include those providing similar services of similar size (number of employees, connections, population and budget) or otherwise deemed to be comparable within a radius identified based on position to the extent possible.

- Cost of living differences between surveyed agencies and the Sacramento Metropolitan Area will be evaluated to determine if significant wage differences require an adjustment to the data.

- Upon review of the survey results, the Board will determine the desirable labor market position of the top of the range. The target position will be at least equal to market median as calculated in the survey.

### 6.1.5 AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY
The General Manager (or his/her designee) is responsible for preparing a compensation budget in accordance with this Policy, as well as all applicable District Policies, which will be included as part of the annual budget review process. The General Manager will have the authority to fix and alter employee compensation in accordance with the intent of this policy and within the budgeting guidelines approved by the Board of Directors.

The General Manager may change or alter the compensation budget during the year by either: 1) requesting the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager to make such changes at budget adoption; or 2) submitting an amended compensation budget, explaining reasons and recommendations for the change, and receiving Board approval for the change.

The General Manager will have full operational authority to implement this policy up to the limits of the approved compensation budget, which includes:
- Determining staffing requirements, titles, positions, responsibilities and organization structure. All new positions require Board approval.  

Page 2  
HR-6.1 Employee Compensation Policy  
<!-- Page 18 -->
- Recommending pay/salary ranges and/or total compensation to the Board for approval
- Setting goals and conducting performance reviews.
- Establishing annual pay/salary adjustments, including annual merit increases and cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) in accordance with section 6.1.7 of this policy.
- Implementing and managing Board approved incentive pay programs.
- Creating programs for position upgrades and special assignments.
- Providing pay/salary and benefit benchmarking information and studies for Board review.

The General Manager will ensure the equitable and uniform implementation of this policy including reporting to the Board at least annually, typically during the budget process.

The Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing the compensation budget as part of the District’s annual budget and has the authority to consider, amend as needed, and approve that budget.

### 6.1.6 SALARY RANGES
The District has established pay ranges for the various job classifications. In establishing these ranges, the Board of Directors considered several factors, including the total compensation for similar positions in other comparable agencies, and each position’s level of responsibility, technical qualifications and the relative degree of decision-making. Salary ranges may be changed from time to time by the Board of Directors and in accordance with this policy.

### 6.1.7 MERIT INCREASES
Each position at the District has a salary range. Each salary range allows for placement in the range based on experience and progression through the range based on performance of the employee, at the discretion of the General Manager. When an employee is not at the top of their salary range, they are eligible for consideration of a merit increase. The amount of the merit increase is determined by their manager, in consultation with the General Manager, based on their performance the previous 12 months. Any merit increase applied to an employee’s salary increases the base salary amount for that employee.

Merit increases are provided to eligible employees during the first full pay period in February. Those employees that are paid at the top of their salary range are not eligible for any merit salary increases.

### 6.1.8 ANTI-SPIKING POLICY RELATED TO SALARIES
The intent of the Board of Directors is to reduce the possibility of increasing the retirement liability of the District, as well as forbid the policy of spiking salaries for the purpose of increasing retirement. The Board of Directors recognizes the benefits of allowing the General Manager the authority to award step increases based on actual work performance and merit. The Board further desires to keep employee salaries at pace with inflation.

The assumptions used by CalPERS in calculating the actuarial projections in retirement costs includes a component related to the amount of increase in salary each employee will receive. The assumptions are based on the age of employee, and number of years of service. Each year, the actuarial valuation is.

![Page 4 HR-6.1 Employee Compensation Policy](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Page+4+HR-6.1+Employee+Compensation+Policy)

**6.1.9 COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT**  
The General Manager has the authority to determine the specific advancement within the salary range for each employee, and to determine and award an Annual Cost of Living Adjustment (generally based on the CPI West B/C index) under the condition that the total increase for all employees does not exceed the total assumed increase used by CalPERS. Upon Board approval of the budget, the General Manager has the authority to award a combination of merit and COLA increases within the total amount of the compensation budget. Should the total increase in payroll costs for recommended step increases exceed the estimated assumed merit increase used by CalPERS, the General Manager will obtain Board approval prior to implementation.

Any COLA awarded will be effective as of July 1st of the new fiscal year.

**6.1.10 PUBLIC EMPLOYEES’ RETIREMENT SYSTEM**  
The District is a member of the Public Employees' Retirement System of the State of California (CalPERS) and membership is compulsory for all employees. Full-time employees and those meeting the 1,000-hours per year requirement of CalPERS are covered under CalPERS. This plan requires an employee to make contributions based upon a percentage of their salary depending on their pension tier.

Full vesting occurs after five years of continuous coverage with a CalPERS participating employer; however, a member’s accumulated CalPERS contributions will remain on deposit with CalPERS upon a member’s separation from CalPERS-covered employment, regardless of the member’s years of credited service, until the member requests to withdraw the contributions. In addition, the District contributes a substantial amount to this plan at a rate adjusted annually by CalPERS.

Upon retirement, an employee may elect to convert accumulated sick leave into service credit toward retirement according to the District’s CalPERS contract. An employee may either cash out vested sick leave, as described in Chapter 3, Section 3.10 of the Personnel Manual, or convert it to service credit, but not both.

**Benefit Tiers**  
An employee’s retirement benefit formula depends upon their length of service in CalPERS, as well as the employee’s entry date into CalPERS and hire date with the District, as described below.

**Tier One**  
Employees hired prior to February 14, 2009, are eligible for the 3% at 60 Miscellaneous Retirement Benefit. Final compensation is calculated by utilizing the highest average compensation during any consecutive 12 months of employment.
<!-- Page 20 -->
![HR-6.1 Employee Compensation Policy](https://example.com/image-url)

**Tier Two**  
Employees hired on or after February 14, 2009, and prior to January 1, 2013, are eligible for the 3% at 60 Miscellaneous Retirement Benefit. Employees joining the District on or after January 1, 2013, that were first hired into a CalPERS participating agency, without a break in service of six months or more, are also eligible for the 3% at 60 Miscellaneous Benefit. Final compensation is calculated by utilizing the average full-time pay rate of the employee’s 36 highest consecutive months.

**PEPRA Tier**  
Employees first hired into a CalPERS participating agency on or after January 1, 2013, or those with a break in CalPERS covered service of six months or greater, are eligible for the 2% at 62 Miscellaneous Retirement Benefit, with final compensation calculated by utilizing the average full-time pay rate of the employee’s 36 highest consecutive months.

Detailed provisions of the plan are provided in the District’s contract with CalPERS and in the CalPERS Law. Employees should contact CalPERS at 1-888-CAL-PERS or the internet website at www.CalPERS.ca.gov for more information.

### 6.1.11 INCENTIVE AWARD PROGRAM

**Program Purpose**  
The purpose of this program is to further the District’s ability to attract and retain the services of the most experienced, motivated and capable group of employees, and to award employees for independent and creative ideas and projects that put downward pressure on water rates. Through recruitment and retention of a superior workforce, the District can better serve the interests of its customers, staff and the broader regional community.

This program is available to those employees who exhibit exemplary performance demonstrated through any of the following:

- The achievement of significant cost savings or new/increased revenue generation
- A significant improvement to efficiency
- A significant improvement in safe work practices
- A significant improvement to the District’s operations

It is not the intent of this program to provide awards to employees whose continued and ongoing performance exceeds expectations. General exceptional performance is awarded through merit increases provided in the annual employee evaluation process. The Board intends incentive awards to be considered a one-time recognition of an act of exceptional merit, not as an increase to base salary. This program is funded out of the general salary and benefits annual budget, which is prepared in conformance with the Board’s Compensation Policy.

**Eligible Participants**  
This program is available to full or part-time regular employees who have been with the District for at least one year. The General Manager operates under a contract and is considered separately from this policy.
<!-- Page 21 -->
![Page 6 HR-6.1 Employee Compensation Policy](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Page+6+HR-6.1+Employee+Compensation+Policy)

**Award Amount and Timing and Process**  
The incentive award will be a fixed amount up to $10,000 per award (subject to budget). Awards should be given as soon as possible after the event warranting the award. At the end of each calendar year, the General Manager will review the awards given and determine if additional awards are merited. Nothing in this policy guarantees that the General Manager will expend any portion of the budget for employee incentive awards or that any employee will receive an award.

**Process for Determining Award**  
Managers may recommend an employee for an award at any time. The recommendation should include a detailed description of the basis for the award and a recommended amount. The General Manager will review the recommendation, and either approve, amend or deny the award. In reviewing recommendations, the General Manager will consider the merits of the recommendation, the amount available within the budget, and the overall distribution of awards between management and non-management staff.

**Payment of Award**  
Performance incentives, when awarded, shall be paid in one installment on either the next available payroll or in February in conjunction with the annual performance evaluation process.

**6.1.12 UNIFORM ALLOWANCE**  
Certain positions, described further in Chapter 5.7 of the Personnel Manual, are required to wear district uniforms. Uniforms will be issued on an “as needed” basis during each fiscal year, not to exceed an annual value of $1,000. The value of the uniforms provided is reported to CalPERS as compensation subject to retirement contributions for employees in classic retirement tiers (not PEPRA). The General Manager has the authority to set or change uniform requirements including brand, quantity, clothing type for each employee as long as the total annual value per employee does not exceed $1,000 (excluding safety items).

**6.1.13 GENERAL INSURANCE**  
The District provides a wide variety of insurance coverage. It is the employee's responsibility to fill out claim forms and submit them for processing.

The District may delete or change employee insurance and other benefits with or without amending this manual, and with or without notice to employees. The specific terms of the District insurance benefits are set forth in various insurance policy and plan documents. This chapter summarizes the key benefits. In the event of any conflict between this chapter and a policy or plan document, the policy or plan document shall govern.

**6.1.14 GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE**  
Full-time regular employees and their eligible dependents, as defined by CalPERS, are covered under the health insurance plan of their choice from among those offered by CalPERS. Coverage generally begins on the first day of the month following the date of hire. If a new employee is already covered by a CalPERS health plan that plan will likely provide coverage through the month following separation from
<!-- Page 22 -->
![HR-6.1 Employee Compensation Policy](https://example.com/image-url)

the previous employer, resulting in continuous coverage between the former employer and hire with the District. Effective January 1, 2020, the District’s contribution is capped at the “Blue Shield Access Plus” rate for CalPERS Region 1. The District will contribute an amount equal to the premium for Blue Shield Access Plus Region 1 for each eligible employee, spouse and any dependents. For example, a single employee, with no children would receive a District contribution towards health care up to the amount of the Blue Shield Access Plan premium for “employee only”. If that employee marries, they would receive a District contribution towards health care up to the amount of the Blue Shield Access Plan premium for “employee plus spouse”. The specific terms, scope and limitations of the coverage are set forth in the insurance plan documents that are available for review by employees at the District’s Finance Department.

It is mandatory that each employee notify the District whenever any additions or deletions occur in their dependent status. Employees are also subject to the eligibility requirements, timing and deadlines determined by the health insurance provider.

Under federal law, if an employee's group health benefits end due to specified qualifying events, the employee or dependent may elect to continue coverage under the District's health plan for a limited period and at the employee's or dependent's expense. A qualifying event is any of the following:

For an employee:
- Termination of employment (other than for gross misconduct) or reduction of hours worked so as to render the employee ineligible for coverage.

For dependents:
- Death of the employee;
- Divorce or legal separation;
- Loss of coverage due to the employee becoming eligible for Medicare;
- For a dependent child, ceasing to qualify as a dependent under the Plan.

Employees and dependents who qualify and wish to continue their coverage will receive notification of their rights and will receive the necessary information and forms to initiate the conversion process.

### 6.1.15 CASH IN LIEU OF MEDICAL INSURANCE
An employee who is eligible for coverage under the District’s medical plan specified in Section 6.1.8, but who is covered by another medical plan, may elect not to be covered by the District’s medical plan by furnishing the District with proof of such medical coverage and by signing a waiver of benefits. In return for not contributing for an employee’s medical coverage, the District shall pay the employee $450 per month, 50% of the maximum amount the District would otherwise pay for their health care coverage (spread over 24 pay periods). If the employee later elects to reinstate under the District’s medical plan, these payments will terminate. Employees may make the coverage election only upon initial hire, annually during CalPERS open enrollment, or in the event of a qualifying event (as defined by CalPERS).

### 6.1.16 POST-RETIREMENT HEALTH
Full-time regular employees who retire from the District remain covered under a health insurance plan of their choice from among those offered by CalPERS, provided that CalPERS’ guidelines are met. In
<!-- Page 23 -->
![HR-6.1 Employee Compensation Policy](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=HR-6.1+Employee+Compensation+Policy)

**accordance with the policy adopted by the Board effective as of February 14, 2009, employees are divided into two tiers for purposes of District-paid retiree health benefits premium payments: (1) those hired prior to February 1, 2009, are in the First Tier; and (2) those hired on or after February 1, 2009, are in the Second Tier. Benefits under the two tiers are:**

**First Tier (hired prior to February 1, 2009)**  
Employees in the First Tier vest after five years of service in the District’s payment of 100 percent of the District’s current contribution amount (as defined in Section 6.1.8 - Group Health Insurance) toward post-retirement health insurance benefits under the plans offered by CalPERS. To receive this benefit, an eligible employee must formally retire through CalPERS within 120 days of separating from employment with the San Juan Water District. Any future changes to the amount of the District’s contribution for active employees would apply to retired employees receiving the First Tier benefit. The District may, once each year without discrimination, allow employees who are covered under the First Tier to elect to be subject to the provisions of the Second Tier. The District must notify CalPERS which employees made that election.

**Second Tier (Hired on or after February 1, 2009)**  
Employees in the Second Tier, who have worked for the San Juan Water District for at least five years, will vest in an entitlement to District-paid health benefits premiums for CalPERS-sponsored health plans in an amount computed using the 100/90 method as described in Government Code Section 22893 and in accordance with the following vesting schedule:

| Years of Service in CalPERS | Percentage of Contribution |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Less than 10                 | 0%                        |
| 10                           | 50%                       |
| 11                           | 55%                       |
| 12                           | 60%                       |
| 13                           | 65%                       |
| 14                           | 70%                       |
| 15                           | 75%                       |
| 16                           | 80%                       |
| 17                           | 85%                       |
| 18                           | 90%                       |
| 19                           | 95%                       |
| 20                           | 100%                      |

To receive this benefit, an eligible employee must formally retire through CalPERS within 120 days of separating from employment with the District. However, if an employee in Tier 2 has 20 years of service with the District, they are entitled to the full benefit whether they retire from the District or from any other entity, public or private, unless another entity offers a richer benefit than the District’s, in which case the employee may be eligible for that benefit. See Government Code Section 22893 for further clarification and exceptions.

The District pays 100% of the employee premium for this coverage and 75% of the premium for eligible dependents. Eligible dependents are spouses, domestic partners, dependent children under age 26, and other dependents as required by state or federal law. An employee with dependent coverage contributes the remaining 25% of the premium for their dependents through payroll deductions.

The District pays 100% of the premium for full-time regular employees and their eligible dependents.

## 6.1.19 GROUP LIFE INSURANCE
Full-time regular employees are covered by group life insurance in the amount of one-times annual salary or wages. The specific terms, scope and limitations of the coverage are set forth in the insurance plan documents that are available for review at the District’s Finance Department.

## 6.1.20 EMPLOYEE-PAID INSURANCE
Supplemental insurance may be available to full-time regular employees. Premiums are paid by employees through payroll deductions. See the Director of Finance/Human Resources for more details.

## 6.1.21 DISABILITY
Full-time regular employees are covered by short-term and long-term disability insurance. Premiums are paid by the District. The specific terms, scope and limitations of the coverage are set forth in the insurance plan documents that are available for review by employees at the District’s Finance Department.

Short-term and long-term disability coverages provide weekly benefits to partially replace lost income for employees who are unable to work as the result of a disability. The nature of the disability can be injury or illness and can be work-related or non-work-related.

Physician certification is required to apply for disability benefits. While receiving disability benefits, employee leave accruals are discontinued, except to the extent the employee is integrating leave balances to augment disability payments. Safety Days earned by full or part-time regular employees will be prorated for an employee who is out on disability based upon the amount of time they worked during the Safety Day accrual period. Any Floating Holidays granted while the employee is on leave will be added to their leave bank upon their return. The District will continue to pay health and dental.
<!-- Page 25 -->
![Page 10 HR-6.1 Employee Compensation Policy](https://example.com/image-url)

**6.1.22 WORKERS’ COMPENSATION INSURANCE**  
It is the employee's responsibility to report immediately to their Department Manager any work-related injuries or illness, regardless of severity.

This coverage protects employees if injured or disabled on the job. It also provides medical, surgical, and hospital treatment in addition to payment for a portion of lost earnings that result from work-related injuries. Compensation payments begin from the first day of employee’s hospitalization or after the third day following the injury if employee is not hospitalized. The cost of this coverage is completely paid for by the District. Time spent going to the District’s current District Workers Compensation Provider for immediate/initial treatment, up to the end of the employee’s regular work day, should be reported and paid as regular time worked. However, accumulated sick, vacation or other earned time-off will need to be used for the three-day waiting period to bring the employee’s compensation up to, but not greater than, the employee’s regular gross pay. Disability benefits may be able to be coordinated with workers’ compensation benefits, depending on the determination of both the disability and workers’ compensation insurance providers. Employees needing follow-up medical appointments will be charged the time-off from their accumulated sick or vacation leave. Any repayment of benefits will require reimbursement to the District.

Employees may choose to integrate their leave balances with their workers’ compensation benefit, to bring compensation to 100%. While out on workers’ compensation leave, health, dental and vision will continue to be paid for up to one year, as if the employee were working. Sick and vacation leave time will accrue for 90 days. Beyond 90 days, leave will accrue in proportion to the amount the employee is using leave balances to augment the workers’ compensation insurance. Any Floating Holidays granted while the employee is on leave will be added to their leave bank upon their return.

Questions regarding workers' compensation coverage should be directed to the Director of Finance.

**6.1.23 UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE**  
Unemployment insurance coverage may be available to employees in the event of separation or layoff from employment with the District. To apply for benefits or to determine eligibility, employees should contact their nearest Employment Development Department Office.

**6.1.24 EDUCATION PROGRAM**  
The District encourages employees to participate in educational and training activities. In addition to increasing employee job proficiency, this education should improve work force stability and the District's ability to attract and retain outstanding employees. The education program is available to all employees after the six-month probationary period has been completed.

**On-Duty Education**  
Employees may, with prior approval, attend seminars, conferences, workshops, cross-training activities or meetings that provide specific training in subjects related directly to water operations, to the employee's position, or to one they may reasonably aspire to, and that will provide benefit to the District.

All departments will annually review and identify areas of training required to maintain employees’ technical and administrative capabilities. Specific schools, conferences and/or seminars are to be listed on budget submission requests wherever applicable and available. The District will pay all fees, tuition and expenses for approved training. Supervisor and/or Department Manager approval for all requests for this training must be obtained prior to enrollment.

**Off-Duty Education**  
Educational assistance is available to employees who desire to obtain skills and/or knowledge that enables them to become more proficient in their present duties and/or prepare them for future assignments. Assistance for off-duty educational expenses is at the discretion of the General Manager and subject to availability of budgeted funds.

This education may occur after regular working hours at a college, vocational trade school or through a self-study correspondence course, which leads to a certificate, license or diploma related to the functions of the District.

Under special circumstances, employees may attend classes during business hours if (1) the course is not available (and will not be) at night or through a correspondence course, (2) the course pertains to a District-approved degree program, and (3) the employee arranges a flexible time schedule with their supervisor to make up time spent in class during normal work hours.

**Eligibility for Off-Duty Education Assistance**  
Only full-time regular employees, who are performing their jobs satisfactorily, are eligible for this program.

The following off-duty education may qualify for financial assistance:

A. Post-secondary Degree (Associates, Bachelors, Masters, other as approved).

C. Any District financial support under this provision shall be implemented by a contract between the District and employee.

D. Completion of the course with a minimum final grade of “B” or equivalent.

E. Funds received from outside sources, such as scholarships or Veteran's Education Benefits, must be applied to the cost of the program first. Then, the remaining cost, up to the maximum available, will be eligible for payment by the District.

F. Total financial assistance for Degree programs require a commitment by the employee to continue District employment for a minimum of three years following completion of the program.

If the employee leaves the District after two years, but less than three years following completion of the degree requirements, financial assistance from the District will be one-half of the cost of the degree program, with the remaining one-half the employee's responsibility. If the District has already paid the full amount, the employee will be required to re-pay the District for their half of the expense.

If the employee leaves the District less than two years following completion of the degree requirements, the employee is responsible to reimburse the District in full for its financial assistance toward the cost of the degree program.

G. Unless arrangements have been made to pay the costs directly to the school, the assistance check is issued to the employee after they furnish evidence of expenses incurred (i.e., receipts, canceled checks, etc.).

H. The employee will furnish the District proof of their successful completion of the course, and final grade, as soon as possible after the end of the class. Reimbursement for subsequent enrollment requires evidence of grade B or better on previously reimbursed courses.

**Procedure**

The Degree program is approved by the General Manager on a case-by-case basis. Employees desiring to obtain a degree should submit their written request stating goals and objectives, institution that they plan to attend and schedule of estimated expenditures via their Department Manager to the General Manager. If approved, the District’s financial assistance may be used only to pay for tuition, books, fees and parking.

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tony Barela, Director of Operations  
**Date:** October 16, 2024  
**Subject:** ACWA JPIA’s Commitment to Excellence (W & R)  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to approve the signing of the ACWA Joint Power Insurance Authority’s (JPIA) Commitment to Excellence (C2E) certification (See Attachment 1), denoting San Juan Water District’s (SJWD) commitment to safety and operational “best practices” to enhance the District’s existing loss reduction programs. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Engineering Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
Since the most frequent and costly losses come from incidents associated with operating vehicles, infrastructure failures, construction activities, employment practices, workplace ergonomics, tripping or falling hazards, and wildfires, the JPIA is encouraging members to implement programs and practices that can reduce these types of risks. The JPIA Commitment to Excellence Program (C2E) is a partnership effort to meet that goal by helping members reduce the frequency and severity of liability, workers’ compensation, and property losses. JPIA provides this program and additional resources to member agencies to help them establish policies and protocols to maximize safety on the job.

The ACWA JPIA Commitment to Excellence Best Practices has been developed for each loss reduction category. Included are loss reduction focus elements, “best practices menus”, and explanations for each menu item. Best Practices are reviewed with member districts during risk assessment visits and discussed in the JPIASource newsletter. JPIA members can select from the menu of best practices items they wish add or enhance to their existing loss reduction programs.

The District’s current safety and risk management program is robust and meets or exceeds the requirements of the C2E program (see Attachment 2). The signed certification by the Board of Directors demonstrates their support and commitment to staff in our work to implement the best practices in the program, which will help to reduce losses. By signing this commitment certification, the District will also qualify to apply for grants through the JPIA’s Risk Control Grant Program. Staff recommends that the Board sign the commitment certification to quantify this support.

**STAFF REPORT**  

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Greg Zlotnick, Water Resources Manager  
**Date:** October 16, 2024  
**Subject:** Potential San Juan Retail Groundwater Well  

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Continue to pursue partnerships with neighboring agencies (including Wholesale Customer Agencies) to expand groundwater banking/transfer activities and to improve dry year reliability. Only if such partnerships do not bear fruit should San Juan Retail pursue its own groundwater facilities.  

**CURRENT ACTIVITIES**  
It is premature for San Juan Retail (or Wholesale) to expend staff or monetary resources to consider pursuing a groundwater well project on its own until a determination is made relative to San Juan’s potential combination with Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD). If a combination occurs, the merged organization will have more than enough groundwater wells to optimize conjunctive use and groundwater banking opportunities.  

If a combination does not occur, Staff recommend continuing to pursue a groundwater banking partnership with SSWD, who have been most receptive to our overtures. We have collaborated with SSWD in evaluating three alternatives for such a partnership - San Juan buying part of a well or wells owned by SSWD, San Juan buying capacity in SSWD’s groundwater production, or San Juan buying produced groundwater from SSWD – and we are close to having a draft document on joint financial arrangements.  

Alternatively (or contemporaneously), San Juan could continue to pursue groundwater banking partnerships with its Wholesale Customer Agencies - Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD), Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD), and Orange Vale Water Company (OVWC).  

This would include San Juan Staff and our federal advocates collaborating with partners in seeking any applicable Grant, Low-Interest Loan, or “Earmark” funding for a partnership project.

# Staff Report – San Juan Groundwater Well
**October 16, 2024**

## CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO SAN JUAN DEVELOPING A GROUNDWATER WELL

### STATED REASONS FOR SAN JUAN RETAIL TO DEVELOP A WELL

San Juan Board members have indicated various reasons for desiring Staff to potentially pursue development of a groundwater well by San Juan Retail: including (1) the “need” to use all of our water; (2) the desire to bank water for future sale; and (3) to increase dry year reliability.

With regard to all three of these expressed concerns, San Juan has already addressed or is continuing to address them and does not need a groundwater well of its own to do so.

### USE OF SAN JUAN’S AVAILABLE WATER SUPPLIES

San Juan strives to use all of its pre-1914 and/or post-1914 water right water at least every three years, though the legal standard for maintaining those rights is to report total use at least every five years. Even were San Juan not to report full use of its water rights once every five years, no change would happen to those water rights unless and until the State Water Resources Control Board conducted a proceeding to reduce or eliminate them. Such proceedings would be highly unlikely to occur and generally take many years to complete.

San Juan has notified the Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) that we are reducing our take-or-pay obligation for our PCWA contract water from 12,500 acre-feet (AF) to 10,000 AF, which augments a prior reduction from 25,000 AF to 12,500 AF in 2017. The recent average annual demand in San Juan’s Placer County service area has been about 9,100 AF.

San Juan did not need to, nor did it, use any of its Central Valley Project (CVP) supplies for many years, presumably to maximize the use of PCWA take-or-pay water. Over the last two years, however, we have been able to take CVP supplies to build up our “historic use” to provide the basis for being able to receive CVP supplies under Reclamation’s “shortage policy” in future dry years to bolster dry year reliability. We plan to buy CVP water in the next “unconstrained” year as well, to increase the CVP’s supply calculation that would apply the next time deliveries to San Juan are subject to the shortage policy.

### BANKING AND TRANSFERS

San Juan has already partnered with SSWD in groundwater banking by selling to SSWD surface water which it has used instead of pumping groundwater, thus resulting in in-lieu banking and credits to its Sacramento Groundwater Authority (SGA) Water Accounting Framework (WAF) balance. These sales in recent years, importantly, have also established a baseline for San Juan and SSWD to partner on market-rate groundwater substitution transfers in the future. This baseline will also be the foundation of the groundwater substitution transfers that SSWD and San Juan have committed to provide for the Voluntary Agreement/Healthy Rivers and Landscapes Program. With the pending agreement with SSWD to expand our partnership in groundwater banking.
<!-- Page 44 -->
![Staff Report – San Juan Groundwater Well](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Staff+Report+%E2%80%93+San+Juan+Groundwater+Well)

**Staff Report – San Juan Groundwater Well**  
**October 16, 2024**  
p. 3

activities, San Juan will have the opportunity to secure a dedicated amount of groundwater, for its use for transfers or backup water supplies. The latter would be delivered via the Antelope Pump Station (and could also include supplies that were banked on behalf of OVWC and Folsom).

Once the Sacramento Regional Water Bank is federally acknowledged, San Juan will be able to utilize more of its available CVP supplies by partnering with SSWD to bank this water in SSWD’s service area, which will result in a WAF balance for San Juan. San Juan can bank CVP water in the wholesale service area now, and we have tried to develop agreements to do so with CHWD and FOWD, but those discussions have yet to bear fruit. Staff will be discussing a potential well partnership with OVWC once it completes its current well project.

**DRY YEAR RELIABILITY**

San Juan’s surface water supplies are quite reliable, due to its settlement agreement with Reclamation for uninterrupted delivery of our full 33,000 AF of water right water. This source could probably meet all of San Juan Wholesale’s demands during drought years, even without taking delivery of PCWA water, which has never been withheld. Moreover, per the terms of San Juan’s contract with PCWA, if such a severe shortage were to occur that PCWA would not be able to deliver San Juan’s entitlement, PCWA would still deliver a proportional amount of its available water for use in San Juan Retail’s Placer County service area.

Another factor impacting demands generally, which will also reduce dry year demands when further reductions in use may be necessary, is the implementation of the State’s new urban conservation regulations. San Juan Retail is facing required delivery reductions by 2040 (which are expected to be accommodated via customers reducing outdoor usage) of either at least 23%, or alternatively about 1% if the current regulation’s requirements related to outdoor use are overturned through legal action – a scenario that would not be known for a few years at least. The Wholesale Customer Agencies are also confronting similar mandated reductions in demand because of the new water conservation regulations, which will in turn contribute to reduced San Juan Wholesale demands (CHWD – at least 13%, FOWD – at least 31%, Folsom – at least 33% and OVWC – at least 6%).

Notably, too, the San Juan Consortium’s currently proposed Purveyor Specific Agreement regarding dry year actions, pursuant to the updated Sacramento Water Forum Agreement now being developed, commits San Juan Consortium agencies to limit surface water diversions in the driest years to an amount below the 33,000 AF total of our water right water.
<!-- Page 45 -->
![Staff Report – San Juan Groundwater Well](https://example.com/image.png)

**Staff Report – San Juan Groundwater Well**  
October 16, 2024  

The only scenario that really threatens San Juan Wholesale’s access to its surface water supplies is the possibility of the intake at Folsom Dam failing or going dry. Staff has already been developing plans to address that situation with Folsom and Roseville, in collaboration with Reclamation.

**COSTS**  

While San Juan’s wholesale master plan consultants estimated the costs of putting in a well to be $4-5M a couple of years ago, the more recent experience of SSWD is that wells cost $8-9M to plan and construct. However, there is no generic, one-size-fits-all cost estimate for pursuing a well project. Each such project is as unique as the aquifer into which the well may be drilled.

Nevertheless, according to consultants with expertise in groundwater well planning, property identification, assessments, modeling, and installation, initial immediate costs would likely range from about $200,000 – $250,000. Once groundwater modeling is carried out and hydrogeological analyses are completed (which may or may not be covered by that initial cost figure), if a promising test well site is identified, the cost of installing and operating a test well is approximately $300,000. Consequently, it is probably a $500-600,000 decision simply to identify and test a site that could be a possible location for a groundwater well.

Moreover, if San Juan ultimately decides to own and operate a groundwater well for municipal water supply purposes, then additional staff would also need to be hired since we currently have not staff with the knowledge and ability to operate and maintain a groundwater well, nor to carry out the regulatory monitoring and reporting that would be required.

The Board has authorized $5M in the San Juan Retail budget to use in developing groundwater capacity, either ourselves or in partnership with another agency. This $5M is specified as future debt to be issued, to pay for groundwater production capacity or supplies. Based on a 30-year repayment period and a range of interest rates between 2% and 4%, the total cost of this debt would range from $6.7-8.7M. For a similar repayment timeframe and range of interest rates for a debt issuance of $8M, the total cost would be $10.7 – 13.9M.

To address the question of potential revenues from groundwater substitution transfers that could be accommodated by a San Juan-owned well, we estimated that the average price for such transfers would be $600/AF (the average of the payments from our 2018 and 2022 transfers), from which the cost of producing the water from the well would have to be subtracted, which we estimate to be $100/AF. We estimate that transfers might occur in about 1/3 of the years in the 30-year loan amortization period, and that, during a transfer window of July through September, a well that has a capacity of 1,500 gallons per minute could produce approximately 600 AF. Adding in a streamflow depletion factor of 10% (the approximate average of the factors in 2018 and 2022), the total volume of water transferred for the 10 of 30 years estimated would be 5,400 AF, which would fetch a total of $2.7M at the net price of $500/AF. This level of revenue would not offset the installation cost of the well. In addition, costs associated with the

necessary hiring of additional staff, as well as carrying out the ongoing operational and reporting requirements, would further reduce the return on investment.

**LOANS, GRANTS AND “EARMARKS”**

There are a number of avenues to secure funding support for pursuing development and installation of a groundwater well. However, all of them would not result in funds being available for at least a year, and more likely two to three years at best, with all avenues requiring an upfront investment of staff time and potentially consultant fees.

As the Board is aware, San Juan was successful in its application to receive an invitation to apply for the EPA’s WIFIA (Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act) low interest financing for the Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project, but for various reasons chose to pursue, successfully, a California State Revolving Fund (SRF) low interest loan from the State Water Resources Control Board. These same sources of low interest loan funds are available to seek for a groundwater well project as well. WIFIA can provide a loan for up to 49% of the project cost, while the SRF can provide low interest loan funding for up to 100% of the total project cost.

There are no State grant programs at this time applicable to San Juan’s potential pursuit of installing a groundwater well. Should Proposition 4 pass in November, State funds may become available to seek.

The following information regarding potential federal funding was provided by our federal advocates, The Ferguson Group (TFG). TFG would support San Juan in any effort to secure funds from the following potential sources.

October 16, 2024  

Reclamation’s WaterSMART program has three potential grant programs that could be applicable to a well project if San Juan decided to pursue one:

1. **Drought Response Program Drought Resiliency Project Grants.** The FY 2026 solicitation will come out next summer. The non-federal cost-share is 50% of the total project cost.

2. **Planning and Project Design Grants.** Reclamation is expected to release the FY 2025 applications in July. This program can only be used for planning and design purposes. The non-federal cost share is 50% of total project cost.

3. **Small Surface Water and Groundwater Storage Projects.** The second round of FY 2025 has an application deadline of July 15, 2025. However, all project applicants must submit an approved feasibility study to Reclamation before applying. The applicable feasibility study would have to be approved by the Board and submitted to Reclamation by April 30, 2025. The non-federal cost share is 75% of total project cost.

There are three sources of “earmarks”. Each of these would require a Congressional sponsor and legislative approval.

1. **EPA’s State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) Program** – This account provides grant-like funding for any project eligible to receive funding under the State SRF program. The non-federal cost share is typically 20% of total project costs. San Juan helped OWVC secure STAG funding in the current Congressional session, as well as receiving our own $1.25M in STAG funding for the Kokila Reservoir Replacement Project.

2. **Reclamation’s Water and Related Resources Program** – This account funds water supply projects. It would be a stretch for a San Juan well project to qualify, but it may be worth exploring.

3. **United States Army Corps of Engineers (COE) Environmental Infrastructure (EI) Authorities -- Sacramento Area Section 219 Account and EI Programmatic Funding.** These two COE accounts could provide up to 75% federal share funding for design and construction of a groundwater well project. The Section 219 account was the source of funding for the current OWVC well project earmarks. However, there is no guarantee of ongoing funding year-to-year as there is for COE civil works projects. Also, so long as the amount of funding previously authorized under these accounts has not been exhausted, there is no need to get a specific project authorization in a Water Resources Development Act Bill. However, a specific project appropriation is required in an Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. For either of these to occur, a Congressional sponsor is required.

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** October 16, 2024  
**Subject:** Proposition 4  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Approve a Board position  

**BACKGROUND**  
Proposition 4 would authorize $10 billion in debt to spend on environmental and climate projects, with the biggest chunk, $1.9 billion, for drinking water improvements. The bond prioritizes lower-income communities, and those most vulnerable to climate change, and requires annual audits. Repaying the money could cost $400 million a year over 40 years, a legislative analysis said, meaning taxpayers could spend $16 billion.

Environmental groups and renewable energy advocates have been clamoring for increased spending on climate change and the environment in recent years, particularly after Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Legislature approved a $54.3 billion spending package called the “California Climate Commitment” in 2022, only to scale it back to $44.6 billion this budget-plagued year.

About $3.8 billion would be spent on water projects — half to improve water quality, the remainder on protecting the state from floods and droughts, and other activities, including restoring rivers and lakes. The rest of the money would be spent on: wildfire and extreme heat projects, $1.95 billion; natural lands, parks and wildlife projects, $1.9 billion; coastal lands, bays and ocean protection, $1.2 billion; clean energy projects, $850 million; agricultural projects, $300 million. See Attachment A for more details on the water funds relevant to us, and on wildfire and extreme heat projects.

**Supporters and Arguments**  
Supporters argue that, given the threat the state faces from wildfires, water pollution, and extreme heat, the need for more spending on these issues is “urgent.” Dozens of environmental groups are backing the measure.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance and Human Resources  
**Devon Barrett, Customer Service Manager**  
**Date:** October 16, 2024  
**Subject:** Continued Discussion on Low-Income Rate Assistance Programs  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Receive analysis and provide direction to staff on whether or not to pursue a Low-Income Rate Assistance Program.

**BACKGROUND**  
At the June 26, 2024, Board meeting, Director Miller requested a discussion on Low Income Rate Assistance Programs. After some discussion, the Board directed staff to research available legal funding sources for such a program, and the threshold for “low-income” and to bring the results of the research back for discussion at the August 29, 2024 Board meeting.

After providing the analysis, which is included below, staff was directed to do additional research as follows:

1. Determine and report back on how many low-income census tracts there are in San Juan’s retail service area.
2. Provide more information about the programs operated by water utilities in our region – level of subsidy, who is eligible, and how many accounts participate, along with looking into the CARE program the PG&E utilizes.

Answers to these questions are provided below.

**ANALYSIS**  
Because utilities are vital to public health and safety, some public utilities offer rate assistance programs to low-income households, providing discounted utility services. However, the California Constitution prohibits the use of water rate revenues to fund these programs. Article 13D of the California Constitution, added in 1996 by Proposition 218, states in section 6(2)(b) that:

(1) Revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not exceed the funds required to provide the property related service.  
(2) Revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which the fee or charge was imposed;

**Low Income Rate Assistance Program Staff Report**  
**October 16, 2024**  
p. 2  

(3) The amount of a fee or charge imposed upon any parcel or person as an incident of property ownership shall not exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel.  
(4) No fee or charge may be imposed for a service unless that service is used by, or immediately available to, the owner of the property in question.  
(5) No fee or charge may be imposed for general governmental services.  

In summary, the law requires water rates to be no higher than the cost of providing the service to the property. Utilizing rate revenues to fund low-income rate assistance programs would result in rates that exceed the cost of providing service to any individual property and is therefore unlawful. Consequently, the agencies that provide these programs must find an alternative revenue source to fund them. In a city, the funding usually comes via a transfer of property or sales tax revenues from the General Fund. Those revenues are generally not otherwise used by or available to the water utility fund and are considered legal funding sources for low-income rate assistance programs.

San Juan has two sources of the similar revenue (non-rate revenue) - property taxes and cell tower leases. While these revenue sources are currently considered legal funding sources for a low-income rate assistance program, San Juan’s situation is slightly different from that of a city. This is because unlike a city, San Juan does not have a “General Fund”. Rather, property tax revenues and cell tower leases are deposited directly into the water utility fund where they are used to defray operating and capital costs, thereby lowering rates for all customers. Redirecting these revenues to fund a low-income rate assistance program would create the need for an overall rate increase, as the funds would no longer be available to defray operating and capital expenses. Even without these revenues, customers are still not paying more than the cost of providing the service. However, the fact that these revenues have been used historically to lower rates creates some risk of a potential legal challenge.

Another consideration is how this program would apply to rental properties. It is the property owner’s obligation to provide access to water. As a result, the account is always in the name of the property owner. When the owner requires the tenant to pay the bill, a copy is sent to both the owner and the property address. San Juan frequently doesn’t even know the name of the tenant. The fixed portion of the bill funds the ongoing maintenance and improvements to the system, which benefits the property owner even more. When landlords require their tenants to pay the water bill, they are passing this cost directly on to the tenant, but the property owner continues to receive the benefits associated with a well-maintained drinking water distribution system. If the tenant fails to pay the bill, the charges ultimately end up as a tax lien against the property, and the owner is responsible for payment. If San Juan had provided a discounted rate, due to the low-income status of the tenant, and the tenant doesn’t pay the bill, the property owner, who likely is not low-income, would be the beneficiary of the lower rate.

San Juan’s current revenues from property taxes that are allocated to the retail fund are $1,530,000. The current revenues from cell tower leases are $47,300. The total of these revenue sources is $1,577,300, which is 7.2% of our annual retail revenues. If all these revenue sources...

Funds were used for low-income rate assistance, additional rate revenue of a similar amount would be necessary to offset this funding shortfall, which would represent a one-time rate increase of approximately 9%.

If San Juan were to offer a low-income rate assistance program, it would have to determine several criteria, including the threshold for income eligibility. In looking at similar programs offered in the region, there appear to be two common thresholds used - 200% of the federal poverty level or the income thresholds for eligibility in the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program. The two income thresholds are as follows:

| Federal Income Poverty Level | # Persons in Household | Poverty Threshold | Max Annual Income |
|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1                            | 1                      | $15,060           | $30,120           |

The levels are the same except that the CARE program starts eligibility at a higher income which is the same as 2 times the federal poverty level for a household of two people. Staff is aware of six agencies in the region that offer this program, as follows:

- City of Folsom
- City of Lincoln
- City of Sacramento
- California American Water Company
- Golden State Water Company
- Sacramento County Water Agency

All entities that provide the program have income eligibility tied to either the electric utility rate assistance program offered by either PG&E or SMUD, or the federal poverty level. Except for the City of Folsom, none of San Juan’s Wholesale Customer Agencies offer such a program, nor does the Sacramento Suburban Water District. After the August board meeting, the City of Lincoln cancelled its program. They are no longer accepting new applicants, and the program will end in February 2025 for existing participants. They cite a lack of available funds as the reason for program termination. See the attached matrix for a description of the programs offered by the entities cited above.

According to the census reporter website at Granite Bay, CA - Profile data - Census Reporter, approximately 5% of the population in Granite Bay have incomes below the poverty level. If the threshold for program participation is approximately 2 times the federal poverty level, then it could be that approximately 10% of San Juan customers may qualify.

be eligible for a low-income rate assistance program. If San Juan were to exclude multi-family housing from the program, as most programs do, then the number eligible would likely be considerably lower. Multi-family housing is usually excluded because such facilities are typically served by a master meter, and water bills are typically paid by the property owner and not the tenants. Furthermore, the programs that we examined seem to require the bill to be in the occupant’s name. San Juan already requires bills to be in the property owner’s name. This common restriction would limit participation in the program to owner-occupied, single-family residences that meet the income eligibility criteria. This would significantly reduce the number of customers that would be eligible for such a program.

Another way to estimate potential program participation is to look at the participation rates of the other entities that offer the program. Thus far staff have been able to determine a participation rate of 6.3% in the City of Sacramento, and 1.3% in the City of Folsom. According to the census reporter, there are many low-income census tracts in the City of Sacramento. There is only one in the City of Folsom, but it lies entirely within the City of Folsom and encompasses a population of 4,478 which equates to approximately 1,660 connections. Only one low-income census tract extends into San Juan's retail service area, and this overlay includes just five homes. Therefore, San Juan is likely to experience lower participation than even the City of Folsom. If you assume a 1% participation rate and a 20% discount, that equates to approximately 110 customers and an annual cost of approximately $30,000 which would equate to a rate increase of less than 1%.

Should the Board decide to pursue a low-income rate assistance program staff can draft a program guidelines document and return to the Board for review and approval. This information would need to be included in the Retail Financial Plan and Rate Study, currently underway, to ensure rates are sufficient to meet the operating and capital needs of the retail division.

**Conclusion:**  
Fiscal Year 2024-25 water sales continue to be strong. Sales to all customers except Granite Bay Golf course were greater than anticipated. In total deliveries for July-September were 22.3% higher than our projection. The largest variances came from Fair Oaks Water District who has taken 43% more than expected and the amount of water treated for SSWD, which is consistently budgeted on the low end. As a result, revenues exceed the budget by 17.7% for the period.

**Personnel Committee Meeting Minutes**  
**San Juan Water District**  
**October 1, 2024**  
**4:00 p.m.**

**Committee Members:**  
Ken Miller, Chair  
Ted Costa  

**District Staff:**  
Paul Helliker, General Manager  
Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
Teri Grant, Board Secretary/Administrative Assistant  

**Topics:**  
- Cash in Lieu of Healthcare Benefits (W & R)  
- Other Personnel Matters  
- Public Comment  

1. **Cash in Lieu of Healthcare Benefits (W & R)**  
   Ms. Silva reviewed the staff report which will be included in the Board packet. She explained that, in 2017, the Board adopted a Cash in Lieu of provision in the Employee Compensation and Benefits policy. This benefit paid participating employees $450 in lieu of the District providing healthcare benefits. She explained that only one employee participated in the benefit and staff would like to make this option more attractive to employees by increasing the stipend with a range to match the employee’s spousal and dependent status, thereby creating a greater benefit for the employees while decreasing costs for the District. The Committee discussed the recommendation, and Ms. Silva also informed the Committee that the stipend would be taxable income to the employee.

   The Personnel Committee recommends that the Board approve an amendment to section 6.1.15 of Board Policy HR-6.1 Employee Compensation and Benefits.

2. **Other Personnel Matters**  
   Ms. Silva informed the Committee that staff is working on a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that governs the Water Treatment Plant shift operators. The shift operators currently have an MOU that was signed by Mr. Keith Durkin and the employees; however, CalPERS requires the MOU to be approved by the Board in order for certain compensation to be included in the employee’s pension. The Committee prefers that this topic be reviewed directly by the Board and another Committee meeting is not needed.

   Director Costa requested that the Committee meet later in the year or the beginning of next year to discuss staff's participation in the Hinkle Reservoir Replacement Project. He would like to see if it’s possible to recognize the employees who worked on the project and provide a monetary award.

3. **Public Comment**  
   There were no public comments.

The meeting was adjourned at 4:14 p.m.

She explained that she is still waiting for information from PFM and is not sure if she will have the information in order to be placed on the agenda for the October Board meeting so the report might be delayed until the November Finance Committee meeting.
