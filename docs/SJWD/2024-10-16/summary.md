### Summary of San Juan Water District Board Meeting (October 16, 2024)

- **Key Agenda Items**:

- **Consent Calendar**:
  - Amended [Board Policy HR-6.1](https://www.sjwd.org/) to increase the Cash in Lieu of Healthcare Benefits stipend from $450 to 50% of the maximum premium for medical insurance, addressing the current stipend's coverage of only 41.79%.
  - Authorized a construction contract with NMI Industrial Holdings, Inc. for the Water Treatment Plant Filter Backwash Hood Facilities Rehabilitation Project, totaling $3,341,547.44, with a 10% contingency bringing the total to $3,675,702.18. This project spans two fiscal years (2024/2025 and 2025/2026).
  - Approved a Professional Services Agreement with Alpha CM, Inc. for construction management and inspection services for the same project, amounting to $377,524.00, with a total authorized budget of $415,276.40.
  - Approved the [ACWA Joint Power Insurance Authority](https://www.acwa.com/) Commitment to Excellence certification, qualifying the District for grants through the Risk Control Grant Program.

- **New Business**:
  - Staff reported no feasible locations for hydropower installation within the current system. The only potential site, the Antelope Pressure Reducing Station, does not meet criteria for effective hydropower generation.
  - Recommended waiting for merger discussions with Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) before pursuing groundwater well development, as a merger would provide access to over 75 existing wells.
  - Motion to support Proposition 4, proposing $10 billion in bonds for environmental and climate projects, failed with 2 Ayes (Manuel Zamorano, Pam Tobin) and 3 Noes (Ted Costa, Ken Miller, Dan Rich). Proposition 4 allocates $3.8 billion for water projects.

- **Old Business**:
  - Discussed the feasibility of a Low Income Rate Assistance Program. Only one low-income census tract exists within the District, comprising five homes. Estimated participation is around 1%, equating to approximately 110 customers and an annual cost of about $30,000, resulting in a potential rate increase of less than 1%. The Board directed staff to explore funding sources and program guidelines.

- **Information Items**:
  - General Manager's report confirmed successful completion of the Lead and Copper Rule survey, indicating no lead piping in the water system.

- **Directorsâ€™ Reports**:
  - Updates from committees, including the Sacramento Groundwater Authority and the Regional Water Authority, focused on regional water management and conservation efforts.

- **Closed Session**:
  - Discussed anticipated litigation; no reportable action was taken.

### Conclusion

The San Juan Water District Board meeting addressed critical operational and financial matters, including significant infrastructure projects, hydropower and groundwater resource discussions, and considerations for a low-income assistance program. The meeting emphasized the District's commitment to transparency, community engagement, and effective water resource management.
