I. **ROLL CALL**  
The Board Secretary took a roll call of the Board. The following directors were present in the Boardroom: Ted Costa, Ken Miller, Dan Rich, Pam Tobin and Manuel Zamorano.

II. **PUBLIC FORUM**  
There were no public comments.

III. **CONSENT CALENDAR**  
All items under the Consent Calendar are considered to be routine and are approved by one motion. There was no separate discussion of these items unless a member of the Board, audience, or staff requested a specific item removed. Consent Calendar item documents are available for review in the Board packet.

1. **Minutes of the Board of Directors Meeting, July 17, 2024 (W & R)**  
   **Recommendation:** Approve draft minutes

2. **Treasurer’s Report – Quarter Ending June 30, 2024 (W & R)**  
   **Recommendation:** Receive and file

   Director Rich moved to approve the Consent Calendar. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

IV. **NEW BUSINESS**  

1. **Pump Stations Optimization Evaluation Project (R)**  
   Mr. Pierson reviewed the written staff report from Mr. Tony Barela, which was included in the Board packet. He explained that staff are looking into cost savings which this project will analyze. In response to Vice President Costa’s question, Mr. Pierson explained that even if there is a merger with SSWD, this analysis is for the retail service area pump stations and would still be warranted.

   Director Tobin moved to authorize the Director of Operations to enter into a Professional Services Agreement with Water Systems Consulting, Inc. (WSC) to provide professional engineering services for the Pump Stations Optimization Evaluation Project (Project). Director Rich seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

2. **Low Income Rate Assistance Program (R)**  
   Ms. Silva and Mr. Barrett provided a written staff report which was included in the Board packet. Ms. Silva reviewed the staff report and provided a thorough summary of how to set up such a program, how it might work, and what the financial implications would be. She explained that cities are more capable of providing a rate assistance program because they can utilize general funds which are not subject to Prop. 218 requirements. In addition, she reviewed the issues the District would have with implementing such a program for multi-family dwellings and rental properties.
<!-- Page 7 -->
![August 29, 2024, Board Minutes Page 3](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=August+29%2C+2024%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+3)

Ms. Silva informed the Board that if the District utilized the cell tower lease or property tax revenues, which are not subject to Prop. 218 requirements, then additional rate revenue of a similar amount would be necessary to offset this funding shortfall, which would represent a one-time rate increase of up to 9% to retail service area customers. In addition, she reported that Mr. Mark Hildebrand voiced concern when she discussed this program with him. Mr. Hildebrand mentioned that there might be some legal vulnerability with using these revenues as they have historically been used to keep rates low and may not be in alignment with the intent of Prop. 218.

Sandy Harris addressed the Board and voiced concern that this program could raise customer rates and she would be upset if this were to occur.

Vice President Costa voiced concern that the 1978 ballot measure to collect property tax revenue did not include using the fund for a Low Income Rate Assistance Program. In addition, he would like to know the number of census tracts that are considered low income in the retail service area – Ms. Silva stated she would research and see if that can be determined.

Director Rich asked that staff bring back more information about the programs operated by water utilities in our region – level of subsidy, who is eligible, and how many accounts participate, along with looking into the CARE program at PG&E utilizes; therefore, staff will do further research and bring this topic back to the Board for review.

### 3. Comments on Brown Act (W & R)
Director Rich informed the Board that he requested that this item be on the agenda. He stated that the Board members and staff have been through Brown Act training and are required to comply with the Brown Act. He commented that Director Tobin has indicated that she believes that the Board is not in compliance sometimes and he asked GM Helliker to provide a summary to discuss, as he believes the District is in compliance and would like General Counsel Jones to confirm.

GM Helliker reviewed his written staff report which was included in the Board packet. He stated that he has never violated the Brown Act as alleged by Director Tobin and, as his staff report states, General Counsel Jones agreed that he had not violated the Brown Act. Director Tobin commented that she has proof from Steve LaMar that the Brown Act was violated. In addition, Director Tobin voiced dismay that the staff report was posted in the Board packet on the website and is designed to shift the focus and influence opinions politically against her.

Director Tobin stated that she has 174 pages of documentation from the District’s former counsel that indicated when and how the Brown Act was violated, and she will provide the documentation to Legal Counsel. Director Rich voiced concern that Director Tobin keeps stating that there are serial meetings happening between Board members and the General Manager when they are not happening, and this may harm the public’s perception of the Board. Director Miller would like General Counsel.
<!-- Page 8 -->
![August 29, 2024, Board Minutes Page 4](attachment://image.png)

to qualify the situation as to the Brown Act violations that Director Tobin is accusing people of.

GM Helliker stated that the allegation regarding Steve LaMar was reviewed by Legal Counsel Jones and it was deemed not a Brown Act violation, and that is the point of this item being on the agenda. Director Tobin stated that she was provided more information from Steve LaMar, which she will provide to Legal Counsel, and stated that GM Helliker only provided half-truths. President Zamorano called Director Tobin Out of Order for the language she was using against another person.

Legal Counsel Jones stated that he represents the District and not individuals on the Board or staff. He voiced concern that anything that puts the District at peril, such as a Brown Act violation, he thoroughly investigates and would appreciate Director Tobin providing the information to him and he is willing to consult with Director Tobin’s attorney as well. However, based on the information that he has received thus far, he has not seen violations of the Brown Act. Director Tobin stated that she will provide him with her attorney information and the documentation.

President Zamorano stated that the proper procedure for filing a Brown Act complaint would be with the courts, since it cannot be litigated via the Board. He stated that these complaints need to stop at Board meetings. Director Tobin inquired then if something happens that it should just go directly to litigation, which President Zamorano stated that General Counsel Jones already gave his opinion on this matter and found that no Brown Act violation occurred, so this needs to stop or Director Tobin should take her complaint to the courts for a final decision. General Counsel Jones stated that his role is to provide legal opinions, and if that opinion is not accepted then the complaint can be taken through the judicial system.

Vice President Costa moved to table the matter. The motion failed with no second.

GM Helliker noted that the point of the discussion was to review some examples and reiterate the Brown Act requirements and noted that the allegations from Director Tobin were refuted by General Counsel Jones and did not violate the Brown Act. GM Helliker stated that it would be helpful to him for the Board to stop these allegations. Director Tobin stated that it would be helpful for her to supply the documentation for General Counsel Jones to review and provide his opinion. Director Miller requested that the documentation that Director Tobin supplies be notarized or signed by an individual claiming that all of the facts presented are true and correct.

President Zamorano requested that if anyone have a complaint about an alleged Brown Act violation that they supply the information to General Counsel Jones for review and opinion. If the complainant does not agree with the opinion, then they could take the complaint through the judicial system. Vice President Costa stated the complaint would be filed with the District Attorney.
<!-- Page 9 -->
![Page 5 of Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+5+of+Board+Minutes)

**President Zamorano moved that if someone has a Brown Act complaint about a violation that they provide all the written documentation to General Counsel Jones for review and opinion.**

General Counsel Jones stated, however, that the Board cannot limit anyone from filing a complaint with the District Attorney. Director Miller voiced concern that even if General Counsel Jones provides an opinion, it may not be accepted by the complainant and then the Board would be in the same place as they are right now.

The motion failed with no second.

Vice President Costa moved to table the matter. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it carried with 4 Aye votes and 1 No vote (Director Rich).

**4. Proposed Biological Opinions on CVP Operations (W)**  
GM Helliker conducted a presentation on the Biological Opinions for CVP/SWP Long-Term Operations that is available on the District’s website Board meeting page. He provided a short overview of the work that Reclamation has been doing since the spring of 2022 on a reconsolidation on long-term operations of the CVP and SWP. He explained that Reclamation recently released the EIS for public comment, and NMFS and USFWS will be releasing their draft biological opinions shortly, with a goal of completing the process by the end of the year. He explained that the EIS evaluates four alternatives to the no action alternative and reviewed each alternative. In addition, he noted that none of them are projected to impact the District’s water supplies in any significant way – Reclamation plans to continue to meet the 300,000 AF planning minimum at the end of December every year (with exceptions during extreme drought), and to meet the modified flow management standard for flows in the Lower American River.

**5. Introduction of Ordinance No. 24-03 Amending Ordinances 2000 and 5000 (W & R)**  
Ms. Silva provided a written staff report which was included in the Board packet. She explained that staff are in the process of reviewing the District ordinances for updates and the revisions to Ordinances 2000 and 5000 are basically for housekeeping purposes. She informed the Board that these ordinances make reference to the Policies and Procedures Manual dated May 15, 2002, which has been superseded multiple times, most recently in 2006, then in 2020 by the revamped Personnel Manual. In addition, she reminded the Board that they delegated authority to the General Manager for future amendments of all but two chapters of the Personnel Manual. She explained that Ordinance 5000 needs to be amended to reflect this delegation and retention of authority as well as the topics covered by the two chapters still subject to Board approval.

Vice President Costa moved to waive the first reading of Ordinance No. 24-03 – An Ordinance of the Board of Directors of the San Juan Water District Amending Ordinances 2000 and 5000. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.
<!-- Page 10 -->
V. OLD BUSINESS

1. Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)  
   GM Helliker reported that the discussion at the Water Bank Program Committee meeting was about previously-banked water. Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) was adamant that they spent a lot of money on banked water that should be counted towards their base of banked water, while Placer County and PCWA have stated agencies should not be allowed to count previously-banked water in the expanded Water Bank. The Committee agreed to work with SGA to quantify an appropriate amount of water that has been previously-banked, for use in the expanded Water Bank.

   GM Helliker reported that there have not been further discussions with SSWD regarding groundwater banking since the two agencies are collaborating on the Business Case Analysis, and SSWD and Del Paso Manor Water District (DPMWD) have been discussing a merger as well. In response to Director Tobin’s question regarding DPMWD/SSWD merger, GM Helliker explained that if DPMWD merges with SSWD then DPMWD financial obligations, including any infrastructure investments, would be covered by a special assessment to DPMWD customers. In addition, GM Helliker pointed out that this topic would be covered in the Business Case Analysis.

   In response to Vice President Costa’s comment, GM Helliker explained that the District does not have rights to water in SSWD’s basin and SSWD bought all of their surface supplies for which they have gotten in-lieu recharge credit from either PCWA or us. He noted that the Antelope Pump Station Agreement allows for schemes to pay back or pay for groundwater they deliver, but it includes no commitment for a specific amount of water supply from SSWD, which is why staff is working on a deal to buy capacity or water. In addition, Ms. Silva confirmed that the budget still includes the $5 million the Board authorized, and she reminded the Board that that amount would be funded by debt.

2. 2024 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)  
   GM Helliker reviewed data which included the current reservoir storage levels across the state, data on releases, temperature and precipitation outlooks, and storage levels and projections at Folsom Reservoir. He conducted a presentation that is available on the District’s website Board meeting page. In addition, he reported that a power bypass may be required this fall since temperatures at Watt Avenue have been exceeding the 65-degree requirement.

VI. INFORMATION ITEMS

1. GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT

1.1 General Manager’s Monthly Report (W & R)

1.2 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence  
GM Helliker reported that SB 366 passed both houses (unanimously) and is headed to the Governor for signature. He informed the Board that the bill sets the target of 9 million acre feet of additional water supply reliability, additional storage, groundwater recharge, desalination, and recycling by 2040, and DWR is required by 2028 in the California Water Plan to identify strategies to meet that target.

GM Helliker reported that the District owns a portion of the capacity in the California Oregon Transmission Project and the contract with SMUD ends at the end of this year. He reported that Mr. Zlotnick has been working on this and it will be brought back to the Board at the next meeting for discussion.

She would like to know why the District doesn’t do this as well. In addition, she reported that ACWA sponsored AB 2257, which should help member agencies avoid Prop. 218 lawsuits, is headed to the Governor’s desk.  

Director Tobin reported that she attended the Region 8 meeting where she moderated the discuss panel for Women in Water. In addition, she provided an update from the ACWA Priorities list.

4. CVP WATER USERS ASSOCIATION  
Vice President Costa reported that the CVP Water Users Association meets quarterly.  

5. OTHER REPORTS, CORRESPONDENCE, COMMENTS, IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS  
Director Rich inquired about the printout that Director Tobin provided to them prior to the meeting. General Counsel Jones will discuss the document with Director Tobin to determine what needs to be redacted and requested that the document be returned to Director Tobin. The directors returned the document to Director Tobin.  

Director Costa inquired if the revenue that is received from water transfers could be used for a Low Income Rate Assistance Program. Ms. Silva explained that the water transfers generate wholesale revenue and the program would be a retail program. GM Helliker stated that the District could not use those funds towards the program since it would violate the wholesale water supply agreements.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tony Barela, Director of Operations  
**Date:** September 18, 2024  
**Subject:** Tree Services Contract – Tree Pro Tree Services  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to authorize the Director of Operations to enter into a 4-year on-call service contract for tree removal and maintenance with Tree Pro Tree Services, Inc. (Tree Pro). The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Finance Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
Every year within the Retail and Wholesale Service Areas trees are required to be removed for multiple reasons. Reasons for tree removals may include damaged or fallen trees during storms, root systems invading buried infrastructure, or areas where trees or heavy brush are creating a fire hazard. The current proposal is to enter into a multi-year contract for these services with Tree Pro.

San Juan Water District (District) has worked with Tree Pro in prior years, and they have provided a sound and cost-effective service to the District, following all safety procedures. Tree Pro has obtained a California Multiple Award Schedule (CMAS) contract that allows agencies, such as the District, to use their services without the need for additional competitive bidding. The CMAS program leverages existing contracts that have been negotiated by the federal government or other public agencies, allowing for a simplified procurement process. Suppliers who hold CMAS contracts have met specific qualifications and pricing standards, ensuring that agencies can procure goods and services quickly and cost-effectively. Tree Pro’s CMAS contract is valid through February 10, 2028.

Staff has contacted multiple neighboring agencies currently utilizing the Tree Pro CMAS contract, and all have been pleased with Tree Pro’s service, cost, and safety performance under the CMAS umbrella. Additionally, staff discussed the use of the contract with Ryan Jones, Jones Mayer Law, and he confirmed that the contract is a good vehicle for on-call contracting. Additionally, Ryan confirmed that the District’s current Procurement Policy allows for use of the contract under the “piggyback” clause.

---

**CURRENT STATUS & FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
If approved, Staff will initiate a contract with Tree Pro for on-call services up to February 10, 2028. The estimated annual cost for these services will be included in the approved annual budget.

# AGENDA ITEM V-1

## STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** September 18, 2024  
**Subject:** Sale of 1 MW of Transmission Capacity in the California-Oregon Transmission Project  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Direct staff to accept the joint offer from the Turlock Irrigation District (TID) and the City of Roseville (Roseville) for the purchase of the District’s 1 MW of transmission capacity in the California-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP).

### BACKGROUND
In 1986, San Juan entered into an MOU to purchase 1 MW (0.0625%) of transmission capacity in the COTP (see attached map for the alignment of this high-voltage electrical power transmission system). Its share of construction costs was $288,000. In that same year, San Juan paid Trinity PUD (Trinity) $75,000 for a 40-year lease of another 1 MW of capacity.

Initially, the 1 MW of capacity San Juan secured by paying a share of the COTP construction costs was dedicated to the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) to secure “preferred customer” status and reduced power rates on the energy Reclamation used to pump San Juan’s water from the Hinkle Wye to the water treatment plant.

In 1993, the year the COTP came on-line, San Juan entered into an agreement to lease the 1 MW it had leased from Trinity to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD). Staff has not researched how much San Juan received in payments from SMUD for this 1993 lease through 2004. In 2004, WAPA informed San Juan that that dedication was no longer necessary to maintain “preferred customer” status. Consequently, SMUD and San Juan terminated the 1993 lease and entered into a new lease as of January 1, 2005, for San Juan’s 2 MW of transmission capacity. SMUD paid O&M costs and provided San Juan with an 8% rate of return on its investment.

At some point after 1993, Trinity informed the COTP that it was withdrawing from the project rather than pay its 5 MW share of the construction costs. Trinity’s 5 MW, including the 1 MW leased to San Juan, reverted to the Transmission Authority of Northern California (TANC). TANC honored the lease, and San Juan continued to
<!-- Page 18 -->
![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT+Sale+of+COTP+Transmission+Capacity+Paul+Helliker)

receive payments from SMUD, which will stop at the end of 2024, upon expiration of the lease, and the 1 MW originally leased from Trinity will revert in total to TANC.

## WHAT TO DO WITH SAN JUAN’S 1 MW OF TRANSMISSION CAPACITY?

If San Juan were to keep the capacity, we would have to start paying the increasing O&M costs on the 30-year-old line going forward, which currently runs about $15,000/year.

San Juan could market its 1 MW of transmission capacity on the COTP through the California Independent System Operator, but only if we develop our own Open Access Transmission Tariff and arrange for 3rd party sales, which would be difficult, complicated to establish and would require the identification and ongoing retention of a paid consultant. According to TANC representatives, the experience among its members in pursuing such individual tariffs has not resulted in positive revenue.

Moreover, keeping the transmission asset also means keeping exposure to potential liability for COTP operations, including claims that could be associated with potential wildfires. The COTP’s liability insurance policy currently has a $25,000,000 deductible, of which San Juan’s share would be about $15,000.

We could try to find another leasing partner, but according to TANC representatives, that would be highly unlikely, and if one were found, they would probably not assume O&M obligations, nor accept indemnifying San Juan for any liabilities arising from the operation of the COTP.

## THE OFFER RECEIVED FROM TID/ROSEVILLE

Beginning in 2021, staff began contacting SMUD regarding whether it would be interested in renewing its lease or purchasing San Juan’s 1 MW outright. In February of this year, SMUD informed staff it was not interested in renewing the lease or purchasing the 1 MW of transmission capacity.

Staff informed TANC representatives that San Juan and Carmichael Water District (CWD), which also owns 1 MW of COTP capacity, were looking for partners. After TANC put out the word, in April of this year, TID and Roseville informed staff of their joint interest in the 1 MW and in August they offered $150,000 to purchase San Juan’s capacity, with the same offer being made to CWD for its 1 MW.

## FINANCIALS

- SJWD’s Costs = $363,000 (MW share of COTP development = $288,000; SJWD payment to Trinity for 40-year lease of MW = $75,000).

- SMUD Payments to SJWD under 2005 lease Agreement = $760,320

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT+Sale+of+COTP+Transmission+Capacity+Paul+Helliker)

- Payments to SJWD from SMUD for 1993 lease, through 2004, would add to this figure.
- Value of reduced WAPA energy rates for period 1993 through 2004 unknown.
- Calculated book value of the 1 MW of transmission capacity = $143,321
- TID/Roseville Offer = $150,000
- Net calculable ROI for SJWD = $547,320

Taking into account all of the above, the best course of action is for San Juan to accept the offer of $150,000 from TID/Roseville and acknowledge the over $500,000 in net positive revenue the District will have received from the purchase of the asset almost 40 years ago. Director Zamorano has discussed this offer with his friend who is an expert in the electric power sector, and his recommendation is to take the offer from Roseville and TID.

**Date:** September 18, 2024  
**Subject:** Lime Silo Recoating Project – Construction Contract Amendment  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to approve an authorized construction budget increase of $6,554 to the construction contract with River City Painting, Inc. (RCP) for the Lime Silo Recoating Project.  

**BACKGROUND**  
This project includes all preparations and painting of the interior and exterior of the Water Treatment Plant's Lime Silo. Preparation work began on the Lime Silo in early August 2024. To date, the contractor has completed approximately 90% of the exterior painting. On September 11, 2024, the District performed a painting inspection with its third-party painting inspector. The District, inspector, and contractor noticed several areas where the original paint color was visible through the new paint coating. After reviewing the specifications and confirming with the District third-party inspector, it was confirmed the Contractor met the minimum dry paint thickness and uniformity requirements. In order to achieve more uniformity, better aesthetics, and extend the coating service life, all parties agreed a second coat of paint was warranted. This budget increase includes all material, labor, and equipment to apply a second coat of paint to the entire exterior of the Lime Silo.  

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
The Board authorized a total construction budget of $103,902. Based on the additional work required, a budget increase of $6,554 is necessary, bringing the total construction budget to $110,456. The additional cost is within the FY 2024/2025 Wholesale CIP Budget.

**AGENDA ITEM VI-2**  

**STAFF REPORT**  

To: Board of Directors  
From: Paul Helliker, General Manager  
Greg Zlotnick, Water Resources and Strategic Affairs  
Date: September 18, 2024  
Subject: Groundwater Banking Activities  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Discussion  

**BACKGROUND**  

**Previously-Banked Water**  

As we discussed at the August 29 San Juan Board meeting, the Regional Water Bank Program Committee discussed at its August 21 meeting the issue of how much water that has been accounted as banked in the Sacramento Groundwater Authority’s Water Accounting Framework (WAF) would be included in the baseline amount for the calculations conducted for the Water Bank. Certain Committee members (who are not SGA members), advocated that no previously-banked water be included in the baseline. SSWD and we disagreed, as SSWD has invested a significant amount of their ratepayer dollars in purchasing surface water supplies, which have been accounted as banked in SGA’s WAF. San Juan would rely on those supplies if and when we asked SSWD to deliver pumped groundwater to us through the Antelope Pump Station. Also, without a baseline amount of banked water, any future groundwater substitution transfer opportunities with SSWD would be delayed until they had purchased enough new surface water to establish a balance in the Water Bank’s Water Accounting System in an adequate amount to accommodate the proposed transfer.  

The Program Committee did acknowledge that SGA has the sole authority to decide how the water banked under its WAF should be addressed. We expected that this issue would be discussed among the affected agencies in SGA, which would include Sacramento, Sacramento County, Golden State, Carmichael, Rio Linda (all agencies in the Central Unit to which the WAF applies), as well as CHWD, FOWD, Orangevale and us. The latter group is relevant because CHWD and FOWD have argued that, even though they have not been formally included in the WAF accounting, they should be allocated a certain baseline amount of groundwater in the Water Bank accounting system, because they have been conducting conjunctive use activities for years, and the groundwater basin underlying their service areas is healthy.  

However, we were notified on August 30 that Paul Selsky, SGA’s chair this year, had created an ad hoc committee of SGA Board members to deliberate on this subject. That committee consists of Selsky, Chris Hunley (Sacramento County), Brett Ewart (Sacramento), Jay Boatwright (SSWD) and Sean Twila (Golden State). The other

## FINANCING PLAN
### REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY
### SACRAMENTO REGIONAL WATER BANK, PHASE 1 PROJECT

In developing the proposed fees for each agency, factors such as agency size and the likelihood and level of participation in a future bank were considered. One of the most significant considerations is whether the agency is also located within the South American Subbasin. This is because agencies in the North American Subbasin are funding much of the cost for the update of that portion of the model through a separate effort. A not-to-exceed fee was established to account for the possibility that not all proposed agencies will participate and to allow for a contingency in the event of unanticipated expenses. The not-to-exceed fee includes an additional 20 percent of the planned Phase 1 fee for each agency.

### Proposed Fee Table

In developing the proposed fees for each agency, factors such as agency size, past participation in a groundwater substitution transfer, and the likelihood and level of participation in the Water Bank in the future were considered. A not-to-exceed fee was established to account for the possibility that other sources of funding may become available during the course of the Phase 2 Program. Fees will be collected over two years as shown below, unless an agency requests to pay its not-to-exceed fee at the outset of the program.

### REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY
### SACRAMENTO REGIONAL WATER BANK, PHASE 3 PROGRAM

In developing the proposed fees for each agency, factors such as agency size, past participation in a groundwater substitution transfer, and the likelihood and level of participation in the Water Bank in the future were considered. A not-to-exceed fee was established assuming the acquisition of other sources of funding will become available during the course of the Phase 3 Program. RWA staff will pursue the collection of fees immediately following signature with each Program Committee Agency. RWA staff will only pursue collection of contingency fees upon a majority approval of the Program Committee.

# AGENDA ITEM VIII-3
## Bringing Water Together

### Special District Grant Accessibility Act, H.R. 7525 / S. 4673

H.R. 7525 was introduced by Congressman Pat Fallon (R-TX-4) and passed out of the House of Representatives by a vote of 352-27 on May 6, 2024. On July 11, 2024, Senator Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) and Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) introduced companion legislation, S. 4673.

The Special District Grant Accessibility Act would provide a federal definition of “special district” for the first time. Establishing a federal definition of “special district” is necessary to help ensure special districts are eligible for various forms of federal funding. The legislation also directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop guidance on how federal agencies will recognize special districts.

By way of background, special districts are a form of local government. Some water providers as well as entities like local fire districts and EMS providers are among the groups that are organized as special districts. During the COVID-19 pandemic special districts were not able to access CARES Act funding and ARPA Fiscal Recovery Fund dollars.

The bill defines a special district as:

> The term “special district” means a political subdivision of a State, with specified boundaries and significant budgetary autonomy or control, created by or pursuant to the laws of the State, for the purpose of performing limited and specific governmental or proprietary functions that distinguish it as a significantly separate entity from the administrative governance structure of any other form of local government unit within a State.

### ACWA Staff Recommendation:
ACWA staff recommends a support position.

### Subcommittee Recommendation:
The Drinking Water and Energy Subcommittee recommends a support position for the Special District Grant Accessibility Act.

![ACWA Water Conservation Rebate Tax Parity Act](https://www.acwa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Water-Conservation-Rebate-Tax-Parity-Act-H.R.-8682-1.jpg)

**Water Conservation Rebate Tax Parity Act, H.R. 8682**

On June 10th, Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and cosponsors Rep. John Curtis (R-Utah), Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), and Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.) reintroduced the Water Conservation Rebate Tax Parity Act, H.R. 8682.

The bill would exempt water conservation and efficiency rebates offered by utilities from federal income tax requirements.

Under current law rebates for energy efficiency are tax exempt, but water efficiency rebates are not.

H.R. 8682 puts water efficiency rebates on par with energy rebates and removes a tax barrier to water conservation.

ACWA has supported versions of this legislation that have been introduced in prior congresses.

**ACWA Staff Recommendation:**
ACWA staff recommends a support position for H.R. 8682.

**Subcommittee Recommendation:**
The Drinking Water and Energy Subcommittee recommends support for the Water Conservation Rebate Tax Parity Act.

![ACWA Farm Bill Document](https://www.acwa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Farm-Bill-Document.png)

Farm Bill  
On May 24th the House Ag Committee passed its version of the Farm Bill by a vote of 33-21. The Senate has yet to release Farm Bill text but two competing bill summaries (one from democrat committee leadership and one from republican committee leadership) have been released.

House Farm Bill (H.R. 8467)  
**Title I Commodities:**  
- Increases the statutory reference price (SRP) for covered commodities by 10 to 20 percent. Rice SRP increased from $14.00 to $16.90.

**Title II Conservation:**  
- Amends eligibility criteria to access funding from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) by removing climate requirements. Unobligated IRA USDA funding (approximately $14.4 billion) is reallocated to conservation programs under Title II.  
- Removes the adjusted gross income (AGI) limitations for program participants that earn 75% or more of their income from agriculture, based on H.R. 4800 sponsored by Congressman Jimmy Panetta.  
- Authorizes emergency cost-share assistance for livestock water facilities and grazing infrastructure for enrolled lands under the CREP program.

**Title VIII: Forestry**  
- Extends authorization of hazardous fuel reduction funding through 2029.  
- Reauthorizes and improves the Water Source Protection Program. This section is based on H.R. 4018 legislation supported by ACWA.  
- Expands use of good neighbor agreements to tribal and county governments.  
- Reauthorizes and amends the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration. Text is aimed at reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire or increasing ecological restoration activities. Restoration activities can include enhancing watershed health and drinking water sources. This section is based on H.R. 4197/S.202, legislation supported by ACWA.  
- Includes text of Act H.R. 2989, the Save our Sequoias Act. This section is based on legislation supported by ACWA.  
- Expands use of Categorical Exclusions (CE) to up to 10,000 acres for: insect and disease, wildfire resilience, and fuel breaks.

**Senate Farm Bill**  
The Senate Agriculture Committee has yet to release bill text. Two competing bill summaries have been released though, one from Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow and one from Ranking Member John Bozeman. The two summaries differ on several issues including funding for nutrition programs. While text has not been released it appears, based on currently available information, that a majority of ACWA’s wildfire priorities are represented in each version of the Senate legislation.

**ACWA Staff Recommendation:**  
Agriculture and the Farm Bill are important to ACWA’s members. Given the current dynamics between the House and Senate ACWA staff recommends a watch position at this time.

# 2024 Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) (H.R. 8812 & S.4367)

The House of Representatives passed its version of WRDA 2024 (H.R. 8812) by a vote of 359 to 13 on July 22, 2024. On August 1, 2024, the Senate passed its version of WRDA 2024 (S.4367) by unanimous consent. Conference negotiations to resolve differences between the two bills are underway. The 2024 WRDA bill is a project-focused bill that also contains several policy reforms that would benefit water managers. A summary of the legislation can be found below.

## House WRDA Bill (H.R. 8812)

The House WRDA bill authorizes $9.8 billion for 160 feasibility studies and 12 new or modified construction projects. The legislation authorizes hundreds of millions of dollars for projects in California and provides a specific benefit to nearly 80 California projects either through the authorization of a feasibility study, project authorization, or project modification.

In addition to funding the House WRDA bill also contains several policy related provisions that may be of interest to ACWA members. These policy provisions include:
- the expansion of the Corps Continuing Authorities Program (CAP) to include drought resiliency
- directing the Corps to track NEPA documents through an online permitting dashboard
- establish water supply as a core mission of the Corps Civil Works Program
- reauthorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) National Dam Safety Program through 2028

## Senate WRDA Bill (S.4367)

The Senate WRDA bill authorizes approximately $3 billion for 81 feasibility studies and 8 new or modified construction projects. The legislation includes 17 projects in California. In addition to California specific authorizations the bill also includes the following provisions that may be of interest to ACWA members:
- the expansion of the Corps Continuing Authorities Program (CAP) to include drought resiliency
- expanding the authority of the Corps to accept funds from non-federal interests to formulate, review, or revise operational documents.
- authorizes an Emergency Drought Operations Pilot Program for projects in California and Arizona

## ACWA Staff Recommendation:
Passing WRDA would benefit numerous ACWA members. ACWA staff recommends taking a support position.

## Subcommittee Recommendation:
The Infrastructure and Agriculture Subcommittee recommended a position of support for WRDA as well as specific support for Sec. 121 of H.R. 8812 (relating to water supply).

# Large-Scale Water Recycling Reauthorization and Investment Act (H.R. 7990)

On April 15, 2024, Representative Grace Napolitano (D-CA-31) and Congressman Jared Huffman (D-CA-2) introduced H.R. 7990, the Large-Scale Water Recycling Reauthorization and Investment Act.

This legislation amends Section 40905 of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), P.L. 117-58 which provides authority for the Bureau of Reclamation’s (Reclamation) Large-Scale Water Recycling Program. The bill would:
- reauthorize Reclamation’s Large Scale Water Recycling Program for an additional six years,
- increase the funding authorization by an additional $550 million to $1 billion (up from the currently authorized level of $450 million), and
- increase the project cost threshold to qualify from $500 million to $1 billion.

By bolstering water recycling capabilities nationwide, a more resilient and sustainable water supply in the future is possible.

## ACWA Staff Recommendation:
ACWA members continue to be industry leaders in adopting water recycling, ACWA recommends support for this legislation.

## Subcommittee Recommendation:
The Water Supply Subcommittee recommended support for Large-Scale Water Recycling Reauthorization and Investment Act.

# Fix Our Forests Act (H.R. 8790)
On June 18, 2024, Representative Bruce Westerman (AR-04) and Congressman Scott Peters (D-CA) introduced H.R. 8790, the Fix Our Forests Act.

This legislation would improve forest management activities and increase wildfire resiliency by: improving federal agency collaboration, authorizing targeted environmental streamlining authorities, providing litigation reform, expanding good neighbor authorities, and invest in research and technology aimed at improving forest health.

Specifically, the legislation would:
- Improve federal agency collaboration by establishing an interagency Fireshed Center Office housed within the U.S. Forest Service that includes representatives from: USFS, DOI, DOE, DHS, DOD, FEMA, NOAA and NASA. The Fireshed Center would work to streamline decision making, procurement, data sharing, and other measures. The bill would also codify cross-boundary stewardship between federal, state, and tribal lands. Cross boundary stewardship would only be provided if requested by a state or tribe.

- Authorize targeted environmental streamlining by expanding the use of Categorical Exclusions (CE) including under power lines, codifies emergency NEPA, NHPA, and ESA regulations in certain high-risk areas. Clarifies that USFS/BLM are not required to reinitiate consultation on an approved land management plan if a new species is listed or critical habitat is designated. Permanently codifies 20 year stewardship contracts.

- Address litigation challenges by expanding litigation reforms found in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and Healthy Forest Restoration Act (no injunction if plaintiff is unlikely to succeed, and balance of harms when considering an injunction). Limits claims on fireshed management projects to 120 days after the agency announces a proposed action.

- Expand good neighbor authorities allowing revenue from timber sales to be retained by counties and tribes. Establishes a joint DOI/USDA Community Wildfire Defense Research Program.

- Invest in research and technology through various mechanisms including a public-private wildfire technology partnership. Encourages policies to improve remote sensing, detection, and tracking of forest health conditions and wildfire data. Directs USDA and DOI to establish biochar demonstration projects.

On June 26, 2024, H.R. 8790 passed the House Natural Resources Committee by voice vote.

## ACWA Staff Recommendation:
Forest health is one of ACWA’s priorities, ACWA staff recommends support for this legislation.

![ACWA EMBER Act](https://www.acwa.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EMBER-Act-S-4628.jpg)

**EMBER Act (S.4628)**

On June 20, 2024, Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ) and Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) introduced S. 4628, the Enhancing Mitigation and Building Effective Resilience (EMBER) Act.

This legislation is based in part on a number of recommendations made by the Wildfire Mitigation and Management Commission, which ACWA member Andy Fecko served on.

This legislation would strengthen wildfire mitigation, management, and recovery techniques nationwide through several key provisions:

- **Investments:** Ease burdens placed on states and localities by reducing or waiving FEMA matching or cost sharing requirements for wildfire planning, management, and recovery projects. Additionally, water entities would receive assistance for cross-border emergency watershed protection to protect lives, property, and resources at risk.

- **Resilience Planning:** Update policies and guidance for post-fire incident recovery, including debris removal, emergency protective measures, and toxicity of drinking water resulting from wildfires. This measure also provides resources to expand wildfire response, suppression, and prescribed fire training to local fire entities.

- **Research and Data Collection:** Direct the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Interior, and Homeland Security to develop uniform wildfire hazard datasets and guidance on wildfire-specific recovery challenges regarding debris removal, emergency protective measures, and toxicity of drinking water resources.

- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Involves interested parties including states, localities, tribes, utility partners, and others to develop a more comprehensive approach to wildfire management in the built and natural environments, resources for effective partnerships, and ways to reduce staffing and financial burdens.

**ACWA Staff Recommendation:**
Forest health is one of ACWA’s priorities; ACWA staff recommends support for this legislation.

**Subcommittee Recommendation:**
The Water Supply Subcommittee recommended support for the EMBER Act.

| Clean Water Act rule on new definition of “waters of the United States” | In 2021, the Biden Administration announced plans to revise the WOTUS definition – this is the third consecutive administration to revise WOTUS. ACWA submitted comments on previous iterations of the WOTUS rulemaking process in 2019 and 2021. <br><br> On 1/18/23, EPA and the Army Corps published a final rule revising the definition of WOTUS. ACWA submitted comments on 2/7/22. The rule went into effect on 3/20/23. <br><br> Several months later, the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) ruled in Sackett v. EPA that the CWA “extends to only those wetlands with a continuous surface connection” to a WOTUS such that they are indistinguishable from those waters. Sackett expressly rejected the “significant nexus” approach in the Biden rule. | On 9/8/23 the agencies published a final rule to update the Biden rule to align with the Sackett ruling. The rule was not subject to public comment. <br><br> Litigation over the updated rule is ongoing. |
| Subsurface/ groundwater connection and NPDES permits | In 2020, SCOTUS held in County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund that the CWA requires a permit when there is a direct discharge, or a “functional equivalent” of a direct discharge via groundwater, of pollutants from a point source into navigable waters. ACWA previously submitted comments on this issue in 2018. <br><br> EPA then published draft guidance, and ACWA participated in NWRA’s comments. The final guidance was released in early 2021. The Biden EPA rescinded the Trump-era guidance in Sept. 2021. | On 11/20/23 EPA published updated draft Maui guidance. <br><br> Once final, this guidance is widely expected to be used to protect waters no longer covered by the CWA due to the Sackett ruling. |
| PFAS                                         | SDWA: In 2021, EPA moved forward with a final regulatory determination to set a drinking water standard for PFOA and PFOS. <br><br> On 3/29/23, EPA published a proposed rule to set federally enforceable limits for six PFAS in drinking water. The proposal would regulate PFOA and PFOS as individual contaminants, and four other PFAS – PFNA, PFHxS, PFBS, and GenX Chemicals – as a mixture known as a Hazard Index (HI). ACWA staff provided verbal comments at a public hearing on 5/4/23 and submitted written comments. | SDWA: On April 10, 2024, the EPA announced the final rule establishing national primary drinking water regulations (NPDWR) for six PFAS substances. The rule established Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCL) and monitoring requirements for these six chemicals under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on April 26, 2024 and will be effective as of June 25, 2024. <br><br> The Final MCL are as follows: |

**CERCLA:** In 2022, EPA published a proposed rule to designate PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as Superfund. ACWA submitted comments. Separately, ACWA gave verbal comments at EPA’s PFAS CERCLA Enforcement Listening Session.

On 4/13/23, EPA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking input on the development of regulations pertaining to PFAS under CERCLA. EPA is exploring whether to regulate 7 additional PFAS under CERCLA. ACWA submitted comments.

**RCRA:** On 5/8/23, EPA sent a proposed rule to list PFOA, PFOS, PFBS, and GenX as RCRA hazardous constituents to OMB for review.

**GUIDANCE:** EPA is working to publish guidance on destroying and disposing of PFAS.

**Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR)**  
In 2021, EPA announced its plans to pursue a two-step rulemaking approach to address lead in drinking water. First, EPA allowed the Trump-era Lead and Copper Rule Revisions (LCRR) to go into effect. Second, EPA would publish the Lead and Copper Rule Improvements (LCRI) to further clarify and build on the LCRR.

On 8/4/22, EPA released its implementation guidance on the LCRR LSL inventory requirements.

ACWA, in coordination with CMUA developed industry-led guidance on LCRR implementation.

**PFAS Standards:**  
- PFOA – 4 parts per trillion (ppt)  
- PFOS – 4 ppt  
- PFHxS – 10 ppt  
- PFNA – 10 ppt  
- HFPO-DA (Gen X Chemicals) – 10 ppt  
- Mixtures of two or more compounds – Hazard Index 1 (unitless).  

Public water systems will have three years to complete initial monitoring and must begin providing public information on PFAS levels by 2027. Full compliance with the rule must be achieved by 2029.

**CERCLA:** On May 8, 2024 the EPA released the final rule designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA. The rule will be final on July 8, 2024.

On April 19, 2024 EPA also published the PFAS Enforcement and Discretion Settlement Policy Under CERCLA. The policy indicates that EPA does not intend to pursue actions against entities where equitable factors do not support seeking response actions or costs under CERCLA. The policy specifically mentions water systems and farms as examples of entities that EPA does not intend to pursue action against. The policy does not address all of the liability concerns ACWA raised in comments.

**RCRA:** ACWA is partnering with the California Municipal Utilities Association (CMUA) to submit joint comments on the proposal. Comments were submitted on 4/8/24.

**GUIDANCE:** On 4/8/24 EPA published draft interim guidance; the interim guidance is open for comments for 180 days.

| **Topic** | **Details** |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Lead and Copper Rule Improvements (LCRI)** | After a series of delays, the LCRR went into effect in 2021 with an accompanying compliance deadline of Oct. 16 of this year. The final LCRR requires water systems to create lead service line (LSL) inventories – including the customer-owned side of the line – by the compliance deadline. ACWA and CMUA submitted comments and engaged in various stakeholder outreach on the LCRR. In 2022, EPA opened the LCRI federalism consultation process. ACWA and CMUA submitted comments. The agency also shared its plans to finalize the LCRI prior to the LCRR compliance deadline of 10/16/24. On 12/6/23, EPA published the proposed Lead and Copper Rule Improvements (LCRI). ACWA and CMUA both gave verbal comments at the LCRI public hearing and submitted joint written comments. |
| **Cybersecurity in Public Water Systems** | On 3/3/23, EPA issued a controversial interpretive memo requiring states to evaluate cybersecurity of operational technology used when conducting sanitary surveys or through other state programs. EPA withdrew the memo after legal challenges arose. On 10/11/23, EPA withdrew the memo in response to litigation (State of Missouri, et al v. U.S. EPA). On 1/24/24, federal agencies, including EPA, released an Incident Response Guide to provide water and wastewater agencies with cybersecurity support that will improve their cyber resilience. On 7/29/24, ACWA filed comments on the WSAR. |
| **Water System Restructuring Assessment Rule** | On 5/30/24, the EPA released a draft of the Water System Restructuring Assessment Rule (WSRAR). EPA was directed to develop the rule under Title I of the 2018 America’s Water Infrastructure Act. The rule gives states greater authority to force restructuring of Public Water Systems (PWS) that frequently violate Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) standards and have been unable to take sufficient actions to come back into SDWA compliance. |
| **Proposed High-Priority Substance Designations Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)** | On 7/25/24, the EPA released a proposal to designate five chemical compounds as High-Priority Substances for risk evaluation pursuant to TSCA. One of the compounds is vinyl chloride (CASRN 75-01-4). Vinyl chloride is used in the manufacture of PVC pipes which are often used for water supply. Comments are due on 10/23/24. ACWA plans to work with members and national partners to submit comments regarding vinyl chloride designation. |
| **Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, DHS** | **Issue**: Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA) Reporting Requirements. **Background**: On 4/4/24, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), published a draft rule proposing reporting requirements for critical infrastructure entities that experience cybersecurity incidents. The proposed rule would affect the water and wastewater sector. **Status**: On 7/3/24, ACWA filed comments on the proposed CIRCIA Rule. |

4. **Tree Pro Tree Services – On-Call Contract (W/R)**  
   Mr. Barela reviewed the written staff report which will be included in the Board packet. He explained that Tree Pro Tree Services has obtained a California Multiple Award Schedule (CMAS) contract that allows agencies to use their services without the need for additional competitive bidding. He informed the committee that staff has contacted multiple neighboring agencies currently utilizing the Tree Pro CMAS contract, and all have been pleased with Tree Pro’s service, cost, and safety performance under the CMAS umbrella, and General Counsel Jones confirmed that the contract is a good vehicle for on-call contracting. Tree Pro’s CMAS contract is valid through February 10, 2028.

   Mr. Barela informed the committee that the contract would be for on-call services so a not to exceed amount was not included in the contract; however, he explained that by entering into this contract, the District will lock in the rate and the actual budget for annual tree service will be approved in the District’s annual budget.

   The Finance Committee recommends that the Board authorize the Director of Operations to enter into a 4-year on-call contract with Tree Pro Tree Services, Inc. to provide tree removal and maintenance services.
