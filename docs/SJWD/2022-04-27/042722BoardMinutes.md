   Director Costa moved to approve the Consent Calendar. Director Rich seconded the motion and it motion carried with the following roll call vote:  
   **Ayes:** Directors Costa, Miller, Rich, Tobin and Zamorano  
   **Noes:** None  
   **Abstain:** None  

IV. **NEW BUSINESS**  
1. **Calling for General District Election on November 8, 2022 (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker reviewed a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. The Board discussed the Candidate Statement options and directed staff to limit the wording to 200 words with the candidate paying for the Candidate Statement.  
   Director Tobin moved to approve Resolution No. 22-09 Calling for General District Election (Sacramento County) and Resolution No. 22-10 Notice of Governing Board Member Election (Placer County), limiting the Candidate Statement to 200 words and requiring the candidate to pay for the Candidate Statement.

3. **Bacon Pump Facility Generator Replacement Project (R)**  
   Mr. Barela provided a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained the Tier 4 requirement that led staff to switch from one large replacement generator (over 1,000 Hp) to two generators under 1,000 Hp. This change will save the District funds since the Tier 4 requirements will not need to be made. The Board discussed the generator and requested Legal Counsel Jones to research the District’s ability to require American-made equipment when issuing Requests for Proposals/Bids. At Director Costa’s request, staff will report back on the generator that failed a couple years ago and provide the Board an update on that item at a future Board meeting.
<!-- Page 4 -->

In addition, she informed the Board that staff was very pleased with the previous auditors; however, Government Code Section 12410.6(b) requires the District to rotate auditors, or partners within the same audit firm, as least once every six years.

Director Costa moved to authorize staff to engage Davis Farr, LLP to perform the financial audit for the year ending June 30, 2022, with an option to extend for each of the five subsequent fiscal years. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it motion carried with the following roll call vote:

Ayes: Directors Costa, Miller, Rich, Tobin and Zamorano  
Noes: None  
Abstain: None  

V. OLD BUSINESS  

1. Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project (W)  
Mr. Pierson provided a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained that there were three bids received and that the lowest bidder Myers and Sons Construction, Inc. requested relief from its bid pursuant to Public Contract Code sections 5101 and 5103 because they discovered an error in the mathematical computation and an error in the transposition of the figures that resulted in Myers’ bid being materially different than Myers’ intended bid. The Board discussed the large project and confirmed that alternative solutions were looked at.

Vice President Rich moved to award a construction contract for the construction of the Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project in the amount of $20,139,000 with a total authorized budget of $22,152,900 which includes a 10% contingency. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it motion carried with the following roll call vote:

Ayes: Directors Costa, Miller, Rich, Tobin and Zamorano  
Noes: None  
Abstain: None  
<!-- Page 5 -->
2. Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project (W)  
Mr. Pierson provided a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained that the contingency is being increased to 15% because the construction project may require additional construction management and inspection services.  

Vice President Rich moved to award a Professional Services Contract to Inferrera Construction Management Group, Inc. (ICM) for construction management and inspection services for the Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project in the amount of $867,870.00 with a total authorized budget of $998,051.00 which includes a 15% contingency. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it motion carried with the following roll call vote:  
Ayes: Directors Costa, Miller, Rich, Tobin and Zamorano  
Noes: None  
Abstain: None  

3. General Manager Employment Agreement (W & R)  
President Miller reported that the Negotiating Committee met with the Board in Closed Session and recommended an amendment to the General Manager’s contract to include a salary of $208,000. Vice President Rich stated that the labor negotiators compared the General Manager’s salary with similar positions in the region to come to that figure, which reflects the regional median of total compensation.  

Director Costa moved to approve an amendment to the General Manager employment agreement to include a salary of $208,000. President Miller seconded the motion and it motion carried with the following roll call vote:  
Ayes: Directors Costa, Miller, Rich and Zamorano  
Noes: Tobin  
Abstain: None  

4. 2022 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker informed the Board that the Sacramento Valley is at 39.2 inches of precipitation for this water year which is 82% of average and snowpack for our region is 42% of average. He reviewed data on Folsom Reservoir, which included the current storage level at 103% of historical average, data on releases, temperature information and storage projections.  

GM Helliker reviewed the State Water Board’s data on the progress towards the Governor’s 15% voluntary conservation request. He reviewed a chart that showed conservation targets in the region from agencies taking water from the American and Sacramento rivers.  

GM Helliker reviewed the Residential Gallons Per Capita Per Day (R-GPCD) for the region and informed the Board that the data shows that by using the December information, indoor usage can be estimated minus a 3-4% water loss. He explained that the current standard for indoor use is 55 GPCD and nobody in the region meets
<!-- Page 6 -->
![Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=April+27%2C+2022%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+6)

that. He stated that the proposal for 2025 is 47 GPCD, and 42 GPCD for 2030, under SB 1157 which is being considered by the legislature. Mr. Zlotnick pointed out that SB 1157 does not take into account an agency's water supply situation or their water rights. Director Costa commented that the District's water rights need to be protected and if it is mandated to reduce to 47 or 42 GPCD then that is a clear taking of the District's water rights and this should be discussed with legal counsel. The Board discussed this topic and would like GM Helliker and Director Zamorano to meet with Senator Hertzberg. In addition, they would like GM Helliker to meet with Assemblymember Cooley to discuss this topic.

5. FY 2021-22 Operations Plan Report Card (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed the 3rd quarter progress on the FY 2021-22 Operations Plan Report Card. He informed the Board that staff is on track to meet the goals and stated that he anticipates the Board will review and update the Strategic Plan next year.

# AGENDA ITEM III-4

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Andrew Pierson, P.E.  
**Engineering Services Manager**  
**Date:** April 27, 2022  
**Subject:** Rancho Del Oro Estates Pipeline Easement Grant to SJWD  

## RECOMMENDATION ACTION
Staff recommends a motion to adopt resolution 22-08 and approve and accept two waterline easements in accordance with District Ordinances for new water distribution pipelines located within the Rancho Del Oro Estates residential development project property. These pipelines will both serve the Rancho Del Oro Estates project as well as improve hydraulic connectivity in the Retail distribution system. This item will be reviewed by the Engineering Committee on April 25, 2022.

## BACKGROUND
Currently under construction, the Rancho Del Oro Estates project is a County-approved 89-lot residential development project located on a 119.4-acre (gross area) parcel on the north side of Olive Ranch Road, generally east of Cavitt Stallman Road and west of Olive Glen Court (APN: 046-090-012-000). The following figure provides an aerial representation of the project location, and easements.

**Project Location**  
Rancho Del Oro Estates  

- **Cavitt Stallman Rd**  
- **Olive Ranch Rd**  
- **Proposed waterline easements**

![Rancho Del Oro Estates Pipeline Easement Grant to SJWD](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Rancho+Del+Oro+Estates+Pipeline+Easement+Grant+to+SJWD)

As a condition of project approval, the District required the Developer of the Rancho Del Oro Estates project to provide two waterline easements located on the proposed development property, as well as to install new pipelines within said easements. These easements provide the District the ability to install two future water supply connections that not only serve as a second source of supply to the Rancho Del Oro Estates project, but will also improve hydraulic connectivity and water supply reliability for the surrounding Retail distribution system.

As shown in the figure below, the proposed northern easement is a 20-ft wide waterline easement located at the end of Baile Court, and will provide the District the ability to install a future waterline within an existing 50-ft wide road and public utility easement located east of the project property. The proposed southern easement is a 12.5-ft wide waterline easement located along the northern property line of Lot 19 that will provide the District the opportunity for a future connection when the adjacent property is developed.

**STATUS**  
The improvement plans for the Rancho Del Oro development project have already been approved by both Placer County and the District, and construction of this project has already commenced. As a condition of District approval and acceptance of the Rancho Del Oro project, the acceptance of the requested water pipeline easement is now needed. The attached Exhibits provide the description of the planned easement to be conveyed to the District.

District staff have reviewed the easement documents and the design plans and have determined that the proposed easement is designed in accordance with the District’s development and engineering Standards.

**BUDGET IMPACT**  
Other than a potential for minor costs associated with recordation of the easement documents (typically there is no charge), there is no anticipated budget impact associated with a Board decision to accept this easement.

**AGENDA ITEM III-5**

**STAFF REPORT**

To: Board of Directors  
From: Mark Hargrove, Senior Engineer  
Date: April 27, 2022  
Subject: Bacon Pump Facility Generator Replacement Project, EETS Amendment No. 3  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to approve Amendment 3 to the professional services contract with EETS, Inc. (EETS) for engineering services related to the construction of the Bacon Pump Facility Generator Replacement Project (Project) in the amount of $69,820 and authorizing a total amendment budget of $76,800 (includes 10% contingency), bringing the total approved project budget to $240,050. This item will be considered by the Engineering Committee on April 25, 2022.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
The Project consists of the replacement of two existing diesel generators located at the District's Bacon Pump Facility. The existing generators are beyond their useful life and District staff believes it is imperative the generators be replaced as soon as possible to avoid catastrophic failure similar to what occurred with the generator at the Upper Granite Bay Pump Station in 2021. Construction bids were received from Contractors on April 14, 2022.

EETS provided the design and bidding services for the Project and their services will be required during construction to provide submittal review, specialty inspection, as-built drawings, and assist with answering contractor questions. The Project construction contract is discussed under a separate staff report.

---

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
The total budget for the project included in FY 2021/2022 and FY 2022/2023 are $68,000 and $1,333,000 respectively, totaling approximately $1.4 million. The low bid amount for construction was approximately $1.8 million which leaves a budget gap. The Project construction contract is discussed under a separate staff report. District staff is currently re-prioritizing projects to accommodate the additional budget required to complete this project.

**AGENDA ITEM III-6**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Finance Director  
**Date:** April 27, 2022  
**Subject:** Capital Asset Policy Revisions  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Consider a motion to approve amendments to the Capital Asset Policy for the San Juan Water District. This item will be reviewed by the Finance Committee on April 26, 2022.

**BACKGROUND**  
Capital Assets is a term used to describe assets that are used in operations, above a certain value threshold, and that have initial lives extending beyond a single reporting period (fiscal year). Capitalization is primarily a financial reporting issue. What this means is that the District’s primary concern in setting capitalization policy should be the anticipated information needs of the users of the District’s external financial reports. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require the matching of expenses to the period of benefit. Since capital assets provide benefits over their entire life, GAAP require that they be expensed or “depreciated” over the same time period.

There are many policy decisions that should be made and periodically reviewed by the Board of Directors to adequately guide staff in the identification, capitalization and depreciation of capital assets, such as capitalization thresholds, estimated useful lives of asset categories, how to determine the value of donated assets, etc.

The Board first adopted a Capital Asset Policy in October, 2017. The policy was reviewed and amended by the Board in August, 2020. Since that time, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) has issued a new pronouncement titled GASB 87: Lease Accounting which requires the capitalization of leases as a financing mechanism and has issued Implementation Guide N0. 2021-1 which changes the accounting for bundled assets. Additionally, staff recommends language clarifying the capitalization threshold for assets that are shared between wholesale and retail.

**GASB 87: Lease Accounting**  
This new pronouncement, effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2021, requires leases to be capitalized on the balance sheet either as an “intangible, right to use” asset (in cases where the District is leasing something) or as a “lease receivable” (in cases where the District is leasing something out to someone else). In either case, the District needs to establish a capitalization threshold. Without a capitalization threshold, the District would be required to capitalize small items such as the postage meter lease, which would be unduly complicated, inefficient and confusing to readers of the District’s financial statements. After reviewing all current leases and conferring with the audit firm Richardson and Company, staff recommends a capitalization threshold of $100,000 for the full term of the lease. This means that the total value of the lease must be $100,000 or greater for the capitalization requirement to apply. With this threshold the District’s cell tower leases will qualify for.
<!-- Page 15 -->
![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT+Capital+Asset+Policy+Revisions)

capitalization as a “lease receivable”, but leased assets such as the postage meter and phone system will likely not.

## Implementation Guide NO. 2021-1 – Bundled Assets
This implementation guide addresses numerous topics, one of which is the accounting treatment of bundled assets. Per the implementation guide:

**Capitalization policies adopted by governments include many considerations such as finding an appropriate balance between ensuring that all significant capital assets, collectively, are capitalized and minimizing the cost of recordkeeping for capital assets. A government should capitalize assets whose individual acquisition costs are less than the threshold for an individual asset if those assets in the aggregate are significant. Computers, classroom furniture, and library books are examples of asset types that may not meet a capitalization policy on an individual basis, yet could be significant collectively. In this example, if the $150,000 aggregate amount (100 computers costing $1,500 each) is significant, the government should capitalize the computers.**

While not specifically addressed in the guide, another important consideration is whether or not the bundled assets will be replaced together. If they are purchased together, but do not have the same estimated useful life, then only the assets with the same lives should be bundled as a group. Staff recommends setting a capitalization threshold of $100,000 for bundled assets, as well as the specification that bundled assets must have the same useful life and be intended to be replaced as a bundle.

A clear version of the proposed policy, as well as a redline version of the existing policy are attached for review.

<!-- Page 18 -->
B. Improvements and Replacements:  
“Improvements and Replacements” are defined as expenditures that involve substituting a similar capital asset, or portion thereof, for an existing one. All “Improvements and Replacements” to existing capital assets should be capitalized as long as the asset meets the criteria of section 5.2.5 above. If the existing asset’s book value is determinable, then the existing asset should be removed from the books at the time the replacement is recorded. If the existing asset is not separately identifiable, then the replacement may be capitalized as the existing asset’s book value is assumed to be negligible. The Director of Finance is authorized to make a determination when this policy does not provide clear direction.

C. Rearrangement or Reinstallation:  
“Rearrangement or Reinstallation” costs are defined as expenditures that involve moving an existing asset to a new location or reinstalling a similar asset in place of an existing asset. All “Rearrangement or Reinstallation” costs should be expensed in the period incurred.

D. Repairs and Maintenance:  
“Repairs and Maintenance” costs are defined as expenditures that involve maintaining the asset in good or ordinary repair. All “Repairs and Maintenance” costs should be expensed in the period incurred.

5.2.8 Depreciation or Amortization of Capital Assets  
Capital assets shall be depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis beginning the first day of the month following acquisition in accordance with the following schedule:

Varies based on life of asset  

Where the useful life is listed by a range, factors such as material type, physical environment of the asset, intensity of expected use and others as may be provided by Project and/or Department Managers will be used to determine placement within the range.  

The depreciation period of an asset financed by debt shall not be less than the length of time for the debt.  

### 5.2.9 Physical Inventory of Capital Assets  
A physical inventory of the following categories of capital assets shall be performed at least annually:  
A. Machinery and Equipment  
B. Fleet Equipment  
C. Office Furniture and Fixtures  
D. Computer Equipment, Purchases Software and Telephones  

The results of the physical inventory shall be reconciled with the District’s fixed asset system.  

### 5.2.10 Disposal of Capital Assets  
Capital assets that have become obsolete shall be disposed of in a manner that returns the maximum value to the District and its ratepayers.  

In most cases the assets are sent to auction; however, the Finance Director determines the best method of disposal.  

State law prohibits District employees from purchasing District property (Government Code section 1090).

# Board Policy Manual

**Section**: FIN-5 Finance  
**Policy**: FIN-5.2 Capital Asset Policy  
**Approval Date**: 10/11/17  
**Latest Revision**: 8/19/20  

## FIN-5.2 Capital Asset Policy

### 5.2.1 Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidance in identifying, capitalizing, depreciating, and accounting for District capital assets.

### 5.2.2 Definitions
A capital asset is defined under this Policy as an asset owned by the District that is: 1) acquired for use in District operations, and 2) long-term in nature.

### 5.2.3 Capital Improvement Program
District infrastructure will be maintained at a level that ensures the delivery of a reliable water supply of the highest quality at reasonable and equitable costs. Long-term capital improvement plans are created with each Master Plan. The capital improvement plan is a planning tool which assists the District in the construction and replacement of capital facilities required to provide water service to current and future customers. The Long Term Capital Improvement Plan is updated each year based on a number of factors including new projects not identified in Master Plan, funding availability, and available staff resources.

### 5.2.4 Categories
Capital assets shall be segregated into the following categories:

A. Land (non-depreciable)  
B. Land Improvements with a limited life, such as driveways, walks, fences, landscaping, and parking areas.  
C. Pump Stations and Improvements  
D. Buildings and Improvements (excluding Water Treatment Plant)  
E. Water Treatment Plant and Improvements  
F. Mains/Pipelines and Improvements  
G. Reservoirs and Improvements  
H. Equipment and Furniture, such as large tools, vehicle trailers, tractors, meters, hydrants, computer equipment, furniture, and fixtures  
I. Vehicles, such as cars and trucks  
J. Software  
K. Other Intangibles  

**Page 1**
<!-- Page 23 -->
# 5.2.5 Capitalization Thresholds
Capital assets eligible for capitalization, must have:

A. An estimated useful life of greater than 1 year from the date of acquisition; and  
B. A minimum individual asset value of $5,000. If the asset is shared between Wholesale and Retail, the combined total value must be at least $5,000 to qualify for capitalization.  
C. Assets cannot be grouped together to meet the minimum $5,000 value.  
D. A combined total of at least $100,000 and be a group of like assets (e.g., meters) purchased and intended to be replaced together at the end of their useful lives.  
E. A lease agreement that extends beyond one year (including extensions) and a total lease value of at least $100,000.  

# 5.2.6 Valuation of Capital Assets
The value assigned to capital assets shall be determined as follows:

A. Purchased or Constructed Capital Assets  
The value is determined using the original cost of the asset, including all reasonably identifiable costs incurred to acquire, construct, and place an asset into service. Studies are not capitalized, unless they can be related to a specific asset.  

B. Donated Capital Assets  
The capitalized value of donated assets shall be determined using the fair market value at the time of donation. If the fair market value of the asset is not available or cannot be reasonably determined, an estimated cost may be determined using the best available information. The value of donated intangible assets shall be accounted for separate from donated tangible capital assets.  

Fair Market or Appraised Value at date of donation includes:  
- Installation costs;  
- Professional fees of engineers, inspectors, attorneys, consultants, etc.;  
- Other normal or necessary costs required to place the asset in its intended location and condition for use.  

Leased Assets (Right to Use)  
- Value of lease liability;  
- Lease prepayments made for future periods;  
- Direct ancillary costs necessary to place asset into service (excluding debt issuance costs).  

# 5.2.7 Capitalization of Costs Subsequent to Acquisition
Additional costs incurred after a capital asset is placed in use shall be accounted for as follows:

A. Additions:  
An “Addition” is defined as an expenditure that either significantly extends the useful life or productivity of an existing capital asset or creates a new capital asset. All “Additions” to existing capital assets should be capitalized as long as the asset meets the criteria of section 5.2.5 above.

<!-- Page 24 -->
B. Improvements and Replacements:  
“Improvements and Replacements” are defined as expenditures that involve substituting a similar capital asset, or portion thereof, for an existing one. All “Improvements and Replacements” to existing capital assets should be capitalized as long as the asset meets the criteria of section 5.2.5 above. If the existing asset’s book value is determinable, then the existing asset should be removed from the books at the time the replacement is recorded. If the existing asset is not separately identifiable, then the replacement may be capitalized as the existing asset’s book value is assumed to be negligible. The Director of Finance is authorized to make a determination when this policy does not provide clear direction.

C. Rearrangement or Reinstallation:  
“Rearrangement or Reinstallation” costs are defined as expenditures that involve moving an existing asset to a new location or reinstalling a similar asset in place of an existing asset. All “Rearrangement or Reinstallation” costs should be expensed in the period incurred.

D. Repairs and Maintenance:  
“Repairs and Maintenance” costs are defined as expenditures that involve maintaining the asset in good or ordinary repair. All “Repairs and Maintenance” costs should be expensed in the period incurred.

5.2.8 Depreciation or Amortization of Capital Assets  
Capital assets shall be depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis beginning the first day of the month following acquisition in accordance with the following schedule:

**AGENDA ITEM III-7**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** April 27, 2022  
**Subject:** Payment to Reduce Unfunded Actuarial Pension Liability  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Authorize staff to make a payment of $200,000 from wholesale and retail reserves to reduce the unfunded pension liability. This item will be reviewed by the Finance Committee on April 26, 2022.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
The District contracts with CalPERS to provide defined benefit pension benefits to all eligible employees. The District offers pension benefits under three different plans, depending upon employee hire date as follows:

| Plan Name               | Plan Benefit         | Calculated on:                     | For Employees Hired: | # of Employees in Plan |
|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Misc. First Tier Plan   | 3% at 60            | Highest consecutive 12 months      | Prior to February 1, 2009 | 10                     |
| Misc. Second Tier Plan  | 3% at 60            | Highest consecutive 36 months (3 years) | After February 1, 2009 | 17                     |
| PEPRA Misc. Plan       | 2% at 62            | Highest consecutive 36 months (3 years) | On or after January 1, 2013 unless a “classic member” | 18                     |

In order to calculate the liability associated with future pension benefits, CalPERS actuaries estimate the future cost of the benefits, making assumptions about interest earnings over time (the “discount rate”), the life span of employees, final compensation, etc. From that number they subtract the total current market value of the pension assets. The difference is either an unfunded liability or a net plan asset.

Unfunded liabilities can be caused in a number of ways, including investment returns below expectations, changes in assumptions on future returns, mortality rates, etc. In order to smooth the effect of the unfunded liability, CalPERS “amortizes” them over a long period of time. This means that entities pay for those liabilities over time, with interest, rather than in the year they are incurred.
<!-- Page 29 -->
![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT+Payment+to+Reduce+Unfunded+Actuarial+Pension+Liability+Donna+Silva)

Investment gains and losses are spread out (amortized) over 30 years and changes in assumptions are spread out over 20 years. There are currently 17 different gains/losses or assumption changes that are being amortized over a period of 20 to 30 years. The annual payment from each of these 17 bases are combined and result in the annual payment towards the unfunded liability.

At the direction of the Board of Directors, two large voluntary payments were made to reduce the unfunded liability - $4,112,000 in 2017 and $2,787,800 in 2018. During the FY 2020-21 budget adoption process, the Board requested regular annual supplemental payments to gradually reduce and/or eliminate the unfunded pension liability. As a result, a supplemental payment of $200,000 was made in April 2021 and another $200,000 payment was included in the FY 2021-22 budget.

As of the most recent actuarial valuation reports, the District’s pension plan is about 90% funded with an unfunded pension liability of approximately $4.8 million. This is reflective of pension plan performance through June 30, 2020. The pension fund had a 21.3% return for the year ended June 30, 2021, which will further reduce the District’s unfunded liability. The large gain triggered a lowering of the discount rate from 7% to 6.8%, which will also be reflected in the next valuation report, expected to be released in September. Relative to other jurisdictions throughout the State, the District has a very strong funded position. The combined pension plan is approximately 80% funded.

**CURRENT STATUS**  
The current year adopted budget anticipates a payment of $200,000 and per the mid-year budget review, District finances are sufficient to support this payment. The remittance of $200,000 will produce interest savings of approximately $166,000 over the next 20 years. Staff will work with CalPERS staff to apply to payment to the amortization base(s) that will produce the maximum savings for the District.

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** April 27, 2022  
**Subject:** 2022 General Elections  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff recommends a motion to approve Resolution No. 22-09 Calling for General District Election (Sacramento County) and to approve Resolution No. 22-10 Notice of Governing Board Member Election (Placer County).

---

**BACKGROUND**  
The members of the Board of Directors are elected for staggered four year terms. Directors Ken Miller and Pam Tobin were re-elected in November 2020. The seats currently held by Directors Ted Costa, Dan Rich and Manuel Zamorano are up for election on November 8, 2022. The candidate filing for the November election opens July 18, 2022 and closes August 12, 2022.

The Board is required to adopt a resolution for Sacramento and Placer counties which outlines the District’s request to be included in the general election. In the past, the Board determined that the candidates will pay for their candidate statement and that a tie vote would be determined by lot. In addition, the Board has limited the candidate statement to 200 words, instead of the 400 word option, which is also allowed. The cost to the candidate is a flat rate, and is less expensive for a 200-word statement than for a 400-word statement. We do not yet know the cost for either option, because it depends on the number of voters to whom the statements are sent (and differs between Sacramento and Placer Counties). We do know that we can only select one option, which will apply to all candidates. Staff recommends that the Board stay with the 200-word option.

**AGENDA ITEM IV-2**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Mark Hargrove, Senior Engineer  
**Date:** April 27, 2022  
**Subject:** Material/Parts Storage Facility Project, Construction Contract  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to approve a construction contract with Plumberbuilt Inc. (Plumberbuilt) for the amount of $654,000 with a construction contingency of $65,400 (10%) for a total authorized budget of $719,400. The Engineering Committee will review this item on April 25, 2022.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
This project consists of a material and parts storage building located at the southwest corner of the District’s property. The new building will replace the original storage building that was demolished in 2018. Construction will include furnishing and installing a new, prefabricated 2-sided metal building, new building concrete footings, electrical service, and lighting.

---

**CURRENT STATUS**  
Eight (8) contractors attended the mandatory pre-bid meeting and two (2) bids were received on April 13, 2022. The bid outcomes are summarized as follows:

| Bidder                  | Bid Amount  |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Plumberbuilt Inc.      | $654,000    |
| Diede Construction, Inc.| $777,100    |

Plumberbuilt was the lowest responsive, responsible bidder. Plumberbuilt’s bid documents were reviewed and found to be complete and in order, including license, insurance, and bonds.

---

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
The project is included in the FY 2022/2023 with a total project budget of $480,000. District staff is currently re-prioritizing projects to accommodate the additional budget required for this project. District staff will also work with Plumberbuilt to reduce the costs of construction, including but not limited to the removal of items from their scope.

**AGENDA ITEM IV-3**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Mark Hargrove, Senior Engineer  
**Date:** April 27, 2022  
**Subject:** Bacon Pump Facility Generator Replacement Project, Construction Contract  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to approve a construction contract with Lords Electric, Inc. (Lords) for the amount of $1,787,600 with a construction contingency of $178,760 (10%) for a total authorized budget of $1,966,360. This item will be considered by the Engineering Committee on April 25, 2022.

**BACKGROUND**  
This project consists of the replacement of two existing diesel generators located at the District’s Bacon Pump Facility. The existing generators are beyond their useful life and District staff believes it is imperative that the generators be replaced as soon as possible to avoid catastrophic failure similar to what occurred with the generator at the Upper Granite Bay Pump Station in 2021. Construction will include the removal and disposal of the existing generators, demolition of existing slabs, site grading, new concrete foundations, new diesel generators (400 kW and 600 kW), new electrical panels, new conduits and wires, and the relocation of an existing storm drain. The new generation system will be in compliance with all regulatory requirements and is sized to provide emergency system support during a power outage at the site.

**CURRENT STATUS**  
Eleven (11) contractors attended the mandatory pre-bid meeting and three (3) bids were received on April 14, 2022. The bid outcomes are summarized as follows:

| Bidder                | Bid Amount   |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Lords Electric Inc.   | $1,787,600   |
| Telstar Instruments    | $1,904,931   |
| Vintage Paving Co.     | $2,290,500   |

Lords’ bid documents were reviewed and found to be mostly complete and in order. They did not include Notary as required by the bid documents. However, they were able to provide the Notary later when informed it was missing. This was discussed with District counsel, Ryan Jones, and it was decided that the District could accept the bid because they “substantially complied with the bidding requirements, and their minor irregularity was fixed and didn’t give them an advantage over other bidders”.

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
The total budget for the project included in FY 2021/2022 and FY 2022/2023 are $68,000 and $1,333,000 respectively, totaling approximately $1.4 million. This leaves a budget gap of approximately $600,000 for construction alone, not including engineering or inspection services during construction. District staff is currently re-prioritizing projects to accommodate the additional budget required to complete this project.

**AGENDA ITEM IV-4**

To: Board of Directors  
From: Donna Silva  
Director of Finance  
Date: April 27, 2022  
Subject: Selection and Retention of Independent Audit Firm  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Consider a motion to authorize staff to engage Davis Farr to perform the audit of Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2022, with an option to extend for each of the five subsequent fiscal years.

**BACKGROUND**  
Government Code Section 12410.6(b) requires the District to rotate auditors, or partners within the same audit firm, as least once every six years. While staff has been pleased with the quality of the audits performed by Richardson and Company, the contract executed with them in 2017 only allowed for four one year extensions. The last year in the contract was the audit of fiscal year 2020-2021.

On March 2, 2022 staff sent a request for proposals to ten audit firms, posted the Request for Proposals on the District’s website and advertised it through the California State Municipal Finance Officers website. Four proposals were received.

Upon review, staff selected the two firms in the middle of the price range that were most responsive to the proposal, Davis Farr, LLP and Maze and Associates. Both Davis Farr and Maze are highly qualified, reputable audit firms. Davis Farr specializes in auditing California Water and Utility agencies including the Placer County Water Agency, San Diego County Water Authority, Irvine Ranch Water District, Rancho California Water District and others. Maze and Associates also has a division that specializes in Water Districts. However, based on upon favorable pricing and the results of informal meet and greet interviews, staff recommends awarding the contract to Davis Farr, LLP.

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
The annual audit cost for Fiscal Year 2020-2021 was $31,100. Davis Farr LLP proposed the following fees for the initial five-year period:

# AGENDA ITEM V-1

## STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Andrew Pierson, Engineering Services Manager  
**Date:** April 27, 2022  
**Subject:** Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project – Construction Contract  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Staff requests Board approval of a construction contract with Steve P. Rados, Inc. for the amount of $20,139,000.00 with a total authorized budget of $22,152,900.00 which includes a 10% contingency. This item will be reviewed by the Engineering Committee on April 25, 2022.

### BACKGROUND
The existing Hinkle Reservoir Cover and Liner was originally installed during the 1979-1980 Hinkle Reservoir improvements construction project. This existing liner and cover has now reached the end of its useful lifespan and must be replaced. This project involves the removal of the existing reservoir cover, and the installation of a new 45-mil CSPE geomembrane liner on the reservoir floor and side slopes, and the installation of a new 60-mil CSPE geomembrane floating cover including hatches and other appurtenances, and structural and equipment improvements to the existing inlet and outlet structures.

### CURRENT STATUS
The Project was advertised for bidding on March 8, 2022. Ten (10) prime contractors, two (2) liner and cover installers, one (1) subcontractor, and (4) consultants attended the mandatory pre-bid conference on March 17, 2022. Bids for the project were received on April 19, 2022 and are summarized as follows:

| Bidder                     | Bid Amount      |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Myers and Sons Construction, LLC | $17,464,045.00 |
| Steve P. Rados, Inc.     | $20,139,000.00  |
| Syblon Reid               | $20,882,000.00  |

On April 22, 2022 Myers and Sons Construction, Inc. (Myers) requested relief from its bid pursuant to Public Contract Code sections 5101 and 5103. When preparing their bid, Myers made an error in the mathematical computation and an error in the transposition of the figures that resulted in Myers’ bid being materially different than Myers’ intended bid. As a result, Staff reviewed Steve P. Rados, Inc.’s (Rados) bid and determined their bid was complete and in order, including license, insurance, and bonds. Rados’ also submitted documentation (i.e. outreach) and completed forms with their bid to meet the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund’s Disadvantage Business Enterprise (DBE) requirements.

### FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The Project will be included in the District’s FY 2022/2023 Wholesale Budget. Construction costs for the Project are expected to be financed through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.

### Conclusion:
Actual deliveries for the first half of the fiscal year were less than anticipated (with the exception of September). January through March deliveries have been higher than anticipated, leaving total deliveries through March at just a half percent under expectations. As shown in the numbers above, the main drivers of the decline are due to lower demands from the regular wholesale customer agencies, with the exception of SJ Retail. Unbudgeted sales to SSWD have significantly reduced the impact of the demand decreases from the regular customers. Excluding SSWD and CWD, deliveries for July -March are down by 4,476 acre feet, an 11.76% decline from the same period last year. The budget anticipated a 7.5% decline in deliveries.

Because the majority of revenues come from the quarterly service charge, and because of the revenues from the sales to SSWD, revenues are actually 6.5% greater than anticipated in the budget for this time of year.

1. **Rancho Del Oro Estates Development Project Pipeline Easement Grant to SJWD (R)**  
   Mr. Pierson provided the committee with a staff report, which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained that the easements provide the District the ability to install two future water supply connections that not only serve as a second source of supply to the Rancho Del Oro Estates project, but will also improve hydraulic connectivity and water supply reliability for the surrounding Retail distribution system.  

   The Engineering Committee recommends consideration of a motion to Adopt Resolution 22-08 accepting a dedicated waterline easement for a new pipeline installation to supply the Rancho Del Oro Estates development project, and authorize staff to accept and process the documents from the property owner.  

2. **Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project (W)**

He explained that there were three bids received and that the lowest bidder Myers and Sons Construction, Inc. requested relief from its bid pursuant to Public Contract Code sections 5101 and 5103 because they discovered an error in the mathematical computation and an error in the transposition of the figures that resulted in Myers’ bid being materially different than Myers’ intended bid. After consulting with legal counsel, staff recommends the contract be awarded to Steve P. Rados, Inc., the next lowest responsive, responsible bidder, in the amount of $20,139,000.00 with a total authorized budget of $22,152,900.00 which includes a 10% contingency.

He informed the committee that five bids were received and a 5-person review panel unanimously ranked Inferrera Construction Management Group, Inc. as the top Technical Proposal.

4. Material/Parts Storage Facility Project (R)  
Mr. Barela provided the committee with a staff report, which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained that this would be a 2-sided steel structure that would protect District equipment and pipe from deterioration from the sun. In addition, he explained that the structure would be placed where the old shop was previously and that it could be moved to a new location when the new Administration building is constructed in the future.

The committee discussed the cost of the building and staff explained that the cost of steel has increased substantially in the last year. Director Rich suggested that the District delay this project to see if the cost of steel will go down. Mr. Larsen voiced concern that there is a safety issue when the hoses fail and additional cost associated with replacing hoses and pipeline that get damaged from the sun. Director Rich requested that staff calculate the cost to replace the hoses, pipes, etc. that the structure would protect so that the committee has a better idea of the potential cost to the District. Ms. Silva suggested that staff look into supply chain issues that might impact ability to procure pipeline. Staff will do a cost analysis and return to the committee with more information.

5. Bacon Pump Facility Generator Replacement Project (R)  
Mr. Barela provided the committee with a staff report, which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained that the emergency generators are well beyond their useful life and need to be replaced. Ms. Silva commented that even though the bids came in above the estimated amount that was used in the financial plan, staff will budget for this project and will adjust projects so that this falls within the constraints of the financial plan and budget. Staff recommends awarding the contract to Lords Electric in the amount of $1,787,600 with a construction contingency of $178,760 (10%) for a total authorized budget of $1,966,360.

7. Other Engineering Matters  
Mr. Barela informed the committee that staff is seeing significant lead times for materials such as brass fittings and hydrants (sometimes more than 20 weeks), which is affecting operations. In addition, he reported that there has been a significant increase in the cost of chlorine gas from $750 per ton last March to $1,400 per ton currently. He informed the committee that staff is budgeting accordingly to address these increases.

In response to Director Zamorano’s question, Mr. Barela explained that there has not been a study regarding electromagnetic pulse (EMP) impacts on the District’s facilities or operations; however, the District does have a SCADA recovery plan and emergency operational plans. GM Helliker stated that staff may want to look at the effects of an EMP when reviewing the emergency response plan.
