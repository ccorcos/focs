I. **ROLL CALL**  
The Board Secretary took a roll call of the Board. The following directors were present: Ted Costa, Ken Miller, Dan Rich, Pam Tobin and Manuel Zamorano.

II. **PUBLIC FORUM**  
Mr. Mitch Dion addressed the Board regarding the state threatening to penalize water utilities regarding shut-offs due to overdue payments and wanted to know how this will impact the individual rate payer, and GM Helliker responded to his question.

III. **CONSENT CALENDAR**  
All items under the consent calendar are considered to be routine and are approved by one motion. There will be no separate discussion of these items unless a member of the Board, audience, or staff request a specific item removed after the motion to approve the Consent Calendar.

1. **Minutes of the Board of Directors Meeting, September 28, 2022 (W & R)**  
   **Recommendation:** Approve draft minutes  
   Vice President Rich moved to approve the Consent Calendar. Director Costa seconded the motion and it carried with 4 Ayes (1 abstain, Tobin).

IV. **NEW BUSINESS**  
1. **ACWA General Session Membership Meeting Delegate (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker announced that a delegate needs to be assigned for the ACWA General Session Membership Meeting on Wednesday, November 30th.  
   Director Costa moved to appoint Director Pam Tobin as delegate to serve as the authorized voting representative at the ACWA General Session Membership Meeting. Vice President Rich seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

V. **OLD BUSINESS**  
1. **FY 2022-23 Operations Plan Report Card (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker reported that everything is on track for the 1st quarter FY 2022-23 Operations Plan Report Card.

2. **2022 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker reviewed data on Folsom Reservoir, which included the current storage level at 69% of historical average, data on releases, temperature and precipitation outlooks, storage projections, and current reservoir conditions across the state.

3. **Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker reviewed a written staff report and two attachments to that report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He informed the Board that, after receiving the FOWD letter to RWA, he sent messages to Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD), Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD), Orange Vale Water Company (OVWC), and
<!-- Page 3 -->

city of Folsom suggesting that he set up a meeting soon and he received a response from CHWD and FOWD stating that they would not be available until January.

The Board discussed the possibility of partnering with FOWD and CHWD to bank water. Director Costa commented that FOWD and CHWD want to bank water otherwise they wouldn’t be drilling injection wells, so he proposed that the SJWD Board meet with the FOWD Board and CHWD Board, separately, to discuss the topic. In addition, he suggested that if FOWD and CHWD do not want to partner to bank water, then the District should look into other opportunities. GM Helliker suggested that they attend one of their board meetings and during public comment offer a meeting between the boards to discuss groundwater banking.

GM Helliker informed the Board that staff has been working with OWVC to help them put grant requests together. Since OWVC is a mutual water company, they do not have the ability to issue the required CEQA documents; therefore, San Juan staff offered to assist as the lead agency. However, since the State Water Board has to approve the water system, the State Water Board has offered to assist OWVC as the lead agency for the CEQA documentation. He explained that the grant funding would be for a treatment system on a current well (for this well, OWVC is not interested in having a partnership with the District). However, he informed the Board that OWVC has another well for which they are interested in forming a potential partnership with the District.

GM Helliker reported that Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) is interested in forming a partnership for groundwater banking and he has been meeting with their staff regarding SSWD’s groundwater program. SSWD is working on a program to rehabilitate their old wells and drill new wells. He explained that SSWD has a 5-year contract with Kirby’s Pumping with an option to acquire the company at the end of the contract term. He informed the Board that a partnership with SSWD would be a good opportunity for both agencies.

Director Costa requested that this topic be on the next Board meeting agenda so that the Board can be updated on the status of a meeting with the other agencies. GM Helliker suggested that a letter from President Miller be written to the FOWD Board to help expedite a meeting to discuss partnering for groundwater banking.

Director Zamorano moved that the Board support the sending of a letter from President Miller to the Fair Oaks Water District Board President regarding a groundwater banking partnership. Director Costa seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

VI. INFORMATION ITEMS

1. GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT
1.1 General Manager’s Monthly Report (W & R)

### 1.2 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence
GM Helliker reported that the water transfer is continuing but they were notified by the Department of Water Resources that the transfer will end once they take out the agricultural salinity barriers which are in the south part of the Delta in the next few days. He commented that this will work out well since the District is requesting that pumping be lowered due to the Hinkle Project.

GM Helliker reported that the Water Loss regulations were adopted on October 19th, and included some of the suggestions from the region. He informed the Board that the District will have some water loss reduction requirements to meet by 2028. He reported that a component study was completed by eSource to help identify where water loss is occurring and there are a few options to consider for the next step.

GM Helliker reported that the work groups to negotiate the new Water Forum agreement, which expires in 2030, are starting to meet. He informed the Board that Mr. Zlotnick will be on the habitat work group. He explained that the work group meetings will be open to the public and he will be attending the water supply work group.

GM Helliker informed the Board that Reclamation wants to wait to continue discussions on several water transfers until after the State Water Board’s water conservation regulations are adopted next year.

GM Helliker informed the Board that a follow up letter was received from Fair Oaks Water District’s legal counsel regarding their Public Records Act request. He explained that their request was regarding the water transfers to Carmichael Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District and a response will be sent.

### 2. DIRECTOR OF FINANCE’S REPORT
#### 2.1 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence
Ms. Silva reported that she informed the Finance Committee that the SRF funding for the Eureka Pipeline Replacement Project is requiring that the District procure 100% USA-made supplies for the construction material since some of the funding is federal. She stated that the requirement is a result of the Build America, Buy America Act that went into effect on May 14, 2022. She explained that there are some fittings that are not USA-made and the contractor has been requested to procure USA-made material. In addition, she explained that staff will be applying for a waiver of this requirement since most of the construction material is American made.

Ms. Silva explained that the delay on the project, at this point, has been due to supply chain issues, but that the project may be deliberately delayed long enough to obtain the waiver and allow for the agreement to be executed prior to construction completion. Mr. Pierson explained what item was the issue and the Board suggested that staff look into having the item custom manufactured. Mr. Pierson informed the Board that the project will not even begin until the

Ms. Silva reported that she was able to get the District's bank to increase the earnings credit rate from 0.2% to 0.75%.

**3. DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS’ REPORT**  
3.1 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence

**4. DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERING SERVICES’ REPORT**

2. **REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY (RWA)**

Director Costa voiced concern regarding the RWA Executive Director's salary and stated that there are 60 governors in the country and the highest paid is at $225,000. Vice President Rich reported that the RWA formed an Evaluation Committee to discuss the Executive Director’s compensation and that committee made a recommendation to the RWA Executive Committee; however, the Executive Committee did not support the Evaluation Committee’s recommendation and instead recommended a higher increase to the RWA Board, which passed it at the last RWA Board meeting.

3. **ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES (ACWA)**  
3.1 ACWA - Pam Tobin  
Director Tobin reviewed her written report that was included in the Board packet.

As part of ongoing efforts to ensure ACWA’s Bylaws are current and reflect consistency with other governance documents and daily operations and to implement changes related to the election of ACWA’s Board Officers, the Board of Directors is recommending proposed Amended and Restated Bylaws for consideration by the membership.

- Amendments to clarify language and to reflect consistency with other governance documents and daily operations
- Amendments to implement changes to the Board Officers’ election process as recommended by the Election Task Force
- Amendments to incorporate California Corporations Code provisions allowing meetings to be held by electronic communication
- Restructuring and reformatting to incorporate a new numbering system

Legal Affairs Committee (LAC) Chair, Jennifer Buckman, appointed LAC member, Doug Coty, to serve as the committee’s representative to review the proposed Amended and Restated Bylaws and provide an analysis pursuant to ACWA Bylaws (Article 9, Section 8). The proposed Amended and Restated Bylaws reflect the LAC’s recommended edits as adopted by the ACWA Board on September 23.

**AGENDA ITEM V-3**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Greg Zlotnick, Water Resources Manager**  
**Date:** October 27, 2022  
**Subject:** Groundwater Banking/Conjunctive Use Projects  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Information and Discussion  

**BACKGROUND**  
In late 2020, at the direction of the Board, we communicated with our wholesale customer agencies and other neighboring agencies, to initiate detailed discussions about potential partnerships to increase conjunctive use and groundwater banking operations. We met with Carmichael and Del Paso Manor Water Districts in late 2020, but given that we have no direct hydraulic connections with those agencies, our ability to develop partnerships for conjunctive use is limited, at best.

We met with our wholesale customer agencies (WCAs) in January 2021, but this discussion focused primarily on the Voluntary Agreement. We then met with them again three times in the fall of 2021, to attempt to define and address the topics that would be covered by any operational or financial agreements for conjunctive use programs. Attachment 1 was the agenda for the second of these meetings, but that meeting and the following meeting in December focused on the analysis that would need to be done to determine whether or not aquifer storage and recovery technology would be appropriate for any particular well location.

Beginning in February of this year, the WCAs and we turned our attention to developing and implementing a regional groundwater substitution transfer, which is one component of the operations of a conjunctive use and groundwater banking program. We now have a second year of agreements between San Juan and both Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) and Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD), which would provide some of the elements of a more comprehensive agreement or suite of agreements to define a conjunctive use and groundwater banking program. Other agreements that would serve as the foundation for this program include the wholesale water supply agreement and the agreement on the ownership and operation of the Cooperative Transmission Pipeline, as well as other related agreements, such as those that govern the delivery of water to Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) and the operation of the Antelope pump station.

Related to this subject of agreements, FOWD submitted to the Regional Water Authority the letter contained in Attachment 2, in advance of a regional discussion on October 5.

of the status of aquifer storage and recovery projects. In the letter, FOWD describes some of the work they are doing on two ASR projects, and they state that "banking of San Juan Water District (SJWD) surface water, using FOWD facilities, is the simplest and most efficient ASR program the Sacramento Region can implement". They note that they have no agreements with San Juan to do so. As just noted, we have a variety of agreements with both FOWD and CHWD that can facilitate a conjunctive use/groundwater banking program. We have followed up this letter with two requests to CHWD and FOWD to reconvene our meetings on the subject, but have yet to receive any proposed dates in response to our requests.

**Orangevale Water Company (OWC)**

As noted in our report to the Board last October, we have worked with OWC to prepare requests for funding for a treatment system to remove perchlorate from water produced from a second well. OWC did receive an allocation of $75,000 in the Corps of Engineers’ Section 219 funding in the current fiscal year with the assistance of The Ferguson Group as part of our advocacy program, and they were also successful in securing $2.5 million in funding from DWR. They are in the process of implementing the grant funding procedures for this project.

OWC has agreed that they will operate this well to participate with us in groundwater substitution transfers in the future, both for market-based transfers and for the Voluntary Agreement, so we will be working with them on agreements for these activities. They were not interested in any more specific partnership on this particular well and treatment system, but they have stated that they would like to discuss a potential partnership with San Juan on a second well project.

**SSWD**

2022 is the third year in a row that we have transferred conserved surface water supplies to SSWD, which will allow them to account for that volume of water as in-lieu banked groundwater, pursuant to the water accounting framework currently in place for the Central Area of the Sacramento Groundwater Authority. This water was delivered pursuant to the temporary transfer agreement approved by SSWD and us in March of this year (which expires at the end of February 2023). This transfer program has established the foundation for future groundwater substitution transfers, either to take advantage of market opportunities such as this year, or to meet the obligations of a Voluntary Agreement.

In their 2020 Urban Water Management Plan, SSWD identified a maximum production capacity of 79,549 acre-feet per year (AFY) from their groundwater system. Of this production capacity, they identify approximately 40,000 AFY as their reliable well field capacity (which includes a reservation of capacity to meet peak hour demands), and 35,000 AFY as the sustainable pumping estimate, to comport with the SGA Groundwater Sustainability Plan. In 2021, SSWD experienced constraints on deliveries during peak demand periods, which prompted them to do more detailed assessments of their well production capacity, and to accelerate their efforts to rehabilitate wells and install new facilities. In the October 17, 2022, Engineering Report to the Board of

Directors, SSWD listed 6 investigation/repair projects on wells in the North Service Area that are currently underway, totaling 6,900 gallons per minute of capacity (11,130 AFY), and 9 investigation/repair projects in the South Service Area, totaling 7,700 gpm (12,420 AFY). The schedule for some of these projects is adversely impacted by the availability of parts and supplies, as well as the shortage of labor in the maintenance and construction industries. To address these issues, SSWD has entered into a five-year contract with Kirby’s Pumps (one of the primary well construction contractors in the region) that dedicates the resources of that company solely to SSWD projects. At the end of that period, SSWD will also have an option to acquire the company.

SSWD also identified in their Engineering Report 6 projects to install new wells, which include 3 in the vicinity of the Antelope facilities (storage tank and pump station), and at least one other that would be able to deliver water into large transmission lines connected to the Antelope Transmission Pipeline. All of these are potential candidates for a partnership in financing and operations between SSWD and San Juan, and we are currently working with SSWD executives to develop options for such a partnership.

# Groundwater Banking – SGA Eastern Area
**Action Items – 11-2-21**

The following principles drive the establishment of a groundwater banking program. They are already implemented in the SGA Central Area via the Water Accounting Framework.

1. Principles that reflect current understanding of the underlying groundwater basin and existing management practices, including basin sustainability goals, as a foundation of the Framework;
2. Standardized methodology for determining the volume of water available for banking and withdrawal operations under the Framework;
3. Elements of a model groundwater banking program for agencies proposing groundwater exchanges under the Framework;
4. Specific roles and responsibilities of SGA staff, the SGA Board, and member agencies in implementation of the Framework.

The following is a list of action items for the development of a groundwater banking program in the SGA Eastern Area.

## Assessment of the Eastern Area Basin Hydrogeology

1. Use the COSANA groundwater model to evaluate the flow and fate of groundwater banked in the Eastern Area, including potential impacts of increased withdrawal on any existing plumes, migration of groundwater out of the Eastern Area, etc.

## Sustainability Goals and Accounting Protocol

1. Development of Eastern Area sustainability goals (presumably founded on the Groundwater Sustainability Plan). The sustainability goal in the Eastern Area would consist of any limitation on groundwater production that would be necessary to balance demands with sustainable yield.

2. Adoption of surface water delivery levels and pumping targets for each agency that has groundwater production operations to optimize conjunctive use.

3. Adoption of an accounting protocol for banked water – including groundwater banked via in-lieu use of surface water, or groundwater that is banked via injection via potential ASR wells. Water banked through use of percolation facilities (managed aquifer recharge) could also be included in the protocol, if any exist in the Eastern Area.
<!-- Page 17 -->
# Agreements for Managing Banked Water

1. Development of interagency agreements for the management of banked water, to account for the ownership of the banked water and the manner in which such water would be used, sold or transferred.

2. Development of interagency agreements for the joint construction or rehabilitation of new or existing facilities, and the ownership and operation thereof, if any such partnerships are created.

# Agreements for Financial Partnerships

1. Development of interagency agreements to define the financial contributions for the construction and operation of groundwater banking facilities, and the distribution of any revenues from sales of banked water (including via groundwater substitution transfers).

2. Consideration of any special pricing for surface water that is banked and related sharing of revenues from the sale of any such water.

3. Development of any potential modifications to the wholesale water supply agreement to accommodate any of these program elements.

# MEMORANDUM

**To:** Sacramento Region ASR Coordination Committee  
**Copy:** Jim Peifer  
**From:** Tom R. Gray  
**Date:** October 3, 2022  
**Subject:** FOWD ASR Program Update  

The Sacramento region’s conjunctive use program and the development the Sacramento Regional Water Bank (Water Bank) are critical to adapting the region’s water supplies to climate change. The Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) has a long record of actively participating in the region’s conjunctive use program. In addition, the FOWD is an active supporter of the development of the Water Bank and believes that aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) is vital to the development of the Water Bank. FOWD believes that the development of the Water Bank is the most important investment in local water supply reliability that regional water purveyors can make.

Based on the above, the FOWD decided to use its resources to immediately invest in ASR in support of the development of the Water Bank.

1. The FOWD has recently completed the development of an ASR well with a 2,300-gpm design production capacity. Equipping of this well for ASR is ready for bid.
2. The FOWD has recently completed the development of a well that can be converted to ASR with a 2,100-gpm design production capacity. Equipping of this well is underway.
3. Though we have no current agreement to do so, the FOWD believes that the banking of San Juan Water District (SJWD) surface water, using FOWD facilities, is the simplest and most efficient ASR program the Sacramento Region can implement.
4. Though we have no current agreement to do so, the FOWD could bank Carmichael Water District (CWD) surface water, using FOWD facilities.
5. Though we have no current agreement to do so, the FOWD could bank surface water from Placer County using the combined facilities of FOWD and others.
6. Though we have no current agreement to do so, the FOWD could bank surface water from south of the American river using the combined facilities of FOWD and others.
7. The FOWD could purchase and bank surface water - while serving customers groundwater.

FOWD believes that investment in ASR must be combined with enhanced ability to move water around the Sacramento Region to fully develop the Water Bank.

## American River South Interconnection Pipeline

In 2008, 2009, and 2015 areas south of the American River had to implement mandatory water conservation as water supply availability had declined. At that time, the need for increased mutual aid interconnections within the region became apparent.

**Conclusion:**
Fiscal Year 2022-23 water sales continue to be strong. While sales to CHWD, FOWD and Folsom are lower than anticipated for the quarter, the difference is more than covered by sales to SSWD and greater than anticipated groundwater substitution transfer revenues. In total, deliveries are 7.9% greater than anticipated, generating revenues that are 17% greater than anticipated for this point in time. Water transfer revenues are reported at gross amounts.

Project Research Asst II – create new position, set at 15% higher than Project Research Asst.  
Budget impact in current year – additional $41,843 in salary expenses (2.9% of total salaries budget) – SGA would pay $15K of this.  
These increased salaries and their schedules will increase with next COLA.  
The budget included covering a potential 20% bonus for Peifer, but only 5% was approved, leaving $33K to help defray these costs in current year.  
Peifer recommends approval of new salary ranges, new positions (Gov Rel Mgr, Proj Res Asst II) and retitled positions (Fin and Admin Mgr).

**Strategic Plan Survey**  
Recommended that it be shortened and put on Survey Monkey.

**Conflict of Interest Code**  
Need to add Manager of Strategic Affairs, doing so approved so it could be on consent calendar for next Board meeting.

**Investment Policy and OPEB Policy**  
Recommend staying with LAIF.

**Major Projects Program Agreement**  
Andrew Ramos stated that nine members of the Major Projects Program Agreement decided to terminate the agreement. However, when Paul Helliker noted that such a decision could only be implemented via a meeting of the program committee with a 2/3 vote, and that such a meeting had not taken place, Ramos said that terminating the agreement was distinguishable from making an amendment pursuant to Section 12 of the MPMS agreement hence a meeting of program committee was not necessary, and in any event nothing would be served by imposing more “process”.

**CIMS Agreement**  
Executive Committee agreed to recommend approval by the RWA Board.

**Ex Dir Report**  
First stakeholder meeting for the groundwater bank will occur tonight.  
Peifer met with regional agency CEOs to discuss regional “asks” on climate change.  
Peifer said he was taking a “Management Improvement” course.

# AGENDA ITEM VII-3
**Director Tobin’s Report ~ Oct 27, 2022**

**ACWA**

Metropolitan Water District invited ACWA Leadership and Staff on “The Colorado River Aqueduct Inspection Trip”. This system can move more than 1 billion gallons of water per day, with an evaporation loss of 4-5% on the entire system. The CRA was completed in 1939 and operational in 1941. The tour was courtesy of Gloria Gray who is the outgoing Chairwoman of the Board.

Met imports water from the Colorado River and CA State Water Project. The service area is about 5,200 square miles in LA, Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura Counties. It serves 20 million people and has 26 member agencies. There is a 38-member board from member agencies.

The CRA (Colorado River Aqueduct) is owned and operated by Metropolitan. It takes the water about 72 hours to travel the 242 miles from Lake Havasu to Lake Mathews, Riverside. Construction began in 1933 and was completed in 1939. Their pumping plants from east to west are Whitsett intake (lift 291 ft.); Gene (303 ft.), Iron Mtn (144 ft.), Eagle Mtn (438 ft.)| Julian Hinds (441 ft.); for a total lift of 1,617 feet. There are 144 aqueduct siphons totaling 29 miles, 29 tunnels totaling 92 miles, 63 miles of canals, and 58 miles of conduits and pipelines. This capacity moves 1,605 cubic feet of water per second.

Metropolitan’s Water Treatment Plants include Joseph Jensen, Granada Hills (capacity 750 million gallons per day), Robert A Skinner, Winchester (350 mgd), F.E. Weymouth, La Verne (520 mgd); Robert B Diemer, Yorba Linda (520 mgd); and Henry J Mills, Riverside (220 mgd.)

Their Reservoirs are Diamond Valley Lake, Hemet, (cap 810,000 AF; Lake Mathews, Riverside, 182,000 AF; Lake Skinner, Winchester 44,000 AF; Copper Basin, Gene 242,200 AF; Gene Wash, Gene 6300 AF; Live Oak, La Verne 2500 AF; Garvey, Monterey Park, 1600 AF; Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills, 1100 AF; and Orange County, Brea 212 AF. Total Capacity is 1, 072,000 AF.

Their distribution system has 830 miles of pipelines and tunnels, and 400 connections to member agencies. They produce 131 megawatts with 16 hydroelectric plants. Met has water rights pursuant to the State Water Contract signed in 1960 and financed projects including 444 miles of CA aqueduct, Lake Oroville and San Luis Reservoir. Met and LA County Sanitation Dist. are partners to develop a new source of local water called, “Pure Water Southern California” once completed it would produce up to 150 million gallons a day to serve about 500,000 households.

**Day 1 Tour:** The first day we visited the Weymouth Treatment Plant which began in 1941 and treats both Colorado River & State Water Project water and serves parts of LA County, the San Gabriel Valley, and Orange County areas. It has the capacity to treat 520 million gallons a day.
<!-- Page 50 -->
We visited Diamond Valley Lake, we drove over the west dam and stopped at Wadsworth Pumping plan.

Our overnight accommodation was at Gene Camp Village which is the hub of the Colorado River Aqueduct system and Metropolitan’s desert operation with offices, employee housing and guest lodging. Its existence began in June of 1936 when the Gene Pumping Plant was under construction. This camp was seen in the early days as a necessity and continues today. During World War II, the area was used by Gen. George S. Patton as a training ground for the armored divisions to acclimate to the equally harsh conditions of North Africa. Wild burros, snakes, mountain lions, big horn sheep, coyotes and bob cats inhabit areas throughout this region.

Day 2 Tour: After Breakfast we were bussed to the Copper Basin Reservoir for a boat tour. It holds 24,000 AF of water and is the second reservoir in the CRA system. It’s also home to a pair of nesting bald eagles, big horn sheep and other wildlife.

Next, we toured the Whitsett Pumping plant and visited Parker Dam which is located below the junction of the Colorado and Bill Williams Rivers. It’s the world’s deepest dam built by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1938. Behind the dam is Lake Havasu, covering 39 square miles. It serves as a forebay and desilting basin for the aqueduct intake; captures and delays flash floods; and regulates the river for power generation and downstream users.

In the afternoon there was a presentation by Meena Westford, Exec. Policy Advisor and a visit to the Allan Preston Museum which had construction tools, pictures, and old equipment on display from the era of the late 1920-1930’s from the variety of project of that time.

Day 3 Tour: Hoover Dam and Lake Mead. Hoover Dam is about 35 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada in Black Canyon. It’s about 300 miles downstream from Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell and is managed by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and is 726 feet high and was completed in 1936 employing 21,000 men to build it in just 5 years. The concrete base measures 660 feet wide, which about two football fields measured from end-to-end and can store 28,945,000 AF. It spans the Colorado River between Nevada & Arizona. It creates Lake Mead which is a major storage facility on the Colorado River system for California, Nevada, Arizona, and Mexico. It produces 4 billion kilowatt hours of hydroelectric power each year and serves 1.3 million people in Nevada, Arizona and California and is one of the country’s largest hydroelectric facilities.

Lake Oroville hit record low levels this year and 2021-2022 are the driest three years on record. Lake Mead and Lake Powell are at historically low elevations and the Colorado River has been in long-term drought. The Colorado River is the backbone of MWD’s supplies. In the past volumes of water in Lakes Powell and Mead has historically buffered flow variabilities in Lake Mead, but in the last 15 years, the inflow has been below the historical median. Additionally, in June of 2022; Commissioner Touton called for a 2-4 MAF of water reductions in 2023 and issues with Salton Sea, the Bureaus 24 month study results, actions to protect Glen Canyon Dam and the Key Drought Contingency Plan of 2019 are all being discussed.

# ACWA UPDATE ON PRIORITY ISSUES
A high-level look at recent ACWA activity and initiatives.

## OCTOBER 2022

### SB 222 (Dodd) - Low-Income Water Rate Assistance
Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sept. 28 vetoed SB 222, which would have created in state law a Water Rate Assistance Program (WRAP) to provide financial assistance for both drinking water and wastewater services to low-income residential ratepayers. ACWA believes a water and wastewater low-income rate assistance program - if designed in a reasonable, efficient and effective manner - is an appropriate approach. However, as re-written in 2022, the bill had many problematic provisions. ACWA and the ACWA-led SB 222 Oppose-Unless-Amended Coalition obtained many amendments to the bill. The final, Aug. 24 version of the bill still, however, proposed an inefficient and unclear mix of enrollment roles for both the State Water Resources Control Board (or its local service provider) and the water and wastewater systems. ACWA and the coalition sent letters urging the governor to veto the bill on Sept. 6. These veto requests are available at [acwa.com/resources](http://acwa.com/resources). The governor’s veto message is available at [gov.ca.gov](http://gov.ca.gov).

### ACWA-Sponsored AB 2142 (Gabriel) - California Income Tax Exclusion for Turf Replacement
ACWA’s sponsored bill AB 2142 was passed by the Legislature and signed by Governor Newsom on Sept. 28. The bill will take effect immediately and exempts benefits from California taxable income for tax years 2022 through 2026. ACWA co-sponsored this bill with the California Water Efficiency Partnership and WaterNow Alliance.

### SB 1157 (Hertzberg) - Indoor Water Use Efficiency Standards
Governor Newsom signed SB 1157 into law on Sept. 28, and it will take effect Jan. 1, 2023. The bill maintains the current standard for residential water use of 55 gallons per capita daily (gpcd) until Jan. 1, 2025, then lowers the standard to 47 gpcd until Jan. 1, 2030, with the final standard reduced to 42 gpcd. ACWA and many of its members adopted an oppose-unless-amended position on the bill early in the year and worked throughout the year with the author’s office to address concerns. The governor issued a signing message that asks the Legislature to provide funding for the Department of Water Resources (DWR) to complete the required studies and encourage the State Water Board to create variances, including a variance to reflect local investments in recycled water and infrastructure.

### Water Use Efficiency
DWR recently released recommendations that it says would improve long-term water use efficiency as California adapts to a hotter, drier future driven by climate change. The recommendations were submitted Sept. 29 to the State Water Board for approval and were a requirement under SB 606 and AB 1668 (2018), which were enacted in support of “Making Conservation a California Way of Life.” In its recommendation memo, DWR states that a full recommendation report with more details will follow. The State Water Board will evaluate DWR’s recommendations through a formal rulemaking process for the adoption of water use objectives for urban retail suppliers, which will include additional analysis, engagement, and opportunity for public comment. The water use objectives are expected to go into effect by Jan. 1, 2024. More information is available in a Regulatory Advisory that ACWA distributed on Oct. 3 at [acwa.com/notifications](http://acwa.com/notifications).

![California Water Plan Update](https://www.acwa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ACWA-October-2022-Page-2.png)

California Water Plan Update  
DWR has initiated the California Water Plan Update 2023 which will promote climate resilience across regions and water sectors with a statewide vision, clear goals, watershed planning framework and toolkit, and progress-tracking dashboard of indicators. The 2023 update will also include updated resource management strategies, water balances, future scenarios and other technical and policy-related activities. More information is available on DWR’s website at water.ca.gov.

**SAFER Drinking Water Needs Assessment**  
The State Water Board on Sept. 20 released a draft white paper that details proposed recommendations for the Drinking Water Needs Assessment Affordability Indicators. The SAFER Program is responsible for conducting an annual Needs Assessment, which includes an affordability assessment, risk assessment and cost assessment. The State Water Board is proposing enhancements to how it incorporates affordability into the Drinking Water Needs Assessment for public water systems, state small water systems, and domestic wells. Written comments are due Oct. 20 and there will be a public workshop on Nov. 1.

**Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation**  
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) in August announced a notice of public hearing to consider the Proposed Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation (ACF). CARB will not consider adoption of the ACF until early 2023. However, the public hearing will provide an opportunity for stakeholder input to CARB staff. The ACF would require California fleet owners and operators to start purchasing zero emission vehicles in 2024, with the goal to move California’s medium- and heavy-duty trucks to zero emission, where feasible, by 2045. Written comments are due Oct. 17 and a public hearing will be held Oct. 27.

**Nonprofit ACWA Foundation**  
After eight months of research, planning and discussion, the committee and four members and stakeholders approved the creation of a new nonprofit ACWA Foundation to advance workforce and leadership development by promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the water industry. The foundation’s bylaws, articles of incorporation and a finance plan also were approved by the Board and will be filed with state and federal authorities to obtain nonprofit 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. More information is available in an ACWA Advisory that was distributed Sept. 23 at acwa.com/notifications.

**Quench California Public Education Campaign**  
ACWA’s statewide 2022-’23 public education campaign Quench California continues with a social media and digital advertising effort having launched in July. The social media strategy includes use of ACWA’s Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn accounts and leverages member participation with social media graphics and customizable content. The first toolkit was distributed to members on Aug. 4 and includes customizable sample social media posts and graphics, logos and other collateral materials about agency infrastructure projects. A second toolkit will be released this month and includes an infographic and new social media graphics.

The toolkits are available to members at acwa.com/resources. More information on the campaign is available at quenchca.com.

# AGENDA ITEM VIII-1
**DRAFT**

## Finance Committee Meeting Minutes  
**San Juan Water District**  
**October 25, 2022**  
**4:00 p.m.**

**Committee Members:**  
Ted Costa, Director  
Ken Miller, Director  

**District Staff:**  
Paul Helliker, General Manager  
Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
Teri Grant, Board Secretary/Administrative Assistant  

**District Staff & Consultants:**  
Attendee  

### 1. Review General Manager Expense and Reimbursements (W & R)  
The committee reviewed the September expenses for the General Manager and found them to be in order.

### 2. Review Check Register from September 2022 (W & R)  
The committee reviewed the September check register and found the entries to be in order.

### 3. Other Finance Matters (W & R)  
Director Costa inquired if the Meter Replacement Program was still in place. GM Helliker informed the committee that Citrus Heights Water District decided to purchase different meters which were not the same as the District meters; therefore, there was no cost savings since a larger purchase was not completed. GM Helliker explained that the meter program is an annual program and staff will seek other agencies to work with.

In response to Director Miller’s question, Ms. Silva informed the committee that the SRF funding for the Eureka Pipeline Replacement Program is requiring that the District procure 100% USA-made supplies for the construction material. She stated that the requirement is a result of the Build America, Buy America Act that went into effect on May 14, 2022. She explained that there are some fittings that are not USA-made and the contractor has been requested to procure USA-made material. In addition, she will be applying for a waiver of this requirement since most of the construction material is American made.
