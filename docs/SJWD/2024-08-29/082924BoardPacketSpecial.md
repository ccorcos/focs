## V. NEW BUSINESS

1. **Customer Service Satisfaction Survey Results (R)**  
   Mr. Barrett introduced Dr. Timothy McLarney, True North Research, Inc., who conducted the survey and compiled the report. Dr. McLarney conducted a presentation which will be attached to the meeting minutes. Dr. McLarney provided background information about True North Research and the work that they perform.

   Dr. McLarney reviewed the Methodology of Study, informed the Board that there were 519 participants instead of the proposed 400, then proceeded to review the results of each question, which included the results from the 2018 survey as well. He informed the Board that the results were very positive for the District. He reviewed the Key Findings which were:

   **Positive Report Card on the District’s Performance**  
   - Familiarity with District is high and increasing  
   - Favorability is high and growing  
   - Overall customer satisfaction is high and strengthening  
   - Customer Service Representatives received high marks  
   - District appears to be striking the right balance in terms of communicating with customers  

   **Opportunity Areas**  
   - Educate customers on the true cost of water – it changes their opinion about value of service  
   - Educate customers on the availability of rebate programs for water efficient appliances  
   - Text messaging for important, time-sensitive notifications  

   The Board thanked Dr. McLarney for conducting the survey and providing the report results. In addition, the Board thanked the Customer Service Department for their hard work in providing great customer service.

2. **2024 Water Transfer (W)**  
   GM Helliker informed the Board that the purpose of the proposed water transfer to Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) is to optimize the use of the District’s surface water, generate some revenue for the District, and establish a foundation for the opportunity to participate in the Voluntary Agreement. He reviewed the written report which was included in the Board packet.
<!-- Page 7 -->
![July 17, 2024, Board Minutes Page 4](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+not+available)

GM Helliker reported that a Negative Declaration was prepared and circulated for comment on June 5, 2024, with the comment period closing on July 5, 2024. He reported that two comment letters were received, one from Citrus Heights Water District and one from Fair Oaks Water District. After review of the comment letters, it was determined that the comments do not present any evidence to contradict the analysis and conclusions in the Initial Study that no significant environmental effects will result from the transfer. In addition, he reviewed the Board actions that staff are recommending.

Vice President Costa inquired of Legal Counsel if the District approved the transfer and, then was sued, could the action be defended. Legal Counsel Ewens informed the Board that this should be discussed in Closed Session, which is on the agenda. In response to Vice President Costa’s comment, GM Helliker informed the Board that the wholesale mailer that was recently sent out, noted the cost savings to the wholesale customer agencies as a result of water transfers to SSWD. The data shows that the wholesale rates would have been 16% higher had there been no water deliveries to SSWD.

In response to Director Tobin’s question, Legal Counsel Ewens informed the Board that her firm worked on the CEQA documentation for the District. In addition, she directed the Board to the staff report that is responsive to the project falling within two exemptions under CEQA. Director Tobin inquired if this agenda item should be brought back after the Closed Session. Legal Counsel Ewens deferred to the Board’s discretion on whether they would prefer to wait to take any action until after the Closed Session. The Board discussed postponing the action until after the Closed Session.

President Zamorano opened the floor for public comment. There were no public comments made.

VI. OLD BUSINESS

1. FY 2023-24 Operations Plan Report Card (W & R)  
   GM Helliker reviewed the 4th quarter progress on the FY 2023-24 Operations Plan Report Card. He noted a few delays in the plan which are shown in the report card, but most items are complete. Mr. Andrew Pierson reported that the Kokila Reservoir Project will go out to bid in the Fall and EPA Grant funds will be used for that project.

2. FY 2024-25 Operations Plan (W & R)  
   GM Helliker reviewed the FY 2024-25 Operations Plan, which will be attached to the Board minutes. He explained that the Operations Plan shows some of the larger or more significant items to track for the current year.

**Page 5**

discussed how to capture the groundwater banking activity that has occurred over the past twenty years and apply it to the water bank. For some of the activities, they all agreed that there was a zero balance in the system for those items; however, for other activities they are still debating on how to account for that water in the water accounting framework.

4. **2024 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)**  
GM Helliker reviewed data which included the current reservoir storage levels across the state, data on releases, temperature and precipitation outlooks, and storage levels and projections at Folsom Reservoir.

   1.1 **General Manager’s Monthly Report (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker provided the Board with a written report for June which was included in the Board packet.

   1.2 **Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence**  
   GM Helliker reported that the State Water Board adopted the Conservation Regulations on July 3rd. He informed the Board that a fifth comment period was opened up that should not affect the substance of the regulations. He reviewed some data regarding irrigated vs irrigable landscape and the impact to various agencies including San Juan. He explained that with the recently adopted regulations, San Juan will have to meet a 23% reduction in deliveries by 2040 based on irrigated landscape as opposed to 1% if the regulation was based on the irrigable landscape specification in the statute.

   GM Helliker reported that the Water Forum agreement update is almost complete after four years. He informed the Board that the conservation element in the agreement is still being discussed. In addition, he reported that Sacramento County sent a letter to the Water Forum last October stating that their contribution was being reduced from approximately $1 million per year to $800,000; however, they recently stated that they want to reduce their contribution to zero. GM Helliker reviewed a table that showed the amounts which the agencies would be charged with San Juan paying $10,000 for the Sacramento County area in addition to the $15,000 that the District already pays.

**Back to Agenda**  
**AGENDA ITEM III-2**  

**STAFF REPORT**  

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** August 29, 2024  
**Subject:** Treasurer’s Report – Quarter Ending June 30, 2024  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
This report is for information only and will be filed with the meeting minutes.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The purpose of the treasurer’s report is to update the Board and the public on the status of the District’s cash balances and investments and highlight material changes from one period to another. The scope of this report covers the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023-2024, ending June 30, 2024.  

The District’s investment objectives are established by the Board approved Investment Policy. The Investment Policy is guided and constrained by the California Government Code. The Board periodically reviews and adjusts the Investment Policy to ensure ongoing compliance with the government code and to maximize investment flexibility as permitted. The current Investment Policy has the following objectives for the portfolio:  
1. Safety  
2. Liquidity  
3. Yield  

Attached is the quarterly Treasurer’s Report for the three months ended June 30, 2024.  

At March 31, 2024, the end of the previous quarter, the value of the District’s total portfolio was $53.6 million. Since that time, the value of the District’s portfolio increased by $358,596 for an ending balance of $53.96 million as of June 30, 2024. Cash and short-term investments increased by $521,683. Medium term investments decreased by $228,718 and long-term investments increased by $65,632.  

The funds are currently held as follows:  
- Cash at Banking Institutions: $1,514,066.03  
- California Asset Management Pool (CAMP): $31,838,555.11  
- Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF): $11,040,663.15  
- PFM Managed Investment Portfolio: $10,019,047.03  

**Total:** $53,957,331.32  
<!-- Page 13 -->
![Distribution of Investments](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
The overall portfolio is diversified with 19% invested in marketable securities (PFM Portfolio), 78% invested in short-term investments that are considered liquid (LAIF and CAMP) and 3% on deposit with US Bank. Staff, in conjunction with your financial advisors, periodically review the mix of liquid and long-term investments and adjust the portfolio according to the market conditions and the District’s short term cash needs.

All securities held are in conformance with those permitted by the District’s Investment Policy. There are sufficient funds to meet the District’s expenditure requirements for the next six months.

The mix and duration of investments are displayed in the following charts:

### Distribution of Investments
- Cash In Checking 3%
- CAMP 58%
- LAIF 20%
- PFM Portfolio 19%

### Mix of Investments - PFM Portfolio
- U.S. Treasury Bonds/Notes
- Federal Agency Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities
- Federal Agency Bonds/Notes
- Corporate Notes
- Asset-Backed Security/Collateralized Mortgage Obligations
- Municipal Bonds/Notes
- Supra-National Agency Bonds/Notes
<!-- Page 14 -->
![Duration of PFM Portfolio](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Duration+of+PFM+Portfolio)

The quarter was characterized by moderating economic growth, inflation resuming its slowing trend as it inches closer to the Fed’s 2% target. The Federal Reserve held rates constant, but expectations on future rate cuts have increased.

The portfolio continues to perform well relative to the benchmark (Bank of America Merrill Lynch “BAML” 0-5 year Treasury Index) on an historical basis.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tony Barela, Director of Operations  
**Date:** August 29, 2024  
**Subject:** Pump Stations Optimization Evaluation Project (R)

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to approve the Director of Operations to enter into a Professional Services Agreement with Water Systems Consulting, Inc. (WSC) to provide professional engineering services for the Pump Stations Optimization Evaluation Project (Project) in the amount of $196,362 with a total authorized budget of $216,000, which includes a 10% contingency. The Engineering Committee Chair requested that this item be brought directly to the Board for consideration.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
In the past several years, the District has made improvements to certain pump stations by installing jockey pumps and variable frequency drives (VFD) to better manage pumping efficiencies during low demands in the system. It was observed that these improvements had significant positive effects on power consumption and operational efficiency. Inefficiencies at the pump stations reduced demands on the system due to conversion resulting in pumps being oversized, the age and health of the pumps, and changes in customer time of day usage. This coming year, Kokila Reservoir will be replaced with a new pressurized concrete tank that will have a larger operational capacity than the existing reservoir. This replacement, in concert with system control valve stations, may provide an opportunity to reimagine the Gravity, Bacon, and Sierra Pressure Zones (PZ).

The primary focus of this project is to complete a detailed data-driven review of the District's pump stations operation to determine where additional improvements can be made to increase efficiency, extend the life of existing assets, and reduce overall costs of operations. Additionally, the Consultant will model possible modifications to our retail pressure zones to optimize our operations for water deliveries.

---

**CURRENT STATUS**  
On June 6, 2024, the District issued an RFP requesting proposals for professional engineering services. On June 19, 2024, the District held an Pre-Proposal Conference, which eight (8) engineering consultants attended. One (1) firm submitted a proposal on July 11, 2024. The Technical Proposal was reviewed by staff and is in conformance with the requirements of the RFP. Subsequent to the technical review, the Cost Proposal was opened and reviewed. The following table lists the proposal total amount from WSC.

| Consultant                     | Proposal Total Amount |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Water Systems Consulting, Inc. | $196,362              |

The total amount proposed by WSC appears reasonable and in line with the effort requested in the RFP.

---

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
The Project is included in the District’s approved Retail CIP budget in FY24/25.

**Subject:** Discussion on Low Income Rate Assistance Programs (R)  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Discussion  

**BACKGROUND**  
At the June 26, 2024, Board meeting, Director Miller requested a discussion on Low Income Rate Assistance Programs. After some discussion, the Board directed staff to research available legal funding sources for such a program, and the threshold for “low-income” and to bring the results of the research back for discussion at the August Board meeting.  

**ANALYSIS**  
Because utilities are vital to public health and safety, some public utilities offer rate assistance programs to low-income households, providing discounted utility services. However, the California Constitution prohibits the use of water rate revenues to fund these programs. Article 13D of the California Constitution, added in 1996 by Proposition 218, states in section 6(2)(b) that:  

(1) Revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not exceed the funds required to provide the property related service.  
(2) Revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which the fee or charge was imposed;  
(3) The amount of a fee or charge imposed upon any parcel or person as an incident of property ownership shall not exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel.  
(4) No fee or charge may be imposed for a service unless that service is actually used by, or immediately available to, the owner of the property in question….  
(5) No fee or charge may be imposed for general governmental services….  

In summary, the law requires water rates to be no higher than the cost of providing the service to the property. Utilizing rate revenues to fund low-income rate assistance programs would result in rates that exceeded the cost of providing service to any individual property and is therefore unlawful. Consequently, the agencies that provide these programs must find an alternative revenue source to fund them. In a city, the funding usually comes via a transfer of property or sales tax revenues from the General Fund. Those revenues are generally not otherwise used or available by the.

water utility fund and are considered legal funding sources for low-income rate assistance programs.

San Juan Water District has two sources of the similar revenue (non-rate revenue), property taxes and cell tower leases. While these revenue sources are currently considered legal funding sources for a low-income rate assistance program, it is slightly different than a city. This is because unlike a City, San Juan Water District does not have a “General Fund”. Rather, property tax revenues and cell tower lease revenues are received directly into the water utility fund where they are used to defray operating and capital costs, thereby lowering rates for all customers. Redirecting these revenues to fund a low-income rate assistance program will create the need for an overall rate increase, as the funds will no longer be available to defray operating and capital expenses. Even without these revenues, customers are still not paying more than the cost of providing the service. However, the fact that historically these revenues have been used to lower rates creates some risk of a potential legal challenge.

Another consideration is how this program would apply to rental properties. It is the property owner’s obligation to provide access to water. As such, the account is always in the name of the property owner. When the owner requires the tenant to pay the bill, a copy is sent to both the owner and the property address. The District frequently doesn’t even know the name of the tenant. The fixed portion of the bill funds the ongoing maintenance and improvements to the system, which benefits the property owner over time. When landlords require their tenants to pay the water bill, they are passing this cost directly to the tenant, but retaining the benefit of a well-maintained drinking water distribution system. If the tenant does not pay the bill, it ultimately ends up as a tax lien against the property, and the owner is responsible for payment. If the District had provided a discounted rate, due to the low-income status of the tenant, and the tenant doesn’t pay the bill, the property owner, who likely is not low-income, would be the beneficiary of the lower rate.

San Juan’s current revenues from property taxes that are allocated to the retail fund are $1,530,000. The current revenues from cell tower leases are $47,300. The total of these revenue sources is $1,577,300, which is 7.2% of our annual retail revenues. If all these funds were used for low-income rate assistance, additional rate revenue of a similar amount would be necessary to offset this funding shortfall, which would represent a one-time rate increase of approximately 9%.

If San Juan Water District were to offer a low-income rate assistance program, it would have to determine several criteria including the threshold for income eligibility. In looking at similar programs offered in the region, there appear to be two common thresholds used, 200% of the federal poverty level or the income thresholds for eligibility in the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program. The two income thresholds are as follows:

| 10                    | $126,960          |

The levels are the same except that the CARE program starts eligibility at a higher income than 2 times the federal poverty level. CARE's first step is 1-2 persons per household, which is the same as 2 times the federal poverty level for a household of two people. Staff is aware of six agencies in the region that offer this program, as follows:

- City of Folsom
- City of Lincoln
- City of Sacramento
- California American Water Company
- Golden State Water Company
- Sacramento County Water Agency

Of the entities that provide the program, only the City of Folsom uses the federal poverty level; the rest use the CARE program threshold. Except for the City of Folsom, none of the District's Wholesale Customer Agencies offer such a program, nor does the Sacramento Suburban Water District.

According to the census reporter website at [Granite Bay, CA - Profile data - Census Reporter](https://example.com), approximately 5% of the population in Granite Bay have incomes below the poverty level. If the threshold for program participation is approximately 2 times the federal poverty level, that means that approximately 10% of San Juan Water District customers may be eligible for a low-income rate assistance program. If the District excluded multi-family housing from the program, as most programs do, then the number eligible would likely be considerably lower. Multi-family housing is usually excluded because they are on a master meter, paid by the property owner, not the tenant.

Should the Board decide to pursue a low-income rate assistance program, it will need to determine a number of other criteria such as the amount of the discount, including whether it should be a fixed monthly amount or a percentage of the bill, the duration of eligibility, whether or not to require proof of income and what that proof would be, whether or not to cap the amount of money to be diverted to the program, and whether or not to restrict the program to single family residences. This information would need to be included in the Retail Financial Plan and Rate Study, currently underway, to ensure rates are sufficient to meet the operating and capital needs of the retail division.

**AGENDA ITEM IV-3**  

**STAFF REPORT**  

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** August 29, 2024  
**Subject:** Allegations of Violations of Brown Act  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Discussion and Possible Action  

**BACKGROUND**  
Director Pam Tobin has made various allegations about purported violations of the Brown Act by General Manager Paul Helliker. Legal Counsel Ryan Jones has refuted these allegations, advising the Board of Directors that Helliker’s actions relative to these allegations do not violate the Brown Act.  

**BROWN ACT**  
Government Code Section 54950 et seq., known as the Ralph M. Brown Act (Brown Act), was created by the Legislature to ensure that decisions of local government bodies are open and transparent. Among other provisions, this law prohibits “serial meetings”, in which elected officials deliberate and make decisions outside of public meetings. This law allows staff of local government agencies to communicate with elected officials outside of governing body meetings about matters under the jurisdiction of the agency, as long as such communications do not convey the positions or comments of the other members of the legislative body. The relevant statutory language in the Government Code is:  

“54952.2 (a) As used in this chapter, ‘meeting’ means any congregation of a majority of the members of a legislative body at the same time and location, including teleconference location as permitted by Section 54953, to hear, discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body.  
(b) (1) A

![Staff Report – Brown Act Allegations](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Staff+Report+%E2%80%93+Brown+Act+Allegations)

**Staff Report – Brown Act Allegations**  
August 29, 2024  

At the February 28, 2024 Board meeting, and in her March 2024 comments on Helliker's performance for 2023-24, Director Tobin alleged that Helliker’s handling of Director Tobin’s past president expenses on expected duties, and discussions with Board members and Steve LaMar from Irvine Ranch WD and Contra Costa Water District violated the Brown Act. Helliker had consulted with LaMar in May of 2023 concerning expenses of ACWA past presidents, in order to prepare San Juan’s 2023-24 budget. At no time did Helliker convey the position of any San Juan Board member to any other San Juan Board member on the subject of expenses proposed or incurred by Director Tobin. In response to these allegations, Legal Counsel Jones advised the Board that Helliker had not violated the Brown Act.

During the process of the Board’s deliberations on Helliker’s performance in 2022-23, Helliker prepared responses to the Board’s comments in the performance review form, and sent the responses to the Board. Director Tobin subsequently accused Helliker of violating the Brown Act by transmitting his comments to the Board. Legal Counsel Jones advised the Board that Helliker’s action had not violated the Brown Act.

Director Tobin has made other similar accusations about Helliker violating the Brown Act by communicating with San Juan Board members outside of Board meetings to provide information or answer their questions. None of these actions by Helliker have violated the Brown Act, and indeed they have all been explicitly authorized by Section 54952.2(b) of the Government Code.

**CONCLUSION**  

Director Tobin’s accusations about Helliker’s actions violating the Brown Act are unsubstantiated, and Legal Counsel Jones has advised Director Tobin and other members of the Board that Helliker’s actions are legal. The proper venue for addressing any purported Brown Act violations is through the judicial system.

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance and Human Resources  
**Date:** August 29, 2024  
**Subject:** Introduction of Ordinance No. 24-03 Amending Ordinance 2000 – Management of the District, and Ordinance 5000 – Rules and Regulations for Employer-Employee Relations  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Introduce and waive the first reading of Ordinance No. 24-03 – An Ordinance of the Board of Directors of the San Juan Water District amending Ordinances 2000 and 5000.

**BACKGROUND**  
Staff are conducting a comprehensive review and update of the District’s Ordinances, an effort which was last conducted in 2008. At least 13 ordinances have recently been updated or are in the process of being updated.

**ANALYSIS**  
During this ordinance review process, staff discovered that Ordinances 2000 – Management of the District and 5000 – Rules and Regulations for Employer-Employee Relations contained references to the Policies and Procedures Manual dated May 15, 2002. This manual has been superseded multiple times, most recently in 2006, then in 2020 by the revamped Personnel Manual. Both ordinances need to be amended to change the reference to the Policies and Procedures Manual to the Personnel Manual.

Furthermore, Ordinance 5000 states that the 2002 Policies and Procedures Manual must be approved by the Board of Directors. In December of 2020, when the Policies and Procedures Manual, a collection of multiple board policies, was consolidated into one document (the “Personnel Manual”), the Board approved delegating authority for future amendments of all but two chapters of the Personnel Manual to the General Manager. The Board of Directors retained authority for Wages and Benefits and Employer/Employee Relations, discussed in Chapters 4 and 7, respectively, of the Personnel Manual. Ordinance 5000 needs to be amended to reflect this delegation and retention of authority as well as the topics covered by the two chapters still subject to Board approval.

Both ordinances are attached for review.

## Conclusion:
Fiscal Year 2024-25 water sales are off to a good start. July water sales to all customers, except the Granite Bay Golf Course were more than anticipated in the budget. The largest acre feet variances were from FOWD and SSWD. FOWD provided an estimate that was significantly higher than historical use. Staff used a lower estimate to be conservative. SSWD also provided a higher estimate than was used to build the budget. If this pattern of demand continues, the budget will likely be significantly lower than actual deliveries and therefore revenues. In total, deliveries for July were 23% greater than anticipated, yielding revenues that are 15.9% above budget.
