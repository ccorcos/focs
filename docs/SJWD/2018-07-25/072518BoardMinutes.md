II. **PUBLIC FORUM**  
There were no public comments.

III. **CONSENT CALENDAR**  
All items under the consent calendar are considered to be routine and are approved by one motion. There will be no separate discussion of these items unless a member of the Board, audience, or staff request a specific item removed after the motion to approve the Consent Calendar.

1. **Minutes of the Board of Directors Meeting, June 27, 2018 (W & R)**  
   **Recommendation:** Approve draft minutes

2. **Public Outreach Contract (W & R)**  
   **Recommendation:** Approve the Crocker & Crocker contract for FY 2018-19

3. **Fair Oaks 40-Inch Pipeline Relining Project, Construction Management and Inspection Services (W & R)**  
   **Recommendation:** Approve the award for Construction Management/ Inspection Services related to the FO-40” Pipeline Relining Project to ICM Group, Inc. in the amount of $180,680, with a total approved budget of $195,140

In response to Director Costa’s question, the Board Secretary informed the Board that the Fair Oaks Water District received an email for the Engineering Committee meeting and this Board meeting with the Fair Oaks 40-Inch Pipeline Relining Project included as an agenda item.

Director Miller moved to approve the Consent Calendar. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

IV. **OLD BUSINESS**

1. **Committee Charters (W & R)**  
   Mr. Helliker provided the Board with a written staff report that will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained that the committee charters were worked on last year but were not formally approved by the Board. He informed the Board that, with the exception of the Legal Affairs Committee which has not met for over a year and a half, the committees have all reviewed and approved their committee charter. Mr. Helliker informed the Board that he had suggested that the Legal Affairs Committee be disbanded last year but that was at the Board’s discretion.

President Hanneman called for questions and stated that the committee charters and the disbanding of the Legal Affairs Committee was being recommended by staff. Director Costa requested that they be considered separately.
<!-- Page 3 -->
Director Costa moved to approve the committee charters. President Hanneman seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

Director Costa voiced concern about disbanding the Legal Affairs Committee and stated that it serves a unique interest different from any other committee and that the General Manager and Legal Counsel work for the Board. In addition, he stated concern regarding Legal Counsel working only with the General Manager and not with the Board.

Director Tobin agreed with Director Costa. Director Rich commented that since the committee hasn’t met for over a year that the committee probably isn’t needed and if there are any legal issues then the whole Board should receive the information at the same time, but he didn’t really have a preference. Director Miller and President Hanneman did not have a preference. President Hanneman directed Mr. Helliker to draft a charter for the Legal Affairs Committee for review at the August Board meeting.

Mr. Helliker commented that Legal Counsel does work for the Board; however, he works closely with Legal Counsel on various issues and if there are items that need to be addressed by the Board then they are brought to a meeting. Furthermore, Mr. Helliker commented that the Board can request an update on any issue from Legal Counsel if they feel there is an item that was not brought before them.

2. SJWD/FOWD 2x2 Committee (W & R)  
Mr. Helliker informed the Board that the SJWD/FOWD 2x2 Committee met on July 11, 2018. He provided the Board with a written staff report that will be attached to the meeting minutes. He informed the Board that FOWD is interested in establishing a take-or-pay contract so he provided them with information which is contained in the staff report. In addition, FOWD would like revise the contract and have a termination date of 2022 and have language in the contract which gives them the ability to decide what rates they should pay. FOWD will prepare a draft of the contract changes they want, which will be discussed at the next 2x2 committee meeting. The Board discussed past, current and projected water deliveries to FOWD.

Ms. Silva informed the Board that the rate covenants for the bonds require that the District set the rates that are sufficient to meet the debt service coverage ratios. She commented that changing the contract for FOWD should still meet the rate covenant; however, it might result in rate increases for the wholesale customer agencies in order to meet the debt service coverage requirements. In addition, she explained that the greatest risk might be a negative effect to the District’s credit rating, which would result in a higher interest rate the next time the District goes out to issue debt, which she confirmed with bond legal counsel. President Hanneman requested that staff attain a written statement from bond legal counsel which outlines this information.

V. NEW BUSINESS  
1. FY 2018-19 Operations Plan (W & R)  
   Mr. Helliker reported that the Strategic Plan was completed in FY 2017-18 and staff recently completed the Operations Plan for FY 2018-19 which outlines some specific projects and tasks which staff will complete this year. He explained that the Operations Plan is not a complete list of every task that District staff complete, but instead a highlighted list for the Board. A copy of the staff report and Operations Plan will be attached to the meeting minutes.  

   Mr. Helliker informed the Board that a quarterly report card will be given to the Board for review and information with the first report card being presented in October. He reviewed some minor changes that were made to the Operations Plan after it was mailed to the Board. He explained that some of the items from the Management Action Plan list, which was created by Keith Durkin, was used in the development of the Operations Plan. Director Tobin requested to see the list of items from Keith’s list that were left off. Mr. Helliker will provide the final version of Keith’s list to the Board which was from FY 2017-18.  

VI. INFORMATION ITEMS  
1. GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT  
   1.1 General Manager’s Monthly Report (W & R)  
   Mr. Helliker provided the Board with a written report for June which will be attached to the meeting minutes.  

   1.2 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence  
   Mr. Helliker reported that Folsom Reservoir storage is at 69% of average, and temperatures are projected to be above normal for the next three months.  

   Mr. Helliker informed the Board that the water transfer utilizing FOWD groundwater substitution began July 6, 2018, and the transfer utilizing CHWD groundwater substitution began July 13, 2018. He explained that there could be a loss in revenue due to the delays; however, the agencies will try to make up the pumping over the course of the transfer window. In addition, he mentioned that the conserved water transfer process is being worked on and an agreement on the methodology with DWR may be received in the next couple of months.  

   Mr. Helliker reported that the $423,000 rebate check from Reclamation was received and another $6,000 rebate check will be received shortly. He informed the Board that the Customer Satisfaction Survey results will be brought back to the Board at the next meeting.

2. DIRECTOR OF FINANCE’S REPORT  
   2.1 Staff Recognition (W & R)  
   Ms. Silva shared the accomplishments of an employee, based on the examples noted in his performance evaluation. She shared information on Jonathan Fulton.  

   2.2 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence  
   Ms. Silva informed the Board that Greg Zlotnick, Rob Watson and herself have been working on the WIFIA letter of interest which is due on July 31, 2018. She explained that the WIFIA rate is set at the U.S Treasury rate for the same period which is expected to be about half of what the interest rate would be for a bond issuance. In addition, she explained that if the District is invited to apply for funding, then the District would have to pay $100,000 application fee. The WIFIA funding would only cover 49% of the project and the remaining funding could come from SRF. She explained that the SRF rate is set at the State of California Government Obligation Bond which is slightly higher than the WIFIA rate. President Hanneman requested the current rate comparisons.  

3. OPERATION MANAGER’S REPORT  
   3.1 Asbestos and Lead Building Inspection/Survey Report  
   Mr. Barela informed the Board that an Asbestos and Lead Assessment was performed by National Analytical Laboratories on the District’s Administration Building, Field Services/Engineering Building, and WTP Operations Building. He conducted a brief presentation which will be attached to the meeting minutes. The results show that there are no lead issues and, out of 73 asbestos samples, there were three found to contain asbestos containing construction materials (ACCM) in the tiles and mastic in all 3 buildings.  

   Mr. Barela informed the Board that the asbestos is contained and non-friable, and would require a Certified Asbestos Abatement Contractor if disturbed. He explained that when the flooring was installed, most likely, the old asbestos containing mastic was not completely removed. In addition, he reported that there are rodent droppings above the ceiling tiles in the Administration Building; therefore, PPE is required for work in that area. He explained that the rodent issue was abated last year with the use of a pest control company.  

   3.2 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence  
   There were no other issues discussed.  

4. LEGAL COUNSEL’S REPORT  
   4.1 Legal Matters  
   No report.

THIS AGREEMENT is made this July 1, 2018, in Granite Bay, California, between the San Juan Water District (“District”), a California public agency, and Crocker & Crocker, a California Corporation (“Consultant”), concerning Retail and Wholesale Public Outreach 2018-2019 (the “Work”). The parties agree as follows:

1. **Scope of Work.** Consultant shall perform the work described in Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein, and described as follows: Retail & Wholesale Public Outreach 2018-2019 (the “Work”). Consultant shall: (a) provide all labor, equipment, material and supplies required or necessary to properly, competently, and completely perform the Work under this Agreement; and (b) determine the method, details and means of doing the Work.

2. **Compensation.**

   a. In exchange for the Work, District shall pay to Consultant a fee based on the fee arrangement described on Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein.

   b. The total fee for the Work shall not exceed $94,405. There shall be no compensation for extra or additional work or services by Consultant unless approved in advance in writing by District. Consultant’s fee shall include all of Consultant’s costs and expenses related to the work.

   c. At the end of each month, Consultant shall submit to District an invoice for the Work performed during the preceding month. The invoice shall include a brief description of the Work performed, the dates of Work, number of hours worked and by whom (if payment is based on time), and an itemization of any reimbursable expenditures. If the Work is satisfactorily completed and the invoice is accurately computed, District shall pay the invoice within 30 days of its receipt.

3. **Term and Termination.**

   a. This Agreement shall take effect on the above date and continue in effect until completion of the Work, unless sooner terminated as provided below. Time is of the essence in this Agreement. Consultant shall complete the Work no later than June 30, 2019.

   b. This Agreement may be terminated at any time by District upon 10 days’ advance written notice to Consultant.

The parties agree that Consultant is not a designated employee within the meaning of the Political Reform Act and District’s conflict of interest code because Consultant will perform the Work independent of the control and direction of the District or of any District official, other than normal contract monitoring, and Consultant possesses no authority with respect to any District decision beyond the rendition of information, advice, recommendation or counsel.

District may inspect and audit such books and records, including source documents, to verify all charges, payments and reimbursable costs under this Agreement.

Consultant may retain a copy of any Work Product and use, reproduce, publish, display, broadcast and distribute any Work Product and prepare derivative and additional documents or works based on any Work Product; provided, however, that Consultant shall not provide any Work Product to any third party without District’s prior written approval, unless compelled to do so by legal process.

b. If any Work Product is copyrightable, Consultant may copyright the same, except that, as to any Work Product that is copyrighted by Consultant, District reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, world-wide, and irrevocable license to use, reuse, reproduce, publish, display, broadcast and distribute the Work Product and to prepare derivative and additional documents or works based on the Work Product.

<!-- Page 12 -->
b. If Commercial General Liability Insurance or other form with a general aggregate limit or products-completed operations aggregate limit is used, either the general aggregate limit shall apply separately to the Work/location (with the ISO CG 2503, or ISO CG 2504, or insurer’s equivalent endorsement provided to District), or the general aggregate limit and products-completed operations aggregate limit shall be twice the required occurrence limit.

c.

g. Consultant’s coverage will be endorsed to be primary and apply separately to each insurer against whom claim is made or suit is brought, except with respect to the limits of the insurer’s liability, and District’s insurance or self-insurance, if any, will be excess and will not contribute with Consultant’s insurance (at least as broad as ISO endorsement CG 20 01).

h. Insurance is to be written on policy forms acceptable to District and be placed with insurers with a current A.M. Best’s rating of A:VII or better and that are admitted to do business in and good standing in California, unless otherwise acceptable upon notice to and approval by District.

**Endorsements Prior to Starting the Work**

j. The requirements as to the types, limits, and District’s approval of insurance coverage to be maintained by the Consultant are not intended to and shall not in any manner limit or qualify the liabilities and obligations assumed by Consultant under this Agreement. In addition, in the event any change is made in the insurance carrier, policies or nature of coverage required under this Agreement, Consultant shall notify District prior to making such changes.

k. Consultant shall ensure that all required insurance coverages are maintained throughout the term of this Agreement. If any of the required coverages expire during the term of this Agreement, Consultant shall deliver renewal certificates and any required endorsements to District at least 10 days before the expiration date.

1. Consultant’s insurance shall apply separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought, except with respect to the limits of the insurer’s liability.

m. Insurance deductibles or self-insured retentions shall be declared by Consultant, and such deductibles and retentions shall be approved by District before Consultant commences the Work. At the election of District, Consultant shall either: (1) reduce or eliminate such deductibles or self-insured retentions; or (2) procure a bond which guarantees payment of losses and related investigations, claims administration, and defense costs and expenses.

n. Consultant shall, upon demand, deliver to District the certificates of insurance required under this section II and the receipts for payment of premiums thereon.

**12. Indemnification.**

a. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Consultant shall immediately indemnify, defend (with counsel approved by District), protect, and hold harmless District, and its directors, officers, employees, authorized volunteers, and agents from and against any and all actions, judgments, legal or administrative proceedings, arbitrations, claims, demands, damages, liabilities, interest, and costs (including, without limitation, attorney’s, expert witness and consultant fees and expenses, fines, penalties, and litigation costs and expenses) of every nature (“claims” or “claim”), arising out of, pertaining to or in any way connected with the negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct of Consultant’s, or its employees’, agents’ or subcontractors’, negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct arising out of or in any manner directly or indirectly connected with the Work to be performed under this Agreement, however caused, regardless of any negligence of District, or its directors, officers, employees, authorized volunteers, or agents (including passive negligence), except if caused by the sole negligence or willful misconduct or active negligence of District, or its directors, officers, employees, authorized volunteers, or agents, or as otherwise provided or limited by law.

b. Consultant’s obligations under this indemnification provision shall survive the completion of Work under, or the termination of, this Agreement. Submission of insurance certificates or submission of other proof of compliance with the insurance requirements in this Agreement does not relieve Consultant from liability under this provision. The obligations of this provision shall apply whether or not such insurance policies shall have been determined to be applicable to any claims.

c. By executing this Agreement, Consultant specifically acknowledges that: (1) the duty to defend provided in this indemnification provision is a separate and distinct obligation from

Consultant’s duty to indemnify District; (2) Consultant shall defend District and other indemnified parties in any legal, equitable, administrative, or special proceedings asserting a claim covered by this indemnity, including any claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act or other federal or state disability access or discrimination laws; (3) Consultant shall pay and satisfy any judgment, award or decree that may be rendered against District, or its directors, officers, employees, authorized volunteers, or agents, in any and all suits, actions, or other legal or administrative proceedings asserting a claim covered by this indemnity and otherwise not barred by subsection (a) of this Section 12; and (4) Consultant shall reimburse District, or its directors, officers, employees, authorized volunteers, or agents, for any and all legal expenses and costs incurred by each of them in connection therewith or in enforcing the indemnity herein provided.

13. Subcontractors. No subcontract shall be awarded nor any subcontractor engaged by Consultant without District’s prior written approval. Consultant shall be responsible for requiring and confirming that each approved subcontractor meets the minimum insurance requirements specified in Sections 10 and 11 of this Agreement. Any approved subcontractor shall be covered by Consultant’s insurance in accordance with the insurance requirements of Sections 10 and 11 of this Agreement or such subcontractor shall obtain the required insurance coverages and provide proof of same to District in the manner provided in Section 11 of this Agreement.

14. Independent Contractor. It is expressly understood and agreed by the parties that Consultant’s relationship to District is that of an independent contractor. All persons hired by Consultant and performing the Work shall be Consultant’s employees or agents. Consultant and its officers, employees, subcontractors, and agents are not District employees, and they are not entitled to District employment salary, wages or benefits. Consultant shall pay, and District shall not be responsible in any way for, the salary, wages, workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance, disability insurance, tax withholding, and benefits to and on behalf of Consultant’s employees. Consultant shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify District, and its directors, officers, employees, authorized volunteers, and agents, from and against any and all liability, penalties, expenses and costs resulting from any adverse determination by the United States Internal Revenue Service, California Franchise Tax Board or other federal or state agency concerning Consultant’s independent contractor status.

15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the attached exhibits represent the sole, final, complete, exclusive, and integrated expression and statement of the terms of the agreement between District and Consultant concerning the Work. There are no written or oral agreements, conditions, representations, warranties, or promises with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement except those contained in or referred to in this writing. No modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless and until such modification is evidenced by a writing signed by both parties to this Agreement.

16. Successors and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding on, and inure to the benefit of, the heirs, successors, and assigns of the parties. However, Consultant agrees that it will not subcontract, assign, transfer, convey, or otherwise dispose of this Agreement or any part thereof, or its rights, title or interest therein, or its power to execute the same without the prior written consent of District, which shall be given or refused in the District’s sole discretion.

17. Severability. If any part of this Agreement is held to be void, invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then the remaining parts will continue in full force and effect and be fully binding, provided that each party still receives the benefits of this Agreement.

18. **No Waiver of Rights.** Any waiver at any time by either District or Consultant of its rights as to a breach or default of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver as to any other breach or default.

Prevailing Wage Work not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for work of a similar character in the locality of District, and not less than the general rate of per diem wages for holiday and overtime work, as established pursuant to the California Labor Code and regulations and orders issued thereunder.

b. Eight-Hour Day Limitation. Consultant agrees that 8 hours’ labor shall constitute a day’s work, and that no worker in the employ of Consultant or any subcontractor performing or contracting to perform Prevailing Wage Work shall work more than 8 hours in any one calendar day and 40 hours in any one calendar week; provided that subject to California Labor Code section 1815, a worker may perform Prevailing Wage Work in excess of 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week at not less than one and one-half times the basic rate of pay. Except as provided above for overtime, Consultant shall forfeit as a penalty the sum of $25 for each worker employed in the execution of this Agreement by it or by any subcontractor under it and performing Prevailing Wage Work for each calendar day during which such worker is required or permitted to work more than 8 hours in any one day and 40 hours in any one calendar week in violation of California Labor Code sections 1810 through 1815.

c. Payroll Records. Consultant and each subcontractor shall keep an accurate payroll record showing the name, address, social security number, work classification, straight time and overtime hours worked each day and week, and the actual per diem wages paid to each journeyperson, apprentice, worker or other employee employed in connection with Prevailing Wage Work, and shall make such payroll records available for inspection, in accordance with the requirements of California Labor Code section 1776. Consultant shall be responsible to ensure compliance with section 1776, whose provisions are incorporated herein by this reference.

# Introduction
For the past several years, Crocker & Crocker has prepared strategic public outreach plans for San Juan Water District. The plans were based on the board’s strategic planning sessions, an analysis of state and federal legislative activities that would affect customers and stakeholders, upcoming projects, events and/or customer calls-to-action anticipated for the year. Each plan also included a communication SWOT and stakeholder analysis, goals and objectives along with strategies and tasks to guide San Juan’s public outreach in a consistent, proactive and forward-fashion way.

For fiscal year 2018/19, San Juan staff will continue to take manage activities in-house like updating and uploading information to the website, working with regional partners and managing the majority of the public affairs activities. The district does not anticipate as many retail or wholesale outreach activities as in past years that will require support from Crocker & Crocker so the scope of work is scaled back accordingly.

To guide efforts, Crocker & Crocker prepared the following scope of work and estimated budget.  
**Note:** Crocker & Crocker has prepared this scope of work prior to the results of the phone survey so there is a chance the phone survey may find other activities that should be conducted or messages that should be relayed to customers as an outcome of the survey findings.

As with past programs, efforts will continue to:
- **Position San Juan Water District as a leading, customer service-oriented water provider,** delivering high-quality water supplies at fair rates.
- **Provide information in a transparent manner** to sustain and/or build trust among customers and stakeholders.
- **Educate and inform customers** about their water supply and water quality.
- **Raise awareness about capital improvement projects,** why they are necessary and why it is important to invest in them.
- **Promote customer service and events** in a timely manner to extend these opportunities to customers and encourage their participation.

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tony Barela, Operations Manager  
**Date:** July 25, 2018  
**Subject:** Fair Oaks 40” Pipeline Relining Project – Construction Management/Inspection Contract  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff recommends a motion to award the Fair Oaks 40” Pipeline Relining Project - Construction Management and Inspection Services contract to Infererra Construction Management Group (ICM), Inc. for the amount of $180,680.00 and authorizing a total budget of $198,750.00 (includes a 10% contingency).  

The recommendation was reviewed by the Engineering Committee on July 17, 2018, and the Committee recommended the contract be approved by the Board of Directors.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The Fair Oaks 40” (FO-40”) Relining Project is considered Phase 2 of the overall rehabilitation of the FO-40” Transmission Pipeline. Phase 1 of the overall rehab included ARC Crossing Replacement Project, Cathodic Protection Project, and the Pipeline Rehabilitation Project. ICM Group, Inc. provided construction management and inspection services on two projects of the Phase I projects, ARC Crossing and Pipeline Rehabilitation Project. Additionally, ICM Group, Inc. completed the internal lining assessment of the pipeline defining the areas needing replacement.  

ICM Group, Inc. was included in Quincy Engineering, Inc.’s proposal for design and construction management services; therefore, ICM was included in the proposal selection process during design. Through discussions with Quincy and ICM, it was recommended that the District contract directly with ICM for construction related services.  

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
Adequate funds are available in wholesale capital reserves. Construction Management and Inspections Services was budgeted for in the Fiscal Year 2018-2019 Budget.

b. Consultant’s obligations under this indemnification provision shall survive the completion of Work under, or the termination of, this Agreement.

All persons hired by Consultant and performing the Work shall be Consultant’s employees or agents.

Consultant shall pay, and District shall not be responsible in any way for, the salary, wages, workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance, disability insurance, tax withholding, and benefits to and on behalf of Consultant’s employees. Consultant shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify District, and its directors, officers, employees, authorized volunteers, and agents, from and against any and all liability, penalties, expenses and costs resulting from any adverse determination by the United States Internal Revenue Service, California Franchise Tax Board or other federal or state agency concerning Consultant’s independent contractor status.

**AGENDA ITEM IV-1**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** July 25, 2018  
**Subject:** Committee Charters and Recommended Revisions  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Approve Committee Charters  

**BACKGROUND**  
San Juan Water District currently has six standing and two ad hoc committees:  

- Engineering  
- Finance  
- Legal Affairs  
- Personnel  
- Public Information  
- Water Supply and Reliability  
- SJWD/FOWD 2x2 Ad Hoc  
- SJWD/SSWD 2x2 Ad Hoc  

The Legal Affairs Committee has typically addressed legal issues associated with topics that are normally under the purview of one of the other committees. Staff recommends that any legal issue associated with an agenda item that is addressed by one of the other committees be addressed during the consideration of that item in the relevant committee. The Legal Affairs Committee has not met since January 2017. Staff recommends that the Legal Affairs Committee be disbanded.  

The other five committees are independent and do not overlap in jurisdiction. They also serve the purpose of allowing Board members to consider topics in more detail than is typically possible during a regular Board meeting, thereby allowing items considered by committees to be addressed by the Board as consent calendar items during a regular Board meeting.  

Staff has developed the proposed charters that are presented in the attachment. These charters have been considered and approved by each of the committees except for the Legal Affairs Committee, which has not met since staff began developing the charters. Staff recommends that the Board approve the charters for each committee.

# AGENDA ITEM IV-2

## STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** July 25, 2018  
**Subject:** FOWD 2x2 Committee Discussions  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Discussion

### BACKGROUND
The Ad Hoc 2x2 Committee composed of Board members from San Juan and Fair Oaks Water Districts met on July 11, to discuss the wholesale water supply contract, and changes proposed by FOWD. The first of these changes would be to establish a minimum purchase quantity for FOWD. The 1991 contract included a provision requiring FOWD to purchase 15,000 AF of water supply annually. This provision was not included in the 2008 contract. Excerpts from those contracts are included in the attachment.

FOWD requested information about the relative cost of water using a take or pay approach, and we provided the following table.

FOWD also proposed changing the term of the contract to terminate in 2022. One potential impact of changing the term in such a manner is that it might affect our credit rating or our debt obligations. Staff is researching this issue further.

Finally, FOWD Board representatives stated that they wanted to rescind San Juan’s ability to set rates without FOWD’s approval. Staff is researching the ratesetting provisions of wholesale water sales contracts, to determine how the existing process in the San Juan wholesale water supply contract compares.

**Excerpts from the 2008 Wholesale Water Supply Agreement:**

5. E. Annual Water Supplies To Be Made Available by San Juan to Fair Oaks.  
During each calendar year throughout the term of this Agreement, consistent with San Juan's Water Rights and Entitlements and subject to the terms of this Agreement (including subsections G and H of this section), San Juan will make available to Fair Oaks the supplies of treated water at the Point of Delivery that are scheduled by Fair Oaks. Fair Oaks will make reasonable and beneficial use of the water supplies provided to Fair Oaks by San Juan, in a manner that is consistent with the terms of San Juan’s Water Rights and Entitlements.

5. G. Water Shortages and Interruptions in Water Deliveries.  
San Juan will use all reasonable means to ensure against: (1) conditions of shortage in the water supplies available under San Juan’s Water Rights and Entitlements; and (2) interruptions in San Juan’s ability to use San Juan’s Water Treatment and Conveyance Facilities in making water supplies available to Fair Oaks at the Point of Delivery, where such conditions or interruptions could result in reductions or interruptions in water service to Fair Oaks under this Agreement. San Juan may temporarily discontinue or reduce the water supplies made available to Fair Oaks under this Agreement for the purposes of investigation, inspection, maintenance, repair, replacement or improvement of any of San Juan’s Water Treatment and Conveyance Facilities, but to the extent practicable, San Juan will: (1) consult with Fair Oaks and consider Fair Oaks’ water supply needs concerning a planned or unplanned interruption in water deliveries; (2) provide Fair Oaks reasonable prior notice of any such interruption in water deliveries; and (3) use its best efforts to limit the duration of such conditions of shortage and interruption in water deliveries. San Juan will allocate available water supplies to Fair Oaks and the other Member Agencies in accordance with San Juan’s Surface Water Supply and Water Shortage Management Plan.

5. H. Water Allocations During Conditions of Shortage.

11. A. Wholesale Water Rates and Charges. San Juan will set wholesale water rates and charges from time to time for making treated water supplies available to Fair Oaks, and other agencies that contract for wholesale water supplies from San Juan, to recover San Juan’s costs of making treated water supplies available, including without limitation, the cost of untreated water under San Juan’s Water Rights and Water Entitlements, and the cost of operation, maintenance, repair, replacement of, and capital improvements to, San Juan’s Water Treatment and Conveyance Facilities. San Juan’s wholesale water rates and charges will include the melded cost of water from San Juan’s Water Rights and Water Entitlements. San Juan’s wholesale water rates and charges will include interest and penalties for delinquent payments, as appropriate. San Juan will determine its wholesale water rates and charges based on cost-of-service principles and other applicable provisions of law. San Juan will ensure that revenues collected by San Juan from Fair Oaks and other Member Agencies for wholesale water service are equitably used for the benefit of such wholesale water customers. San Juan will provide Fair Oaks with 150 days’ advance written notice of proposed changes in water rates and charges under this Agreement, provide Fair Oaks an opportunity to comment on such proposed changes prior to adoption of changes by San Juan, and account for Fair Oaks’ comments in making its determination. Changes in water rates and charges will typically be effective as of January 1 of the calendar year following adoption by San Juan.

### Other Activities:  
- Staff signed up 982 customers for recurring payment since April and another 3,168 have self-enrolled using the District’s website.  
- The number of 48-hour notices issued should decrease with the August bills as all billing cycles will now have received 2 bills under the new system. Staff is still removing customers from the shut off list who have not re-enrolled in autopay. If, after two billing cycles, these customers maintain a delinquent status because they have not re-enrolled in auto pay or paid their last two bills, staff will need to disconnect service.  
- Home sales in the retail service area remain high. Staff processed 61 manual bills to be included in the title company escrow process.

### Conclusion:
Total deliveries, which had been lagging the budgeted deliveries throughout the year, ended the year slightly above the budgeted amount due to higher than expected May and June deliveries. Total deliveries for the year ended .6% higher than budgeted with revenues coming in 1.9% higher than expected. This favorable result is primarily attributable to the Sacramento Suburban Water District taking more PCWA water than anticipated, which offset the lesser amount taken by the Fair Oaks Water District.

# AGENDA ITEM VII-2

## DIRECTOR TOBIN’S REPORT FOR 7/25/2018

### RWA
Exec Committee Meeting 6/27/2018

March Emmerson, Director of Carmichael Water District presented information regarding license fees that are currently being charged by the drinking water program passed by the State Water Resources Control Board to restructure how drinking water fees are calculated. Fee have gone up for a number of agencies and Mark believes that they should be more accountable and efficient in the way they determine these fees. It was suggested a conversation with SWRCB may be beneficial in requesting documents informally before a request for public records is sent.

**HR services:** Regional Government Services Authority is being retained to provide HR services. It’s a not to exceed $40K for the 1st year and is in this year’s budget. Total budget is $150,000 and work will begin July 1.

The work includes:
- Updating the employee handbook to comply with current state and federal laws
- Provide support for the Exec Directors evaluation process including compensation discussions and the compensation studies.
- Support RWA staff and the board in recruitment, hiring and onboarding of new staff
- Evaluate organization needs and make succession planning recommendations
- Assist in consideration of alternatives for merit based bonus program
- Evaluate alternative for employee and retiree health benefits and/or retiree health benefit vesting schedule to reduce long term costs.

### OPEB Funding Policy
Changes to the Policy 500.10 Other Post Employment Benefits Funding Policy were passed by the board. GASB 75 required RWA to make changes. The CPA, Nicole Krotoski said that terminology changes occurred because OPEB standards have changed, such as the actuarial determined contribution (ADC) replacing the term actuarially required contribution (ARC). The amortization changed from an open 10 yr amortization, to a closed 10 yr amortization. A closed 10 yr period amortizes the unfunded liability over a period whereas the open 10 yr period continually re-set at 10 yrs every time a new valuation was conducted. Another change includes some flexibility in the funding the implicit subsidy if the expected value of assets exceeds the expected costs of future benefits that include future employees services. And lastly it outlines that RWA may modify the discount rate to provide for a margin for adverse deviation. Explicit subsidy is the actual health premiums required for retirees. Implicit subsidy results when health care premiums for retirees don’t necessarily cover the expected costs of the retirees’ health care. This subsidy occurs when premiums are blended rates across all age groups of both active and retired employees, as with the CalPERS Health Plans. The valuation report reflects a cash ADC for FY 19 of Approx. $58,400 which is within the approved budges of $83,200. The $58,400 will fund both the implicit and explicit subsidy.

# INTEGRATED Regional Water Management Plan Update

Rob Swartz gave an update on the American River Basin Integrated Regional Water Management Plan and said it’s nearing completion. The comment period closed on May 25, 2018 and staff has addressed the final comments. Stantec will finalize pdf forms of each section and will upload to the RWA website by July 3rd.

## Water Tax

The attempt to get the water tax passed through a trailer bill failed and doesn’t seem to be making progress. AB2649 is designed to make it easier for agencies to take surface water to recharge groundwater. ACWA has taken a position policy position that groundwater recharge should be a beneficial use of water. The bill is trying to streamline the permitting process for recharge projects during times of high stream flows and extend the time period for agencies that do put water in the ground to take it back out of storage.

## RWA Exec Meeting 7/25/2018

### Update of Policy 400.2 Employee Compensation

RWA conducted a compensation survey in 2017. Proposed salary schedules derived from the study were very contentious when considered for approval by the RWA Board. Both the proposed salaries and the methodology of the survey were questioned. After modification and additional discussion at the exec committee the salary schedules were approved by the board in Nov 2017. Exec Committee agreed to revisit Policy 400.2 and consider changes to the process for compensation surveys in the future.

### Subcommittee updates

The Conference Subcommittee met on July 11, 2018 and agreed to plan for an event covering implementation of new water efficiency legislation in March 2019 to convene a Delta update workshop following the November Board meeting.

The Membership Subcommittee met on July 9th to strategize outreach activities to potential members, associates and affiliates. I was asked to chair that subcommittee because Robert Dugan is having difficulty attending the meeting. EID, the City of Lincoln and Woodland Davis have been identified as just a few of the potential candidates for membership.

Bill AB 2649 is a work in progress to streamline the administrative process identifying up to the 90 percentile to pull surplus water from streams and put into ground water in wet times.

## Prop I Bond Funding

Has identified two projects in the local area to receive funding:
1. Regional Sand – S. County Water is a project that will bring water to the Ag communities and will receive $280 Million.
2. Sites Reservoir will be receiving $800 Million and Rsvl, PCWA and City and County of Sacramento have a seat at the table on this project.

## ACWA Meetings

ACWA has a BOD 2019 Budget Workshop tomorrow July 26th.  
ACWA BOD Meeting is Friday, July 27th.

He explained that ICM Group, Inc., was included as a sub-contractor under the Quincy Engineering proposal which was approved by the Board last year; however, the District will work directly with ICM Group, Inc., as discussed among the three parties.  

   In response to Director Costa’s question, the Board Secretary informed the committee that Fair Oaks Water District was included in the email that was sent out last week which contained the agenda including this topic.  

   The Engineering Committee recommends consideration of a motion to approve the award for Construction Management/Inspection Services related to the FO-40” Pipeline Relining Project to ICM Group, Inc. in the amount of $180,680, with a total approved budget of $195,140.  

2. **Asbestos and Lead Building Inspection/Survey Report (W & R)**  
   Mr. Barela informed the committee that, at the request of the Board, an Asbestos and Lead Assessment was performed by National Analytical Laboratories on the District’s Administration Building, Field Services/Engineering Building, and WTP Operations Building. He conducted a brief presentation which will be attached to the meeting minutes. The results show that there are no lead issues and, out of 73 asbestos samples, there were three found to contain asbestos containing construction materials (ACCM) in the tiles and mastic in all 3 buildings.

Mr. Barela informed the committee that the asbestos is contained and non-friable, and would require a Certified Asbestos Abatement Contractor if disturbed. In addition, he reported that there are rodent droppings above the ceiling tiles in the Administration Building; therefore, PPE is required for work in that area. He explained that the rodent issue was abated last year and plans will be made to clean the area.

Director Costa suggested that staff look into when the tiles floors were installed and make a claim against the contractor, if possible, for abatement of the issue. Mr. Barela will look into this.

### 3. Douglas Main Replacement Project Status Update (R)
Mr. Watson provided an update of the Douglas Main Replacement Project. He informed the committee that Phase 1 of the project was delayed when the contractor found that the existing pipeline had a bend in the section where the trenchless insertion pipeline work would be performed. He explained that the bend was not indicated in the As-Built plans and was discovered when the contractor inspected the existing pipeline during preparation for installation of the replacement pipeline. Therefore, the contractor has moved to Phase 2 of the project while staff determines the best cost-effective solution for Phase 1.

Mr. Watson informed the committee that there are three options to consider for Phase 1:
1. Re-connect the old pipeline and leave replacement of this section for later
2. Open trench construction across the AFR/Douglas intersection
3. Implement another type of trenchless technology

Mr. Watson explained that there is no recommendation at this time since staff is still waiting for cost estimates for the trenchless and open cut options. An update of this information will be brought back to the committee at the next meeting.

Mr. Watson informed the committee that staff are working directly with businesses and customers to keep them informed, the General Manager sent an e-mail to the board members about the Phase 1 item on July 10th, revisions and updates have been made to the website, and an e-blast was sent on July 13th.

*For information only; no action requested.*

### 4. Other Engineering Matters
Mr. Barela provided a Distribution Leak Update to the committee. He explained that staff tracks leaks in the distribution system, looking for trends and other indicators that can help them with preventative maintenance. He informed the committee that July of this year is tracking higher than in recent years. He explained that leak detection is scheduled and planned out in advance, and during those times, the number of leaks is higher. However, for most leaks, the District receives notification from customers. In addition, he mentioned that more saddle failures are being found.

So, staff is noting where saddle leaks are occurring and using this information to determine where a more widespread issue may exist in the system.

Mr. Barela informed the committee that replacing saddles in groupings will be challenging, since customers will need to be notified that there will be a water service shut down over multiple days while the saddles are switched out. He explained that these service replacement projects significantly impact Field Operations and Engineering staff resources because of the customer notifications and coordination, and multiple shutdowns that are required over concurrent days. Mr. Watson commented that there are several factors to the saddle failures which include age, materials and soil type. In addition, Mr. Watson informed the committee that the CIP for FY 2018-19 does include some service replacements in proactive response to the recent failure trend identified by Operations.

In response to Director Rich’s question, Mr. Barela informed the committee that Citrus Heights Water District has been working on the RFP for the meter project. There is a meeting scheduled next week and he anticipates that the RFP will be finalized.

4.1 Next Meeting Date  
The committee scheduled the next committee meeting for Tuesday, August 14th at 4:00 pm.

5. Public Comment  
There were no public comments.

The meeting was adjourned at 12:12 p.m.
