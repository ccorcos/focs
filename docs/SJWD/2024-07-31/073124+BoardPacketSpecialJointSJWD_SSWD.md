# Items for Discussion and/or Action

1. **History Between Sacramento Suburban Water District and San Juan Water District Regarding Combination Discussions**  
   SSWD General Manager Dan York (SSWD GM York) introduced the item, presented the PowerPoint Presentation and answered clarifying questions.  
   SJWD Director Rich inquired how much water was transferred between SSWD and SJWD on an average year.  
   San Juan Water District (SJWD) General Manager Paul Helliker (SJWD GM Helliker) explained that the annual contracts started around 2019 which started around 6,000 acre feet, and that in 2023 it was 4,000 acre feet.  
   SSWD GM York expressed that on average there has been between 8,000 and 12,000 acre feet of PCWA water that is treated and wheeled from SJWD through the CTP and ATP.  
   SSWD Director Wichert requested to receive a copy of the PowerPoint Presentation.  
   William Eubanks (Mr. Eubanks) inquired about the SSWD South Service Area noting that he felt that it was not getting the attention it needed, as he believed the new wells were only being constructed in the North Service Area.

2. **Consultant Services and Communications Plan**  
   SJWD GM Helliker introduced the staff report and presented the PowerPoint Presentation, noting staff was requesting to put together a request for proposals (RFP) for a consultant to work on a Business Case Analysis.  
   SSWD Director Wichert expressed that he did not support using the Raftelis report as a model to use going forward.  
   SSWD GM York explained that the Raftelis report was only placed as an attachment in the report as an example, not to be used as a model.  
   SSWD Director Wichert moved for both agencies to embark on a process whereby the Boards would develop a table of contents and scope of work for a study to be conducted by a consultant, using the RFP, by using the table of contents and outline.  
   SJWD GM Helliker pointed out the components in the PowerPoint presentation that staff was recommending to be analyzed, such as operations, finance, rates and debt.  
   SSWD Director Wichert stated that he was most interested in the Boards approving the table of contents and outline.  
   SSWD GM York offered a suggestion for the motion, that staff provide a draft for the Boards to review and amend. He additionally suggested that a consultant interview each.

<!-- Page 7 -->

Director and additionally follow up with the interviews to ensure that their concerns are being addressed.

SSWD Director Wichert amended the motion to include GM York’s suggestion.

The motion died for a lack of a second.

Mr. Eubanks stated that he believed the customers in the South Service Area of SSWD would gain no benefit from a combination of SSWD and SJWD.

Jose Henriquez, Executive Officer for the Local Agency Formation Commission recommended that in a consolidation situation where a district could dissolve, he recommended to protect the pre-1914 water rights, and additionally for SJWD with their dual status which would additionally be protected.

SJWD GM Helliker reiterated that staff was recommending the Board provide direction to move ahead with a Business Case Analysis, and to issue an RFP, including a scope of work and all of the elements. He additionally pointed out that staff was recommending to utilize each agencies’ communication consultants by expanding their scope to include communication for the current combination discussions.

SJWD Director Costa moved to allow the General Managers to work together to develop an RFP and include any input from their respective Boards. He added that another Joint Board meeting was not needed to draft the RFP; SJWD Director Zamorano seconded the motion.

SSWD Chair Thomas moved to allow the General Managers to come together to develop an RFP and include any input from their respective Boards. He added that another Joint Board meeting was not needed to draft the RFP.

SSWD Legal Counsel Josh Horowitz expressed that each Director could express individually to their General Manager what their suggestions would be for the RFP, but that another Joint Board meeting should be held to finalize and approve the RFP in public.

SJWD Director Costa withdrew his motion.

SSWD Chair Thomas withdrew his motion.

SSWD Director Boatwright moved for the General Managers to work together to develop an RFP and allow each Director to express individually to their General Manager what their suggestions would be for the RFP, and that the draft document be discussed and approved at a future Joint Board meeting. SSWD Director Jones seconded.

their suggestions would be for the RFP, and that the draft document be discussed and approved at a future Joint Board meeting. SJWD Director Tobin seconded.

SSWD Director Wichert expressed he wanted to be sure that economics was included in the study. He additionally requested to provide an amendment to the motion, that the communications teams not begin working on outreach efforts until the Boards had an opportunity to gather more information in the study.

SSWD Director Boatwright pointed out that the amendment did not apply to the motion, as the motion was only addressing the business case analysis and not anything on communications. He expressed that he was however, in favor of what SSWD Director Wichert suggested on public outreach, though noting that he would be ok with general information being distributed.

SSWD Director Wichert requested an amendment to the motion to make it clear that the study will include a rate study. He further suggested to sole source Mark Hildebrand for that rate study.

SSWD Director Boatwright expressed that he felt SSWD Director Wichert’s requested amendment to the motion should be an item for discussion among the Joint Boards, and recommended it be a subsequent motion following the current motion, but not included in the current motion.

**Date:**  
July 31, 2024

**Subject:**  
Request for Proposals for Business Case Analysis

**Staff Contact:**  
Dan York, SSWD General Manager  
Paul Helliker, SJWD General Manager

**Recommended Board Action:**  
Approve the Request for Proposal to conduct a Business Case Analysis.

**Discussion:**  
At the June 25, 2024 Joint Board meeting, both Boards of Directors of Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) and San Juan Water District (SJWD) directed the General Managers to develop a Request For Proposal (RFP) for a Business Case Analysis (Analysis), and present it to the respective Boards at the July 31, 2025 Joint Board meeting for approval. That proposed draft RFP is attached to this staff report.

This RFP contains three tasks for two scenarios: a description of the existing characteristics, operations and assets of the two organizations; an analysis of the pros and cons of continuing to operate as independent organizations compared to combining into one organization; and the meetings and deliverables for the project. Some of this Analysis was conducted as part of the Collaboration/Integration Project during 2019-21, and much of the data and other information on which this Analysis will be based is available in various plans and reports that have been prepared by the Districts (master plans, asset management plans, financial management plans, etc.). The goal of this project is not to replicate these plans and reports, but to synthesize and analyze the information and define the benefits and challenges of either combining organizations or continuing with the status quo.

The RFP includes references to certain meetings and outreach activities. There will also be scopes of work for the communications consultants to conduct more extensive activities in these categories.

# DRAFT
## REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL
### CONSULTANT SERVICES FOR
### A BUSINESS CASE ANALYSIS FOR A POTENTIAL COMBINATION BETWEEN
### SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT AND
### SACRAMENTO SUBURBAN WATER DISTRICT

### A. INTRODUCTION:

San Juan Water District (SJWD) and Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) are issuing this Request for Proposals (RFP) to select a qualified firm to conduct an analysis on a potential combination of the two agencies into a single entity.

#### Study Objective

SJWD and SSWD (Agencies) desire to become more efficient and to minimize cost to their customers and optimize the use of their water supplies, personnel, equipment, infrastructure and other resources, as well as improve their ability to influence state and federal policies. The Agencies desire to evaluate whether or not they can better achieve these objectives by combining SJWD and SSWD into a single organization, comparing that scenario to no change to existing operations. As part of the Study for the potential combination activities, the selected consultant should 1) evaluate potential governance structures and board advisory committees to ensure customer equality and equity for both districts and achieve an overall cost benefit to the Agencies’ customers, 2) perform a detailed assessment of each agency’s operations, infrastructure and other assets and 3) perform detailed financial analyses of each agency’s current water rates, fees, debts, retirement funding obligations, costs, and reserves, and future equities based on current capital improvement projects (CIP) plans. Also as part of the Study, the Agencies desire to understand the pros and cons of these alternatives, and to understand the compelling reasons for making any changes.

#### Background

In 2019, SJWD and SSWD were part of a regional effort to identify opportunities to improve collaboration and potentially merge operations into one combined district. In June 2021, the regional effort was finalized.

On June 25, 2024, a Joint Board meeting was held between SJWD and SSWD. Direction was given to the General Managers to develop a RFP for the purpose of analyzing the pros and cons of a potential combination of the two agencies.

#### Project Management

SSWD will be responsible for administration of the project and will be the primary contact for the consultant. The project will be overseen by the General Managers of SJWD and SSWD.

4. PROPOSAL REVIEW:

Qualifications will be evaluated by the General Managers of the Agencies. Submittals will be evaluated according to project understanding by the consultant, and the qualifications of your key personnel and firm in providing services of a similar nature and how relevant that experience is to this project.

The top two to four proposers will be invited for an interview on or about **TBD 2024**. The interviewing panel will be comprised of the General Managers of SJWD and SSWD. Proposers may be invited to additional interviews on another date if requested.

The Consultant selected to perform the Study will be notified by **TBD 2024**.

5. AWARD:

The top ranked party will be invited to enter into negotiations with the Agencies on the terms of a consultant contract based on a final proposal to be submitted at that time. The negotiations will occur in **TBD 2024**. If a satisfactory agreement cannot be negotiated, then the same process will be undertaken with the next highest ranked party until a satisfactory agreement can be reached. The Agencies desire to execute a contract in **TBD 2024** and to begin providing services immediately.

The Consultant, as an independent contractor, will report to the General Managers from the Agencies. SSWD staff will provide contract administration and project coordination. The Agencies reserve the right to reject all proposals, directly contract with any proposer or non-proposer and request additional information.

6. CONFLICT OF INTEREST:

By submitting a Proposal, the Respondent declares and warrants that no elected or appointed official, officer or employee of the Agencies has been or shall be compensated, directly or indirectly, in connection with the award of the Agreement or any work for the proposed project.

E. CONCLUSION:

If you have any questions, or need additional information, please contact Dan York at dyork@sswd.org or 916-679-3973.

![Attachment B](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Sacramento+Suburban+Water+District+Conflict+of+Interest+Code)

**Sacramento Suburban Water District**  
**Conflict of Interest Code**  
**Adopted:** February 20, 2002  
**Revised:** September 21, 2020  

The Political Reform Act (Government Code Section 81000, et seq.) requires state and local government agencies to adopt and promulgate conflict of interest codes. The Fair Political Practices Commission has adopted a regulation, Section 18730 of Title 2 of the California Code of Regulations, which contains the terms of a standard conflict of interest code. This regulation can be incorporated by reference into any agency’s code without publication in full within the code. After public notice and hearing, Section 18730 may be amended by the Fair Political Practices Commission to conform to amendments in the Political Reform Act. Therefore, the terms of that regulation, Title 2, section 18730 of the California Code of Regulations and any amendments to it duly adopted by the Fair Political Practices Commission from time to time are hereby incorporated by reference in full into this code and will be applied in accordance with the provisions existing on the date that any issue arising under this code adopted by the Sacramento Suburban Water District Board of Directors must be addressed. This cover page, the referenced and incorporated FPPC regulation, and the Appendix, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein, designating positions and establishing disclosure categories, shall constitute the conflict of interest code of the Sacramento Suburban Water District.

Recognizing that different employees have different levels of authority and responsibility, the Appendix to this Conflict of Interest Code establishes three categories of disclosure under which employees are designated based on the scope of their decision-making authority. Employees with no significant decision-making responsibility are classified as exempt, and are not required to file reports under this Code.

Non-exempt District employees and officers listed in the attached Appendix are designated as persons who are deemed to make, or participate in the making of, decisions that may have a material effect on a financial interest. Consultants are also subject to the disclosure requirements of this Conflict of Interest Code if they are in a position to make decisions, or influence decisions, that could have an effect on their financial interest.

## CONFLICT OF INTEREST CODE  

### APPENDIX OF DESIGNATED POSITIONS AND DISCLOSURE CATEGORIES  

**Designated Positions.** The officers and employees listed below are designated as persons who are deemed to make, or participate in the making of, decisions that may have a material effect on a financial interest. Persons holding designated positions listed below will disclose interests and investments in accordance with the corresponding disclosure categories as defined below.

| Designated Position            | Disclosure Categories |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Assistant General Manager      | 1                     |
| District Legal Counsel         | 1                     |
| Engineering Manager            | 1                     |
| Operations Manager             | 2                     |
| Information Technology Manager  | 2                     |
| Customer Services Manager      | 3                     |
| Consultants                    | 1¹                    |

**Officials Who Manage Public Investments.** Officials who manage public investments are deemed to be “statutory filers” within the meaning of Government Code Section 87200 and California Code of Regulations, Title 2, section 18720 because they must file statements of economic interest (FPPC Form 700) pursuant to the state Political Reform Act instead of the District’s Conflict of Interest Code. The District’s statutory filers are: Members of the Board of Directors, General Manager/Board Secretary and Director of Finance and Administration/Board Treasurer. As a result, such persons are not designated in this code and are listed here for information only. An individual holding one of the above-listed positions may contact the Fair Political Practices Commission (“FPPC”) for assistance or written advice regarding their filing obligations if they believe that their position has been categorized incorrectly. The FPPC makes the final determination whether or not a position is covered by Government Code Section 87200.

1 Unless the General Manager determines in writing that narrower disclosure is permitted in accordance with the standards provided on page 2 of this Appendix under the heading “Consultants.”

“Consultants” are included in the list of designated positions and must disclose interests and investments in accordance with the broadest disclosure category in the District’s conflict of interest code, subject to the following limitation: The General Manager may determine in writing that a particular consultant, although a “consultant” and “designated position,” nevertheless is hired or retained to perform a range of duties that is limited in scope and therefore is not required to comply with any or some of the disclosure requirements described in this section. The General Manager’s written determination will include a description of the consultant’s duties, and, based on that description, a statement of the extent of disclosure requirements. The written determination is a public record and will be retained for public inspection in the same manner and location as the District’s conflict of interest code as required by Government Code Section 81008.

**New Position Added or New Consultant Hired Without Code Revision.** If the District creates a new position that requires disclosure under this code without simultaneously amending the code, the employee appointed to fill such a position will file a Form 700 Assuming Office Statement and thereafter file annual Form 700 Disclosure of Economic Interest Statements using the broadest disclosure category until the District amends the code to designate the position and, if warranted, to authorize more narrow disclosure for the position.
