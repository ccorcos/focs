![May 13, 2020, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=May+13,+2020,+Board+Minutes)

I. ROLL CALL  
The Board Secretary took a roll call of the Board. The following directors were present via teleconference: Ted Costa, Marty Hanneman, Ken Miller, Dan Rich and Pam Tobin.

President Costa opened the floor for public comment. A few members of the public addressed the Board regarding the District transitioning to division-based elections.

II. TRANSITION TO DIVISION-BASED ELECTIONS  
GM Helliker referred to his staff report, which will be attached to the meeting minutes, and explained that it referenced a letter from Shenkman & Hughes when actually it was the agreement. He explained that the agreement provides an additional 90 days to complete the process to adopt an ordinance that specifies the new divisions by November 9, 2020.

GM Helliker informed the Board that Resolution 20-03 and the schedule for adopting the process needs to be considered. He explained that the schedule contains 4 public hearings and a final meeting on November 9, 2020, to adopt the ordinance. He explained that he has revised the schedule so that the meetings do not fall on a regular Board meeting date and would like the Board to consider this revised schedule, which places the public hearing on the 2nd Wednesday of June, July/August, September and October.

The Board discussed the process to transition to a division-based election. In response to President Costa’s comment, Ms. Buckman informed the Board that she agrees that this needs to be completed in the proper manner – to get a good demographic study and to look at how the divisions are drawn, while proceeding as quickly as possible. She commented that all due precaution and care should be taken to ensure that the rights to the voters are ultimately properly represented.

GM Helliker informed the Board that the “safe harbor” provisions of the Elections Code would allow the District a minimum of 90 days to adopt new divisions (e.g., by early August), which, even without the 90-day extension, would be after the deadline to submit the divisions for the 2020 elections. He explained that the extension would allow the District important time to conduct public outreach.

Director Miller moved to approve the agreement with the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project and Shenkman & Hughes for granting of the 90-day extension provided in Elections Code 10010 for completing the formation of voting divisions within the District. Director Hanneman seconded the motion and it carried with the following roll call vote:

Ayes: Directors Costa, Hanneman, Miller, Rich and Tobin  
Noes: None  
Absent: None
<!-- Page 13 -->
![May 13, 2020, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=May+13,+2020,+Board+Minutes)

Vice President Tobin moved to adopt Resolution 20-03 declaring San Juan Water District’s intent to transition from at-large elections to division-based elections and establishing a process for the transition. Director Miller seconded the motion.

In response to President Costa’s question, GM Helliker explained that the Resolution calls for a regular meeting on November 9, 2020. Ms. Buckman commented that the Board should define a schedule for the public hearings as part of the resolution. GM Helliker suggested that the revised schedule, with the second Wednesdays for the public hearings, be used. The Board reviewed the dates and agreed that the revised schedule should be used with July, not August. Ms. Buckman confirmed that the dates fall within the statutory requirements.

The motion carried with the following roll call vote:
Ayes: Directors Costa, Hanneman, Miller, Rich and Tobin  
Noes: None  
Absent: None  

President Costa called for Closed Session at 4:35 pm.

III. CLOSED SESSION  
1. Conference with legal counsel—potential initiation of litigation (Government Code sections 54956.9(d)(4)) – one matter.  
2. Conference with legal counsel – existing litigation (Government Code § 54956.9(d)(1), (d)(4)) - California Natural Resources Agency v.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** May 27, 2020  
**Subject:** Treasurer’s Report – Quarter Ending March 31, 2020  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
This report is for information only and will be filed with the meeting minutes.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
The purpose of the treasurer’s report is to update the Board and the public on the status of the District’s cash balances and investments, and highlight material changes from one period to another. The scope of this report covers the third quarter of fiscal year 2019-2020, ending March 31, 2020.

The District’s investment objectives are established by the Board approved Investment Policy. The Investment Policy is guided and constrained by the California Government Code. The Board periodically reviews and adjusts the Investment Policy to ensure ongoing compliance with the government code and to maximize investment flexibility as permitted. The current Investment Policy has the following objectives for the portfolio:

1. Safety  
2. Liquidity  
3. Yield  

Attached is the quarterly Treasurer’s Report for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

At December 31, 2019, the end of the previous quarter, the value of the District’s total portfolio was $28.2 million. Since that time, the value of the District’s portfolio decreased by about $189,000 for an ending balance of $28 million as of March 31, 2019. Cash and short-term investments decreased by $307,218. Medium term investments decreased by $282,300 and long-term investments increased by $400,231.

The funds are currently held as follows:

| Description                          | Amount      |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| Cash at Banking Institutions          | $ 1,222,370 |
| Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF)  | $ 17,089,075|
| PFM Managed Investment Portfolio      | $ 9,717,182 |
| **Total**                            | **$ 28,028,627** |
<!-- Page 16 -->
![Distribution of Investments](https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png?text=Distribution+of+Investments+San+Juan+Water+District)

The overall portfolio is diversified with 35% invested in marketable securities (PFM Portfolio), 61% invested in short-term investments that are considered liquid (LAIF) and 4% on deposit with US Bank. Staff, in conjunction with your financial advisors, periodically review the mix of liquid and long-term investments and adjusts the portfolio according to the market conditions and the District’s short term cash needs. After the February debt service payments, staff transferred $2.5 million out of the checking account into LAIF to capture interest income.

All securities held are in conformance with those permitted by the District’s Investment Policy. There are sufficient funds to meet the District’s expenditure requirements for the next six months.

The mix and duration of investments are displayed in the following charts:

The United States economy was strong prior to the coronavirus outbreak. With businesses forced to close their doors and consumers stuck at home “social distancing”, the economy has come to a near standstill over a very short period of time. Treasury yields and stock prices have plummeted while credit spreads and volatility have soared in reaction to the uncertainty created by the pandemic. The Federal Reserve significantly broadened their tool kit to support markets. Actions included cutting rates by 150 basis points down to zero at two emergency meetings in March, instituting asset purchase programs, expanding swap lines with additional foreign central banks, providing liquidity support, decreasing the rate charged and extending terms of loans, increased the amount of repurchase agreements offered and moved the reserve requirement to 0, extending the filing deadline for 3/31 financial statements and eased capital liquidity restraints.

U.S. economic fundamentals are expected to deteriorate significantly in the next quarter as the full effect of COVID-19 materializes. The duration of the economic shutdown is unknown as is the speed and trajectory of the eventual recovery. As a result, the District’s investment team will maintain a neutral portfolio duration relative to the benchmark as they monitor the markets.

The portfolio is still performing well and continues to outperform the benchmark (Bank of America Merrill Lynch “BAML” 0-5 year Treasury Index) on an historical basis.

# ABOUT THE DISTRICT
The San Juan Water District (District) initially began as the North Fork Ditch Company dating back to 1854 providing water to the area. The District, as in existence today, was formed as the result of petitions being presented to the Board of Supervisors of Sacramento and Placer Counties by Citrus Heights Water District, Fair Oaks Water District, Orange Vale Water Company and a group of homeowners in South Placer County. An election was then held within the boundaries of the sponsoring districts including the District’s current Placer County service area on February 10, 1954. At this election, voters approved the formation of the San Juan Water District by nearly a two-thirds majority and elected five Directors. The District is a Community Services District formed under Section 60000 et seq., Title 5, Division 3 of the California Government Code.

The District provides water on a wholesale and retail basis to an area of approximately 17 square miles for retail and 46 square miles for wholesale (which includes the retail area) in Sacramento and Placer Counties.

The District’s wholesale operations include: protecting access to reliable and sufficient water supplies; operating and maintaining a surface water treatment plant; operating and maintaining treated water storage; pumping and transmission facilities; delivering treated water to five retail agency customers (the District’s retail division, Fair Oaks Water District, Citrus Heights Water District, Orange Vale Water Company and the City of Folsom (Ashland); and providing the administrative support necessary to successfully carry out those functions.

The District’s retail operations consist of operating and maintaining storage, pumping, transmission and distribution facilities, which deliver water to approximately 10,700 retail service connections located in a portion of Northeast Sacramento County and the Granite Bay area of South Placer County, and providing the administrative, customer service, water efficiency, and engineering support necessary to successfully carry out those functions.

The District’s existing water supply consists of three separate raw water contracts. The first source of water comes from a settlement contract with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) whereby it is required to deliver the District’s pre-1914 and post-1914 water rights water from the American River, totaling 33,000 acre-feet, in perpetuity. The second source is a water repayment contract with Reclamation for 24,200 acre-feet of Central Valley Project water, also in perpetuity, subject to standard shortage policies. The third water source is a contract with Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) for up to 25,000 acre-feet of water.

All sources of surface water are either stored or flow through Folsom Lake and delivery is taken at Folsom Dam outlets, either by gravity or pumped by Reclamation’s Folsom Pumping Plant. Total raw water delivery for the 2018-2019 fiscal year was 34,109.73 acre-feet and is anticipated to be 37,280 acre-feet for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019-20, and 33,550 for FY 2020-21 excluding pass through deliveries for SSWD.

In response to the recent drought and in preparation of future drought conditions, the District recently partnered with two nearby water districts, PCWA and SSWD, to construct inter-ties.

to allow water supplies to be shared and transferred if normally available supplies are reduced and/or inadequate to meet immediate demands for either district.

The District has long been a proponent and practitioner of cost effective water efficiency programs. The implementation of these programs has been highly successful and the District complies with best management practices that are required by the Sacramento Area Water Forum Agreement, California legislation SBx7-7 (2009), the California Department of Water Resources, and the Central Valley Project Improvement Act.

The District’s water efficiency programs include:

- **Water Awareness Poster Contest and Calendar** – Since 1992, the District and its wholesale agency customers, Citrus Heights Water District, Fair Oaks Water District and Orange Vale Water Company, have promoted water awareness at the elementary school level through an annual water awareness poster contest.

- **Rebate Program** – The District provides rebates for the purchase of high-efficiency washing machines, and hot water on-demand recirculation systems as well as water based irrigation timer rebates to both residential and non-residential customers.

- **Free Programs** – District staff provides free indoor and outdoor water audits, leak detection, and recommendations to improve irrigation system performance. Staff also creates landscape water budgets and irrigation schedules to improve efficiency. The District conducts and hosts a variety of workshops on drip systems and proper irrigation techniques, landscape design, soil health, tree maintenance, controller management and other water efficiency topics. A speakers’ bureau is available to talk to groups about water efficiency programs and water supply and reliability issues.

- **Water Efficient Landscape (WEL) Garden** – Located behind the District’s administrative office are gardens to inspire visitors to create a water efficient landscape that looks beautiful every season. The garden demonstrates efficient irrigation and non-water using materials to create a beautiful landscape.

The benefits of these programs include more cost-effective and efficient use of water and increased customer awareness on the importance of water efficiency to contribute to future reliability of water supplies.

The District’s water treatment facility, the Sidney N. Peterson Water Treatment Plant (Plant), was constructed in three phases beginning in 1975 and completed in 1983. The Plant includes two flocculation-sedimentation basins, two filter basins, an operations building and a covered 62 million gallon storage reservoir. Major upgrades and improvements to the Plant have been made over the years, including increasing its maximum seasonal capacity (May 15th to September 30th) to 150 million gallons a day (mgd) from its original 100 mgd. Those past upgrades, and ongoing efforts to identify and implement projects and process improvements to increase efficiency, cost effectiveness, and productivity, all contribute to the District’s success in reliably satisfying customer demands while continuing to meet or exceed all Federal and State regulatory requirements.

The Plant receives delivery of raw water directly from Folsom Dam outlets. The raw water undergoes an extensive water treatment process to ensure the highest quality of water for all customers. From the Plant, the water flows into the District’s 62 million gallon Hinkle Reservoir for storage and distribution. The District maintains approximately 222 miles of transmission and distribution pipelines, which transport the high quality treated water to wholesale and retail customers.

**Budget Purpose, Process and Control**  
The District operates on a fiscal year that runs from July 1 through June 30. The District adopts an annual operating budget and an annual capital improvement budget to ensure the adequacy of resources to meet District needs and to accomplish the District’s mission. As required by certain debt covenants, the annual operating budget is evaluated, to ensure that net revenues, as defined by the various debt covenants, are equal to or exceed a minimum of 115 percent of the anticipated debt service for the budget year.

In March of 2018, the Board of Directors adopted a Strategic Plan which staff now uses as the guiding light in preparing an operations plan and annual budget. Using the goals in the Strategic Plan, as well as direction received throughout the year from the Board of Directors, the Department Managers prepare and submit draft budgets to the Finance Department. The Finance Department prepares the revenue budget, and reviews and compiles the various department budgets. A budget workshop is held in May of each year to present and discuss the draft budget with the Board of Directors and interested members of the public. Feedback from that meeting is used to adjust the draft budget, if necessary. A public hearing is then held in June after which the Board of Directors votes on budget adoption.

Budget to actual financial data is monitored continuously throughout the year by management and is reported on a monthly and annual basis to the Board of Directors. The General Manager has the authority to move budget between specific lines within a fund, or between funds to correct posting errors. Transfers between funds, for purposes other than error correction, or to maintain required reserve levels, require approval from the Board of Directors.

**Budget Format**  
The budget is prepared on a modified accrual basis wherein revenues and expenses are reported when earned and incurred, respectively. The budget does not include amounts for depreciation, pension expense in accordance with GASB 68, or retire medical expenses in accordance with GASB 74/75 but does include an expenditure for debt principal. Therefore, the budget is not prepared in the same manner as the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR). The program budget format is used versus a line item detail format to provide the most valuable information to the reader on all of the District’s major areas of service (Administration, Customer Service, Distribution, Engineering, Water Efficiency, and).

Water Treatment Plant). Expenditure data is also presented in a functional format (Salaries & Benefits, Materials & Supplies, etc.) to provide readers with an alternate view.

For financial reporting purposes, the District operates a single enterprise fund. However, for management of the two divisions, wholesale and retail, the District utilizes four distinct funds, one each for Operations and one each for Capital Outlay.

In order to ensure funds are available to meet both operating and capital needs, the District (for both Wholesale and Retail Operations) established a financial planning process with development of a Master Plan that contains a review of current infrastructure, and that recommends projects for a twenty to thirty year period. The District then estimates current and future operating needs, and works with a rate consultant to develop a water rate study and financial plan.

The District completed a Financial Plan and Rate Study, resulting in a 5-Year Rate Schedule. The Wholesale Rate Schedule went into effect on January 1, 2017, and resulted in an effective increase of 16%. Wholesale rates are authorized to increase by 9% per year through January 2020 and by 5% in January of 2021. The Retail Rate Schedule went into effect on May 1, 2017, and resulted in an effective increase of 8%. Retail rates are authorized to increase by 9% on January 2018 and 8% on January 1, 2019 and 2020, with a 6% increase approved for January 1, 2021. In an effort to bring rates into alignment with the District’s fixed versus variable expenses, all rate increases are applied to the fixed portion of the rate with the volumetric portion of the rate unchanged. This will bring stability to the rate structure and provide reliable funding to cover fixed operating costs regardless of water demand.

## Financial Policies
Key District Financial Policies include the Reserve Policy, the Debt Policy, the Investment Policy and the Procurement Policy.

### Reserve Policy
In accordance with Board Resolutions, Board Motions, and/or District Ordinances, certain reserve funds have been established and maintained as follows:

| Capital Improvement Program    | To fund capital replacements, rehabilitation, upgrades and improvements. | Determined annually by Board of Directors. Budget includes revenues and transfers in at least equal to annual depreciation. |

**Debt Policy**  
The Debt Policy, adopted in compliance with Government Code Section 8855(i), governs all debt undertaken or refinanced by the District. It describes the purposes for which Debt may be issued, the types of debt the District may issue, and the relationship of debt to the Capital Improvement Program and the Operating Budget.

**Investment Policy**  
In accordance with District Ordinance No. 3000.05, management responsibility for the investment program is delegated to the General Manager. The Director of Finance has been designated as the “Investment Officer” in charge of operational management.

Investments by the Investment Officer are limited to those instruments specifically described in the District’s Investment Policy. The Investment Officer submits quarterly reports to the Board of Directors detailing all investment holdings. In order of importance, the following five fundamental criteria are followed in the investment program: 1) safety of principal; 2) limiting credit risk liquidity; 3) limiting interest rate risk; 4) liquidity and; 5) return on investment.

### Procurement Policy
The District's procurement policy creates uniform procedures for acquiring equipment, and goods and services for its operations. The primary purpose of this policy is to provide for the purchase of materials and trade services with the objective that they will be available at the proper time, in the proper place, in the proper quantity, in the proper quality, and at the best available price, consistent with the needs of the District.

### Accounting System and Controls
The District uses the Tyler Technologies financial accounting system to record its financial transactions. Management has established a system of internal controls that provides a reasonable basis for protecting the District’s assets from loss, theft, and misuse, and that compiles sufficient reliable information for the preparation of the District’s financial statements. At the end of the year, the District prepares a CAFR consisting of management’s representations concerning the District’s finances. An independent auditing firm audits this report and examines District internal controls and provides an opinion on the financial reporting and provides suggestions on ways to improve the internal control processes of the District.

### Fund Structure and Descriptions
Legally, San Juan Water District is a single enterprise fund. For purposes of rate setting, reserve segregation and managerial reporting, the District utilizes four distinct funds as follows:

**Enterprise Funds:**
- Wholesale Operating Fund
- Retail Operating Fund

**Capital Outlay Funds:**
- Wholesale Capital Outlay Fund
- Retail Capital Outlay Fund

The funds are combined for purposes of formal financial reporting (audited financial statements). Budgets and descriptions for these funds can be found starting on page 37.

**MAJOR REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES**  
In order to assist in understanding the fiscal trends facing the District, and the assumptions utilized in preparing this budget, the following discussion and analysis of the District’s major revenues and expenditures are presented.

**Water Sales**  
Revenue from the sale of water accounts for 86% of all District revenues. Water revenues are driven by two primary factors, the amount of water sold and the rate per unit. The Board of Directors considers and adopts rates through separate processes for wholesale and retail. Wholesale customers are presented with a rate study and are given 150 days to provide comments to the Board of Directors on proposed rate changes. After the 150 day comment period, the Board of Directors review the comments and make a decision on rates for the upcoming calendar year.

Retail rate setting is subject to the provision of Proposition 218 wherein customers are provided information on proposed rate changes, and are invited to attend a public hearing on the proposed changes. Proposed rate changes can be denied if a majority of ratepayers submit votes opposing them. If a majority of rate payers do not vote “no”, the Board of Directors vote on the proposed rate increase and set the effective date for any proposed and approved changes.

The District completed a Financial Plan and adopted a 5-Year Rate Schedule for both wholesale and retail water rates in early 2017.

**Chart 2**

The most recent drought resulted in a significant decline in water deliveries. Wholesale water deliveries began a steady decline in FY 2011-12, followed by retail two years later. Wholesale water deliveries reached their low in FY 2014-15 and retail reached its low in FY 2015-16. With the drought “officially” over, the District experienced an uptick in wholesale water demand in FY 2015-16 totaling 35,105 acre-feet. However, this increase was primarily attributed to 4,468 acre-feet of water treated for SSWD. SSWD has an agreement to periodically purchase raw water from PCWA (based upon water supply conditions). They have an agreement with the District to treat and deliver the water that they purchase from PCWA.

Absent the water treated for SSWD, wholesale demand did not begin to increase until FY 2016-17. Demand from the District’s regular wholesale customers slowly increased through FY 2019-20 but is expected to decrease by approximately 10% in FY 2020-21 with a total of 31,725 acre-feet anticipated to be sold in this budget year to the regular wholesale customers. It is uncertain how water use will be affected through the COVID-19 pandemic. To be conservative, the District is anticipating a 10% decline in water demand.

The end of the drought resulted in increased water demand in the retail service area. There was an 18% increase in FY 2016-17 retail water deliveries and a 15% increase in FY 2017-18. Water demand stabilized in FY 18-19 with a minor 2% decline. The District expects to see a 1% decline in water use in the current year. Given so many people are out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the timing of re-opening the economy is uncertain, the District is anticipating increased conservation to reduce water bills. The FY 2020-21 Budget anticipates a 10% decline in water use.
<!-- Page 65 -->
![Water Sale Revenues (in millions$)](https://example.com/image.png)

Wholesale water sale revenues declined steadily from FY 2010-11 through FY 2014-15. Revenues increased steadily from FY 2015-16 through FY 2018-19 for a number of reasons:
- Increased demand from wholesale customers. Demand from the wholesale customers was a low 33,213 acre-feet in FY 2014-15 and is estimated to peak at 35,173 acre-feet in FY 2018-19.
- Treatment of SSWD water. When certain hydrology conditions are met, SSWD is able to purchase surface water from PCWA to augment their groundwater supplies. SSWD pays the District to treat this surface water on their behalf. After not taking surface water for two years, SSWD began taking this supply in FY 2015-16, causing a spike in District revenues. The budget includes treating 7,786 acre-feet of water for SSWD in FY 2019-20.
- Increased rates. On January 11, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a 5-Year Rate Schedule, which allows for a 9% effective increase to go into effect on January 1, 2020. However, this budget includes a reduction to the Debt Service Charge, reflecting the savings from a refunding of the 2009A COP’s in 2017.

Wholesale water sale revenue is expected to decline in FY 2019-20, in spite of the rate increase due to SSWD taking less surface water. In addition, wholesale water rates were reduced on July 1, 2019 to reflect savings incurred by refinancing a debt issuance in 2017. Wholesale water sale revenues are also expected to decline in FY 2020-21, in spite of a planned 5% effective rate increase on January 1, 2021. Two factors contribute to the expected decline. First, due to the relatively dry rainy season, SSWD will not be taking their PCWA water this year so the District will not have revenues associated with treating their PCWA water. Second, the District is anticipating a 10% decline in water demand due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On the retail side, FY 2011-12 retail water use was relatively constant from the prior year, but due to a 2% rate increase, effective the prior January, revenues were slightly up.
<!-- Page 66 -->
# San Juan Water District
## Fiscal Year 2020-21 Budget

In FY 2012-13, water use increased 11% and while there was no rate increase in the prior year, there was an inflation adjustment of 2% mid-way through the year, resulting in an increase in revenues.

In FY 2013-14, water use began a multi-year decline, but a mid-year 2% rate increase, combined with the prior year 2% increase resulted in revenues that were just slightly lower than the prior year.

In FY 2014-15, water use dropped significantly as a result of the drought and conservation mandates. The District restructured their rates and at the end of the fiscal year, in June 2015, implemented a retail drought surcharge. Revenues for FY 2014-15 fell 7.8% from the prior year.

In FY 2015-16, water use continued its sharp decline but due to the drought surcharge and a 15% rate increase in January 2016, revenues were restored to FY 2013-14 levels. The drought surcharge was removed April 1, 2016.

FY 2016-17 yielded a 10.4% increase in revenues, mostly from increased consumption from the end of the drought.

The Board of Directors approved a 5-Year Rate Schedule that resulted in an effective 8% rate increase on May 1, 2017, and a 9% rate increase on January 1, 2018. Those rate increases, combined with increased consumption produced a 19.9% increase in retail water sale revenues for FY 2017-18.

In FY 2018-19, there was an 8% effective rate increase on January 1, 2019, but consumption was down 8.46%, resulting in a revenue increase of 4.43%.

The District expects to see an 8.51% increase in FY 2019-20 revenues, due to the 8% effective rate increase on January 1, 2020 and relatively stable consumption (0.56% decline expected).

The last rate increase from the 5-year rate plan goes into effect on January 1, 2021. This 6% effective increase is expected to be partially offset by a 10% decline in consumption, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a revenue increase of 3.48%.

### Property Tax
Representing approximately 9% of total District revenues, the Property Tax is the second largest revenue source. Property Tax revenue is shared evenly between wholesale and retail and has been designated by the Board of Directors to be spent on capital projects, not operations.

### Property Tax Revenues

![Property Tax Revenues Chart](chart_placeholder)

Chart 4

Property Tax revenues have been steadily increasing over the past eight years, a result of the rebound in the housing market after the Great Recession (see Chart 4). This budget anticipates a 2% increase in Property Tax revenues. Property taxes are set in January for the upcoming fiscal year, based on January property values. As such, any effects to property values from the COVID-19 pandemic will not be seen until the FY 2021-22 year.

### Salaries and Benefits
Aside from the Capital Improvement Program, Salaries and Benefits represent the largest expense of the District.

#### Salaries and Benefits

![Chart 5](chart_image_url)

Chart 5 depicts a spike in Salary and Benefit costs in FY 2016-17 then a decline through FY 2018-19 with increases in FY 2019-20 and FY 2020-21. The spike is due to the Board of Director’s decision to pay down the District’s unfunded pension liability. The District paid $4,112,000 towards this liability in FY 2016-17 and remitted an additional $2,787,800 in FY 2017-18, which is expected to materially eliminate the liability. Paying down the unfunded liability will save the District approximately $8.8 million over the next 30 years.

Salaries and Benefits are expected to increase by 10% or $875,300 due to the following factors:

- A 4.4% increase in salaries. Per the Board of Directors Compensation Policy the salary budget is calculated using the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) assumptions for salary increases, so that salaries increase are constrained and do not increase more than the CalPERS assumed increase. This methodology controls future pension costs by ensuring a reasonable cap on the combination of cost of living adjustments and merit pay increases.

![San Juan Water District Fiscal Year 2020-21 Budget](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+Fiscal+Year+2020-21+Budget)

- The addition of incentive awards, which were not included in the prior year’s budget. With more than half of the District’s salaries frozen, due to the Board’s decision to adjust total compensation to market median, down from 10% above market average, the Incentive Award Program provides a way for exceptional performance to be rewarded. The one-time bonus provides employees incentive and reward, without affecting future pay or pension costs. A total of $60,000, plus taxes, has been included in the budget for this purpose.

- Decrease of 18% in Workers Compensation costs due to a decrease in claims.

- Increase of 15% in health benefits based on current estimates stemming from impacts to the health care industry from the COVID-19 pandemic.

- Inclusion of $200,000 to be paid to CalPERS to further reduce the District’s unfunded pension liability.

The level of District staffing (number of employees) had remained relatively unchanged for many years, in spite of significant increases in regulatory compliance work and an aging infrastructure. In FY 2016-17, the Board of Directors approved the addition of one Water Treatment Plant Operator, in FY 2017-18, the Board of Directors approved the addition of a Safety/Regulatory Compliance Coordinator, and in FY 2018-19, the Board of Directors approved the additional of a Customer Service Technician to improve internal controls and better serve our customers. The District now has 48 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) positions.

The Compensation Policy, amended by the Board of Directors in September of 2017, requires a compensation study be performed at least once every four years. The purpose of the study is to ensure the District is offering a fair and competitive compensation package to its employees. The District completed its most recent Compensation Study in the Spring of 2019. The Board of Directors changed their target market position for total compensation from “10% above market average”, to “market median”. As a result, the District has two compensation schedules. Compensation Schedule A reflects the salary ranges in effect prior to the change. Compensation Schedule B reflects the salary ranges in accordance with market median. Compensation Schedule A is frozen. Employees remain in Schedule A until Schedule B is greater than Schedule A. The result is that employees on Schedule A have a reduced ability to get merit pay increases and cost of living adjustments.

### Water Supply Costs
The District’s existing water supply consists of three separate raw water contracts. The first source of water is 33,000 acre-feet of water rights on the American River. The second source is a contract with Reclamation for 24,200 acre-feet of Central Valley Project water. The third water source is a contract with PCWA for up to 25,000 acre-feet of water. All sources of surface water are either stored or flow through Folsom Lake and delivery is taken at Folsom Dam outlets, either by gravity or pumped by Reclamation’s Folsom Pumping Plant. Total water deliveries for FY 2018-19 were 34,942 acre-feet and are anticipated to be 35,509 acre-feet for FY 2019-20, and 31,950 for FY 2020-21, excluding pass through deliveries for SSWD.

### Wholesale Water Supply Cost

| Year      | Cost        |
|-----------|-------------|
| FY 10-11  | $0          |
| FY 11-12  | $200,000    |
| FY 12-13  | $400,000    |

| FY 18-19  | $1,600,000  |
| FY 19-20 est. | $1,800,000 |
| FY 20-21 Budget | $2,000,000 |

*Total Excludes Groundwater Reimbursement*

As illustrated in Chart 6, water supply costs increased significantly in FY 2016-17 and again in FY 2018-19.

The FY 2016-17 costs increased for two primary reasons. First, in 2008 a surface water shortage and reimbursement agreement to provide groundwater supplies during times of surface water shortage was prepared, and referenced in the signed 2008 Wholesale Water Supply Agreements. The District, in its capacity as the wholesale supplier, determined that there was a potential need for groundwater pumping between 2009 and 2013, and asked both the Citrus Heights Water District and Fair Oaks Water District to maintain their readiness to supply groundwater. In 2014, due to a potential shortage in surface water supplies caused by a third year of drought, the District requested groundwater to be pumped. From 2009 to 2014, both districts maintained their readiness to supply groundwater, as requested, but did not submit invoices for the incremental cost.
<!-- Page 71 -->
![San Juan Water District Fiscal Year 2020-21 Budget](https://example.com/image-url)

until the District asked them to actually pump groundwater in 2014. At that time, the District was provided with a bill in the approximate amount of $4 million. The District disputed the amount, and the cost was settled in FY 2016-17 at $1,981,440, to be repaid over a 4-year period ending in FY 2019-20. The light grey bar on Chart 6 shows water supply costs for fiscal years 2016-17 through 2019-20 without the payment towards the groundwater reimbursement.

After removing the effect of the groundwater reimbursement, FY 2016-17 water supply costs still show an increase over the prior year. The agreement with PCWA required the District to pay for 25,000 acre-feet of water, regardless of how much water the District actually took. However, in periods of drought, the District is allowed to pay for the greater of 10,000 acre-feet or the actual amount delivered. With the drought officially over in FY 2016-17, the reduced demand allowance ended and the cost of the PCWA contract rose accordingly.

Water supply costs decreased in FY 2017-18, in spite of increased demand. This was due to a reduction in the cost of water purchased from PCWA. Per the contract between the District and PCWA, the cost of PCWA water is calculated as the average of the District’s Central Valley Project rate and the Central Valley Project rate for the City of Roseville and PCWA. In addition, the District must pay Warren Act contract charges on the PCWA water it receives. Central Valley Project water rates and Warren Act charges are set annually by Reclamation, due to an abundance of water supplies. Reclamation reduced the Central Valley Project rate by 35% for 2017, causing a like decrease in the District’s PCWA water rate. Additionally, in December of 2017, the District negotiated an amendment to the contract with PCWA wherein the take or pay amount was reduced from 25,000 acre-feet to 12,500 acre-feet. The District still has the option to take up to 25,000 acre-feet, but is only required to pay for 12,500 acre-feet regardless of whether it takes the water or not. This cut the PCWA water supply cost to half of what it would have been otherwise.

The spike in costs in FY 2018-19 is a result of a groundwater substitution transfer. In FY 2018-19 the District sold 2,808 acre-feet of surface water to the Dudley Ridge Water District and the Kern County Water Agency. Both the Citrus Heights Water District and the Fair Oaks Water District used their groundwater instead of purchasing the District’s surface water. The District compensated them for the cost of the groundwater out of the transfer proceeds. The transaction yielded net revenues but increased the water supply cost in the process.

Water supply costs for FY 2019-20 are expected to be in line with FY 2017-18 with no groundwater substitution transfer and no substantial change in water demand.

Water Supply costs for FY 2020-21 are lower than the prior four years for two reasons:

- The groundwater reimbursement payments to Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks Water Districts were completed in FY 2019-20, reducing annual costs by $495,400.
- No groundwater substitution transfers planned.

## Capital Spending

Chart 7

Capital spending has fluctuated from $7.3 million in FY 2015-16 to a low of $1.8 million in FY 2017-18 then increasing to a five year planned high of $11.5 million.

On the wholesale side the District is planning to spend $6.06 million in FY 2020-21 on capital projects, mostly on Water Treatment Plant and Reservoir improvements.

The retail division plans to spend $5.4 million on capital projects in FY 2020-21, mostly on pipeline replacements and pump stations improvements.

A complete list of projects planned for FY 2020-21 can be found on pages 46 and 53 of this document.

# Reserve Summary
## Wholesale and Retail Operating and Capital Reserves Combined

Chart 8

The combination of the Great Recession, followed by the drought, resulted in the need to defer maintenance and capital projects and utilize reserves to augment operations and critical capital projects. This is illustrated in Chart 8 by the sharp decline in District reserve balances between FY 2013-14 and 2017-18.

The District has taken several actions to improve its financial condition now and into the future, as described below:

- **Paid off Unfunded Pension Liability:** The Board authorized two large payments intended to pay off the District’s unfunded pension liability. The District was paying 7.5% interest on this liability, but only earning approximately 1.5% on its reserves. In May 2017, the District remitted $4,112,000, and in April 2018 the District paid $2,787,800. By drawing down reserves to pay down this debt, the District will save approximately $8.8 million through FY 2036-37, with annual savings of approximately $350,000. These savings can be used to fund critical infrastructure needs which will help reduce upward pressure on rates. Through these efforts the District has been able to achieve a funded rate of approximately 95%, one of the highest funded rates in the State of California. While this status is fluid, changing assumptions about future interest and mortality rates, it still signifies strong financial stewardship by the Board of Directors. This budget includes an additional $200,000 to be paid towards the remaining unfunded liability, which will
<!-- Page 74 -->
![San Juan Water District Fiscal Year 2020-21 Budget](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+Fiscal+Year+2020-21+Budget)

likely be increasing due to the volatility of the stock market in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

- **Debt Refinanced:** In May of 2017, the Board of Directors approved an advance refunding of the District’s Series 2009A Certificates of Participation. This refinancing will save the District approximately $11.2 million through FY 2038-39.

- **Renegotiated contract with PCWA:** In December of 2017, the District negotiated an amendment to its contract with PCWA wherein the take or pay amount was reduced from 25,000 acre-feet to 12,500 acre-feet. The District still has the option to take up to 25,000 acre-feet, but is only required to pay for 12,500 acre-feet regardless of whether it takes the water or not. This cut the PCWA water supply cost in half, providing savings of approximately $275,000 per year, starting in FY 2018-19.

- **Renegotiated contracts with City of Roseville (City):** Under two separate contracts, the District is obligated to provide up to 4,000 acre-feet annually to the City from the District’s PCWA take or pay contract. The amendments require the City to compensate the District for maintaining the availability of 4,000 acre-feet per year water supply for the City. This will generate annual revenues of approximately $90,000 beginning in FY 2018-19.

- **5-Year Rate Schedule:** The District completed a Five Year Financial Plan and implemented a five year rate structure in 2017 that was designed to replenish reserves while ensuring that the District can continue its mission to deliver a reliable water supply of the highest quality at reasonable and equitable costs.

- **Completion of the first groundwater substitution transfer:** The District has been working for many years to create a legal path for the sale of excess water supplies. Selling excess water supplies benefits all customers of the District as it generates additional revenues that can be used to maintain and/or improve infrastructure, reduce or eliminate the need for future debt which will reduce future upward pressure on water rates. The first groundwater transfer was completed in FY 201819 paving the way for more transfers in the future.

- **Salary Schedule Reduction:** The District has historically chosen to maintain salaries schedules that, when combined with benefits, put the District’s total compensation at 10% above average amongst the selected comparator agencies. In FY 2019-20 the Board of Directors reduced this target down to market median. Current employees were not subject to pay decreases, but their ability to receive future pay increases is substantially reduced. All new hires will be hired into the new Compensation Schedule, which can be found on the District’s website. Existing employees remain on their original pay scale until such time as the new schedule is greater than their existing scale. The old pay scale is not able to receive cost of living adjustments, as it is frozen until all employees migrate to the new pay scale, at which time it will obsolete.

### Wholesale Capital Outlay Fund
This fund was created in FY 2015-16 to receive and separately account for revenues that are designated by the Board of Directors to be utilized solely for wholesale capital expenditures and to account for the acquisition of wholesale capital assets, including large scale maintenance of capital assets and improvements made to such assets. Capital reserves were transferred out of operating into this new fund upon fund creation. This fund now holds and is used to report on all wholesale capital reserves. Details on the capital projects can be found on page 46.

**Water Main Installation Underneath the North Glenn Bridge**  
**Project Status:** Planned  
**Start Date:** FY 2020-21  
**Estimated Completion:** Unknown  
**Estimated Spending FY 2019-20 & Prior:** $ -  
**Budgeted Spending FY 2020-21:** $ 75,000  
**Total Project Cost:** $ 75,000  

This project involves the replacement of approximately 100-LF of previously existing 6-inch pipe with new 8-inch pipe. In June of 2015 Placer County requested that the District remove the old water main running under the existing storm drainage channel to facilitate removal of the old Northglenn Pedestrian Bridge. When the bridge washed out in 2015 the 6-inch pipeline was damaged. The District’s only option at that time was to cut and remove the damaged section of pipe and then cap the water main on opposite sides of the drainage channel at this location. The County has plans to replace the bridge, and at that time the District can replace the currently disconnected pipeline. This project will involve designing the replacement water main that will be installed under the new bridge on the downstream side. Construction timing is dependent upon the County’s project schedule, but the District needs to be ready to move forward concurrently with the County’s project. This will be a joint project with Placer County, and the County has agreed to allow the District to install the replacement pipeline on or under the County’s bridge which will result in a lower cost than replacing the pipeline under the drainage channel.

- Actual Deliveries: 35,993
- Difference: 408
- Percentage: 1.1%

## Budgeted Water Sale Revenue
- Budgeted Water Sale Revenue: $ 9,244,873
- Actual Water Sale Revenue: $ 9,360,625

- Percentage: 1.25%

## Conclusion:
With the exception of the month of August, water deliveries in July through November were greater than anticipated. Water deliveries in the months of December through February were slightly lower than anticipated, but deliveries in March and April exceeded expectations. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting stay-at-home orders have not yet had an adverse impact on water demand; in fact, April water deliveries were 10% above expectations.

Year to date water deliveries are in line with budget expectations, varying by just 408 acre feet to the positive. Resulting revenues are also on track, with a positive budget to actual variance of 1.25%.

Letter from Rio Linda, signaling withdrawal, and e-mail from Tim Shaw with recent correspondence.

Jim Peifer expressed disappointment with Rio Linda dropping out, and questioned their rationale about Brown Act violations. RWA had not been noticing meetings as required by the Brown Act, but is doing so now. For example, RWA will be organizing a regional conversation about how to reopen businesses, and will notice it as a Board meeting. Other Executive Committee members expressed disappointment, as well.
<!-- Page 148 -->
On water loss, Jim mentioned that Paul Helliker had requested Jim become more involved and help work on a statewide effort. Jim stated that Amy Talbot is doing fine leading this for RWA and that he would engage more if the Executive Committee requested him to do so. Sean Bigley and Kerry Schmitz thought Amy was handling things adequately. Paul Schubert wants more information and a deeper dive into the details by RWA.

**Directors Comments:**  
PCWA all returned to the office on May 4.

# AGENDA ITEM VIII-3.1

ACWA May 27, 2020

ACWA staff is still working remotely and will continue to do so until further notice based on the Governor’s orders.

ACWA Conference is going to a virtual conference. Supporting ACWA is important from a financial position. Fees are $350 which is almost half of normal full registration without the costs or other expenses like hotel, travel and meal costs. We will automatically transfer your conference registration to the virtual event. Attendees will be able to apply the remaining credit toward the 2020 Fall Conference & Exhibition or receive a refund.

Water infrastructure funding: a partnership with Community Waster groups, some water agencies, and environmental Justice Coalition. came together to produce a letter with ACWA in a Leadership capacity has 4 asks:

1. $100 billion in new funding over five years for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, with at least 20 percent of the new funding distributed to disadvantaged communities as additional subsidization (grants) rather than loans and eligibility for the new funding for all water systems, regardless of their organizational structure.
2. $4 billion in immediate funding to the Environmental Protection Agency for grants to the states for a Low-Income Households Drinking Water and Wastewater Assistance/Affordability Program to help struggling households pay for essential water and wastewater service.
3. Emergency funding for affected water utilities, particularly serving disadvantaged or hard-hit communities, to help offset lost revenue, the costs associated with moratoriums on shutoffs, and the essential public health protections being put in place by water utilities.
4. Shutoff moratorium/safe reconnection provision that ensures every American has access to water in their homes now and through the duration of the COVID-19 crisis and that allows for relief to vulnerable customers for a time afterwards to regain their financial footing while also providing needed fiscal support to water systems.

Special District Provide Essential Services Act: would allow special districts direct access to the Coronavirus Relief Fund. Under the bill each state would be require allocating no less than 5% of future Covid 19 Relief Fund disbursements received by the state to special districts.

- Dept of Ag

SGMA: On Jan 31st we entered the beginning of the implementation stage, of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act with DWR staff having 20 days to review approximately 45 GSPs and determine their adequacy, and up to two years to approve them. These plans started to guide work toward achieving groundwater sustainability within a 20-year horizon. This process will be locally driven, because SGMA acknowledges that local water resource management is the most effective path toward groundwater sustainability. GSA boards are composed of locally elected leaders of water agencies, irrigation districts, cities, and counties. In other words, a community’s voters retain their voice.

![Voluntary Agreements](https://www.acwa.com/resources/2019-year-in-review/)

**Voluntary Agreements**  
On May 15, 2020 a comment letter was sent to Governor Newsom and the U.S. Dept of Interior Secy Bernhardt stating that ACWA urges Gov. Newsom and Secretary Bernhardt to use their leadership in bringing all parties back to the table to complete the work of finishing the voluntary agreements. The letters include polling results indicating that over 62 percent of California voters support the voluntary agreements knowing that the agreements will result in fish habitat in the Bay-Delta and its vast watersheds.

**Association of California Water Agencies’ Comments regarding the Draft Water Resilience Portfolio**  
ACWA provided comments regarding the California Natural Resources Agency’s, the California Environmental Protection Agency’s and California Department of Food and Agriculture’s draft Water Resilience Portfolio (Draft Portfolio).

**2019 Year in Review**

- Hinkle Reservoir Replacement Project Update (W)  
- Other Engineering Matters  

1. **Hinkle Reservoir Outage Temporary Tank Project (W)**  
   Mr. Barela provided the committee with a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained that this contract is for the tank construction only and the next agenda item will cover the site civil improvements including connecting pipelines, controls, etc. In addition, he informed the committee that nine contractors attended the mandatory on-line pre-bid conference and only two bid on the project.  

   The Engineering Committee recommends awarding a construction contract to CST Industries, Inc., for the construction of the Hinkle Reservoir Outage Temporary Tank Project for the amount of $1,040,000 with a construction contingency of $104,000 (10%) for an authorized total construction budget of $1,144,000.  

2. **Hinkle Reservoir Outage Temporary Tank Civil Site Improvements Project (W)**  
   Mr. Barela provided the committee with a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained that the project involves the construction of a 24” pipeline and appurtenances, site electrical, site grading, and drainage improvements in preparation for the two (2) bolted temporary potable water storage tanks that will be used for operational storage while the Hinkle Reservoir liner and cover are being replaced.  

   The Engineering Committee recommends awarding a construction contract to A-1 Construction General Engineering, Inc., for the construction of the Hinkle Reservoir Outage Temporary Tank Civil Site Improvements Project for the amount of $413,012 with a construction contingency of $41,300 (10%) for an authorized total construction budget of $454,300.

**Page 2**  

3. **Hinkle Reservoir Replacement Project Update (W)**  
   Mr. Pierson reported that the consultant submitted the 75% design on the Hinkle Reservoir Replacement Project. He informed the committee that the project will begin in fall of 2021 which will allow enough time for testing of the operational plan utilizing the temporary storage tanks. He informed the committee that the test results on the Hinkle and Kokila reservoir hypalon material were positive and the material still looked good mechanically, and there should be no issues delaying the project until next year as planned.

4. **Other Engineering Matters**  
   Mr. Pierson reported that the Filter Basin Rehabilitation Project for the North Basin is complete and work on the South Basin will begin in November 2020. He explained that the contract covered work on both basins; however, there were some unexpected additional expenses encountered on the North Basin and staff is evaluating whether additional funds are needed to complete work on the South Basin.

   Mr. Pierson reported that the WTP Thickener Concrete Repair & Coating Project is complete and the contractor, Jeffco Painting & Coating, did an outstanding job on the interior lining. He informed the committee that the interior was in better shape than expected, therefore, the District will receive credit for the work that did not have to be completed on the project. He also explained that the original design included repairing cracks and resurfacing the exterior of the tanks; however, there was concern that bids would come in over budget based on the engineer’s estimate, therefore that work was excluded from the design and will be completed under a separate contract in the future.

5. **Public Comment**  
   There were no public comments.  

The meeting was adjourned at 3:27 p.m.
