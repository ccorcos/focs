In addition, he reviewed the water allocations for State Water Project and Central Valley Project contractors.

VI. NEW BUSINESS

1. ACWA Letter Regarding Immediate Past President Activities (W & R)  
Director Tobin commented that this item should be under Old Business as it was discussed at the last Board meeting and President Zamorano did not want to send a response letter. GM Helliker explained that the item was not on the agenda at the last Board meeting, but was discussed under his report, and that the Board requested that the item be brought back to the Board for consideration. The Board discussed the letter and there were no objections to the letter.  

Vice President Costa moved to approve a response letter to the ACWA letter regarding Immediate Past President activities with his name as the acting President. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it carried with 4 Aye votes (President Zamorano absent).

2. General Manager Employment Agreement (W & R)  
Legal Counsel Jones reported that the labor negotiators met with GM Helliker and an amendment to the employment agreement was drafted. Vice President Costa reported that the amendment to the agreement includes an increase of 8.2%, which reflects the 5.2% COLA that all staff received and a 3% merit increase, bringing the contract amount to $251,184 annually.  

Vice President Costa moved to approve the revised amendment to the General Manager employment agreement. Director Miller seconded the motion and it carried with 3 Aye votes and 1 No vote (Director Tobin with President Zamorano absent).

3. Amendment to the 2024/2025 Water Transfer Agreement Between San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) (W)  
GM Helliker reviewed a written staff report which was included in the Board packet. He explained that SSWD is interested in purchasing water since it is a wet year, and this would help establish a foundation for future groundwater substitution transfers. He added that this would be for up to 4,000 acre-feet of water delivered through existing facilities and would offset SSWD’s groundwater pumping.

GM Helliker informed the Board that staff complied with the wholesale water supply agreement which requires notification to the Wholesale Customer Agencies for use of surplus water supplies. He reported that a letter was received from CHWD and FOWD, but it did not state that they did not agree with the analysis or indicate any concern of inadequate supply. He reported that the transfer would generate over $1 million in wholesale revenue.

GM Helliker informed the Board that the CEQA documentation was included in the Board packet and there were concerns expressed by CHWD and FOWD regarding the CEQA process for this transfer. He informed the Board that his recommendation is to complete the water transfer; however, based on the comments received from CHWD and FOWD, staff could do further research and report back on the appropriate CEQA documentation for this transfer.

Vice President Costa asked Legal Counsel if the District is looking to put its water rights water to beneficial use and someone prohibits the District from doing so does that cause damage to the District. Legal Counsel Ewens informed the Board that it would depend on what the challenge is. Director Rich asked Mr. Ray Riehle, CHWD Board member, if the District were not to complete the transfer this year due to delays in the environmental documentation and not receive the $1.1 million of which CHWD would receive approximately $400,000, that would cause any issue for CHWD. Mr. Riehle informed the Board that he was not authorized by the CHWD Board to speak on that issue.

Hearing no objections from the other Board members, Vice President Costa directed staff to conduct future research on the CEQA documentation requirements and return to a future Board meeting for consideration.

**4. FY 2024-25 Budget Assumptions (W & R)**  
Ms. Silva reviewed her written staff report which was included in the Board packet. She shared the proposed assumptions for the FY 2024-25 budget. She informed the Board that the budget workshop will be conducted at the May Board meeting.

**5. Short Term Mutual Aid Exchange of Water to/from Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) (R)**  
Mr. Barela provided the Board with a written staff report which was included in the Board packet. He explained that PCWA reached out to the District for mutual aid support to provide water to them to maintain service essential to PCWA’s customers. He informed the Board that PCWA requested that the District provide 2.0 million gallons per day through the Barton Road intertie from May 1st thru as late as December 31, 2024. In addition, he explained that PCWA will return the equivalent amount of water back to the District, through the same intertie, upon completion of the repairs.

Vice President Costa moved to (1) Adopt Notice of Exemption [CEQA] based on the findings detailed in the Staff Report; and (2) Authorize the General Manager to execute the mutual aid exchange between San Juan Water District.
