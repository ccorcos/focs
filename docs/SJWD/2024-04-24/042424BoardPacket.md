**IV. OLD BUSINESS**

1. **San Juan and the Regional Water Authority (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker provided a written staff report which was included in the Board packet. He reviewed some of the items that RWA and San Juan have cooperatively worked on and some items that San Juan had issues with. He stated that staff appreciates the work that RWA does and looks forward to hearing from them.

   President Zamorano requested that the RWA members limit their comments to allow time for the Board to ask questions. Various members of RWA addressed the Board, introduced themselves and provided more information about RWA and the work that they do for the region.

   Vice President Costa expressed concern that there is no organized plan, water banking is not happening, and more groundwater wells are needed. Mr. Brett Ewart, RWA Chair, addressed Vice President Costa’s concerns stating that the RWA completed the Regional Reliability Plan several years ago which addressed conjunctive use. GM Helliker commented that the District started transferring water to SSWD in 2020 and they got credit for banking the water. Vice President Costa stated that the District needs to show beneficial use on all the District’s water and should be banking the water for future use.

   GM Helliker informed the Board that SGA and FOWD are willing to work with the District and the eastern unit of SGA to develop a water accounting framework which is the next step to be able to do in lieu banking in the District’s service area.

   Vice President Costa voiced concern regarding the amount of time it takes for SGA to start the process of confirming a representative to SGA via the Board of Supervisors. In addition, he voiced concern regarding the voting rights of various member agencies of RWA versus the size of the agency and suggested that there is an imbalance. Mr. Ewart commented that having one vote per agency allows RWA to see the perspective of all the agencies.

   In response to Director Rich’s question, Mr. Jim Peifer informed the Board that a new project description should be released soon and work on the environmental documents will continue. He explained that RWA is looking for federal acknowledgement of the water bank in 2025 so that CVP water supplies can be stored in the groundwater basin. In addition, he stated that the water bank will help with SGMA, sustainability, and will help facilitate future groundwater substitution transfers. Mr. Peifer commented on the District’s Mission Statement and explained that RWA has helped the District achieve its mission by advocating against onerous legislative mandates that would increase costs to the District and RWA has worked on the Voluntary Agreements to help ensure uninterrupted access to the water.

   Director Miller voiced concern that RWA has not assisted the District or attended any of the San Juan Board meetings in order to be proactive with the Board. GM Helliker
<!-- Page 8 -->
![March 27, 2024, Board Minutes Page 4](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=March+27,+2024,+Board+Minutes+Page+4)

stated that Mr. Peifer had attended a Board meeting several years ago to address the Board.

In response to Director Tobin’s question, Mr. Ewart explained that RWA is working on the definitions for water banking. He explained that the water accounting methodology is still under development and there is broad participation and interest in the water bank. Mr. Trevor Joseph commented that RWA is about three quarters of the way through the development process on the water accounting system for the water bank which will not be extremely different from the water accounting framework that was established approximately 10 years ago.

In response to Director Tobin’s question, Mr. Ryan Ojakian informed the Board that RWA is looking at earmarks with Senator Padilla for federal funding. In addition, he stated that RWA recently agreed to take $2 million from the State to build a watershed of resilience program as a pilot project which will be very extensive and will benefit the region with regard to how the State is likely to do funding in the future. In addition, he believes that bond funding will also be available.

Mr. Tom Gray, representing CHWD and FOWD, addressed the Board and commented that they are both members of RWA and support their collaborative efforts and stated that it’s a good financial decision on behalf of the rate payers to be a member of RWA. He also stated that, as an RWA Board member, they listen to San Juan and even if they are not in agreement with San Juan, San Juan is still heard. In addition, he stated that RWA Board makes decisions by consensus of the whole and once a decision is made then the members should work together in collaboration. In response to Director Miller’s comment, Mr. Ewart commented that all RWA members have a voice, there may be disagreements, and he encourages everyone to understand everyone’s interests as opposed to just their own.

In response to Director Rich’s question of what San Juan can do with regard to helping RWA’s mission, Mr. Ewart commented that working together, fostering good relationships, and communicating, will help RWA obtain its mission.

In response to Director Tobin’s question regarding the letter removing San Juan from the Common Interest Agreement, Mr. Ewart stated that he could not fully answer the question. GM Helliker stated that, last year, the State decided to have confidentiality re-imposed on the Voluntary Agreement (VA) deliberations; therefore, all parties to the VA, including San Juan, had to sign a confidentiality agreement, and the District is directly involved with the VA. GM Helliker provided the Board with a timeline of the activity surrounding the VA.

The Board thanked the RWA representatives for their time in attending the meeting.

2. Mid-Year Budget Review (W & R)
Ms. Silva reviewed the staff report which was included in the Board packet. She reported that Wholesale Operations revenue is tracking greater than the budget.
<!-- Page 9 -->
![March 27, 2024, Board Minutes Page 5](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=March+27%2C+2024%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+5)

while expenses are tracking slightly below budget. This should result in an anticipated transfer out to Wholesale Capital reserves in excess of $1.3 million, mainly due to water deliveries to Sacramento Suburban Water District. She reported that the Wholesale Capital revenue is tracking 0.5% above the budget while expenses are tracking about 44% less than budgeted with the anticipation of 11 projects being delayed until next fiscal year.

Ms. Silva reported that Retail Operations revenue is tracking 1.9% above the budget while expenses are tracking about 6.6% below the budget. Ms. Silva explained that this should result in an anticipated transfer to Retail Capital reserves as high as $3.9 million.

Ms. Silva reported that Retail Capital revenues are anticipated to be substantially below the budget due to the timing of the Kokila Reservoir project and the funds to be received for that project which will now be reflected in the next fiscal year budget. She explained that the Retail Capital expenditure budget anticipated expenses of $8.8 million to fund 37 projects: 4 are already complete, 15 more are expected to be completed by the end of the year, 12 have either already started, or are expected to start, but not finish by years’ end, and 2 won’t be started until next fiscal year. Of the 37 total projects, 4 were deemed not needed and will not be re-budgeted. The mid-year estimated expenses are $8,813,600.

3. Director Compensation (W & R)  
Vice President Costa mentioned that at the last meeting he suggested that the Board reduce the number of meetings compensated each month to five per month for efficiency purposes. However, after receiving feedback, he would like the Board to discuss the number of meetings. The Board discussed the number of meetings and suggested that eight meetings per month seemed more realistic. GM Helliker provided a staff report which was included in the Board packet.

President Zamorano moved to change the proposed Ordinance from five meetings per month to ten meetings per month at $200 per meeting and retaining the language regarding filing a written statement to the General Manager to receive the increased amount. The motion failed with no second.

Vice President Costa moved to amend proposed Ordinance No. 24-01 – An Ordinance of the Board of Directors of the San Juan Water District Concerning Compensation of Board Members to reflect $200 per meeting not to exceed eight meetings per month and delete paragraph 3 regarding the written statement to the General Manager. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it carried with four Aye votes and one No vote (Miller).

Legal Counsel Jones informed the Board that the revised ordinance will be brought to the April Board meeting for the second reading and potential adoption.
<!-- Page 10 -->
4. Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker informed the Board that meetings with Citrus Heights (CHWD) and Fair Oaks (FOWD) water districts are on hold at this time. He reported that he and Mr. Zlotnick have met with Sacramento Suburban Water District and will meet again to discuss the financial structure of an agreement for groundwater banking. He explained the three alternatives of buying part of a well, buying capacity, or buying water, and SSWD will provide an estimate of what the financial arrangements would be for each scenario.

GM Helliker reported that the proposed edits for the project description on the water bank were received and are being reviewed. He informed the Board that there are concerns about expanding the scope of the environmental impact report to include water transfers since there seems to be no reason for the environmental impact report in the first place since the only action covered is RWA’s proposed water accounting system. He explained that federal acknowledgment is only required when banking CVP water outside of the service area.

GM Helliker informed the Board that RWA’s draft language proposes a 5% leave behind (tax) on water that is banked. He explained that this means if the District were to bank CVP water outside of the service area then 5% would have to be left behind which would not then be included in the District’s historic use. He noted that, while this is standard practice in other parts of the state, our water bank is owned and operated by the agencies that own the facilities and it is their water going in the groundwater basin and therefore there should not be an unnecessary 5% tax.

5. 2024 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed data which included the current reservoir storage levels across the state, data on releases, temperature and precipitation outlooks, and storage levels and projections at Folsom Reservoir. In addition, he informed the Board that Sacramento Suburban Water District should be taking their water via their PCWA contract, and he is not sure whether or not they will take any SJWD water. In any case, a proposed water transfer with SSWD will be placed on the April Board meeting agenda.

V. NEW BUSINESS  
1. Hydrant and Valve Maintenance FY 2023/24 (R)  
Mr. Barela provided a staff report which was included in the Board packet. He explained that this is the first of three amendments that were included in the original contract. In response to Vice President Costa’s question, Mr. Barela explained that these types of requests typically go to the Engineering Committee for review. GM Helliker informed the Board that he checked with the Engineering Committee Chair, Director Rich, and he directed staff to bring this directly to the Board. In response to Director Tobin’s question, Ms. Silva explained that when contracts are approved by the Board, or executed within staff expenditure authority, she reviews them and issues a purchase order to ensure that there is no over-spending on the contract.
<!-- Page 11 -->
![March 27, 2024, Board Minutes Page 7](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=March+27%2C+2024%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+7)

Director Tobin moved to authorize and approve Amendment #1, 1st year renewal to the contract with Wachs Water Services (WWS) for professional services related to the inspection and maintenance of the District's hydrants and valves for the fiscal year 2023/24. Vice President Costa seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

2. 2024 Legislation (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed a staff report which was included in the Board packet. He explained the three bills that staff are requesting support on: AB 1827, SB 1110, and SB 1330. He also reviewed Initiative 1935 which staff are requesting that the Board oppose. GM Helliker informed the Board that there is language in the initiative that has to do with providing evidence that water rates and fees are exempt from following the tax provision for voter approval, and showing that water rates and fees cover actual costs rather than reasonable costs. He explained that this creates uncertainty and risk for the District. He informed the Board that ACWA, RWA and CSDA oppose the initiative.

Director Tobin moved to support AB 1827, SB 1110, and SB 1330, and oppose Initiative 1935. There was no second so the motion failed.

The Board discussed Initiative 1935. GM Helliker explained the negative impact on the District. President Zamorano, as well as Vice President Costa, voiced support for the initiative and added that, should the initiative pass, the District may no longer be able to save reserves for pay as you go projects since the rates would seemingly have to be set based on actual costs not projected costs. She explained that if the District is unable to set rates that cover future estimated costs that are based on historical actual costs then the District would not be able to save money nor potentially issue debt for infrastructure, and she, therefore, does not recommend the Board support the initiative.

President Zamorano moved to support AB 1827, SB 1110, and SB 1330, and take a neutral position on Initiative 1935. There was no second so the motion failed.

Vice President Costa moved to support AB 1827, SB 1110, and SB 1330. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

Vice President Costa moved to support Initiative 1935. President Zamorano seconded the motion.

Director Tobin provided a substitute motion to take a neutral position on Initiative 1935. There was no second so the motion failed.

President Zamorano called for the question to support Initiative 1935.

The motion carried with 4 Aye votes and 1 No vote (Tobin).

3. Property Contract/Lease Projects (W & R)  
Mr. Tony Barela conducted a presentation on the District’s Property Contract/Lease Projects and a copy of the presentation will be attached to the meeting minutes. He reviewed the five properties that he has been working on in order to resolve some issues. He reviewed each property, the items of concern, and potential solutions. The Board discussed each property and provided staff with their comments.

VI. INFORMATION ITEMS

1. GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT  
1.1 General Manager’s Monthly Report (W & R)  
GM Helliker provided the Board with a written report for February which was included in the Board packet.

1.2 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence  
GM Helliker reported that a letter from ACWA was received asking for reconsideration of the recent decision to not financially support Director Pam Tobin’s service to ACWA. He informed the Board that he drafted a response for their consideration. The Board discussed the response letter; however, Legal Counsel Jones directed the Board to place this item on the next Board meeting for discussion since it was not specifically listed on this agenda.

GM Helliker informed the Board that he submitted comments on the conservation standards with roughly 25 other agencies signed onto the joint comment letter. In addition, ACWA submitted their comments on the issue as well.

GM Helliker informed the Board that another Public Records Act (PRA) request was received from FOWD and CHWD for documents associated with the Wholesale Financial Plan for the timeframe of November 7, 2023 to March 26, 2024.

2. DIRECTOR OF FINANCE’S REPORT

### 3.1 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence
Mr. Barela informed the Board that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revised their lead and copper rule in 2021. He explained that an inspection of all service lines was required for pipelines older than 1987, which was approximately 7,000 connections. The inspections were completed and there were no service lines with lead.

**Back to Agenda**  
**AGENDA ITEM V-1**  

**STAFF REPORT**  

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** April 24, 2024  
**Subject:** Wholesale Rates  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Approve Resolution 24-01 Reaffirming Wholesale Rates and Charges  

**BACKGROUND**  
The Board of Directors approved the 2017 Wholesale Financial Plan and Five-Year Rate Schedule on January 11, 2017. At the behest of Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD) and Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD), the District revised these rates annually, starting in 2020, via approvals of revisions of the quarterly service charges in the wholesale rates on December 11, 2019; January 27, 2021; January 26, 2022; and January 25, 2023. Each of these changes was conducted pursuant to the 150-day notice requirements defined in the Wholesale Water Supply Agreement. The Board approved the 2023 Wholesale Financial Plan and Five-year Rate Schedule on December 13, 2023.

District operations are conducted pursuant to various statutory authorities, including statutes pertaining to Community Services Districts (Government Code Section 61000, et seq.) and Municipal Water Districts (Water Code Section 71000, et seq.) Government Code Section 61115 states that a Community Services District may establish rates or other charges for services and facilities that the district provides via resolution or ordinance, but does not require that it do so. Water Code Section 71614 states that a Municipal Water District may fix the rates at which water shall be sold.

Resolution 24-01 (attached) reaffirms the adoption of wholesale rates and charges by the Board on the dates listed above. This resolution renders moot any nuisance litigation that challenges the approval of these rates by motion of the Board, such as the allegation contained in the Petition for Write of Mandate filed by CHWD and FOWD on April 10, 2024.

Also attached is the news release issued on April 12 by San Juan, addressing this nuisance litigation. The third attachment is the new release issued on April 11, 2024 by CHWD and FOWD on their litigation, with comments on various statements in that release. Staff discussed with the Public Information Committee on April 15 a proposal to send a direct mailer to all wholesale customer accounts in late April/early May, to address this litigation and provide accurate information. The mailer will likely also include information on 2024 water supply, federal grants, and a notice about the Consumer Confidence Report that will be distributed in May.

**San Juan Water District hit with nuisance litigation on wholesale water rates**

Granite Bay, CA – The San Juan Water District (San Juan) was hit with a nuisance lawsuit on April 10, 2024 from two of its five Wholesale Customer Agencies (WCAs) - Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD) and Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD). The lawsuit, which will cost ratepayers in Granite Bay, Folsom, and Orangevale (as well as in Fair Oaks and Citrus Heights) at least tens of thousands of dollars to defend, challenges the five-year wholesale rate plan that San Juan adopted in December of 2023. This is the second nuisance lawsuit filed by CHWD and FOWD against San Juan in the last seven months; the first was dismissed by the Sacramento Superior Court in January.

The suit was filed even when San Juan’s wholesale rates are the lowest in California, due to San Juan’s senior water rights on the American River and its efficient operations. San Juan’s process for updating its wholesale rates included the use of respected industry consultants recommended by CHWD and FOWD to prepare a plan for allocating costs to San Juan’s wholesale and retail operations. Using this cost allocation plan, a separate industry expert assisted San Juan in preparing its five-year wholesale rate plan, which was delivered to the WCAs five months before it was adopted by the San Juan Board of Directors, to allow for robust review and input by the WCAs. The comments from the WCAs during this review period were thoroughly addressed by San Juan, and adjustments were made to reduce the impact of rate increases.

“San Juan’s wholesale rates that I and my fellow Board members approved in December are fair, reasonable, responsible and meet all legal requirements,” said Manuel Zamorano, President of the San Juan Board of Directors. “Our five-year plan is based on operating, maintenance, and future capital investment needs funded by targeted savings, an ultra-low interest loan for infrastructure projects, and rate increases driven mainly by the need to address inflation.”

San Juan’s five-year wholesale rate plan includes annual rate increases of 5% for 2024-26, dropping to 4% in 2027 and 2028. San Juan’s projections of inflation are 4% in 2024 and 2025, dropping to 3% thereafter. Part of the reason for the additional 1% increase above base inflation is the repayment costs of a $24 million dollar State Revolving Fund loan that funded the 62-million-gallon Hinkle Reservoir cover and lining project, which includes an interest rate of just 1.2% for the 30-year life of the loan.

“This litigation is completely unnecessary and misguided, and we anticipate that the Superior Court will rule in our favor,” continued President Zamorano. “The fact is, San Juan provides the best water in the state at the lowest rates going, and this litigation will be a waste of ratepayer dollars.”

San Juan’s response to the April 10 petition for writ of mandate from CHWD and FOWD is due to the court on May 27, 2024. It will be posted on San Juan’s website, along with other documents associated with this case.

###  
San Juan Water District provides reliable, high-quality water service to approximately 265,000 retail and wholesale customers in eastern Sacramento and southern Placer counties. In addition to serving its own retail customers, San Juan delivers wholesale water supplies to Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks water districts, Orange Vale Water Company, the City of Folsom (for customers north of the American River) and, periodically, to Sacramento Suburban Water District.

**Water Agencies File Lawsuit to Protect Water Rates and Local Control**  
Citrus Heights Water District and Fair Oaks Water District stand with customers against alleged San Juan Water District wholesale water rate overcharge  

Citrus Heights, CA (April 11, 2024) – As a last resort, Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD) and Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) filed a joint lawsuit against their wholesale water provider, San Juan Water District (SJWD). CHWD and FOWD elected officials, who represent about two-thirds of SJWD’s population, unanimously backed the case. The districts allege that SJWD’s rate increase illegally overcharges CHWD and FOWD customers.

“Wholesale water from SJWD is CHWD’s single largest outbound cost. We are committed to making sure our customers pay their fair share - and no more,” said CHWD Board President Caryl Sheehan. “Local residents, business owners, and our Districts pleaded with the SJWD Board to work with us, but they simply approved the rates over our opposition.”  

SJWD’s Board of Directors voted to approve the higher rates on December 13, 2023, with only Director Pam Tobin voting against the increase, and urging more coordination with CHWD and FOWD.

“SJWD approved unfair rates that also make it more expensive to use local water supplies that we’ve already invested in,” said Chris Petersen, FOWD Board President. “At the end of the day, litigation is something FOWD and CHWD wanted to avoid, but found necessary for better, fairer rates.”

SJWD is a wholesale water agency that provides water to local water agencies, including FOWD and CHWD, who in turn deliver it to homes and businesses in the Granite Bay area. SJWD provides water directly to homes and businesses in the Granite Bay area. SJWD also sells much of its least expensive water to others, which the districts allege leaves CHWD and FOWD customers with higher bills.

The complaint suggests that under the new rate plan that SJWD recently approved, local water agencies are disincentivized to conserve or use local, reliable groundwater. This appears to conflict with State policy or decades-long efforts to build regional water supply resiliency. The current rate plan could make the region more vulnerable to water shortages and keep rates artificially high for CHWD and FOWD customers.

The Superior Court of California, County of Sacramento will assign a judge to oversee the case. CHWD and FOWD will keep the community up to date as the lawsuit progresses. The Districts encourage customers to stay informed about this important issue.

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** April 24, 2024  
**Subject:** Strategic Plan  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Approve Strategic Plan  

**BACKGROUND**  
In 2018, after six months of analysis, workshops, various iterations of a range of documents and support from a strategic planning consultant, the San Juan Board of Directors adopted a Strategic Plan (Plan) to guide the District's operations. The Plan was intended to serve the District for a period of three to five years. Every year, staff prepare for Board approval an Operations Plan (Ops Plan), to complement the Plan, and define in more detail the specific priority tasks that need to be accomplished in that year. Every quarter, the progress in accomplishing the tasks in the Ops Plan is reported via the Report Card prepared by District staff.

At the October 25, 2023, Board meeting, the Board agreed to update the strategic plan. The Board directed staff to review the current plan and propose revisions for the Board to consider. The proposed revisions were presented to the Board at the January 24, 2024, Board meeting. The Board directed staff to set up a workshop to discuss potential revisions to the strategic plan, which was held on March 6, 2024. At that meeting, the Board made various revisions to the Strategic Plan and requested that staff seek input from the Wholesale Customer Agencies. The draft plan was sent to them on March 12. Tom Gray requested more time to review the plan, which is why approval of the plan was delayed from the March 27, 2024, Board meeting to the April 24, 2024, Board meeting.

The draft updated strategic plan is attached, for Board review and discussion. Staff recommends approval of the plan.

**FOREWORD**

Welcome to the San Juan Water District’s Strategic Plan. With its 150+ year history and now more than 60 years of operation as San Juan Water District, the District continues to provide reliable water supply for communities in Sacramento and Placer Counties. Meeting the needs of our customers for reliable, high quality water supplies in an ever-changing regulatory and hydrologic environment can be challenging and requires thoughtful planning, as elucidated in this Strategic Plan.

Our mission, vision and values are the foundation for our operations and articulate our dedication to high quality service and environmental protection. The Strategic Plan encompasses these elements and outlines the goals and objectives that we will pursue to meet our mission and achieve our vision. The Plan incorporates the principles of fiscal responsibility, customer service and operational excellence.

This plan is our roadmap for the next two to five years, and will guide our decisions on annual budgets and operating plans. The Board of Directors and District management are committed to implement these plans to ensure efficient and effective operations that meet our commitment to our retail and wholesale customers, and our goal of protecting our water rights and supplies for years to come. The District adopts annual operating plans to implement this strategic plan, which include performance metrics and target dates.

Manuel Zamarano  
President, Board of Directors  

Paul Helliker  
General Manager

![District Overview](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
**DISTRICT OVERVIEW**  
The San Juan Water District (District) began as the North Fork Ditch Company, which started providing water to the area in 1854. The San Juan Water District, as it exists today, was formed as the result of petitions being presented to the Board of Supervisors of Sacramento and Placer Counties by Citrus Heights Water District, Fair Oaks Water District, Orange Vale Water Company and a group of homeowners in South Placer County. An election was then held within the boundaries of the sponsoring petitioners on February 10, 1954. At this election, voters approved the formation of the San Juan Water District by nearly a two-thirds majority and elected five Directors. The District is a community services district formed under Section 60000 et seq., Title 5, Division 3 of the California Government Code.

The District provides both wholesale and retail water service. The wholesale area (which includes the District’s 17 square mile retail area) covers approximately 46 square miles in northeastern Sacramento and southeastern Placer Counties. The District wholesales water to San Juan Retail, Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks Water Districts, Orange Vale Water Company, and the City of Folsom for its customers north of the American River. The District serves a population of approximately 150,000 within its wholesale service area.

The District’s existing water supply consists of three separate raw water contracts. The first source of water is a settlement contract with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) that provides, in perpetuity, for the delivery of 33,000 acre-feet of water from the American River based upon the District’s water rights, which date from 1853 and 1928. The second source is a permanent repayment contract with Reclamation for 24,200 acre-feet of Central Valley Project water. The third source is a contract with Placer County Water Agency for up to 25,000 acre-feet of water. All sources of surface water are either stored or flow through Folsom Lake and delivery is taken at Folsom Dam outlets, either by gravity or pumped by Reclamation’s Folsom Pumping Plant.

**GOALS**  
The District has adopted the following goals to guide its operations. Each of these goals tells us what we want to achieve and where we are going. The objectives that relate to each goal define what we need to accomplish in the near term. Each year, District staff prepare a budget and operational plan for approval by the Board, which allocate the resources and specify the tasks necessary to achieve these objectives. Finally, performance metrics define the quantifiable indicators which we will use to measure our progress in meeting these goals.

**RE:** Request for Reconsideration of Decision Not to Financially Support Leadership Role of ACWA Immediate Past President  

Dear Mr. President and Members of the Board:  

On behalf of the Officers of the Board of Directors of the Association of California Water Agencies (“Association”), I am writing to request reconsideration of your recent decision not to financially support San Juan Water District (“San Juan WD”) Director Pam Tobin’s service to ACWA and its 470 public agency members, including San Juan WD, as the Association’s Immediate Past President from 2024-25. The decision to serve as an officer of the Association is a six-year commitment from Vice President to President to Immediate Past President. It is both a commitment of the individual seeking election to ACWA leadership and of their local water agency adopting a resolution of support for their service to the Association and its membership.  

Consistent with ACWA Board Policy and past practice, the Association has covered the costs of Director Tobin’s four-year service as Vice President and President; the remaining financial obligation to cover her service as Immediate Past President falls on Director Tobin’s home agency, San Juan WD. We are not aware of any other member agency that has refused to honor this commitment to their own director or the Association. With this letter, we respectfully ask that you reconsider your recent decision not to financially support Director Tobin’s service as Immediate Past President. Presently, her ability to effectively serve as an ambassador and member of the leadership team of ACWA has been severely diminished.  

Thank you for your consideration,  

Dave Eggerton  
Executive Director  
Association of California Water Agencies

April 24, 2024

Mr. Dave Eggerton  
Executive Director  
Association of California Water Agencies  
980 9th Street  
Sacramento, CA 95814  

Dear Mr. Eggerton:

Thank you for your letter of March 25, 2024, concerning expenses of ACWA Immediate Past Presidents (IPP). We are unaware of expenses for any activities that are required of IPPs that San Juan has failed to reimburse.

As you may be aware, when San Juan staff prepared the budget for the current fiscal year, they consulted with the two most recent IPPs, and with the Senior Clerk of ACWA’s Board of Directors, to ensure that there would be a smooth transition from ACWA reimbursing expenses for the President to San Juan reimbursing expenses for the IPP. To that end, our FY 23-24 budget includes funding for the IPP to attend ACWA Spring and Fall conferences, regional events and other activities that IPPs are required to conduct.

The San Juan Board of Directors is in the process of reviewing and revising Board compensation policies. The current policy provides compensation of $125 per day of service and allows the statutory maximum of ten days of service per month. The agenda for the April 24, 2024, San Juan Board meeting includes the second reading of a proposed ordinance to increase the compensation level and reduce the allowable days of service per month. Any changes that the San Juan Board approves on April 24 would become effective no earlier than late June 2024.

Thank you again for your correspondence. If you need any further information about our 2023-24 budget, please contact our General Manager Paul Helliker or our Board Secretary Teri Grant.

Sincerely,

Manuel Zamorano  
Board President

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Greg Zlotnick, Water Resources Manager  
**Date:** April 24, 2024  
**Subject:** Proposed Agreement Between San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District to Provide Conserved Surface Water Supplies to Enhance Groundwater Stabilization  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
(1) Adopt Notice of Exemption [CEQA] based on the findings detailed in this Staff Report; (2) make a formal finding concurring with staff’s analysis, that the proposed transfer water would be surplus to the needs of the Wholesale Customer Agencies in accordance with their Wholesale Water Supply Agreements; and (3) Authorize the General Manager to sign the Proposed Agreement Between San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District to Provide Surface Water Supplies to Enhance Groundwater Stabilization  

---

**BACKGROUND**  
To optimize the utilization of San Juan Water District’s (District) surface water supplies; generate revenue for the District’s wholesale enterprise; increase regional conjunctive use; and enhance groundwater stabilization in Sacramento Suburban Water District’s (SSWD) northern service area, the District and SSWD seek to enter into an agreement whereby the District may sell up to 4,000 acre-feet (AF) of conserved pre-1914 water right to SSWD for the limited period between May 1, 2024, and February 28, 2025.  

The Proposed Agreement incorporates the same terms as prior agreements, adjusted to current rates.  

The Wholesale Customer Agencies were informed by emailed correspondence, on March 29, 2024, of staff’s intent to bring this Proposed Agreement to the Board in accordance with the Wholesale Contract. That communication included the determination that the transfer water is available as surplus to WCA surface water demands, which were maximally estimated to be 10% over the average aggregate WCA total over the last three years.  
<!-- Page 53 -->
![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT+Water+Transfer+Agreement+with+SSWD+Greg+Zlotnick)

Notably too, the Proposed Agreement includes a failsafe mechanism that in the unlikely occurrence the District could not continue to transfer water to SSWD while still meeting WCA demands, the transfer will be halted.

If the full 4,000 AF of water is transferred to SSWD, the District will receive over $1,060,000 in payments as compensation for treatment and wheeling of that water. The charge per AF for treatment is the same as the District charges SSWD for treating Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) water it receives in years, such as this year, when the unimpaired inflow to Folsom Reservoir is 1.6 million AF or more.

The water rate SSWD will pay, exclusive of treatment and wheeling, is $36.82/AF, which would generate $147,280 if all 4,000 AF is transferred. Of that amount, the District will net a minimum of approximately $10.04/AF, which would total $40,160 for 4,000 AF.

Notably, another benefit of the proposed transfer is the District will use more of its “take-or-pay” water to meet demands in the Placer County retail service area, which will reduce the amount of PCWA entitlement water being left “on the table as a sunk cost.

In total, then, it is expected that this agreement to transfer up to 4,000 AF will result in over $1,100,000 in positive revenue impact to the District’s wholesale enterprise.

**CEQA**

Adopting and implementing this agreement is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for the following separate and independent reasons. The agreement is eligible for a Class 1 categorical exemption under CEQA Guidelines section 15301 because it does not involve the construction of any new facilities or modification or expansion of capacity of existing facilities and only involves water supplies that have historically been consumptively used by the District prior to undertaking conservation actions. As separate and independent basis, the agreement is exempt from CEQA based on the common sense exemption in CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3) because it can be determined with certainty that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment.

**Project Title:** Short term agreement to sell water to Sacramento Suburban Water District  

**Project Location:** San Juan Water District facilities in Sacramento and Placer Counties will be used to receive, treat and convey conserved pre-1914 water right water to Sacramento Suburban Water District in Sacramento County. See attached map.  

**Description of Nature, Purpose and Beneficiaries of Project:** San Juan Water District (San Juan) will make available for sale up to 4,000 AF of pre-1914 water right water to Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD), which San Juan has previously conserved through various conservation efforts, including primarily the improved water use efficiency of its customers. The agreement to sell water to SSWD is short-term, for the limited period of May 1, 2024 to February 28, 2025, and does not obligate San Juan to sell water to SSWD at any time after February 28, 2025. The project does not involve the construction of any new facilities or the modification or expansion of capacity of existing facilities. San Juan will benefit from the project as a result of being better able to utilize the surface water supplies it has available to it for public benefit, as well as receiving revenue that will improve its wholesale enterprise’s financial position and reduce upward pressure on wholesale water rates. SSWD will benefit from the receipt of surface water to improve the conjunctive management and health of its groundwater basin.  

**Name of Public Agency Approving Project:** San Juan Water District  

**Name of Person or Agency Carrying Out Project:** San Juan Water District  

**Exempt Status:** (Check One)  
___ Ministerial

✔ Other: Common Sense Exception, CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3)  

**Reasons why project is exempt:**  
This agreement is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for the following separate and independent reasons. The agreement is eligible for a Class 1 categorical exemption under CEQA Guidelines section 15301 because it does not involve the construction of any new facilities or modification or expansion of capacity of existing facilities and only involves the short-term sale of water supplies that have historically been consumptively used by San Juan prior to undertaking conservation actions. As a separate and independent basis, the agreement is exempt from CEQA based on the common sense exemption in CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3) because it can be determined with certainty that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment.

and North Service Areas, overlying separate groundwater sub-basins, which SSWD conjunctively manages to ensure water supply reliability and groundwater sustainability.

E. SSWD also has an entitlement contract for take-or-pay water from PCWA, which is diverted from Folsom Reservoir by Reclamation to San Juan for water treatment and then delivered to SSWD. These supplies are only available to SSWD when the calculated unimpaired inflow to Folsom Reservoir is 1.6 million acre-feet or more in the delivery year.

F. On September 20, 2017, San Juan and SSWD entered into an AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT BETWEEN SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT AND SACRAMENTO SUBURBAN WATER DISTRICT CONCERNING DIVERSION, TREATMENT AND CONVEYANCE OF WATER (2017 Agreement). The 2017 Agreement governs the measurement, treatment, conveyance (via the Cooperative Transmission Pipeline (CTP) owned by San Juan and in which SSWD owns a portion of the capacity) and payment by SSWD to San Juan for treatment and conveyance, of the water San Juan will provide to SSWD pursuant to this Agreement.

G. All of SSWD’s payments for the water provided by San Juan to SSWD pursuant to this Agreement will be made by SSWD to San Juan under the same schedule as that paid for treatment and conveyance in accordance with the 2017 Agreement identified in Recital F above.

H. SSWD has installed a pipeline to convey treated surface water from the terminus of the CTP to its North Service Area to enable SSWD to better conjunctively manage, conserve and utilize its groundwater resources.

I. San Juan has determined, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, it will be able to deliver up to 4,000 acre-feet of its conserved pre-1914 Water Right Water to SSWD, while meeting the surface water needs of its WCAs, to enhance conjunctive management of the groundwater basin underlying SSWD’s North Service Area, during the period of May 1, 2024 through February 28, 2025, as provided in this Agreement.

J. San Juan is willing to deliver to SSWD, and SSWD is willing to purchase from San Juan, on a temporary basis, water surplus to the needs of San Juan’s WCAs, treated and delivered by San Juan under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

K. San Juan has made a formal determination that the approval of this Agreement, and implementation of the activities to be undertaken as a result, are exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act.

Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained, herein, the parties agree as follows:

1. Recitals Incorporated. The foregoing recitals are incorporated by reference.

2. Term of Agreement. This Agreement shall be effective as of ______________, 2024, and shall remain in effect through February 28, 2025, unless terminated earlier under the provisions of this Agreement.

3. Limitation on Location of Use. SSWD may only distribute the water purchased from San Juan pursuant to this Agreement to retail customers within its authorized service area, and under no circumstance may SSWD deliver or sell this water outside of its authorized service area.

4. No Obligation to Purchase. The parties do not intend this Agreement to be a take or pay contract or to otherwise obligate SSWD to purchase any water from San Juan. Any purchases of water up to the 4,000 acre-feet San Juan has offered to make available shall be at SSWD’s sole discretion.

5. No Obligation of Future Transfer. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a commitment or intent by San Juan to transfer, sell or deliver, or agree to transfer, sell or deliver, any water to SSWD at any time following expiration of the term of this Agreement.
<!-- Page 59 -->
6. Water Shortage Provisions.

(a) Deliveries to SSWD shall be subject to reduction or elimination, as determined solely at San Juan’s discretion, should San Juan notify SSWD that San Juan has determined that it must take such action to ensure the availability of sufficient water supplies to meet the needs of its WCAs or other commitments with priority over continued deliveries to SSWD. Such notification shall be provided by phone and email as soon as possible and followed up with a written explanation for the suspension of deliveries at the earliest date feasible.

(b) San Juan may temporarily discontinue or reduce the amount of water delivered to SSWD for the purpose of maintaining, repairing, replacing, investigating or inspecting any of the facilities necessary for the storage or furnishing of water to SSWD. In so far as it is feasible, San Juan will give SSWD due notice in advance of such temporary discontinuances or reductions except in cases of emergency, in which case notice will be provided at the earliest date feasible. In the event of any such discontinuance or reduction, San Juan will, upon the resumption of service, attempt, in coordination with SSWD, to deliver the quantity of water to SSWD that would have been furnished to SSWD in the absence of such event.

(c) In the event of a water shortage as described in subparagraphs (a) or (b) of this article, SSWD shall be solely responsible for supplying water to meet its customers’ needs, and no liability shall accrue against San Juan or any of its directors, officers, agents or employees for any damage, direct or indirect, arising from such shortages.

7. Schedule, Rate and Payment for Water.

(a) SSWD shall pay San Juan for each acre-foot of water treated and conveyed to SSWD the charges set forth in the 2017 Agreement for such treatment and conveyance with San Juan, identified in Recital F above, and on the same schedule as contained therein. The attached Appendix A lists this rate.

(b) SSWD shall also pay San Juan for each acre-foot of water treated and conveyed to SSWD the equivalent of the following: the acre-foot price PCWA charges San Juan for water.
<!-- Page 60 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+not+available)

made available to San Juan in Folsom Reservoir for use within Placer County pursuant to the agreement between San Juan and PCWA identified in Recital B above, plus one-half of the difference between that price and the price San Juan pays PCWA for water made available in Folsom Reservoir for use within Sacramento County pursuant to that same agreement. Appendix A lists that rate equivalent.

(i) Should San Juan be required to deliver any portion of its PCWA entitlement to its retail or wholesale customers in Sacramento County to maintain deliveries to SSWD without triggering the shortage provisions set forth in Article 6 above, SSWD shall pay San Juan for each acre-foot of water treated and conveyed to SSWD the equivalent of the charge San Juan pays PCWA for that water made available in Folsom Reservoir for use within Sacramento County pursuant to the agreement between San Juan and PCWA identified in Recital B above. Appendix A lists that rate equivalent.

(ii) San Juan shall inform SSWD as soon as feasible if the Article 7(b)(i) rate equivalent will be applied to any deliveries and in what quantity, and SSWD may choose to direct San Juan to halt deliveries – at which direction San Juan will halt deliveries as soon as practicable. SSWD will compensate San Juan for water actually delivered prior to any delivery stoppage.

(c) In addition, SSWD shall pay San Juan for each acre-foot of water treated and conveyed to SSWD the equivalent of the charge San Juan pays Reclamation pursuant to the Warren Act contract identified in Recital C above. Appendix A lists that rate equivalent.

(d) Charges to SSWD described in Articles 7(a) and 7(b) above may change during the term of this Agreement. SSWD acknowledges such rate adjustments will be made and agrees to pay those new charges in accordance with this Agreement.

8. Responsibilities for Delivery and Distribution of Water. Neither San Juan or its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for the control, carriage, handling, use, disposal or distribution of water furnished to SSWD hereunder outside of facilities then being

**Back to Agenda**

# AGENDA ITEM VI-4

## STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** April 24, 2024  
**Subject:** Preliminary Assumptions for Creation of Fiscal Year (FY) 2024-25 Budget  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Receive and comment on report.

### BACKGROUND
The District’s annual budget process begins with a discussion between staff and the Board of Directors at the April Board meeting each year. These assumptions inform the calculations and final numbers used for the proposed budget, which is presented to the Board in May. The feedback received from the Board and the public at the May meeting, is used to create the final proposed budget, which is presented at a public hearing in June, followed by adoption of the budget by the Board, assuming no additional changes are requested. These budget adoption milestones are not set in stone, but are the general schedule followed by the District. The District is legally required to adopt a final budget by September 1st of each year.

Staff suggests and recommends the following assumptions for the Fiscal Year 2024-25 Proposed Budget:

### Revenues:

**Wholesale Water Sales:**
- **Demand from Wholesale Customer Agencies:** Staff recommends assuming water demand will be generally the same as it was in the current fiscal year.
- **Demand from Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD):** SSWD has provided a schedule that anticipates their taking 12,000-acre feet of their PCWA water between July and June. Their take or pay contract with PCWA is for 8,000. If they do not take their 8,000-acre feet in years when hydraulic conditions allow, their take or pay contract is forever reduced by 50% of the difference between 8,000-acre feet and what they took. Therefore, it is reasonable for SJWD to budget for the 8,000-acre feet. The additional 4,000-acre feet is speculative and therefore should not be counted on in the budget.
- **Water Rates:** Staff recommends using the rate schedule as adopted by the Board of Directors.

**Retail Water Sales:**
- **Demand:** Staff recommend using the same approach for estimating retail demand this year, as was used last year, with a slight modification. Last year, retail demand was projected by the Customer Service Manager who looked at the 5-year historical.

**Staff Report – Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget Assumptions**  
April 24, 2024  

- Average consumption, reduced by 5% due to this historical trend of reduced consumption in wet spring months. Conditions this spring were similar to last spring so this approach seems reasonable. Staff is further estimating a small decline, .40% due to the January 2024 increase in the volumetric portion of the rate. It is anticipated that the increase in the volumetric portion of the rate may prompt additional water conservation by some customers. Staff recommends assuming total demand of 4,557,041 CCFs of water.  
- **Rates:** The 2021 Retail Financial Plan examined rate revenue needs for a 10-year period from FY 2022 through FY 2023. However, due to upcoming conservation regulations, the Board approved a three-year rate schedule, instead of the standard 5-year schedule. The last of these rates went into effect January 1, 2024. The Financial Plan recommends rate increases of 7%, 6%, 6%, 6% for 2025 – 2028 before falling to inflationary rate increases in FY 2029. The District needs to adhere to the Prop 218 noticing and hearing process to consider further rate increases. Given the uncertainty of the outcome of that process staff recommends assuming constant rates for this budget cycle.  

**Property Tax Revenues:**  
- 2% increase  

**Interest Income:**  
- Cash balances have been restored with the receipt of proceeds from the Hinkle Reservoir Loan and the Eureka Road Loan. Given the higher cash balances, and the higher interest rates, staff will be performing an in-depth analysis and estimate of projected interest earnings for FY 2024-25. Given the latest inflation numbers, interest rate reductions do not appear imminent. Staff recommends assuming a slight decline in the interest rate to produce a conservative, yet realistic projection.  

**Expenses:**  

**Salaries and Benefits:**  
- Salaries prepared in accordance with Board Compensation Policy, utilizing CalPERS estimated wage growth  
- 11% increase in health care costs (same as last year)  
- No increase in worker’s compensation insurance rates  
- Continuance of supplemental payment towards unfunded pension liability - $200,000  

**Insurance Costs – per correspondence with David DeBernardi of ACWA-JPIA:**  
- Property Insurance premium increase of 20%  
- Liability Insurance premium increase of 10%  
- No increase for cyber insurance  

**Energy Costs:**  
- There have been three rate increases by PG&E in 2024 thus far, and two more are anticipated. In total, we are anticipating a rate increase of 31.34% from PG&E.
<!-- Page 68 -->
# Staff Report – Fiscal Year 2024-25 Budget Assumptions  
**April 24, 2024**  
p. 3  

After weighing this for differences in consumption throughout the year, staff recommends assuming a 28.99% increase in PG&E bills and a 5% increase in SMUD bills.  

## Legal Expenses:  
- Absent costs from defending the District against the April 2024 lawsuit filed by the Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD) and Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD), staff is projecting wholesale legal expenses to decline by 17.4% due to no anticipated activity on General American River issues and the winding up of the initial CHWD/FOWD litigation. Wholesale legal expenses will be budgeted for a significant increase due to the April 2024 lawsuit filed by CHWD and FOWD. Staff are currently waiting for an estimate from Jones Mayer.  

## Public Relations Expenses:  
- Staff is still developing the proposed budget, but at the direction of the Public Information Committee we are planning for an uptick in outreach, which will require additional funding.  

## Reserves:  
- Creation of debt service reserve equal to one year’s debt service for Kokila Reservoir Replacement Project SRF loan, as required by loan agreement.

# AGENDA ITEM VI-5  
## STAFF REPORT  

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tony Barela, Director of Operations  
**Date:** April 24, 2024  
**Subject:** Short Term Mutual Aid Exchange of San Juan – Retail Water to/from Placer County Water Agency  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION  
Staff requests a Board motion to (1) Approve a Notice of Exemption [CEQA] based on the findings it describes; and (2) Authorize the General Manager to execute the mutual aid water exchange between San Juan Water District and Placer County Water Agency described in this staff report.  

### BACKGROUND  
On April 11, 2024, Placer County Water Agency (PCWA or Agency) reached out to the San Juan Water District (District) to request mutual aid assistance while they complete repairs at PG&E’s Spaulding Powerhouse #1 to reestablish delivery capability that has been interrupted by a failure of discharge piping.  

PCWA was notified on March 8, 2024, of substantial leakage at the discharge piping of the PG&E’s Spaulding Powerhouse #1. Required repairs of the damaged facilities has forced a shutdown of the powerhouse and water releases to PCWA from Lake Spaulding. During the outage of the powerhouse, PG&E does not have the ability to move water into PCWA’s Drum Canal which conveys most of the Agency’s water supply provided by PG&E. The Agency was notified that full repair of the powerhouse and associate discharge piping, and return to service, may not be completed until the end of the year.  

To maintain service essential to PCWA’s customers PCWA has requested that the District’s retail enterprise provide 2.0 million gallons per day through the Barton Road intertie from May 1st thru as late as December 31, 2024, for a volume not to exceed 1,500 acre-feet. Upon completion of the repairs, PCWA will return the equivalent amount of water back to the District’s retail enterprise through the same intertie.  

The District has evaluated this request and has determined that we can assist without negative impacts to the District’s operations. Water delivered will move through the District’s Bacon Pressure Zone to the intertie with PCWA located at the intersection of Barton Road and Indian Springs Road. Water delivered to PCWA will be conserved pre-1914 water right water.  

Upon completion of the repairs, the equivalent amount of water will be returned to the Bacon Pressure Zone through the same intertie. All water will be metered at the intertie and reported as part of the District’s water supply source reporting to Reclamation and the SWRCB.  

### CEQA  
For the reasons stated in the attached proposed Notice of Exemption, the mutual aid water exchange is exempt from CEQA. If approved by the Board, the attached Notice of Exemption will be filed.  

### BUDGET IMPACT  
None.

**Project Title:** Short term Mutual Aid agreement to transfer water to Placer County Water Agency  

**Project Location:** San Juan Water District wholesale and retail facilities in Sacramento and Placer Counties will be used to receive, treat and convey conserved pre-1914 water right water to Placer County Water Agency in Placer County. See attached map.  

**Description of Nature, Purpose and Beneficiaries of Project:** Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) normally receives significant water supplies from PG&E via Spaulding Powerhouse #1, which is then conveyed to PCWA through its Drum Canal. However, as a result of damage to discharge piping at the powerhouse, those water supply releases have been halted. To help maintain service essential to PCWA’s customers, PCWA has requested San Juan Water District’s (SJWD) retail enterprise to provide 2.0 million gallons per day of treated water to the Barton Road intertie (at the intersection of Barton and Indian Springs roads), to then be pumped into PCWA’s distribution system by a PCWA operated booster pump station. The operation of the intertie is estimated to last, at a maximum, from May 1, 2024 thru as late as December 31, 2024, for a volume not to exceed 1,500 acre-feet. The mutual aid water SJWD will be transferring is conserved pre-1914 water right water.  

To deliver the needed water to PCWA, SJWD’s retail enterprise will take delivery of the water from SJWD Wholesale as part of its normal water purchases. SJWD’s wholesale supplies are received via the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s facilities at Folsom Dam and conveyed to SJWD’s Sidney N. Peterson Water Treatment Plant where the water will be treated and delivered to SJWD’s retail system through the SJWD Wholesale’s transmission system. From the transmission system, water will be pumped through the District’s Bacon Pump Station that is located in Sacramento County, and then conveyed through the SJWD retail distribution system in Placer County to the Barton Road intertie located at the intersection of Barton Road and Indian Springs Road, where it will enter PCWA’s system for distribution.  

All water will be metered at the intertie and reported. Upon completion of PCWA’s repairs, an equal amount of treated water will be delivered back to SJWD through the intertie. Only existing facilities will be used to convey this water through SJWD’s system to PCWA’s, and to convey the exchanged water back to and through SJWD’s system when it is returned.

Tony Barela  
San Juan Water District  
Director of Operations  

Subject: Emergency Delivery of San Juan Water District Treated Water to Retail Customers of PCWA in 2024  

Dear Mr. Barela,

PCWA was notified on March 8 of substantial leakage of the discharge piping of PG&E’s Spaulding Powerhouse #1. Repair of the damaged facilities has forced a shutdown of the powerhouse and water releases from Lake Spaulding. During the outage of the powerhouse, PG&E does not have the ability to move water into the Drum Canal which is the source of most of the Agency’s water supply provided by PG&E. The Agency was notified that a partial repair, providing approximately 50% capacity in the Drum Spaulding system, is anticipated to be completed by June 14, 2024; additionally, a full repair of the powerhouse and associate discharge piping would not be completed until late fall or early winter. To maintain service essential to PCWA’s customers and minimize use of PCWA water supplies from PG&E, PCWA is evaluating available resources such as the American River Pump Station, interties with neighboring water agencies, increased groundwater pumping, and voluntary reductions of untreated water deliveries.

To ensure adequate water deliveries to PCWA customers, PCWA requests San Juan Water District’s (SJWD) assistance by conveying treated water to a portion of PCWA’s service area. Given that the date of full restoration of PG&E raw water deliveries to PCWA is uncertain, PCWA requests SJWD prepare for up to 2 million gallons per day (MGD) of deliveries from May 1 through December 31, 2024. Upon full restoration of PG&E deliveries, PCWA will coordinate with SJWD to return the same volume of water back to SJWD - eliminating the need for payment of water.

**11.9%**

## Conclusion:
July through March deliveries were higher than anticipated by 5,603 acre feet or 19.6%. As shown in the table above the main drivers of the positive variance are deliveries to SSWD and the Citrus Heights Water District. Deliveries to SSWD are 67.2% greater than anticipated for this point in the year and deliveries to Citrus Heights Water District are 13.6% higher than anticipated.

The 19.6% positive variance in deliveries results in year to date revenues that are 11.9% greater than anticipated in the budget for this point in the year.

# STAFF REPORT

**To:** Public Information Committee  
**From:** Devon Barrett, Customer Service Manager  
**Date:** April 15, 2024  
**Subject:** Customer Satisfaction Survey Discussion  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Review proposed questions to be included in the 2024 Customer Satisfaction Survey  

**BACKGROUND**  
Objective 6 of Goal C of the Strategic Plan calls for Staff to complete a “…customer satisfaction survey every 5 years achieving an 85% good or excellent customer satisfaction rating for customer service.” The last survey was completed in 2018 so staff have begun the process of conducting the next survey.

**Current Status**  
Prosio Communications will facilitate the survey and has brought on True North, Inc., to conduct the survey. So that we can understand trends in customer attitudes, as well as to address issues that continue to be of interest to San Juan Board members and management staff, we are proposing to use many of the questions from the 2018 survey. Based on the input from the survey experts, True North, staff have reviewed and removed a few questions that were deemed unnecessary or repetitive. This will reduce the length of the survey, which should enhance the likelihood of customer participation.

**Financial Considerations**  
The cost based on the current survey length is $26,250 flat-fee. This cost is included in the Fiscal Year 2023-24 budget for Customer Service.
