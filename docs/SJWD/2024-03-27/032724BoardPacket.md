He explained that the project covers the three thickener tanks and includes providing better access into the tanks for regular maintenance, which was identified as a safety hazard for staff, and includes replacing the fill line, dust collector, pressurized air supply line and vent fan louver in preparation for recoating the silos.

![February 28, 2024, Board Minutes Page 3](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=February+28,+2024,+Board+Minutes+Page+3)

1. **Lime Silo and Thickener Improvements Project – WSC Amendment #2**  
   Mr. Barela reviewed the staff report which was included in the Board packet. He explained that this amendment covers engineering services during construction for the first project, which includes the fabrication and installation of custom pivoting ladders for access into the District’s thickener tanks and replacement of appurtenances on the District’s lime silo, and the second project, which includes the recoating of the lime silo.  
   Director Tobin moved to approve the Director of Operations to sign a construction contract with Clyde G. Steagall, Inc. (Steagall) for the Lime Silo and Thickener Improvements Project. Director Rich seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

2. **District Cyber Security Program (W & R)**  
   Mr. Chris von Collenberg conducted a brief presentation regarding the District’s Cyber Security Program. He explained that, since he has been at the District for the past 17 years, the District’s systems have been under attack by outside forces on a daily basis, and the system has never been breached. In addition, he informed the Board that the District’s cyber security remains the same and is based on security best practices. He explained that the District utilizes layered security, and he would be notified at any time of the day or night if there was ever a breach.  
   GM Helliker informed the Board that staff are in the process of enhancing the District’s physical security, and explained that once the new Administrative Building is built, then public access will be confined to that building only.

3. **2023 Rebate to CHWD and FOWD (W)**  
   GM Helliker reviewed the staff report which was included in the Board packet. He explained that the allocation methodology used for the Board approved 2023 wholesale fixed charges was different than what had been used in the past. It used 4 years of water use instead of the past 5 years. Vice President Costa inquired if the different methodology used was due to adding and dropping a year for calculating the rates on the rolling average. GM Helliker confirmed and further explained that the 2023 process for wholesale rate setting was the last time the rolling average will be used. GM Helliker explained that there is no Board policy on setting the wholesale rates. In addition, GM Helliker reminded the Board that they adopted the wholesale.
<!-- Page 8 -->
![February 28, 2024, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=February+28%2C+2024%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+4)

rates in December 2023, and they are structured on a five-year rate schedule based on the previous 10-year fixed average.

Ms. Suzanne Jones addressed the Board and voiced concern that there is no Board policy for setting rates and that there should be a policy. GM Helliker explained that the previous rate setting process that was conducted in 2017 allocated the fixed charges based on the previous 5 years of water use. In 2019, at the request of the wholesale customer agencies, the Board approved a revised rate schedule for Calendar year 2020 wherein the fixed charges were re-allocated using the most recent 5-years of respective water deliveries. In each subsequent year, staff presented a revised rate schedule updating the allocation for recent water use. He further explained that the Wholesale Financial Plan that the Board adopted constitutes the Board policy on rate setting. Ms. Silva explained that, from 2017-2019, the District had consistency with the previous financial plans and rate schedules, then at the request of the customers, the District changed the formula to the rolling average. She informed the Board that this resulted in volatility and was more susceptible to errors when changing the rate annually; therefore, the District reverted back to the fixed average approach for the most recently adopted Wholesale Financial Plan and Rate Schedule.

Director Tobin moved to approve a rebate of $77,108.97 to Citrus Heights Water District and a rebate of $751.19 to Fair Oaks Water District. Director Rich seconded the motion and it with 4 Aye votes and 1 No vote (Costa).

5. Director Compensation (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed a staff report which was included in the Board packet. He informed the Board that this topic was brought up at the last Board meeting and he discussed the topic with President Zamorano. He explained that the last time the Board compensation was adjusted was in 2005 and Water Code 20202 allows a 5% annual increase since the last adjustment which could potentially bring the compensation up to $315.87 per meeting should the Board approve that amount.

The Board discussed the topic and there were suggestions to increase the compensation at the same rate as the employee COLAs, to leave it as is, or to increase the amount of compensation and reduce the number of meetings to 5 per month.

President Zamorano moved to increase the compensation to $250 per meeting with a limit of 5 meetings per month. There was no second, the motion failed.

Legal Counsel Jones informed the Board that any action taken tonight would be to give staff direction for returning to the Board with an ordinance amendment if that is the direction that the Board takes.

In response to Director Miller’s question, the Board Secretary informed the Board that the Board as a whole averaged 5.6 meetings per month for the last couple of
<!-- Page 9 -->
![February 28, 2024, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=February+28%2C+2024%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+5)

years; however, she indicated that Director Tobin averaged 10 per month during that time since Director Tobin was on the ACWA board and the rest of the Board was considerably less per month.

Director Rich moved to give staff direction for the amendment to show an increase in the stipend to $200 per meeting with a limit of 5 meetings per month. Vice President Costa seconded the motion.

Ms. Jones addressed the Board and commented that she received $300 per month, regardless of the number of meetings that she attended, along with mileage and the cost to send a director to a conference is not compensation to the director. Director Miller commented that directors do not receive mileage to attend meetings at the District any longer since the government does not allow that, and the Board policy for out of state travel was implemented for the ACWA DC2024 conference and the Board voted not to allow the travel to attend that conference.

President Zamorano made a substitute motion to give staff direction for the amendment to show an increase in the stipend to $200 per meeting with a limit of 5 meetings per month with a requirement that a director must request, in writing to the General Manager, that they receive the increase. Director Rich seconded the motion.

Legal Counsel Jones stated that a motion was not needed, just Board consensus on what to bring back to the next meeting.

In response to Board discussion, Legal Counsel Jones informed the Board that he will confirm that a director can elect to not receive a stipend or to receive a reduced amount. In response to Ms. Silva’s question, President Zamorano stated that the number of meetings should stay at five per month regardless of the amount received per meeting.

Legal Counsel Jones informed the Board that at the next Board meeting, the Board will review the draft ordinance amendment with the provisions that the motion has stated in it.

V. OLD BUSINESS

1. 2024 Committee Assignments (W & R)  
GM Helliker announced that the 2024 committee assignment list was included in the Board packet, and the only change was for an agreed upon swap with Director Tobin becoming Chair of the Finance Committee and Vice President Costa joining the Public Information Committee. The Board discussed the 2x2 Ad Hoc Committee with Fair Oaks Water District and decided to keep the committee on the list.
<!-- Page 10 -->
2. Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker informed the Board that analysis of the wholesale and retail systems identified these needs: groundwater production for backup supplies during critically dry years for SJWD Retail, Folsom and Orangevale; sufficient groundwater production to meet the substitution transfer volumes that are agreed to with CHWD, FOWD, OWWC and SSWD; groundwater production for substitution transfers at market rates; and, with regard to recharge, meet sustainability goals with partners and, as necessary, provide additional recharge to make sure that the groundwater resources are available to meet future needs. He indicated that the analysis document was previously emailed to the Board members.

GM Helliker explained that there are three alternatives that have been discussed: (1) buy into facilities; (2) buy capacity in a facility; and (3) buy water as needed. He informed the Board that there has not been a lot of discussion with CHWD or FOWD, but there have been discussions with SSWD, and OWWC is also interested in discussing this topic. Mr. Zlotnick explained that this is regarding physical infrastructure with regard to partnering with agencies that have facilities or are looking to have facilities with groundwater that they can access. Mr. Zlotnick confirmed that these options, along with in lieu of or ASR, make banking of water a possibility for the District. GM Helliker emphasized that the most critical need that the District has is groundwater production and having access to groundwater during a drought.

In response to Vice President Costa’s comment, GM Helliker explained that the 2008 Shortage Policy that the District had with the CHWD and FOWD was cancelled and replaced with another policy which now states that if there is a shortage of surface water and not enough to meet all the needs of the wholesale area, then the surface water will be distributed in a prorated amount, based on the last five years of use.

GM Helliker reviewed two scenarios regarding backup supplies for critically dry years and explained the well capacity needs of the District. In addition, he reviewed the last ten years of water use by CHWD and FOWD and their current demands, along with data from monitoring wells that show groundwater sustainability levels. He reviewed the various amounts of water that the District, CHWD, FOWD, OWWC and SSWD are required to deliver as it pertains to the Voluntary Agreement.

GM Helliker informed the Board that Mr. Zlotnick has completed some research regarding grant opportunities for groundwater facilities. Mr. Zlotnick explained that there are three opportunities through the federal government with the Army Corp of Engineers and their Environmental Infrastructure Account Section 219, the Environmental Protection Agency State & Tribal Assistance Grants Program, and Reclamation’s Water Smart Program. Mr. Zlotnick reviewed the options that are available to the District to secure funding.

3. 2024 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed data which included the current reservoir storage levels across the state, data on releases, temperature and precipitation outlooks, and storage levels and projections at Folsom Reservoir.

Mr. Zlotnick informed the Board that staff plans to purchase some CVP water this year, along with all of the water rights water and some PCWA water and will balance the water supply cost with the budget. He explained that using CVP water helps to build the historic use when there are times of water shortage allocations from Reclamation.

1.1 General Manager’s Monthly Report (W & R)

GM Helliker reported that there was a proposal to expand the groundwater bank project description to include water transfers. He indicated that there were many questions and concerns regarding adding water transfers as it may lead to some implications for the annual transfers that the District conducts. In addition, he mentioned that, since RWA does not conduct water transfers, adopting CEQA documentation with the inclusion of water transfers does not make sense.  

3. ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES (ACWA)  
3.1 ACWA - Pam Tobin  
Director Tobin expressed her concerns regarding the punitive use of votes taken at a recent Board meeting regarding her attendance at the ACWA DC2024 conference.

GM Helliker informed the Board that he hasn’t had a conversation with Mr. Lamar for about a year and was not involved in the Board’s decision regarding her attendance at the conference. Director Tobin started to discuss the democracy of voting when President Zamorano called for a point of order. Director Tobin stated the District missed an opportunity for her to meet with various federal representatives on important water matters. In addition, she stated that the conference was budgeted then the Board voted not to allow her attendance as punishment and is not allowing her to do her job and duties as agreed upon. President Zamorano called for a point of order. In response to Director Tobin’s request, Legal Counsel Jones informed Director Tobin that she has the floor for her report as long as it is related to ACWA.  

Director Tobin finished her report and informed the Board that the ACWA Legislative Symposium is scheduled for April 10, 2024, and the ACWA Spring Conference is scheduled for May 7-9, 2024.

GM Helliker stated that the usual process is for him to provide the Board with a self-evaluation form, and then the Board makes their comments and forwards them to the Board Secretary, who then compiles them into one document for review during Closed Session at the March Board meeting. In addition, the Board President appoints Labor Negotiators to meet with GM Helliker to discuss compensation. President Zamorano appointed Director Miller and Vice President Costa as the District’s Labor Negotiators and directed them to meet with GM Helliker prior to the March Board meeting.

### AGENDA ITEM III-3

**STAFF REPORT**

To: Board of Directors  
From: Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
Date: March 27, 2024  
Subject: Review and Update the Investment Policy of the San Juan Water District  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Consider a motion to approve proposed updates to the San Juan Water District Investment Policy. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Finance Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
The San Juan Water District's Investment Policy communicates the Board’s investment objectives, delegation of authority, investment procedures and defines authorized and suitable investments for the District. While no longer required by state law, best practices require a periodic review with updates as needed or desired. This policy was last reviewed and updated on August 19, 2020.

Staff, and your Investment Advisors at PFM Asset Management, Inc. have reviewed the Investment Policy and are recommending the following changes to the policy:

**Addressing Recent Code Changes:**  
Senate Bill 882, made one change to Government Code (Code) section 53601, the section of Code that governs the investment of public funds. Language was added to Code Section 53601(o), the subdivision that allows investment in assets-backed and mortgage-backed securities, to state that securities allowed under 53601(o) that are issued by the United States, federal agencies, or United States government-sponsored enterprises are exempt from the credit and diversification requirements included in 53601(o). To address this change to Code, staff suggests editing policy section 5.6.7.1 Authorized and Suitable Investments, Investment Types. This edit to the Policy does not change what PFM is allowed to purchase on your behalf nor the management of your portfolio.

Senate Bill 1489 made two changes to Code section 53601. First it added language stating that an investment’s term or remaining maturity shall be measured from the settlement date to final maturity, and second, that a security purchased in accordance with Code section 53601 shall not have a forward settlement date exceeding 45 days from the time of investment. Previously, Code was silent on both items. To address the Code changes, staff recommends adding the new Code language to Policy section 5.6.2 Investment Parameters, Maximum Maturities.

**Additional Recommendation:**  
Staff recommends correcting an error in the government code reference in the last bullet point in section 5.6.7.1 Authorized and Suitable Investments, Investment Types to bring the language in line with the government code.

# FIN-5.6 Investment Policy

## 5.6.1 Policy
The purpose of this document is to convey the Investment Policy of the San Juan Water District (“District”). This policy should be reviewed periodically to ensure consistency with legal and District requirements. It is the District’s policy to invest all funds in such a way as to achieve the highest investment return possible consistent with maximum security of District funds while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the District. All investments must conform to pertinent state and local statutes governing the investment of public funds.

## 5.6.2 Scope
The District currently has one fund type, an enterprise fund, in which all transactions are accounted and reported in. Activities for both Wholesale and Retail include: Non-Operating, Operations, and Capital Improvements. This investment policy applies to all fund and activity types. In addition, this policy will apply to any new fund created, unless that fund is specifically exempted.

### 5.6.2.1 Exceptions
Two exceptions exist regarding the investment of (1) bond reserve funds, and (2) grant funds.

Acceptable investments for bond reserve funds are specified in the bond documents, and may not necessarily be the same as those listed later in this document (e.g. Guaranteed Investment Contract). Bond funds will be invested in accordance with the statutory provisions governing the issuance of the bonds or the bond documents, as applicable.

Grant funds will be invested according to the statutory provisions applicable to the investment of the grant funds or the grant itself, as applicable.

### 5.6.2.2 Pooling of Funds
With the exception of cash in restricted and special funds, the District will consolidate cash balances from all funds to the extent practicable in order to maximize investment earnings and minimize fees.

## 5.6.3 Prudence

### 5.6.3.1 Standard of Prudence
The standard of prudence will be the “prudent investor” standard.

When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing public funds, the Board and its designated investment officer(s) shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic conditions and the anticipated needs of the District, that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiarity with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of the agency. This standard

5.6.4 Objectives  
The primary objectives, listed in order of priority, of the District’s investment activities are:

5.6.4.1 Safety  
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the District’s investment program. Investments will be executed in a manner that seeks to ensure preservation of capital in the overall portfolio, whether from institutional default, broker/dealer default or erosion of market value of securities. In attaining this objective, the District will strive to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk.

5.6.4.1.1 Credit Risk  
The District will minimize credit risk, the risk of loss due to the failure of the security issuer/backer, by:  
- Limiting investments to the safest types of securities;  
- Pre-qualifying the financial institutions, broker/dealers, intermediaries and advisors with which the District will do business; and  
- Diversifying the investment portfolio by sector and issuer.

5.6.4.1.2 Interest Rate Risk  
The District will minimize the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio will fall due to changes in general interest rates, by:  
- Structuring the investment portfolio so that securities meet the cash flow requirements, thereby avoiding, to the extent possible, the need to sell securities on the open market prior to maturity; and  
- Investing operating funds in shorter-term securities.

5.6.4.2 Liquidity  
The District’s investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to meet all cash flow requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent with cash flow requirements (static liquidity). Since all possible cash flow requirements cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should consist largely of securities with active secondary or resale markets (dynamic liquidity). As mentioned earlier, a portion of the portfolio should also be invested in short-term securities, which offer same-day liquidity.

<!-- Page 22 -->
# 5.6.4.3 Return on Investment
The District’s investment portfolio will be designed to attain an acceptable rate of return, taking into account the investment risk constraints and cash flow requirements.

# 5.6.5 Standards of Care

## 5.6.5.1 Delegation of Authority
The Finance Director is hereby designated as the “Investment Officer” in charge of managing the District’s investment program. The Investment Officer may delegate the day-to-day placement of investments to a registered investment advisor. The investment advisor shall make all investment decisions and transactions in strict accordance with State law and this Policy. The Investment Officer shall establish a system of written internal controls to regulate the District’s investment activities, including the activities of the investment advisor and any subordinate officials acting on behalf of the District.

## 5.6.5.2 Investment Procedures
The Investment Officer will establish written investment procedures for the operation of the investment program consistent with this policy. The procedures should include reference to: safekeeping, wire transfer agreements, banking service contracts and collateral/depository agreements. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the established procedures.

## 5.6.5.3 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the investment program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Investment officials and employees will disclose to the Investment Officer any material financial interests in financial institutions that conduct business within their jurisdiction, and they will further disclose any large personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the District.

# 5.6.6 Safekeeping and Custody

## 5.6.6.1 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
The District will conduct investment transactions with authorized financial dealers and institutions. All financial institutions and broker/dealers who desire to become qualified bidders for investment transactions must supply the Investment Officer with the following: proof of National Association of Security Dealers certification, completed broker/dealer questionnaire, certification of having read the District’s investment policy, and depository contracts.

An annual review of the registrations of qualified bidders will be conducted by the Investment Officer. A current broker dealer questionnaire is required to be on file for each financial institution and broker/dealer in which the District invests. The Investment Officer will maintain a list of authorized financial dealers and institutions.

If the District utilizes an investment advisor to conduct investment transactions on the District’s behalf, the investment advisor may use its own list of approved broker/dealers and financial institutions for investment purposes. The investment advisor’s approved list must be made available to District upon request.

As an additional source for investing, the District may utilize services designed for government agencies seeking competitive investment rates (e.g. GFOA Yield Advantage).

### 5.6.6.2 Internal Control
The Investment Officer will facilitate an annual process of independent review by the District’s external audit firm as part of the annual audit. This review will provide internal control by assuring compliance with policies and procedures.

### 5.6.6.3 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions, including collateral for repurchase agreements, entered into by the District shall be conducted on a delivery-versus payment (DVP) basis. Investments will be held in safekeeping by a third party custodian and evidenced by safekeeping receipts. The custodian will be competitively selected by the Investment Officer and will act under the terms of a custody agreement.

### 5.6.7.2 Ineligible Investments
Ineligible investments are those that are not described herein, including but not limited to, common stocks, reverse repurchase agreements, inverse floaters, range notes, mortgage derived interest only strips, derivatives securities, or any security that could result in zero interest accrual.

### 5.6.8 Investment Parameters
#### 5.6.8.1 Diversification
The District will diversify its investments by security type and institution. With the exception of U. S. Treasury securities, U. S.

To the extent possible, the District will strive to match its investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. Where this Policy does not specify a limitation on the term or remaining maturity at the time of the investment, no investment shall be made in any security that—at the time of the investment—has a term remaining to maturity in excess of five years, unless the legislative body has granted express authority to make that investment either specifically or as a part of an investment program approved by the legislative body no less than three months prior to the investment. For purposes of compliance with this Policy, an investment’s term or remaining maturity shall be measured from the settlement date to final maturity. A security purchased in

## 5.6.8 Investment Earnings

### 5.6.8.3 Investment Earnings
Investment earnings that are collected from investments authorized in this policy will be allocated monthly to the various program areas based upon their respective participation and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

### 5.6.8.4 Investment Pools
A thorough investigation of the pool/fund is required prior to investing. At a minimum that review should consist of the following:
- a determination of the eligible investment securities;
- a determination of the allowable size of deposits and withdrawals;
- the frequency with which deposits and withdrawals can be made;
- the process and timeline for withdrawals;
- a review of the fee schedule.

The Finance Director shall monitor the pool to ensure he/she is aware of any changes made to the pool in the above categories.

### 5.6.8.5 Review of Investment Portfolio
The securities held by the District must be in compliance with Section 7.0 Authorized and Suitable Investments at the time of purchase. Because some securities may not comply with Section 7.0 Authorized and Suitable Investments subsequent to the date of purchase, the Investment Officer shall at least quarterly review the portfolio to identify those securities that do not comply. The Investment Officer shall establish procedures to report to the Board, should one exist, major and critical incidences of noncompliance identified through the review of the portfolio.

## 5.6.9 Policy Considerations

### 5.6.9.1 Legislative Changes
Further restrictions on allowable maturities, investment type or percentage allocations imposed by any State of California legislative action, will be incorporated into the District’s Investment Policy as deemed prudent and supersede any and all previous applicable language.

### 5.6.9.2 Investment Policy Adoption
The District’s Investment Policy will be adopted by resolution or motion of the District’s Board of Directors. The policy will be reviewed and updated periodically.

## 5.6.10 Reporting

### 5.6.10.1 Methods
The Investment Officer will provide investment reports to the Board. Such reports will provide a status of the current portfolio, along with economic conditions, potential future changes and investment strategies. The reports will include:
- A listing of the securities held by category;
- Maturity date of all investments;
<!-- Page 28 -->
- Coupon, discount or earnings rate;
- Par Value, Amortized Book Value and Market Value; and
- Percentage of the portfolio by category.

5.6.10.2 Performance Standards  
The investment portfolio will be developed with the objective of attaining a rate of return commensurate with the District’s investment risk constraints, cash flow requirements and the economic environment. An appropriate benchmark will be established against which portfolio performance can be compared on a regular basis.

5.6.10.3 Marking to Market  
The market value of the portfolio will be calculated monthly, with a statement of market value issued. This will ensure that review of the investment portfolio, in terms of value and price volatility, has been performed consistent with the GFOA Recommended Practice on “Mark-To-Market Practices for State and Local Government Investment Portfolios and Investment Pools.”

# FIN-5.6 Investment Policy

## 5.6.1 Policy
The purpose of this document is to convey the Investment Policy of the San Juan Water District (“District”). This policy should be reviewed periodically to ensure consistency with legal and District requirements. It is the District’s policy to invest all funds in such a way as to achieve the highest investment return possible consistent with maximum security of District funds while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the District. All investments must conform to pertinent state and local statutes governing the investment of public funds.

## 5.6.2 Scope
The District currently has one fund type, an enterprise fund, in which all transactions are accounted and reported in. Activities for both Wholesale and Retail include: Non-Operating, Operations, and Capital Improvements. This investment policy applies to all fund and activity types. In addition, this policy will apply to any new fund created, unless that fund is specifically exempted.

### 5.6.2.1 Exceptions
Two exceptions exist regarding the investment of (1) bond reserve funds, and (2) grant funds.

Acceptable investments for bond reserve funds are specified in the bond documents, and may not necessarily be the same as those listed later in this document (e.g. Guaranteed Investment Contract). Bond funds will be invested in accordance with the statutory provisions governing the issuance of the bonds or the bond documents, as applicable.

Grant funds will be invested according to the statutory provisions applicable to the investment of the grant funds or the grant itself, as applicable.

### 5.6.2.2 Pooling of Funds
With the exception of cash in restricted and special funds, the District will consolidate cash balances from all funds to the extent practicable in order to maximize investment earnings and minimize fees.

## 5.6.3 Prudence

### 5.6.3.1 Standard of Prudence
The standard of prudence will be the “prudent investor” standard.

When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing public funds, the Board and its designated investment officer(s) shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic conditions and the anticipated needs of the District, that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiarity with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of the agency. This standard

5.6.4 Objectives  
The primary objectives, listed in order of priority, of the District’s investment activities are:

5.6.4.1 Safety  
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the District’s investment program. Investments will be executed in a manner that seeks to ensure preservation of capital in the overall portfolio, whether from institutional default, broker/dealer default or erosion of market value of securities. In attaining this objective, the District will strive to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk.

5.6.4.1.1 Credit Risk  
The District will minimize credit risk, the risk of loss due to the failure of the security issuer/backer, by:  
- Limiting investments to the safest types of securities;  
- Pre-qualifying the financial institutions, broker/dealers, intermediaries and advisors with which the District will do business; and  
- Diversifying the investment portfolio by sector and issuer.

5.6.4.1.2 Interest Rate Risk  
The District will minimize the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio will fall due to changes in general interest rates, by:  
- Structuring the investment portfolio so that securities meet the cash flow requirements, thereby avoiding, to the extent possible, the need to sell securities on the open market prior to maturity; and  
- Investing operating funds in shorter-term securities.

5.6.4.2 Liquidity  
The District’s investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to meet all cash flow requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent with cash flow requirements (static liquidity). Since all possible cash flow requirements cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should consist largely of securities with active secondary or resale markets (dynamic liquidity). As mentioned earlier, a portion of the portfolio should also be invested in short-term securities, which offer same-day liquidity.

<!-- Page 38 -->
# 5.6.4.3 Return on Investment
The District’s investment portfolio will be designed to attain an acceptable rate of return, taking into account the investment risk constraints and cash flow requirements.

# 5.6.5 Standards of Care

## 5.6.5.1 Delegation of Authority
The Finance Director is hereby designated as the “Investment Officer” in charge of managing the District’s investment program. The Investment Officer may delegate the day-to-day placement of investments to a registered investment advisor. The investment advisor shall make all investment decisions and transactions in strict accordance with State law and this Policy. The Investment Officer shall establish a system of written internal controls to regulate the District’s investment activities, including the activities of the investment advisor and any subordinate officials acting on behalf of the District.

## 5.6.5.2 Investment Procedures
The Investment Officer will establish written investment procedures for the operation of the investment program consistent with this policy. The procedures should include reference to: safekeeping, wire transfer agreements, banking service contracts and collateral/depository agreements. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the established procedures.

## 5.6.5.3 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the investment program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Investment officials and employees will disclose to the Investment Officer any material financial interests in financial institutions that conduct business within their jurisdiction, and they will further disclose any large personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the District.

# 5.6.6 Safekeeping and Custody

## 5.6.6.1 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
The District will conduct investment transactions with authorized financial dealers and institutions. All financial institutions and broker/dealers who desire to become qualified bidders for investment transactions must supply the Investment Officer with the following: proof of National Association of Security Dealers certification, completed broker/dealer questionnaire, certification of having read the District’s investment policy, and depository contracts.

An annual review of the registrations of qualified bidders will be conducted by the Investment Officer. A current broker dealer questionnaire is required to be on file for each financial institution and broker/dealer in which the District invests. The Investment Officer will maintain a list of authorized financial dealers and institutions.

If the District utilizes an investment advisor to conduct investment transactions on the District’s behalf, the investment advisor may use its own list of approved broker/dealers and financial institutions for investment purposes. The investment advisor’s approved list must be made available to District upon request.

As an additional source for investing, the District may utilize services designed for government agencies seeking competitive investment rates (e.g. GFOA Yield Advantage).

### 5.6.6.2 Internal Control
The Investment Officer will facilitate an annual process of independent review by the District’s external audit firm as part of the annual audit. This review will provide internal control by assuring compliance with policies and procedures.

### 5.6.6.3 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions, including collateral for repurchase agreements, entered into by the District shall be conducted on a delivery-versus payment (DVP) basis. Investments will be held in safekeeping by a third party custodian and evidenced by safekeeping receipts. The custodian will be competitively selected by the Investment Officer and will act under the terms of a custody agreement.

## 5.6.8.3 Investment Earnings
Investment earnings that are collected from investments authorized in this policy will be allocated monthly to the various program areas based upon their respective participation and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

## 5.6.8.4 Investment Pools
A thorough investigation of the pool/fund is required prior to investing. At a minimum that review should consist of the following:

- the frequency with which deposits and withdrawals can be made;
- the process and timeline for withdrawals;
- a review of the fee schedule.

The Finance Director shall monitor the pool to ensure he/she is aware of any changes made to the pool in the above categories.

## 5.6.8.5 Review of Investment Portfolio
The securities held by the District must be in compliance with Section 7.0 Authorized and Suitable Investments at the time of purchase. Because some securities may not comply with Section 7.0 Authorized and Suitable Investments subsequent to the date of purchase, the Investment Officer shall at least quarterly review the portfolio to identify those securities that do not comply. The Investment Officer shall establish procedures to report to the Board, should one exist, major and critical incidences of noncompliance identified through the review of the portfolio.

## 5.6.9 Policy Considerations

### 5.6.9.1 Legislative Changes
Further restrictions on allowable maturities, investment type or percentage allocations imposed by any State of California legislative action, will be incorporated into the District’s Investment Policy as deemed prudent and supersede any and all previous applicable language.

### 5.6.9.2 Investment Policy Adoption
The District’s Investment Policy will be adopted by resolution or motion of the District’s Board of Directors. The policy will be reviewed and updated periodically.

## 5.6.10 Reporting

### 5.6.10.1 Methods
The Investment Officer will provide investment reports to the Board. Such reports will provide a status of the current portfolio, along with economic conditions, potential future changes and investment strategies. The reports will include:
- A listing of the securities held by category;
- Maturity date of all investments;
<!-- Page 44 -->
- Coupon, discount or earnings rate;
- Par Value, Amortized Book Value and Market Value; and
- Percentage of the portfolio by category.

5.6.10.2 Performance Standards  
The investment portfolio will be developed with the objective of attaining a rate of return commensurate with the District’s investment risk constraints, cash flow requirements and the economic environment. An appropriate benchmark will be established against which portfolio performance can be compared on a regular basis.

5.6.10.3 Marking to Market  
The market value of the portfolio will be calculated monthly, with a statement of market value issued. This will ensure that review of the investment portfolio, in terms of value and price volatility, has been performed consistent with the GFOA Recommended Practice on “Mark-To-Market Practices for State and Local Government Investment Portfolios and Investment Pools.”

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** March 27, 2024  
**Subject:** San Juan Membership in the Regional Water Authority  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Discussion and Possible Action  

**BACKGROUND**  
Director Costa requested that this item be placed on the agenda, to allow for a discussion about San Juan’s participation in the Regional Water Authority, including discussion of topics relevant to the Sacramento Groundwater Authority.

San Juan was one of the founding members of RWA and has participated in various subscription programs since the inception of the organization. San Juan currently provides funding for and participates in the water efficiency program and the groundwater bank program. San Juan had previously been a participant in the state legislative subscription program, which is now a core program (and in which San Juan’s representatives participate). San Juan also participates in the non-disclosure agreement collaboration on the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan/Voluntary Agreement, which is supported by RWA. San Juan’s dues are currently $68,400 per year, and its contribution to the water efficiency program is $15,703 in FY 23-24. San Juan has contributed $50,000 to the RWA member agency costs of the groundwater bank, which totals $1,703,000 in the Phase 1 and 2 Agreements, and has committed to provide an additional $35,000 in funding.

Some topics the Board may want to discuss:
- Development of the groundwater bank, certain proposed operating rules, and their relationship to the current operations of San Juan, its Wholesale Customer Agencies and its other partners
- The role of RWA in representing its Member Agencies’ positions on various issues
- The structure of the SGA Board of Directors and the process for designating such members
- Salaries and the compensation studies that underlie them

Attached are the comments that San Juan’s RWA Board members provided on RWA’s strategic plan.

**Staff Report – San Juan and RWA**  
March 27, 2024  

### Strategic Plan Priorities

10. Are there any priorities your organization believes are important that are NOT in the Strategic Plan? If yes, please list them.  
There needs to be more engagement on regulatory issues as noted above. The current breadth of legislative engagement should be narrowed to focus on many fewer bills to allow for increased engagement on the regulatory front, along with the necessary communication and education of the membership about what is being proposed and adopted that will significantly impact costs and operations.

11. If you could change anything about the Strategic Plan, what would you change to benefit your organization? Please explain what and why.  
We would prioritize the objectives identified herein because we believe they would serve the membership best.

12. Do you believe the RWA is adequately implementing and effectively operating in a manner that is consistent with the Strategic Plan? Please explain why.  
Per note above, we believe too much of limited staff time and resources are spent on legislative lobbying and instead more attention needs to be paid to the regulatory arena and keeping the member agencies informed and educated.

### RWA Mission

The RWA’s mission is: To serve, represent and align the interests of regional water providers and stakeholders for the purpose of improving water supply reliability, availability, quality and affordability.

13. Thinking about the RWA’s mission: What are the challenges your organization is experiencing in the context of the mission?  
RWA leadership does not do well in respecting differences of opinion and interests, too often failing to build consensus, or even trying to work toward it, and instead imposing a particular position over an objection. This type of association should value real engagement and addressing concerns of its members as collaboratively as possible. We don’t think that is an RWA leadership priority, which is a challenge.

Another concern we have is that the mission statement above is not consistent with the mission defined for RWA in Recital B of its Joint Powers Authority (JPA) Agreement which is: “The mission of the Regional Authority is to serve and represent the regional water supply interests, and to assist the Members of the Regional Authority in protecting and enhancing the reliability, availability, affordability and quality of water resources.” RWA’s JPA mission statement does not include any reference to “aligning” the interests of its member agencies, because it is not the role of an organization whose purpose is to be a forum for developing a common message to dictate any position that a member agency should have on any subject. It appears that this concept of “aligning” is the crux of many conflicts that exist between the Executive Director and several member agencies. RWA was not established to be the sole point of contact nor the sole “spokesagency” for its member agencies, and no such policy exists in any of its policies. This repeated pursuit of
<!-- Page 55 -->
Staff Report – San Juan and RWA  
March 27, 2024  p. 5  

“alignment”, particularly when there is none, and the related efforts to muzzle member agencies, is also a problematic challenge.  

14. Thinking about the RWA’s mission: What could the RWA do within its mission that would be most helpful to your organization?  
Fix the “challenges” identified above.

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** March 27, 2024  
**Subject:** Mid-Year Financial Report – Fiscal Year 2023-24  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Receive report.

**BACKGROUND**  
The Board of Directors adopted the Fiscal Year 2023-24 Operating and Capital Budget on June 28, 2023. The Board of Directors receives budget to actual reports at each Board Meeting. Approximately halfway through a fiscal year, staff performs a deep analysis of the year-to-date revenues and expenses and projects the annual results and compares those projections to the adopted budget. A mid-year analysis of this nature affords the District the opportunity to course correct, if necessary, and/or to be assured that the financial activities and position of the District are on course with the approved budget.

The purpose of this report is to summarize the mid-year budget analysis for the Board of Directors.

**Mid-Year Financial Report**  
**Donna Silva**  

As illustrated in the graph above, both wholesale revenues and expenses are tracking favorably with the budget. Estimated revenues are 14.8% greater than budgeted and expenses are estimated to be 3.6% less than budgeted.

Water sales to the regular wholesale customer agencies are slightly higher than was anticipated in the budget. The increased deliveries, combined with the new rates, are expected to generate revenues that are 6.7% greater than anticipated in the original budget. The original budget did not assume a rate increase. The budget anticipated revenues of $1.3 million from treating Sacramento Suburban Water District’s (SSWD) PCWA water. The District ceased deliveries to SSWD in February. Based on actual deliveries, total revenues from SSWD will be $2.25 million, almost $1 million more than anticipated in the original budget.

Wholesale operating expenses are projected to be $368,100 less than budgeted. The largest variance comes from Source of Supply. The District had budgeted $275,000 for Warren Act and NEPA work. The consultant is currently on hold waiting for modeling information which is unlikely to be available prior to the end of the fiscal year.

The budget anticipated a transfer in from wholesale capital to fund the required reserve for the Hinkle Reservoir SRF loan. However, based on the additional revenues from water treatment and sales, a transfer from capital will not be needed. On the contrary, the operating fund should be able to transfer out approximately $1.3 million to the capital fund, continuing the District’s progress towards achieving pay as you go status for its robust capital program.

**Wholesale Capital:**  
Wholesale capital revenues, comprised this year predominately of proceeds from the Hinkle Reservoir SRF loan, are on track with the original budget. The final proceeds from the loan will not be received until next fiscal year, but higher than expected property tax revenues and investment income more than offset that negative variance. Staff estimates wholesale capital revenues will be approximately 0.5% greater than anticipated in the original budget.

The wholesale capital expenditure budget funded 34 projects/equipment purchases totaling $5,043,200. The Hinkle Reservoir project is taking longer than anticipated to complete, taking time away from staff’s ability to complete all planned projects. 4 of the projects or equipment purchases are complete. Staff estimates that 10 more projects will be completed by the end of year and another 6 projects will be underway. 11 projects will not commence by year’s end and will be re-budgeted next year. As a result, wholesale capital expenditures are expected to be $2.8 million or 44% less than budgeted.

**Fiscal Year 2023-24**

| Revenues                     | Expenses       |
|------------------------------|----------------|
| Budget: $23,927,800         | $5,043,200     |
| Actuals as of February: $22,993,512 | $1,656,375     |
| Mid-Year Estimate: $24,036,972 | $2,824,200     |

The budget anticipated wholesale capital reserves of $19.08 million after a transfer out to wholesale operations of $958,700 to fund the Hinkle Reservoir SRF loan reserve. Based on favorable estimates of operating activity, not only will that transfer out not be needed, the operating fund should be able to send $1.3 million into the capital fund. Staff projects an ending reserve balance of just under $25.3 million in the wholesale capital fund.

**Retail Operations:**
Retail operations are on track with the budget, with a small positive variance. Revenues were budgeted at $17,257,500. The mid-year estimate for revenues is $17,586,100, an overall increase of 1.9%. Half of the increase is due to increased water sales. Consumption is estimated to be just 0.1% higher than staff estimated for the original budget. The number of connections paying the base charge is also higher by approximately 0.1%. Between those two factors, revenues from retail water sales are estimated to be 1.9% greater than the budget. With such a small variance, actual results could vary in either direction, but the original budget continues to appear reasonable, if not slightly conservative.

**Retail Operating**  
**Mid-Year Budget Analysis**  
**Fiscal Year 2023-24**

| Revenues                | Expenses                |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Budget: $17,257,500    | Budget: $14,522,300     |
| Actuals as of February: $9,092,597 | Actuals as of February: $8,072,954 |
| Mid-Year Estimate: $17,586,100 | Mid-Year Estimate: $13,564,600 |

Operating Expenses were budgeted for $14,522,300 and are now projected to be about $13,564,600, which is $957,700, or 6.6%, less than the budget. A number of factors are contributing to this variance, as follows:

- Almost half of the variance is from lower-than-expected service area maintenance contractor costs. Staff utilize the services of Flowline Contractors for repairing leaks and assisting with the service lateral replacement program. A portion of their work is considered capital and is recorded in the Retail Capital Fund. It is difficult at the beginning of the year to determine the nature of their work for the year and therefore which fund it will draw from.
- Professional Services expenses in the Engineering Department are expected to be lower than the budget by approximately $220,000. Costs for activities such as GIS support, construction inspections and easement evaluations are expected to be about half of what was originally budgeted.
- The original budget included $162,600 for failed meter replacements. In accordance with the recently revised Capital Asset Policy, all meter replacements done in a fiscal year, whether due to planned replacement, or due to failure, are capitalized as a bundled asset. Therefore, all of the activity in this account will be recorded in the capital, not operating fund.

The budget anticipated a transfer out to capital reserves of $2,427,000. Given the favorable results from the prior year and the projected results of the mid-year analysis, the transfer out to capital could be as high as $3.9 million, which makes significant progress towards saving for future capital needs.

**Retail Capital:**
The Retail Capital Fund has budgeted revenues of $14,653,600. Staff's mid-year analysis estimates actual revenues will be just $6,484,000 due to the timing of the Kokila Reservoir project. The budget anticipated the loan agreement would be in place, and drawn upon by the end of the year, which is not the case. Staff is still working on the final submittals for the loan and will re-budget for this revenue in the next fiscal year.

Partially offsetting the impact of the delay in proceeds from the issuance of debt is the 4th consecutive year of extraordinarily high capital facility fee receipts. Because staff cannot reasonably predict this revenue source, the budget usually contains a very small estimate. At the time of the mid-year analysis the District had received $1.16 million in financial capital facility fees, when the budget only assumed $100,000. A significant chunk of the capital facility fee revenues are held in reserve, to be spent on specific projects that have an expansionary component, and thus were part of the basis for the establishment of the fee. Additionally, interest income is $279,000 higher than anticipated and property tax revenues are anticipated to be $96,400 higher than anticipated.

| Mid-Year Estimate | $6,484,000     | $8,813,600     |

The retail capital expenditure budget anticipated expenses of $8.8 million to fund 37 projects: 4 are already complete, 15 more are expected to be completed by the end of the year, 12 have either already started, or are expected to start, but not finish by years’ end, and 2 won’t be started until next fiscal year. Of the 37 total projects, 4 were deemed

not needed and will not be re-budgeted. Based on this, staff estimates expenses will be $8,813,600.

Due primarily to project delays in the prior and current year, staff estimates the Retail Capital Reserve will end the year with reserves of $20 million instead of the $4.1 million anticipated in the original budget. Of this amount, approximately $5.1 million is reserved capital facility fees, which will be spent on designated projects in the future.

Year-to-date income statements by fund can be found in the General Manager’s Monthly Report included in this meeting’s agenda packet.

**AGENDA ITEM IV-3**  

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** March 27, 2024  
**Subject:** Director Compensation  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Introduce and Waive First Reading of Ordinance No. 24-01 – An Ordinance of the Board of Directors of the San Juan Water District Adopting Ordinance 1200 Compensation of Board Members  

**BACKGROUND**  
Current Board member compensation is $125 per day for each day’s attendance and service at specified meetings and events as provided in District Board Policy BOD-2.2. California Water Code Section 20202 allows annual updates to Director compensation, in an amount not to exceed 5%, for each year that has elapsed since compensation was last increased. It also limits entitlement to compensation to 10 days per month. The last time Director compensation was increased was on April 13, 2005, when the Board adopted Ordinance 05-001 increasing Director compensation from $100 to $125 per day for a meeting or event. Pursuant to Water Code Section 20202, the maximum amount to which the compensation level could be increased would be $315.87 per day of service.

The Board discussed changing compensation at its February 28, 2024, meeting. The Board directed staff to develop an ordinance to set compensation at $200 per day of service, with a limit of compensation for no more than five days of service per month.

Attached is the proposed Ordinance 1200, as well as Ordinance 24-01.

**AGENDA ITEM V-1**  

**STAFF REPORT**  

To: Board of Directors  
From: Adam Larsen, Field Services Manager  
Date: March 27, 2024  
Subject: Hydrant and Valve Maintenance FY23/24  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to approve the Field Services Manager to sign Amendment #1, 1st year renewal to the professional services contract to Wachs Water Services (WWS) for professional services related to the inspection and maintenance of the District's hydrants and valves for the fiscal year 23/24, in the amount of $122,578 plus a 10% contingency, for a total authorized amount of $134,836.  

**BACKGROUND**  
On January 25, 2023, the Board approved a contract with Wachs Water Services (WWS) in the amount of $118,424. The District's contract with Wachs Water Services (WWS) included three optional, 1-year extensions/renewals. Staff are requesting Board approval for the 1st year renewal in the amount of $134,836. This project involves the inspection and maintenance of approximately 319 hydrants and their isolation valves, as well as 474 mainline valves in the District's distribution system. The contract period of performance will be extended an additional 365 days.  

The following detail summarizes the current agreement and proposed additions:  

| Contract/Amendment | Date        | Total      | Duration | Completion Date |
|---------------------|-------------|------------|----------|------------------|
| Original Contract    | 2/24/2023  | $118,424   | 365 Days | 12/31/2023       |

# AGENDA ITEM V-2

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** March 27, 2024  
**Subject:** Legislative Analysis on Various Bills  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Discussion of various bills which have an impact on the District.

---

**BACKGROUND**  

**AB 1827 – Support**  
This bill would provide that the fees or charges for property-related water service imposed or increased, as specified, may include the incrementally higher costs of water service due to specified factors, including the higher water usage demand of parcels. The bill is jointly sponsored by IRWD and California Coastkeeper. ACWA has adopted a support position, and RWA will likely support.

**SB 1110 – Support**  
This bill would provide additional guidance to the Water Board when it considers enforcement actions, and any discretion that it exercises. RWA is sponsoring this legislation.

**SB 1330 – Support**  
This bill would delay the enforcement measures in the conservation regulations to match the delays in the proceedings. It would also eliminate the threshold required to be able to use variances, and other changes recommended by the Legislative Analyst’s office. ACWA and RWA are both expected to take support positions.

**Initiative 1935 – Oppose**  
This initiative would create multiple additional requirements for approving taxes in California, including requiring not just a 2/3 approval by both houses of the Legislature, but also require approval of a majority of voters in an election. With respect to water rates and fees, the initiative would require that water agencies provide “clear and convincing evidence” that rates and fees are exempt charges (potentially to a judge, should someone challenge our rates and fees). There is also the requirement that water agency rates and fees do not exceed the actual costs of providing water supplies, with “actual costs” defined in the initiative. Water agencies would also have to adopt such fees and rates via ordinance (including retroactively doing so for any fees or rates adopted since January 1, 2022). All of these requirements are new and thus not well-defined, and will likely lead to lots of legal challenges, and thus pose significant risks to San Juan’s ability to adopt rates or fees that are necessary to ensure our financial stability. ACWA, CSDA and RWA all oppose this initiative.
