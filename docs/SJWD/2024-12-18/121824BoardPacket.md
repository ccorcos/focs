All items under the Consent Calendar are considered to be routine and are approved by one motion. There was no separate discussion of these items unless a member of the Board, audience, or staff requested a specific item removed. Consent Calendar item documents are available for review in the Board packet.

1. **Minutes of the Board of Directors Meeting, October 16, 2024 (W & R)**  
   **Recommendation:** Approve draft minutes

2. **Treasurer’s Report – Quarter Ending September 30, 2024 (W & R)**

4. **Records Management Policy Revisions (W & R)**  
   **Recommendation:** To adopt Resolution 24-08 revising Board Policy Adm-3.6 Records Management Policy

Director Tobin requested that Consent Calendar items 3 and 4 be removed for discussion.

Director Miller moved to approve the Consent Calendar items 1 and 2. Director Rich seconded the motion, and it carried with 4 Aye votes. (President Zamorano absent).

Vice President Costa opened the floor to Director Tobin regarding Consent Calendar item 3. Director Tobin suggested that any policy changes be held off until the new Board member is seated. In addition, she suggested that a third party be hired to review current policies to ensure that they align with legal requirements and best practices. She also had concern that the policies were placed on the Consent Calendar instead of under the regular agenda items.

In response to Director Miller’s question, General Counsel Ashjian informed the Board that Legal Counsel Jones did review the policy. GM Helliker explained that the policy is composed of elements that are included in the Personnel Manual and are being moved into a Board policy since there is no Board policy on these particular items. He explained that the policies on the Consent Calendar were reviewed by Legal Counsel and the Legal Affairs Committee, and it is the standard practice of the Board to place items on the Consent Calendar that have been reviewed by a committee.

Vice President Costa stated that Director Tobin’s comment regarding that the full Board is not present, and a new Board member will be at the next Board meeting had merit; however, he stated that her other arguments were without merit.

![November 20, 2024, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=November+20,+2024,+Board+Minutes)

Director Tobin moved to move Consent Calendar item 3 (Board Policy on the Prevention of Discrimination, Harassment, Violence in the Workplace and Abusive Behavior) to the next Board meeting when there is a full Board present. Director Rich seconded the motion.

Mr. Mike McRae addressed the Board and noted that once Sacramento County confirms the votes, he anticipates filling the Division 4 seat on the San Juan Board. He voiced concern that Board members are not considered regular employees and questioned the legality of this policy.

Ms. Berkema addressed the Board and agreed with Mr. McRae’s position and voiced concern regarding staff and Board member inter-relationships. In addition, she was concerned with whistleblowing and ethics training for District staff and Board members.

Ms. Jones addressed the Board and stated that this item should have been an action item on a previous Board agenda and not on the Consent Calendar.

Mr. Gary Flanagan addressed the Board and believes that this item is a way to control and manipulate Board members.

Director Miller stated that this item was reviewed by the Legal Affairs Committee (2 directors) and a recommendation was provided to the Board for consideration which was very transparent. He called for the question.

The motion carried with 4 Aye votes. (President Zamorano absent).

Vice President Costa opened the floor to Director Tobin regarding Consent Calendar item 4. Director Tobin voiced concern regarding Board policy 2.3.32 and a 30-day retention policy. The Board Secretary inquired what section Director Tobin was reviewing in order to present it to the audience on the projector. It was discovered that Director Tobin was reviewing and commenting on the previous policy which was delayed until the December Board meeting.

Director Tobin moved to move Consent Calendar item 4 (Records Management Policy Revisions) to the next Board meeting when there is a full Board present. Director Rich seconded the motion.

Director Tobin would like to meet with Legal Counsel Jones prior to the Board meeting to discuss the policies – Vice President Costa directed GM Helliker to arrange that meeting.

Mr. McRae addressed the Board and encouraged the Board to delay the revisions to the Records Management Policy since the District is a party to a lawsuit and he believes that it would be best not to change this policy at this time.

**Page 5**

Ms. Berkema addressed the Board and was concerned about the 30-day retention period for audio recordings and whether or not the District is following the state guidelines. Vice President Costa encouraged the public to return to the next Board meeting when this topic will be discussed.

Ms. Jones addressed the Board and encouraged the Board to make sure that the retention periods match state and local laws. GM Helliker explained that Legal Counsel reviewed the document thoroughly and confirmed the citations in the retention schedule. The Board Secretary informed the Board and public that the Retention Schedule, located on the District’s website, contains links to the authorizing code that the retention period is based on for each item.

Ms. Kris Johnson addressed the Board and inquired what the compelling reason was for making the retention so short. The Board Secretary explained that it was set at 30 days based on prior legal counsel’s recommendation.

The motion carried with 3 Aye votes. (Director Miller voted No and President Zamorano was absent).

**IV. NEW BUSINESS**

1. **Recognition of Service of Kenneth H. Miller (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker conducted a brief presentation recognizing Director Ken Miller’s 40 years of service at the District and thanked him for his service and guidance. A copy of the presentation will be attached to the meeting minutes. Director Miller thanked the Board and staff and stated that it has been a very rewarding experience, especially seeing the District’s accomplishments over the years. Director Rich read Resolution 24-09 and highlighted the amendment to the resolution to include naming the Administration Building the Kenneth H. Miller Administration Building. The Board and public members congratulated Director Miller and thanked him for his service.

   Director Rich moved to adopt Resolution 24-09 Recognizing Kenneth H. Miller for 40 Years of Service to the District with an amendment that the Board hereby names the Administration Building the Kenneth H. Miller Administration Building. Vice President Costa seconded the motion, and it carried with 4 Aye votes. (President Zamorano absent)

2. **Censure of Pamela J. Tobin (W & R)**  
   Vice President Costa announced the agenda item and Director Tobin stated that her middle initial is E. Director Rich stated that he added this item to the agenda and would like to amend the resolution to correct the middle initial to E. Director Rich explained that a censure is a formal vote of disapproval of a member’s conduct and he read a written statement that will be attached to the meeting minutes. The written statement outlines the reasons he brought this request for the Board’s consideration. In response to Vice President Costa’s comment, Director Rich indicated that the comments in the written statement are consistent with the resolution.
<!-- Page 10 -->
Vice President Costa commented that the Brown Act violation allegations are pretty serious and then questioned if Director Tobin sent out a mailer. Director Tobin confirmed that she sent out a mailer and that the use of the District's logo was totally unintentional and that it was not her intention to misrepresent and that she did not seek endorsement from the Board. She stated that she received a cease and desist notice from GM Helliker and did not do further mailers. In addition, she questioned the posting indicating that there was an illegal use of the District's logo and who determined that it was illegal.

Director Tobin stated that she disagrees with a lot of Director Rich's comments and that she brought issues to the Board that they needed to be made aware of that were disregarded. In response to Vice President Costa asking if the District's logo was still on her website, Director Tobin stated that it was not and that she took it off. Director Rich commented that the logo on her website is the District's logo.

Vice President Costa inquired if there was any evidence that the four Board members conspired to censure Director Tobin. Director Tobin responded that she did not have a source but there was no due process. She rebutted that she was not taken off as the RWA representative for the reasons that Director Rich stated, and that she wants to be open and transparent and able to discuss actions that the District at risk.

Vice President Costa and Director Tobin discussed President Zamorano's conversation with her that occurred in November, and her interactions with GM Helliker, her attorney, and the FPPC. Vice President Costa inquired of Directors Rich, Miller and Tobin if they had discussed any topic that was on tonight's agenda with him and none of them had done so. They discussed the committee assignments, and Vice President Costa commented that if he is chair next year, he will move committee assignments around.

Vice President Costa voiced concern regarding Director Tobin's campaigning at the Citrus Heights Chamber of Commerce event at City Hall. Director Tobin informed the Board that she asked in advance to speak at the event, and it was approved for her to do so.

Director Miller asked the public if they had attended more than one Board meeting over the last six months, and a few raised their hand that they had. He stated that to understand the Board and their actions, attending one or two meetings is not adequate to have knowledge about the process.

Director Rich commented that the resolution does not prohibit Director Tobin from performing the duties that she was elected to do. Vice President Costa commented that she could perform her duties for internal meetings but would not be allowed to represent the District in any external meetings.

Vice President Costa opened the floor for public comment.

Ms. Caryl Sheehan, Citrus Heights Water District Board member, addressed the Board and indicated that she is opposed to the resolution and requested that this item be removed from the agenda or at the least delayed until the next Board meeting when the newly elected Board members are seated.

Mr. Wes Trumell, from Fair Oaks, addressed the Board and voiced concern that there may be a conflict of interest with regard to Director Rich and Tobin voting on this issue since they are implicated in the resolution, and made some comments about the contents of the resolution.

Mr. McRae addressed the Board and commented that it’s clear that there is friction on the Board and that this process is not extending the olive branch. He also commented that using the logo should not be an issue or considered a show of endorsement or be considered illegal. He recommended that the Board delay this permanently or until the next Board meeting. Director Miller commented that it would be a copyright infringement as well and it is strictly prohibited by state law – Mr. McRae added that may be true if a court of law determines his interpretation is true.

Ms. Amber Beckler addressed the Board, stating that she has attended previous Board meetings, and voiced concern about ensuring a newly elected, not certified, Board member. She suggested hiring an independent conflict management consultant to help the Board work through underlying challenges. Vice President Costa informed the public that the Board already did this. In addition, she was concerned with taking away Director Tobin’s ability to represent her division. She stated that censuring is highly serious and encouraged the Board to remove this item completely.

Mr. Flanagan addressed the Board and stated that he received the email regarding improper use of the District’s logo and that the District does not support any candidates and thought it was fine until the part regarding pursuing legal action. He commented that the information sent out showed bias and was wrong.

Ms. Johnson addressed the Board stating that she supports Director Tobin as an active member of the Board, believes there should have been previous discussions with Director Tobin prior to this action, and is very disappointed in seeing this being considered.

Ms. Berkema addressed the Board and pointed out that the censure resolution does not have a time limit. She stated that, on social media, Director Rich and GM Helliker repeatedly posted messages in opposition of Director Tobin and gave a bad impression of San Juan Water.

Ms. Jones addressed the Board and highly recommended that the action be tabled or removed completely from the agenda. She stated that there are some very potential illegalities and unethical conduct by members of the Board and the General Manager if the Board passed the resolution tonight. In addition, she informed the Board that she spoke to Placer County District Attorney, Morgan Gire, today and
<!-- Page 12 -->
![November 20, 2024, Board Minutes](https://example.com/image-url)

**November 20, 2024, Board Minutes**  
**Page 8**

Based on what he has read and has seen here, there is enough cause for them to have an investigator look into all of this. Vice President Costa encouraged her to proceed and provide his name. She stated that if they find anything substantive, the Placer County DA is good friends with the Sacramento County District Attorney as well. She then stated that if the Board passes this without due process for Director Tobin, she will recommend that Director Tobin file a complaint with both the Sacramento County grand jury and the Placer County grand jury. She further commented that the Board works for the ratepayers as elected officials.

Ms. Sandy Harris addressed the Board and voiced concern regarding the 3rd statement of the resolution since Director Tobin represents the District on the regional committees and provides detailed summaries of those meetings to the Board and feels it would be a huge mistake to remove her from those responsibilities.

Director Miller explained that he asked his question earlier about attendance at Board meetings since Board meetings are open to the public and it seemed like some members of the public do not believe that the Board is transparent. In response to Director Miller’s comment of whether there is a ratepayer or a Supervisor giving the Board direction, Ms. Jones responded that she is both. He commented that the situation that the Board is dealing with needs to be acted upon.

Director Tobin commented that she has had a differing opinion on how the District should be run, with accountability being key. She commented that the District was removed from the CIA Voluntary Settlement Agreement due to a breach of confidentiality by the General Manager which removed the District from attending meetings and the District had to hire a Water Attorney because the District was not involved in those talks. She stated that each time she brings something to the attention of the Board that she gets retaliated against. She informed the public that she filed a complaint with the California Department of Civil Rights regarding the retaliation and bullying that she has experienced and feels that the censure is a way to shut her up and make her go away. In addition, she commented that the District used to be a leader in the region and the District is no longer there. She further commented that the General Manager was not appointed to the ACWA Water Management Committee due to his actions. She suggested that the Board hire a consultant to bring the Board together and teach them how to be better Board members and work cohesively.

In response to Vice President Costa’s questions about the Board’s attempt to shut Director Tobin up and the use of the District’s logo, Director Tobin responded that the censure is an attempt to shut her up and it was not her intention to use the District logo.

GM Helliker asked to provide Ms. Karen Humphrey’s written chat comments, as she was having technical difficulties with her audio. The Board Secretary read Ms. Humphrey’s comments which stated that she strongly opposed the censure and asked that it be withdrawn. In addition, she commented that she was concerned with Director Tobin being unable to continue to hold external positions including as Past
<!-- Page 13 -->
![Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=November+20%2C+2024%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+9)

President of ACWA, one of the few women ever to hold the position. GM Helliker responded in the chat that Director Tobin was not being prevented from serving as Past President, only from representing San Juan.

Director Rich commented that he presented the resolution because it has been an accumulation of many actions by Director Tobin over the years, including misrepresentation and name calling, which became public over the election period. He commented that the censuring will not stop Director Tobin from performing the duties that she was elected to do and is basically a formal complaint from the Board. In addition, he explained that the 2nd item is an attempt to have Director Tobin stop making false allegations, which has been discussed in the past. He explained that the 3rd item is to remove her from external committees during the censure since she has been making statements that are unprofessional and unqualified to people outside the Board.

In response to Director Tobin’s comment about ACWA Immediate Past President position, Director Rich responded that she would continue to be the ACWA Immediate Past President, as nobody could take that away from her.

Vice President Costa commented that San Juan has a problem that started when GM Helliker came on board with a specific management style that has been backed by the Board and that one Board member cannot supervise the policy of the Board. He commented that when Director Tobin became ACWA Vice President, she was removed from being the RWA representative. In addition, he pointed out that when the Board voted not to send Director Tobin to the ACWA DC conference in Washington, that was the Board’s decision which should not be challenged.

Director Tobin commented that Washington was very important to attend and denying her that opportunity was nothing more than a retaliatory move. She commented that President Zamorano stated in a public meeting that he was voting no because she needed to be nicer to staff. Ms. Jones commented that it was protected speech, and the Board can’t censure Director Tobin for protected speech. Vice President Costa responded that the Board is not censuring her for protected speech.

Vice President Costa commented that the Board requested Director Tobin to meet once a month with GM Helliker, about three years ago, to get their differences straightened out but she refused to meet. Director Tobin stated that she started meeting with him but discontinued doing so because he has more twists and turns than a country road. Ms. Jones stated that Director Tobin does not work for the General Manager, he works for her, and Vice President Costa commented that Ms. Jones, as a County Supervisor, meets with her general manager and other staff, which she responded that she meets twice a month with her staff person.

Director Rich moved to adopt Resolution 24-10 Censuring Pamela E. Tobin. Vice President Costa seconded the motion.
<!-- Page 14 -->
![November 20, 2024, Board Minutes Page 10](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=November+20%2C+2024%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+10)

Director Tobin commented that the Board should listen to the ratepayers.

Ms. Berkema commented that she would like to be on Director Tobin’s EEOC complaint and that she would like to file a complaint with the Board regarding Paul Helliker and Director Rich.

Ms. Jones inquired if Vice President Costa interacts with any other water agencies. Vice President Costa stated that he attends a lot of those meetings as that’s the only way to know what’s going on in those agencies. Ms. Jones commented that she works closely with PCWA and they are not happy about anything that is happening with this Board.

Ms. Beckler asked Legal Counsel to clarify the rules around conflict of interest for voting on this particular matter. Legal Counsel Ashjian responded that she does not know the circumstances of Director Rich’s involvement regarding campaigning for Director Miller. Legal Counsel Ashjian stated that for censuring there is not any kind of recusal and there is no conflict to have both Director Rich and Director Tobin included in the vote. In addition, Legal Counsel Ashjian commented that as for campaigning, she is not aware of the circumstances and that would need to be investigated.

Mr. Flanagan commented that this action should be delayed and the attorney should look into the Nextdoor posts and whether or not Director Rich should be allowed to vote or recuse himself. In addition, he commented that Director Miller should also recuse himself since he lost the election to Director Tobin and may be vindictive.

Vice President Costa asked Legal Counsel Ashjian about the accusations that were just made. The member of the public said he did not make any accusations and that he made recommendations. Vice President Costa asked Legal Counsel Ashjian if there were any reason why any of the four Board members should not vote on this agenda item. Legal Counsel Ashjian responded that Legal Counsel Jones looked into the Nextdoor posts and there does not seem to be any conflict. Director Rich stated that he was concerned about the resolution, so Legal Counsel Jones reviewed it as well. In response to Vice President Costa’s question regarding delaying this action, Director Rich stated that he did not want to hold this over to the next meeting.

A member of the public inquired if the censure would impact Director Tobin’s job in any way or not allow her to serve on any committees. Vice President Costa said that it would not impact her job and that she would be allowed to serve on internal committees.

Legal Counsel Ashjian informed the Board that she had talked to Legal Counsel Jones on this particular item with regard to NextDoor and there is no conflict of interest with the censure motion.

Director Miller inquired how Mr. Flanagan would know his state of mind after the election and possible vindictive actions since the election results have not been finalized and certified. Mr. Flanagan stated it could be the perception.

Mr. Tom Gray addressed the Board and stated that at least four times, in public meetings, a director has used foul language during a Board meeting, and the Board has never taken any action.

The motion carried with 3 Aye votes and 1 No vote (Director Tobin voted No and President Zamorano was absent).

Director Tobin wanted her objection noted in the minutes and then left the meeting.

Vice President Costa called for a break at 8:15 pm.

Vice President Costa called the meeting back to order at 8:22 pm.

3. Water Treatment Plant Memorandum of Understanding (W)  
Ms. Silva reviewed the staff report which was included in the Board packet. She explained the Water Treatment Plant operators’ work schedules and the fact that a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is needed due to the unique work schedules. She informed the Board that there is an existing MOU, but it was not approved by the Board, which is a requirement of CalPERS. She explained that without Board approval, the shift operators will not be entitled to a pension that is based on the compensation they receive for working their assigned normal work schedule under the terms of the MOU that has governed their employment for the past 20 years.

Ms. Silva reported that the revised MOU does not include substantive changes to the WTP Operator pay or benefits, and is similar to the existing MOU, but she pointed out two changes: 1) a change to the work week from Saturday 3:00 pm through Saturday 2:59 pm to Saturday 12:00 am through Friday 11:59 pm so that the WTP Operators can be in alignment with the rest of the District and utilize the electronic timesheet system, and 2) a change in the work schedule from one 24-hour day on, and two off, to two days on-four days off.

Ms. Silva explained that it was discovered that the method that the District has been utilizing to report the WTP Operator’s time to CalPERS is incorrect and it needs to be corrected. She explained that part of the $7,500 is to correct the erroneous reporting that has occurred over the years and the other part is to capture the overtime from their regular pay.

Ms. Silva informed the Board that, if approved by the Board, staff will be sending the MOU to the CalPERS Special Compensation unit for review; therefore, if there are substantive issues with the MOU, staff will return to the Board with recommended edits. In addition, she informed the Board that the shift operators and the day operators would like to further discuss and analyze the unpaid sleep shift, so this might be brought to the Board at a later date for consideration.

4. District’s 457 Deferred Compensation Plan (W & R)

5. ACWA General Session Membership Meeting Delegate (W & R)  
GM Helliker explained that the Board needs to appoint a delegate for the ACWA General Session Membership meeting.

## Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards

**Board of Directors**  
San Juan Water District  
Granite Bay, California  

### Independent Auditor’s Report

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental activities and each major fund of the San Juan Water District (the “District”), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated December 5, 2024.

### Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. We identified a deficiency in internal control, described below that we consider to be a significant deficiency.

### 2024-001 Purchasing Noncompliance for Inventory Purchases Over $50,000

During our test of purchasing compliance, we identified an instance of noncompliance with the District’s purchasing policies related to inventory purchases exceeding $50,000. The District’s policy requires Board of Director’s approval for purchases exceeding $50,000. Due to the nature of inventory purchases typically not exceeding this threshold, the District staff
<!-- Page 21 -->
![Audit Report](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Audit+Report)

did not identify that the transaction required Board approval. The District staff identified this issue prior to our testing and took action to obtain retroactive Board approval prior to the start of the audit.

**Recommendation**  
To address this issue, we recommend the District reinforce the policy requiring Board approval for inventory purchases above $50,000 through additional training for procurement and finance teams. The District could also utilize a reporting mechanism to periodically review high-value transactions to monitor compliance.

**Management’s Response Regarding Corrective Action Taken or Planned**  
In the June 26, 2024 Board meeting, management received approval from the Board to amend the District’s procurement policy to increase the General Manager’s purchasing limit, exclude certain expenses from procurement policy, add language allowing the use of other governmental procurement contracts and approve specific invoices/purchase orders paid/issued in Fiscal Year 2023-24 in excess of the purchasing authority in the current procurement policy. Training on the revised policy was provided through the District’s training software Target Solutions. Additional in-person training is also planned.

**Report on Compliance and Other Matters**  
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

**The District’s Response to Findings**  
Government Auditing Standards requires the auditor to perform limited procedures on the District’s response to the findings identified in our audit and described previously. The District’s response was not subjected to the other auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response.

**Purpose of this Report**  
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Board of Directors  
San Juan Water District  
Granite Bay, California  

We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities and each major fund of the San Juan Water District (the “District”) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, and have issued our report thereon dated December 5, 2024. Professional standards require that we advise you of the following matters relating to our audit.

**Our Responsibility in Relation to the Financial Statement Audit**

As communicated in our engagement letter dated May 15, 2024, our responsibility, as described by professional standards, is to form and express an opinion about whether the financial statements that have been prepared by management with your oversight are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our audit of the financial statements does not relieve you or management of your respective responsibilities.

Our responsibility, as prescribed by professional standards, is to plan and perform our audit to obtain reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, as part of our audit, we considered the internal control of the District solely for the purpose of determining our audit procedures and not to provide any assurance concerning such internal control.

We are also responsible for communicating significant matters related to the audit that are, in our professional judgment, relevant to your responsibilities in overseeing the financial reporting process. However, we are not required to design procedures for the purpose of identifying other matters to communicate to you.

We have provided our letter regarding significant control deficiencies over financial reporting and other matters noted during our audit in a separate letter to you dated December 5, 2024.

**Planned Scope and Timing of the Audit**

We conducted our audit consistent with the planned scope and timing we previously communicated to you in our letter dated June 11, 2024.

**Compliance with All Ethics Requirements Regarding Independence**

The engagement team, others in our firm, as appropriate, and our firm have complied with all relevant ethical requirements regarding independence under the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) independence standards, contained in the Code of Professional Conduct.
<!-- Page 23 -->
![Audit Report](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Audit+Report)

We identified independence threats related to the preparation of the financial statements and proposing journal entries. We have applied certain safeguards to reduce the threats to an acceptable level, including using an independent party within the firm to perform a quality control review of the financial statements, and obtaining confirmation from the San Juan Water District management that their review of the financial statements included comparing the financial statements and footnotes to the underlying accounting records.

**Significant Risks Identified**

During the planning of the audit, we identified the accounting and disclosures related to new SRF loans and compliance with Federal grant requirements as a significant risk.

**Qualitative Aspects of the Entity’s Significant Accounting Practices**

**Significant Accounting Policies**

Management has the responsibility to select and use appropriate accounting policies. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the District is included in Note 1 to the financial statements. There have been no initial selection of accounting policies and no changes in significant accounting policies or their application during 2024. No matters have come to our attention that would require us, under professional standards, to inform you about (1) the methods used to account for significant unusual transactions and (2) the effect of significant accounting policies in controversial or emerging areas for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus.

**Significant Accounting Estimates**

Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based on management’s current judgments. Those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management’s current judgments.

The most sensitive accounting estimates affecting the financial statements include management’s estimate of the pension and OPEB liability and related balances based on actuarial reports. We evaluated the key inputs and assumptions used by the actuary to calculate the balances and determined that they are reasonable in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

**Financial Statement Disclosures**

Certain financial statement disclosures involve significant judgment and are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statement users. The most sensitive disclosures affecting the District’s financial statements relate to the District’s Defined Benefit Pension Plan and Other Post-Employment Benefits Plan.

**Significant Difficulties Encountered during the Audit**

We encountered no significant difficulties in dealing with management relating to the performance of the audit.
<!-- Page 24 -->
![Uncorrected and Corrected Misstatements](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Uncorrected+and+Corrected+Misstatements)

**Uncorrected and Corrected Misstatements**

For purposes of this communication, professional standards also require us to accumulate all known and likely misstatements identified during the audit, other than those that we believe are trivial, and communicate them to the appropriate level of management. Further, professional standards require us to also communicate the effect of uncorrected misstatements related to prior periods on the relevant classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures, and the financial statements as a whole and each applicable opinion unit. There were no such misstatements. Uncorrected misstatements or matters underlying those uncorrected misstatements could potentially cause future-period financial statements to be materially misstated, even though the uncorrected misstatements are immaterial to the financial statements currently under audit. There was one uncorrected misstatement detected during the audit process to record approximately $46,000 in interest receivable for investment interest earned through June 2024. The effects in the current and prior period, as determined by management, is immaterial to the financial statements taken as a whole.

In addition, professional standards require us to communicate to you all material, corrected misstatements that were brought to the attention of management as a result of our audit procedures. There were no material misstatements that we identified as a result of our audit procedures.

**Disagreements with Management**

For purposes of this letter, professional standards define a disagreement with management as a matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction, concerning a financial accounting, reporting, or auditing matter, which could be significant to Commission’s financial statements or the auditor’s report. No such disagreements arose during the course of the audit.

**Representations Requested from Management**

We have requested certain written representations from management in a letter dated December 5, 2024.

**Management’s Consultations with Other Accountants**

In some cases, management may decide to consult with other accountants about auditing and accounting matters. Management informed us that, and to our knowledge, there were no consultations with other accountants regarding auditing and accounting matters.

**Other Information Included in Annual Comprehensive Financial Report**

Pursuant to professional standards, our responsibility as auditors for other information, whether financial or nonfinancial, included in the District’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, does not extend beyond the information identified in the audit report, and we are not required to perform any procedures to corroborate such other information. However, in accordance with such standards, we have read the other information and considered whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and the financial statements, or the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

Our responsibility also includes communicating to you any information which we believe is a material misstatement of fact. Nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that such information, or its manner of presentation, is materially inconsistent with the information, or manner of its presentation, appearing in the financial statements.
<!-- Page 25 -->
![Other Significant Matters, Findings, or Issues](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Other+Significant+Matters,+Findings,+or+Issues)

In the normal course of our professional association with the District, we generally discuss a variety of matters, including the application of accounting principles and auditing standards, significant events or transactions that occurred during the year, operating and regulatory conditions affecting the entity, and operational plans and strategies that may affect the risks of material misstatement. None of the matters discussed resulted in a condition to our retention as the District’s auditors.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of Directors and management of the District and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

Kokila Reservoir is a 4.56 million gallon Hypalon lined and covered earthen reservoir. The reservoir serves as an operational and emergency storage facility at a high elevation point within the District's Bacon Pressure Zone, approximately 5 miles north of the District's Water Treatment Plant. The cover and liner were installed in 1984 with an estimated life of 25 years. Regular maintenance has extended its life; however, it is now in need of replacement. The Kokila Reservoir Replacement Project will replace the aged reservoir cover and liner with a concrete tank.

To: Members of the Board of Directors San Juan Water District and Ratepayers of the San Juan Water District

We are pleased to present the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) for the San Juan Water District (District) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 (fiscal year 2024).

**REPORT PURPOSE AND ORGANIZATION**

The purpose of this letter is to introduce the basic financial statements and provide an analytical overview of the District’s financial activities. The information presented in this ACFR is intended to provide financial information with all the disclosures necessary to enable the District’s customers, investment community and general public to assess the District’s financial condition. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to accompany the basic financial statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). This letter of transmittal is designed to complement the MD&A, which can be found immediately following the report of the independent auditors.

The ACFR is published in accordance with State law that requires financial statements be published within twelve months of the close of each fiscal year and be presented in conformity with GAAP and audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified public accountants. It is also prepared to meet reporting standards set forth by the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA). This report contains management’s representations concerning the finances of the District. Management is responsible for the completeness and reliability of all the information presented in this report. To provide a reasonable basis for making these representations, management of the District has established a comprehensive internal control framework that is designed to both protect the District’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse, and to compile sufficient reliable information for the preparation of the District’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Because the cost of internal controls should not outweigh their benefits, the District’s comprehensive framework of internal controls has been designed to provide reasonable rather than absolute assurance that the financial statements will be free.

from material misstatement. As management, we assert that, to the best of our knowledge and belief, this financial report is complete and reliable in all material respects.

The District’s financial statements have been audited by Davis Farr, LLP, a firm of licensed certified public accountants. The goal of the independent audit is to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements of the District for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, are free from material misstatement. Information on the audit, and the auditor’s opinion, can be found in the Independent Auditor’s Report beginning on page 1.

## ABOUT THE DISTRICT

Not everyone who reads this report is familiar with our District and it is hard to understand a government’s finances without knowing something about the entity and how it operates. Let us tell you a little about the San Juan Water District!

### History

The District was formed as a result of petitions being presented to the Board of Supervisors of Sacramento and Placer Counties by Citrus Heights Water District, Fair Oaks Water District, Orange Vale Water Company and a group of homeowners in South Placer County. An election was held within the boundaries of the sponsoring districts on February 10, 1954. At this election, voters approved the formation of the San Juan Water District by nearly a two-thirds majority and elected five Directors. The District is a community services district formed under Section 60000 et seq., Title 5, Division 3 of the California Government Code.

The District provides water on a wholesale and retail basis to an area of approximately 17 square miles for retail and 46 square miles for wholesale (which includes the retail area) in Sacramento and Placer Counties.

The District’s wholesale operations include: protecting access to reliable and sufficient water supplies; operating and maintaining a surface water treatment plant; operating and maintaining treated water storage; pumping and transmission facilities; and delivering treated water to five retail agency customers (San Juan Water District retail division, Fair Oaks Water District, Citrus Heights Water District, Orange Vale Water Company and the City of Folsom); and providing the administrative support necessary to successfully carry out those functions.

San Juan’s retail operations consist of operating and maintaining storage, pumping, transmission and distribution facilities, which deliver water to approximately 10,900 retail service connections located in a portion of Northeast Sacramento County and the Granite Bay area of South Placer County, and providing the administrative,

customer service, water efficiency and engineering support necessary to successfully carry out those functions.

## Mission Statement

The District’s mission is to ensure the delivery of a reliable water supply of the highest quality at the lowest reasonable price.

## Water Supply

The District’s existing water supply consists of three separate raw water contracts. The first source of water comes from a settlement contract with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) whereby it is required to deliver the District’s pre-1914 and post-1914 water rights water from the American River, totaling 33,000 acre-feet. The second source is a water service contract with Reclamation for 24,200 acre-feet of Central Valley Project water. The District secured a long-term (40 year) renewal of this contract in 2006. The third water source is a contract with Placer County Water Agency for up to 25,000 acre-feet of water.

All sources of surface water are either stored or flow through Folsom Lake and delivery is taken at Folsom Dam outlets, either by gravity or pumped by the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation Folsom Pumping Plant. Total raw water for the fiscal year 2024 was 49,469.74 acre-feet.

In response to the recent drought and in preparation of future drought conditions, the District recently partnered with two nearby water districts, Placer County Water Agency and the Sacramento Suburban Water District, to construct inter-ties to allow water supplies to be shared and transferred if normally available supplies are reduced and/or inadequate to meet immediate demands for either district.

## Water Efficiency

The District has long been a proponent and practitioner of cost-effective water efficiency programs. The implementation of these programs has been highly successful, and the District complies with best management practices that are required by the Sacramento Area Water Forum Agreement, California legislation SBx7-7 (2009), the California Department of Water Resources, and the Central Valley Project Improvement Act.

The District’s water efficiency programs include:

- **Water Awareness Poster Contest and Calendar** – Since 1992, the District and its wholesale agency customers, Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks water districts and Orange Vale Water Company, have promoted water awareness at the elementary school level through an annual water conservation poster contest.
<!-- Page 34 -->
- **Rebate Program** – The District provides rebates for the purchase of high-efficiency washing machines, and hot water on-demand recirculation systems as well as irrigation efficiency rebates to both residential and non-residential customers.
- **Free Programs** – District staff provides free indoor and outdoor water audits, leak detection, and recommendations to improve irrigation system performance. Staff also creates landscape water budgets and irrigation schedules to improve efficiency. The District conducts and hosts a variety of workshops on drip systems and proper irrigation techniques, landscape design, soil health, tree maintenance, controller management and other water efficiency topics. A speakers’ bureau is available to talk to groups about water efficiency programs and water supply and reliability issues.
- **Water Efficient Landscape (WEL) Garden** – Located behind the District’s administrative office are gardens to inspire visitors to create a water efficient landscape that looks beautiful every season. The garden demonstrates efficient irrigation and non-water-using materials to create a beautiful landscape.

The benefits of these programs include more cost-effective and efficient use of water and increased customer awareness of the importance of water efficiency to contribute to future reliability of water supplies.

The District became 100% metered and began billing all customers on a metered rate on January 1, 2005.

### Water Treatment Plant

The District’s water treatment facility, the Sidney N. Peterson Water Treatment Plant (WTP), was constructed in three phases beginning in 1975 and completed in 1983. The WTP includes two flocculation-sedimentation basins, two filter basins, an operations building and a covered 62-million-gallon storage reservoir. Major upgrades and improvements to the WTP have been made over the years, including increasing its maximum seasonal capacity (May 15th to September 30th) to 150 million gallons a day (mgd) from its original 100 mgd. Those past upgrades, and ongoing efforts to identify and implement projects and process improvement to increase efficiency, cost effectiveness, and productivity, all contribute to the District’s success in reliably satisfying customer demands while continuing to meet or exceed all Federal and State regulatory requirements.

The WTP receives delivery of raw water directly from Folsom Dam outlets. The raw water undergoes an extensive water treatment process to ensure the highest quality of water for all customers. From the WTP, the water flows into the District’s 62-million-gallon Hinkle Reservoir for storage and distribution. The District maintains approximately 220 miles of transmission and distribution pipelines, which transport the high-quality treated water to wholesale and retail customers.
<!-- Page 35 -->
During the fiscal year 2024, the District worked on and/or completed several capital improvement projects to improve the water system reliability:

- **Hinkle Reservoir Cover and Liner Replacement Design** - critical to operations, the Hinkle Reservoir is a 62-million-gallon earthen reservoir, lined and covered with hypalon, which is a flexible membrane used to protect the water from contamination. The hypalon was installed in 1981 with an estimated life of 25 years. Regular maintenance has extended its life, but it needed replacement. The reservoir was taken offline in November 2022, and while it was put back online in June 2023, project completion was not completed until July 2024.
- **Replacement of the Transmission pipeline in Eureka Road between Barton and Auburn Folsom Road** - This project replaced 3,925 linear feet of aged steel transmission pipeline in Eureka Road from Barton Road to Auburn Folsom Road. This aged pipeline replacement will ensure system redundancy by improving the backbone intertie between the Bacon and Lower Granite Bay Zones, allowing either zone to supply the other in the event of a pump station loss.

Other projects underway in the fiscal year 2024-2025 will continue to improve and efficiently maintain District water facilities.

### Accounting System and Budgetary Controls

The District operates on a fiscal year that runs from July 1 through June 30. The District’s accounting records are maintained using the accrual basis of accounting. The revenues of the District are recognized when they are earned, and the expenses are recognized when they are incurred.

The District staff works with the Finance Department to develop the annual budget. The budget is used as a management tool for projecting and measuring revenues and expenses. The process typically begins in January when managers begin developing their budget requests to fulfill the District’s mission, goals and objectives for the next fiscal year. The Finance Department prepares the proposed budget which is presented to the Board of Directors in May for their review. A public hearing is usually held in June, with anticipated finalization and adoption scheduled for the following meeting or ideally no later than June 30th. The District is legally required to adopt a budget by September 1st of the budget year.

### Enterprise Operations

The District is one legal enterprise but is accounted for as two separate enterprise operations. The financial management and accounting for the two enterprise operations is recorded separately with an operating and a capital outlay fund for each enterprise. However, for financial reporting purposes all four funds are presented in a consolidated report. As additional information, the accounting for the four funds on a budget versus actual basis is provided.

# FACTORS AFFECTING FINANCIAL CONDITION

## Economic Outlook

The information presented in the financial statements is best understood when it is considered from the broader perspective of the specific economy within which the District operates. The District is located in Northern California approximately 20 miles Northeast of Sacramento and between the Cities of Folsom and Roseville. The District spans two counties in the region with the wholesale-only service area primarily in Sacramento County, and the wholesale/retail service area primarily within Placer County. Consistent with the national economy, the region as a whole has been experiencing a rebound in economic strength. After a two-year decline the Placer County unemployment rate ticked upwards to 4.2%, still a relatively low rate of unemployment. Sacramento County also ticked upwards from 4.5% to 4.8%. The national average unemployment rate in June 2024 was 4.1%. Unemployment rates in both Placer and Sacramento County were slightly higher than the national average.

Total assessed property values in both counties have improved. Placer County experienced a 11.0% increase in assessed property values in fiscal year 2023-2024 over the prior fiscal year, and Sacramento County experienced a 7.3% increase in fiscal year 2023-2024 values over the prior fiscal year. The San Juan Water District is located in a relatively low growth area of both counties. There were 138 more retail service connections for the current fiscal year, which represents a growth rate of approximately 1.27% for the year.

## Water Supply Outlook

As a result of California’s severe multi-year drought that began in 2013, the State required the District’s retail enterprise to achieve a 36% reduction in water use from June 2015 through February 2016, and a 33% reduction in water use from March through May 2016, as measured against 2013 usage. Over that time period the District achieved an actual overall reduction in use of 35.6%. In June 2016, the State’s conservation mandate was lifted.

Though increasing slightly from 2016 to 2021, water demands did not fully rebound to pre-drought/pre-2015 levels. This was anticipated as some customers permanently modified their landscapes to use less water.

In July 2021, Governor Newsom signed an executive order encouraging all Californians to reduce water use by 15% as 50 of the state’s 58 counties were declared to be in another drought-related state of emergency. On October 19, 2021,
<!-- Page 37 -->
he issued a proclamation extending the drought emergency statewide and further urging Californians to step up their water conservation efforts as the western U.S. faced a potential third dry year.

On May 31, 2018, Governor Brown signed legislation intended to help the state better prepare for droughts and climate change by establishing various water efficiency mandates. On July 3, 2024, The State Water Resources Control Board formally adopted the regulation to implement the framework effective January 1, 2025. The framework requires: district-wide water budgets that will continue the need for programs to reduce indoor and outdoor water use by residential customers; increase water use efficiencies by commercial customers; and requires agencies to aggressively address distribution system water loss.

California’s increasing regulatory focus on reducing water use over the last decade or so, and financial lessons learned during drought periods, prompted the District, and many other water agencies, to begin to modify its rate methodology to shift charges from being primarily volumetric based to being focused on fixed cost recovery regardless of usage. This refinement provides better long-term alignment of revenues with costs.

Based upon the previous 5 Year Retail Financial Plan, the District applied its rate increases to the daily (fixed) base rate, as opposed to the volumetric rate. This resulted in a shift in the proportion of total revenue derived from the base rate from 55%, to close to 68% of total rate revenues. The financial plan and rate schedule adopted by the Board in January 2022 continues this shift towards the base rate for one more year, at which point approximately 72% of retail revenues will be derived from the base rate, which aligns more closely with the ratio of the District’s fixed versus variable costs. The Wholesale rates were subsequently adjusted to achieve maximum alignment between costs and revenues. This rebalancing has helped strengthen the District’s financial stability and reduced the need for special drought related rate increases.

Long-term Financial Planning

In order to ensure funds are available to meet both operating and capital needs, the District (for both Wholesale and Retail Operations) established a financial planning process with development of a Master Plan that contains a review of current infrastructure, and that recommends projects for a 20 to 30-year period. The District then estimates current and future operating needs and works with a rate consultant to develop a water rate study and financial plan.

The District completed an update to the Wholesale Financial Plan, resulting in a five-year rate schedule adopted by the Board of Directors at the December 13, 2023, board meeting. Rates will increase approximately 5.0% for each of the next three
<!-- Page 38 -->

years, commencing with January 2024 and an increase of 4.0% for the year 2027 and 2028.

The District is finalizing its Retail Financial Plan and Rate Study and anticipates board adoption of the new five-year rate schedule in early 2025.

**Relevant Financial Policies**

The District’s adopted budget document contains a listing and explanation of relevant financial policies, including reserve policies. Information regarding District reserves can be found in Note H to the Financial Statements.

Government Finance Officers Association of the United States and Canada (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to the San Juan Water District for its annual comprehensive financial report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. In order to be awarded a Certificate of Achievement, a government must publish as easily readable and efficiently organized annual comprehensive financial report. This report must satisfy both generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legal requirements.

A Certificate of Achievement is valid for a period of one year only. We believe that our current annual comprehensive financial report continues to meet the Certificate of Achievement Program’s requirements, and we are submitting it to GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.

The preparation of the annual comprehensive financial report was made possible by the dedicated services of the entire staff of Finance, Retail Operations (Water Efficiency, Customer Service, Engineering Services, and Field Services), and Wholesale Operations. This specifically includes the continuing support of the Board of Directors of the District in the planning and implementation of the financial affairs of the District.

**Independent Auditor’s Report**  

**Board of Directors**  
San Juan Water District  
Granite Bay, California  

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements**  

We have audited the financial statements of the San Juan Water District (the “District”) as of and for the year June 30, 2024, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents.  

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the District, as of June 30, 2024, and the respective changes in financial position and cashflows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

**Basis for Opinion**  

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the San Juan Water District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  

**Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements**  

The District’s management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the District’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.  

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**  

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.  

---
<!-- Page 44 -->
In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.
- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the District’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control–related matters that we identified during the audit.

**Required Supplementary Information**

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that management’s discussion and analysis, pension and other post employment benefit schedules, as listed in the table of contents, be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context.

We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

**Supplementary Information**

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements that collectively comprise the District’s basic financial statements. The supplemental sub-fund statements and schedules and capital asset rollover schedules are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements.

The supplemental statements and schedules are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic.
<!-- Page 45 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Financial+Report+Page)

financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the supplemental statements and schedules are fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

**Other Information**

Management is responsible for the other information included in the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report. The other information comprises the introductory section and statistical section but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and the financial statements, or the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the other information exists, we are required to describe it in our report.

**Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards**

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated December 5, 2024 on our consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

# MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

In order to enhance the information provided in the transmittal letter, management offers this narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the San Juan Water District (District) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 (Fiscal Year 2024). We encourage readers to consider the information here in conjunction with that transmittal letter, which can be found on pages i-viii of this report. The information is intended to provide a better understanding of the District’s financial operations and performance.

## HIGHLIGHTS

The District’s activities vary, sometimes significantly, from year to year resulting in changes to the District’s revenues, expenses and capital project spending, and overall cash flows. Operating revenues were stable with just a 9.46% increase over the prior year. Operating expenses were 33.73% higher than the prior year. Non-Operating Revenues and Expenses combined were 43.01% more than the prior year and capital contributions were down 70.60%. The activities that affected District revenues and expenses most notably for the period ending June 30, 2024, are highlighted below, in order of magnitude and discussed in greater detail starting on page 10.

- **Retail Water Sales:** For the period ended June 30, 2024, the District had retail water sale revenues of $16.8 million, an increase of $1.7 million or 11.4%, from the prior year, and 1.2% higher than anticipated in the budget.

- **Investment Income:** The District investment income increased by $1.0 million from the prior year. The 133.6% increase is primarily due to a combination of more cash in the investment portfolio and higher interest rates than the prior year.

- **Capital Charges and Other Capital Revenue** decreased by $2.3 million over the prior year, a 61.6% decrease. Revenue from Contributed Assets decreased by $3.0 million from the prior year.

- **Pension Expense:** the District had a pension revenue of $533,209 in the prior year due to the District’s commitment to paying off its unfunded pension liability and a 21.3% investment return experienced by CalPERS in 2021. This year the District has a pension expense in the amount of $4.4 million, an increase in expense of 921.4% from the prior year. The shift from revenue to expense is due to factors such as an investment loss of 6.1% in 2022, discount rate adjustments, which is the assumed rate of return on investments. Rising interest rates, inflation, and an increased life expectancy are leading to a larger gap between the present value of future pension obligations and the current value of the pension fund’s assets.
<!-- Page 47 -->
# OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The four sections of the District’s financial statements are: 1) introductory section, 2) financial section, 3) supplemental information section, and 4) statistical section.

The Introductory Section includes the letter of transmittal, list of Board of Directors and Staff, and organization chart.

The Financial Section includes the auditor’s report, management’s discussion and analysis and basic financial statements. The District’s basic financial statements are comprised of the Statement of Net Position, Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position, and Statement of Cash Flows. The Statement of Net Position presents information on all assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources with the difference between these items reported as net position. When evaluated over a period of time, increases or decreases in net position may serve as an indicator of whether the financial position of the District is improving or deteriorating. The Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position reflects the revenues and expenses for the fiscal year ended. The Statement of Cash Flows shows the sources and uses of cash in the operating, non-capital, capital and related financing, and investing activities. The notes provide in-depth information that is vital to gaining a full understanding of the data provided in the financial statements. The notes to the financial statements begin on page 17.

The Required Supplementary Information Section provides information on the funding progress of the District’s pension and postemployment benefits plans.

The Supplemental Information Section provides additional information on administrative and general expenses and budget versus actual comparisons. The Statistical Section provides additional information not contained in the financial section on District activities.

# FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE DISTRICT

Unlike a private company, as a government agency, the District is not in the business to make a profit. The District has two major financial goals, which are:

1. Recovering the cost of providing services to its constituents and other customers, and
2. Securing the financial resources needed to maintain and improve the capital facilities used in providing those services.

The financial statements assist a reader in determining whether the District is meeting these goals. In general, net position provides a realistic indicator of a government’s financial position. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, assets and deferred outflows of resources exceeded liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $116,835,110. In the prior year, assets exceeded liabilities by $108,667,107.

A summary of the Statement of Net Position follows:

| **Total Net Position** | $ 116,835,110 | $ 108,667,107 | $ 8,168,003   |

As shown in the table above, total assets increased $35.1 million or 23.5% compared to the prior fiscal year. Capital Assets increased by $5.3 million primarily due to $2.1 million in capital asset additions, offset by current year depreciation and disposals and $30.4 million in construction-in-progress for capital improvement projects under construction throughout the District. Notable projects would be the Hinkle Reservoir Rehabilitation with a cost of $24.1 million, and Eureka Rd. Pipeline with a cost of $3.7 million. Both projects were substantially completed and in service during the current fiscal year. Noncurrent assets increased by $1.6 million primarily due to an increase in leases receivable. The district renewed their cell tower lease with T-Mobile in March 2024 for an additional 5 years with 5 options to extend another 5 years until termination date of February 28, 2053.

Deferred Outflows of Resources decreased by 15.5% or $1.7 million. The decrease is attributable to pension and OPEB related deferred outflows of $1.6 million, predominately due to the difference between the District’s actual contributions and
<!-- Page 49 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

the District’s proportionate share of the pooled plans contributions between the prior and current year, offset by a decrease in deferred charges on refunding $81,262, which is due to the refunding of the 2012 Refunding Bonds.

Total liabilities increased by $24.1 million, 49.5% from the prior year. The majority of the increase is due to the increase in long-term debt by 77.9% or $23.8 million. The District received State Water Board California’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) loan proceeds for both Hinkle Reservoir Rehabilitation project and Eureka Rd. Pipeline project as discussed in note 6. In addition, there was an increase of 30.1% or $1.2 million in the OPEB liability and an increase in pension liability of $877,826 million or 16.9% as discussed above and on notes 10 and 9 respectively.

Deferred Inflows of Resources increased by $1.1 million or 38.2%. Most of the increase is due to lease related deferred inflows of $1.5 million with an offset of $434,413 in pension, OPEB and 2012 Refunding Bonds related deferred inflows.

The District realized an overall increase in net position of $8.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. The components of net position as of June 30, 2024, are:

- **Net Investment in Capital Assets:** is the largest portion of the District’s net position, 54.4% and reflects its net investment in capital assets (e.g., land, buildings, machinery, and equipment) less any related debt used to acquire the assets that it still owns standing. In the prior year, net investment in capital assets represented 77.0% of net position. The District utilizes capital assets to serve its customers; therefore, these assets are not available for future spending. While the District’s investment in capital assets is reported net of related debt, the funds needed to repay this debt must be contributed from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities.

- **Restricted Net Position:** The District charges Capital Facility Fees to new development. A portion of the fee is designed to help pay for the expansion of the system to accommodate new development. As such, a portion of the fees collected, but not spent by the end of a fiscal year are restricted for future use on the designated capital projects. As of June 30, 2024, the District held $3.4 million of capital facility fee revenues earmarked for such expansionary projects. In addition, the District set aside an additional $131,522 to establish a debt service reserve for the Eureka Rd. Pipeline State Water Board California’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) loan as required by the loan agreement. The State Water Resources Control Board loan agreement states that the loan recipient (District) must establish a restricted reserve fund equal to one year’s debt service on the loan obligation and must maintain the reserve fund throughout the term of the loan agreement.

- **Unrestricted Net Position** represents resources available to the District to utilize in the future for various needs. The Board of Directors has designated the unrestricted net position for various specific purposes. An explanation of these reserve funds can be found in Note 8 to the financial statements.

| Net Position, End of Year                 | $116,835,110 |

As shown in the table above, the District’s net position increased by $8.2 million for the period ending June 30, 2024. Revenues were relatively stable, increasing 4.5%, which was largely due to increases in water sales and investment income over the prior year. Expenses increased 32.3% or $7.2 million mainly because of the $5.3 million increase in retiree medical (OPEB) and Pension Benefit expenses and $1.9 million increase in operation expenses. Contributed assets (infrastructure donated by developers upon completion of their projects), decreased by $3.0 million, due to a real estate market decrease in development activity. Year-over-year changes and variances from the budget are more fully described and depicted below.
<!-- Page 51 -->
![Comparative Revenues by Source (Current Year, Budget, Prior Year)](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768)

The graph above shows revenue sources, in order of magnitude, as compared to the budget and the prior year.

**Water Sales:**
Retail water sales were up by $1.7 million while wholesale water sales were up $568,683 from the prior year while for a combined increase of $2.3 million over the prior year.

- **Retail Water Sales:** For the period ended June 30, 2024, the District supplied 10,340 acre-feet of water to 11,014 retail connections, compared to 10,083 acre-feet of water to 10,876 connections in the prior fiscal year. This, combined with a January 1 8% rate increase, resulted in total retail water sales revenues of $16.8 million, an increase of $1.7 million or 11.4%, from the prior year. Actual revenues were 1.2% higher than those anticipated in the budget.

- **Wholesale Water Sales:** Revenues from wholesale water sales increased by $568,683, a 5% increase over the prior year. The District has five core wholesale water customers. It periodically enters into separate agreements with other agencies to provide for the sale of water that is surplus to the needs of the core customers. In the prior fiscal year, the District sold 28,712 acre-feet of water to the core customers, as compared to 34,203 acre-feet in the current year. Increased sales, plus a mid-year rate increase contributed to the increased.
<!-- Page 52 -->
revenues. In addition to sales to its core customers, the District had one agreement in place with an entity outside of the wholesale service area as follows:  
• Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD): SSWD relies primarily on groundwater to serve its customers but occasionally purchases raw water from the Placer County Water Agency (PCWA). When they do so, they pay the District to treat the raw water on their behalf. SSWD is only able to purchase raw water from PCWA when the estimated March-November unimpaired inflow to Folsom Reservoir is 1.6 million acre-feet or more, a condition which existed this year. As a result, the District received revenues of $3.1 million for treating SSWD’s PCWA water. In the prior year the District sold its own water to SSWD, in addition to treating their PCWA water. Current year revenues from SSWD were 1.6%, or $48,683 more than in the prior year.  

**Tax Assessments:**  
Revenues from Property Taxes increased by $131,850 or 4.8%, a result of increasing assessed values within both Sacramento and Placer counties.  

**Investment Income:**  
Investment income increased $1.0 million compared to the prior year. The District realized interest income of $1.3 million and a $420,408 unrealized market value gain on its investment. During FY23-24, the District received $22,019,068 of reimbursement loan proceeds from the State Water Board California’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) for the Hinkle Reservoir Rehabilitation project and $3,345,186 of loan proceeds for the Eureka Rd. Pipeline project. These loans proceeds were transferred to the State of California Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) upon receipt and later a portion transferred to CAMP investments. LAIF interest rates increased to 4.5% in the current year from 3.2% as of June 30, 2023. During FY23-24 the District diversified its investments by diverting a portion of their investment funds to a new account with CAMP which annual term yields were 5.2% as of June 27, 2024. While the District is able to withdraw 100% of its contributions, plus interest, at any time, it is required to report on the market value of the pool.  

**Capital Charges:**  
Revenues from Capital Charges decreased 61.6% or $2.3 million. These are fees paid by developers to defray the impact of their development on existing rate payers. The timing of the payments is at the discretion of the developer. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, the real estate market faced challenges due to high mortgage rates, which remained at 6.6% for a 30-year fixed-interest loan, leading many developers to halt projects and resulting in decreased revenues compared to the previous year.  

**Contributed Assets:**  
Revenue from Contributed Assets decreased by $3.0 million from the prior year. When the District determines existing District facilities are inadequate to serve a development project, or a new single service connection, the new service or services are not allowed to connect into the system until the applicant makes arrangements with the District for a main line extension or for water facilities improvements in accordance with Ordinance 130000. Usually this results in the developer or applicant
<!-- Page 53 -->
![Comparative Expenditures by Type (Current Year, Budget, Prior Year)](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Graph+Placeholder)

**Other Revenues:**
Revenue from other operating and non-operating activities increased by $427,372 from the prior year, a 51.6% increase. Cost recovery was higher than in the previous year as more activity on engineering and field services projects was accomplished during the year. 

**Depreciation:**
Depreciation increased slightly by $750,950 or 18.2% due to asset additions. The District does not budget for depreciation.

**Transmission and Distribution:**
These expenses, originating from the Retail Field Services Department, decreased 2.5% over the prior year, but were 16.3% less than anticipated in the budget due to lower-than-expected service area maintenance contractor costs.
<!-- Page 54 -->
![Source of Supply](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Source of Supply**  
Source of Supply represents the costs incurred to procure water. It includes both the costs to receive the wholesale water, and the costs incurred by the retail division to buy the treated from the wholesale division. This is the second largest expense category and was stable compared to the prior year, increasing only 4.2%. In addition, it was 9.3% less than anticipated in the budget due to Warren Act contract renewal and NEPA work being put on hold waiting for modeling information which was not available as of the end of the fiscal year.

**OPEB and Pension Expenses**  
Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) and Pension Expenses both varied significantly from the prior year and the budget. OPEB, or retiree medical, expenses were up relative to the prior year due to lower-than-expected investment returns, and rising interest rates. Actual expenses were lower than budget as the budget is prepared on a cash basis, planning for actual retiree medical premiums and a supplemental contribution to the trust.

Pension expenses, like OPEB, are budgeted based on cash payments expected to be remitted to CalPERS during the year while the pension expense is calculated in conformance with GASB 68. CalPERS reported a net return of 9.3% on its investments for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2024, which outpaced the discount rate of 6.8%, comparable to an assumed rate of return and a policy marker established by the CalPERS Board of Administration. While the return was good it was not sufficient to offset the overall increase in liabilities. There were no significant changes in actuarial methods or assumptions for the June 30, 2023, valuation. However, the ongoing impact of previous assumptions changes continues to affect the unfunded liability. The plan's demographic experience, such as retirements, deaths, and salary increases differed from the assumptions. This non-investment experience contributed to the increase in unfunded liability. Higher-than-expected inflation rates have put upward pressure on contribution requirements and downward pressure on the funded status. Inflation also affects cost-of-living adjustments for retirees and salary increases for active members. CalPERS continuously adjusts its investment strategy to optimize returns while managing risk. This includes diversifying the investment portfolio and incorporating leverage to reduce exposure to higher-risk investments and increase exposure to lower-risk investments.

**Administration and General**  
Actual expenses were higher than the prior year by 23.4% and were $185,424, or 5.1% more than the budget. This category includes many departments such as the Board of Directors, Executive, Finance, Human Resources, Information Technologies, etc. so the increase is due to a combination of small items coming in higher than anticipated.

**Water Treatment**  
These expenses originate primarily from the District’s Water Treatment Plant. Actual expenses were $244,534 greater than the prior year, but $852,071 less than budgeted. The budget had anticipated general price increases, some but not all of which were realized.
<!-- Page 55 -->
![Interest Expense](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Interest+Expense)

**Interest Expense**  
Debt Interest increased by $73,479 or 7.3% due additional debt established for both Hinkle Reservoir Rehabilitation and Eureka Rd. Pipeline SRF loans.

**CAPITAL ASSET AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION**

**Capital Assets**  
The District’s investment in capital assets as of June 30, 2024, net of accumulated depreciation, is $120,905,313. This investment includes land, buildings, water treatment plant, distribution system, construction in progress, vehicles, equipment, office equipment and furniture. At June 30, 2023, this amount was $115,590,202.

The increase of $5,315,111 from the prior fiscal year is largely due to an increase in reservoirs and pipelines. At June 30, 2023, the District had $86,433,499 in reservoirs and pipelines. At June 30, 2024, the District had $117,777,873.

The 2017 Revenue Refunding Bonds advance refunded the 2009 Certificates of Participation and were issued with ratings of “AA” from Standard & Poor’s Rating Group.

The 2012 Refunding Certificates of Participation (COP) were issued with ratings of “AA” from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group and upgraded to “AA+” by Fitch Ratings, Inc. They were refunded this year with the 2022 Refunding Loan at a favorable interest rate of 1.6%.

The Hinkle Reservoir Rehabilitation loan represents the State Water Board California’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) loan with a 1.2% per annum interest rate.

The Eureka Rd. Pipeline loan represents the State Water Board California’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) loan with a 1.1% per annum interest rate. The District must pay interest annually, by December 31 of each year, until one year after completion of construction. Beginning no later than one year after completion of construction, the District must make annual payment of the principal of the project funds, together with all interest accruing thereon by December 31, 2026. Eureka Rd. Pipeline project was completed in August 2023.

## BUDGET AND RATES

The District adopts annual non-appropriated budgets for planning and control purposes. The budgets are adopted on a modified cash basis. Budgetary controls are set at the department level. The General Manager has the authority to reallocate budgeted funds between accounts within a fund or project.

The District’s budget contains four funds: one operating budget each for wholesale and retail, and one capital budget each. On June 26, 2024, the Board approved the Fiscal Year 2024-2025 operating and capital budget in a total amount of $55,175,100.

The District completed a 5-year Wholesale Financial Plan and Rate study in 2023 that resulted in a 5-year rate schedule, commencing January 1, 2024. Under the approved schedule wholesale water rates will effectively increase by 5.0% in each year through 2026 and 4.0% through 2028. The District’s retail rate schedule has been unchanged since the last increase in January 2024. The District is currently finalizing an update to the Retail Financial Plan and Rate study.

## CONDITIONS AFFECTING CURRENT FINANCIAL POSITION

With the adoption of a 5-year Wholesale Rate Schedule the District has substantially achieved alignment between its fixed and variable costs in the wholesale rate structure. This alignment brought stability to the District’s finances as costs and revenues moved in the same direction at generally the same time. The District has been successful in securing low interest rates loans to finance its largest capital projects and has implemented long term infrastructure replacement programs that will ensure the reliability of the treatment and distribution now and in the future.
<!-- Page 57 -->
With the anticipated completion and adoption of the Retail Rate Schedule the District hopes to also achieve alignment between its fixed and variable costs in the retail rate structure and to mitigate any negative impacts caused by the inflation over the past few years.

## Notes to the Basic Financial Statements
### Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024

(1) **Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

The basic financial statements of the San Juan Water District (the District) have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as applied to government units. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the accepted standard setting body for establishing governmental accounting and financial reporting principles. The more significant of the District’s accounting policies are described below.

(a) **Reporting Entity**

The District was incorporated March 4, 1954 as a community service district under community service district law of the State of California (Section 60000 et. seq., Title 5, Division 3 of the California Government Code). The District is governed by a five member Board of Directors elected by the voters within specific geographic divisions for staggered, four year terms, every two years. The District provides water to retail customers in Sacramento and Placer Counties and sells water on a wholesale basis to other agencies. The accompanying basic financial statements present the District and its component unit. The component unit discussed below is included in the District’s reporting entity because of the significance of its operational and financial relationship with the District. The financial statements of the District have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), as applied to enterprise funds. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the accepted standard setting body for establishing governmental accounting and financial reporting principles.

The District has created the San Juan Suburban Water District Financing Corporation (the Corporation) to provide assistance to the District in the issuance of debt. Although legally separate from the District, the Corporation is “blended” as if it were part of the primary government because it shares a common Board of Directors with the District and its sole purpose is to provide financing to the District under the debt issuance documents of the District. Debt issued by the Corporation is reflected as debt of the District in these financial statements. The Corporation has no other transactions and does not issue separate financial statements.

(b) **Basis of Presentation**

The District’s resources are allocated to and accounted for in these basic financial statements as an enterprise fund type of the proprietary fund group. The enterprise fund is used to account for operations that are financed and operated in a manner similar to private business enterprises, where the intent of the governing body is that the costs (expenses, including depreciation) of providing goods or services to the general public on a continuing basis be financed or recovered primarily through user charges, or where the governing body has decided that period of determination of revenues earned, expenses incurred, and/or net income is appropriate for capital maintenance, public policy, management control, accountability, or other policies. Net position for the enterprise fund represents the amount available for future operations.

## Notes to the Basic Financial Statements
### Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

(c) **Basis of Accounting**

The accounting and financial reporting treatment applied to a fund is determined by its measurement focus. The enterprise fund type is accounted for on a flow of economic resources measurement focus. With this measurement focus, all assets, deferred outflows, liabilities, and deferred inflows associated with the operation of the fund are included on the balance sheet. Net position is segregated into amounts recorded as net investment in capital assets, amounts restricted and amounts unrestricted. Enterprise fund type operating statements present increases (i.e., revenues) and decreases (i.e., expenses) in net total position.

In the Statement of Net Position and Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position, business-like activities are presented using the accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recorded when the liability is incurred or the economic asset used. Revenues, expenses, gains, losses, assets and liabilities resulting from exchange and exchange-like transactions are recognized when the exchange takes place.

Those revenues susceptible to accrual include taxes, intergovernmental revenues, interest and charges for services. Earned and unbilled water services are accrued as revenue.

Grant revenues are recognized in the fiscal year in which all eligibility requirements are met. Under the terms of grant agreements, the District may fund certain programs with a combination of cost-reimbursement grants and general revenues. Thus, both restricted and unrestricted net position are available to finance program expenses. The District’s policy is to first apply restricted grant resources to such programs, followed by general revenues, if necessary.

Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from nonoperating items. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and producing and delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal operations. The principal operating revenues of the District are charges to customers for sales and services. Operating expenses for enterprise funds include source of supply, the cost of sales and services, administrative expenses, and depreciation of capital assets. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as nonoperating revenues and expenses. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the District’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are needed.

(d) **Cash and Investments**

For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the District's cash and cash equivalents include restricted and unrestricted cash on hand or on deposit, and demand deposits and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition.

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

(e) **Fair Value Hierarchy**  
The District categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles. In determining fair value, the District’s custodians use various methods including market and income approaches. Based on these approaches, the District’s custodians utilize certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The District’s custodians utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

Various inputs are used in determining the value of the District’s investments and other financial instruments. The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels: Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical investments, Level 2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.) and Level 3 – significant unobservable inputs (including the District’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of instruments).

(f) **Prepaid Items**  
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are recorded as prepaid items in the financial statements.

(g) **Inventories**  
Inventories are stated at cost, on a weighted average method. Inventories consist of materials and supplies.

(h) **Capital Assets**  
Capital assets are recorded at historical cost if purchased or constructed. Donated assets and capital assets received in a service concession arrangement are valued at estimated acquisition value on the date received. Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the following useful lives:

- Buildings and structures: 10-50 years
- Improvements other than buildings: 7-35 years
- Machinery and equipment (including furniture): 5-70 years
- Meters and endpoints: 10-25 years
- Plant and pipelines: 10-80 years
- Pump stations/pressure control stations: 12-40 years
- Reservoirs and improvements: 25-50 years
- Vehicles: 10 years
- Software: 10 years
- Intangible assets: Varies based on asset

## Notes to the Basic Financial Statements
### Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024

(1) **Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

The cost of maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially extend asset lives are charged to operations when incurred. It is the District’s policy to capitalize all capital assets with a cost of $5,000 or more. Costs of assets sold or retired (and the related amounts of accumulated depreciation) are eliminated from the balance sheet in the year of sale or retirement, and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations.

Water lines constructed by private developers and then dedicated to the District are recorded as capital contributions when they pass inspection by the District. The estimated value of the lines are capitalized as pipelines, reservoirs, pumping stations and buildings. The District is responsible for future maintenance once it accepts the water lines.

(i) **Long-Term Liabilities**  
Long-term liabilities and other long-term obligations are reported on the Statement of Net Position. Initial issue bond premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized over the life of the bonds using the straight-line method. The difference between the reacquisition price of refunding bonds and the net carrying amount of refunded debt (deferred amount on refunding) is amortized over the shorter of the lives of the refunding debt or remaining life of the refunded debt. Amortization of bond premiums or discounts and deferred amounts on refunding is included in interest expense.

(j) **Compensated Absences**  
It is the District’s policy to permit employees to accumulate earned but unused vacation and sick leave benefits (up to a maximum). These benefits will be paid to employees upon separation from service from the District in accordance with the vesting policy. The cost of vacation and sick pay is accrued in the period earned with an offsetting liability in compensated absences. The current portion is calculated as the amount that is estimated to be used during the next year and the remaining portion is included in the long-term liabilities.

(k) **Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions (OPEB)**  
For purposes of measuring the net OPEB liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to OPEB, and OPEB expense, and information about the plan (OPEB Plan), have been determined by an independent actuary. For this purpose, benefit payments are recognized when currently due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms.

Generally accepted accounting principles require that the reported results must pertain to the liability information within certain defined timeframes. For this report, the following timeframes are used:

- **Valuation Date**: June 30, 2023  
- **Measurement Date**: June 30, 2023  
- **Measurement Period**: June 30, 2022 to June 30, 2023

## Notes to the Basic Financial Statements
### Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

(l) **Pensions**  
For purposes of measuring the net pension liability and deferred outflows/inflows of resources related to pensions and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the District’s California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) plan (Plan) and additions to/deductions from the Plan’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by CalPERS. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when currently due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value.

GASB 68 requires that the reported results must pertain to liability and asset information within certain defined timeframes. The following timeframes are used for pension reporting:  
- **Valuation Date:** June 30, 2022  
- **Measurement Date:** June 30, 2023  
- **Measurement Period:** June 30, 2022 to June 30, 2023  

(m) **Deferred Outflows and Inflows of Resources**  
In addition to assets, the statement of net position reports a separate section for deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred outflows of resources, represents a consumption of net assets that applies to future periods and so will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until the earnings process is complete. Deferred amounts on refunding result from the difference in carrying amount of the refunded debt and its reacquisition price. This amount is deferred and amortized over the shorter of the life of the refunded or refunding debt. The District has three items that qualify for reporting in this category, deferred outflows related to refunding of debt, pensions and OPEB.

In addition to liabilities, the statement of net position reports a separate section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred inflows of resources, represents an acquisition of net assets that applies to future periods and so will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until the earnings process is complete. Deferred amounts on refunding may be reported as deferred inflows of resources. The District has four items that qualify for reporting in this category, deferred inflows related to refunding of debt, leases, pensions and OPEB.

(n) **Property Taxes**  
The District receives property taxes from both Sacramento and Placer Counties. Property taxes receivable are recorded in the fiscal year for which the tax is levied based on the assessed value as of March 1 of the preceding fiscal year. They become a lien on the first day of the year they are levied. Secured property tax is levied on January 1 and due in two installments, on November 1 and February 1. They become delinquent on December 10 and April 10, respectively. At that time, delinquent accounts are assessed a penalty of 10%. Accounts that remain unpaid on June 30 are charged an additional 12% per month.

## Notes to the Basic Financial Statements
### Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Unsecured property tax is levied on July 1 and due on July 31, and becomes delinquent on August 31. The penalty percentage rates are the same as secured property tax.

The District elected to receive the property taxes from the Counties under the Teeter plan. Under this program the District receives 100% of the levied property taxes in periodic payments with the Counties assuming responsibility for delinquencies.

(o) Water Charge to the Retail Service Area  
For accounting purposes a charge is made to the retail service area for water used at a wholesale rate. This amount is recorded as income to the wholesale unit and as expense to the retail area.

(p) Net Position  
The net position amount is the difference between assets/deferred outflows and liabilities/deferred inflows. Net investment in capital assets are capital assets, less accumulated depreciation and any outstanding debt related to the acquisition, construction or improvement of those assets, as well as any deferred amounts on debt refunding. Net position is reported as restricted when there are legal limitations imposed on their use by the District or external restricters by other governments, creditors or grantors. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the District’s policy to use restricted resources first, and then unrestricted resources as they are needed.

(q) Use of Estimates  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.

## Notes to the Basic Financial Statements
### Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024

(2) Cash and Investments (Continued)

### Investments Authorized by Debt Agreements
Investments held by the bond/COP fiscal agents (trustees) are governed by the provisions of the various debt indenture agreements rather than the general provisions of the District's investments policy or the California Government Code.

### Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that market rate changes could adversely affect the fair value of an investment. In general, the longer the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value to changes in market interest rates. One of the ways the District manages its exposure to interest rate risk is by purchasing a combination of shorter and longer term investments and by timing cash flows from maturities so that a portion of the portfolio is maturing or coming close to maturity evenly over time as necessary to provide the cash flow and liquidity needed for operations.

Information about the sensitivity of the fair values of the District's investments (including investments held by the bond trustee) to market rate fluctuations is provided by the following table that shows the distribution of the District's investments by maturity as of June 30, 2024:

| Remaining Investment Maturities | Total         | 12 Months or Less | 13 to 24 Months | 25 to 60 Months |
|----------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|

### Disclosures Relating to Credit Risk
Generally, credit risk is the risk that the issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment. This is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. Presented below is the minimum rating as categorized by the nationally recognized statistical rating organization required by (where applicable) the Ca. Government Code, the District’s investment policy, or debt agreements, and the actual credit ratings by Moody’s as of year-end for each investment type.

### Custodial Credit Risk
Custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that, in the event of the failure of a depository financial institution, a government will not be able to recover its deposits or will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in the possession of another party. The custodial credit risk for investments is the risk that, in the event of the failure of the counter-party (e.g., broker-dealer) to a transaction, a government will not be able to recover the value of its investments or collateral securities that are in the possession of another party. The California Government Code and the District's investment policy do not contain legal or policy requirements that would limit the exposure of custodial risk for deposits or investments, other than the following provision for deposits: The California Government Code requires that a financial institution secure deposits made by state and local governmental units by pledging securities in an undivided collateral pool held by a depository regulated under state law (unless so waived by the governmental unit). The market value of the pledged securities in the collateral pool must be equal to at least 100% of the total amount deposited by public agencies. California law also allows financial institutions to secure Agency deposits by pledging first trust deed mortgage notes having a value of 150% of the secured public deposits.

At June 30, 2024, the carrying amount of the District’s deposits were $2,914,903 and the balances in financial institutions were $1,514,066. Of this amount, $1,264,066 was not insured by federal depository insurance.

### Investment in LAIF
The District is a voluntary participant in the Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) that is regulated by the California Government Code under the oversight of the Treasurer of the State of California. The fair value of the District’s investment in this pool is reported in the accompanying financial statements at amounts based upon the District’s pro-rata share of the fair value provided by LAIF for the entire LAIF portfolio (in relation to the amortized cost of that portfolio).

(2) **Cash and Investments (Continued)**

The balance available for withdrawal is based on the accounting records maintained by LAIF, which are recorded on an amortized cost basis. LAIF is not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not rated. Deposits and withdrawals to and from LAIF are transferred on the basis of $1 and not fair value. This external pool has no limitations or restrictions on participant withdrawals.

### Investment in California Asset Management Program (CAMP)

The District is a voluntary participant in the California Asset Management Program (CAMP) that is regulated by the California Government Code. The fair value of the District’s investment in this pool is reported in the accompanying financial statements at amounts based upon the District’s pro rata share of the fair value provided by CAMP for the entire CAMP portfolio (in relation to the amortized cost of that portfolio). The balance available for withdrawal is based on the accounting records maintained by CAMP, which are recorded on an amortized cost basis.

### Fair Value Hierarchy

The District categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles. The hierarchy is based on the valuation inputs used to measure the fair value of the assets. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets; Level 2 inputs are significant other observer inputs; Level 3 inputs are significant unobservable inputs. The District has the following recurring fair value measurements as of June 30, 2024:

CalPERS issues publicly available reports that include a full description of the pension plans regarding benefit provisions, assumptions and membership information that can be found on the CalPERS website.

#### Benefits Provided
CalPERS provides service retirement and disability benefits, annual cost of living adjustments and death benefits to plan members, who must be public employees or their beneficiaries. Benefits are based on years of credited service, equal to one year of full time employment. Members with five years of total service are eligible to retire at age 50 (52 for PEPRA Miscellaneous Plan) with statutorily reduced benefits. All members are eligible for non-duty disability benefits after 10 years of service. The death benefit is the following: the Optional Settlement 2W Death Benefit. The cost of living adjustments for each plan are applied as specified by the Public Employees’ Retirement Law.

The Plan operates under the provisions of the California Public Employees’ Retirement Law (“PERL”), the California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (“PEPRA”), and the regulations, procedures and policies adopted by the CalPERS Board of Administration. The Plans’ authority to establish and amend the benefit terms are set by the PERL and PEPRA and may be amended by the California state legislature and in some cases require approval by the CalPERS Board.

The Plans’ provisions and benefits in effect for the year ended June 30, 2024 are summarized as follows:

| Miscellaneous | Miscellaneous | Miscellaneous |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Tier I Rate Plan | Tier II Rate Plan | PEPRA Rate |
| Hire date | (Prior to February 14, 2009) | (On or after February 14, 2009) | (On or after January 1, 2013) |
| Benefit formula (at full retirement) | 3.0% @ 60 | 3.0% @ 60 | 2.0% @ 62 |

Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024  

(9) Defined Benefit Pension Plan (Continued)  

Tier I and Tier II Miscellaneous Plans are closed to new members that are not already CalPERS eligible participants.  

**Contributions**  

Section 20814(c) of the California Public Employees’ Retirement Law (PERL) requires that the employer contribution rates for all public employers are determined on an annual basis by the actuary and shall be effective on the July 1 following notice of a change in the rate. The total plan contributions are determined through CalPERS’ annual actuarial valuation process. The actuarially determined rate is the estimated amount necessary to finance the costs of benefits earned by employees during the year, with an additional amount to finance any unfunded accrued liability. The employer is required to contribute the difference between the actuarially determined rate and the contribution rate of employees. Employer contribution rates may change if plan contracts are amended. Payments made by the employer to satisfy contribution requirements are classified as plan member contributions.  

For the year ended June 30, 2024 the employer contributions for the Plan (all rate plans combined) were $910,347.  

**Pension Liabilities, Pension Expenses and Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions**  

As of June 30, 2024, the District reported a net pension liability of $6,067,829 representing the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability.  

The District’s net pension liability is measured as the proportionate share of the net pension liability. The net pension liability as of June 30, 2024 is measured as of June 30, 2023, and the total pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2022 rolled forward to June 30, 2023 using standard update procedures as required by GASB Statement No. 68.  

The District’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on a projection of the District’s long-term share of contributions to the pension plans relative to the projected contributions of all participating employers, actuarially determined. The District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability for the Plan as of June 30, 2024 was as follows:  

- Proportion - June 30, 2023: 0.11092%  
- Proportion - June 30, 2024: 0.12135%  
- Change - Increase (Decrease): 0.01043%  

For the year ended June 30, 2024, the District recognized pension expense of $4,380,017. At June 30, the District reported deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to all Plans combined from the following sources:

The $910,347 reported as deferred outflows of resources related to contributions subsequent to the measurement date will be recognized as a reduction of the net pension liability in the subsequent fiscal year. Other amounts reported as net deferred inflows of resources related to pensions will be recognized as pension expense (credit) as follows:

| **Total** | **$ 2,828,647** |

### Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liabilities in the June 30, 2024 actuarial valuation for the Plan was determined using the following actuarial assumptions:

| Valuation Date | June 30, 2022 |
|----------------|----------------|
| Measurement Date | June 30, 2023 |
| Actuarial Cost Method | Entry-Age Normal Cost Method |
| Actuarial Assumptions: | |
| Discount Rate | 6.90% |
| Inflation | 2.30% |
| Salary Increases | 2.30% |
| Mortality Rate Table¹ | Derived using CalPERS Membership Data for all Funds |
| Post Retirement Benefit Increase | The lesser of contract COLA or 2.30% until Purchasing Power Protection Allowance floor on purchasing power applies, 2.30% thereafter |

(1) The mortality table used was developed based on CalPERS-specific data. The probabilities of mortality are based on the 2021 CalPERS Experience Study for the period from 2001 to 2019. Pre-retirement and Post-retirement mortality rates include generational mortality improvement using 80% of Scale MP-2020 published by the Society of Actuaries. For more details on this table, please refer to the CalPERS Experience Study and Review of Actuarial Assumptions report from November 2021 that can be found on the CalPERS website.

### (9) Defined Benefit Pension Plan (Continued)

**Discount Rate**  
The discount rate used by CalPERS to measure the total pension liability was 6.90%. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that contributions from plan members will be made at the current member contribution rates and that contributions from employers will be made at statutorily required rates, actuarially determined. Based on those assumptions, the Plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.

**Discount Rate**  
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class.

In determining the long-term expected rate of return, CalPERS took into account both short-term and long-term market return expectations. Using historical returns of all of the funds’ asset classes, expected compound (geometric) returns were calculated over the next 20 years using a building-block approach. The expected rate of return was then adjusted to account for assumed administrative expenses of 10 Basis points. The expected real rates of return by asset class are as follows:

| Investment Type                     | Assumed Asset Allocation | Real Return 1,2 |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Global Equity - Cap-Weighted        | 30.0%                   | 4.54%            |
| Global Equity Non-Cap-Weighted      | 12.0%                   | 3.84%            |
| Private Equity                      | 13.0%                   | 7.28%            |
| Treasury                            | 5.0%                    | 0.27%            |

| High Yield                          | 5.0%                    | 2.27%            |
| Emerging Market Debt                | 5.0%                    | 2.48%            |

**Sensitivity of the Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability (Asset) to Changes in the Discount Rate**

The following presents the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability for the Plans, calculated using the discount rate for the Plans, as well as what the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability (asset) would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage point lower or 1-percentage point higher than the current rate:

| Discount Rate | Net Pension Liability (Asset) |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| 1% Decrease (5.90%) | $12,794,844 |
| Current (6.90%) | $6,067,829 |
| 1% Increase (7.90%) | $530,917 |

**Pension Plan Fiduciary Net Position**

Detailed information about each pension plan’s fiduciary net position is available in the separately issued CalPERS financial reports.

### (10) Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB)

**Description of the Plan**

The District provides health care benefits to eligible retired District employees and survivor dependents as defined by their participating tier (first or second) and coverage level (basic or Medicare supplement) with a choice of several plans through an agent single-employer defined benefit plan established July 28, 2012. This is contracted with the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) through the Public Employees’ Medical and Hospital Care Act (PEMHCA). State statutes assign the authority to establish and amend the benefit provisions of the agent multiple-employer health care plans administered by CalPERS to the respective employer entities.

The District does not issue a separate stand-alone financial report for its OPEB plan.

**Funding Policy**

The District pays a percentage of the post-employment health care benefits for retirees, their spouses, and their dependents based on the retirees’ tier. Surviving spouses and eligible dependents of retirees may elect to continue health care benefits with the same District contribution towards the expense. Substantially all of the District’s employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach normal retirement age while working for the District. No contributions are required for plan members or the District. Pre-funding contributions made by the District are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.

The contribution requirements of the District are established and may be amended by the District’s Board of Directors. Plan members are currently not required to contribute.

### (10) Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) (Continued)

**Employees Covered by Benefit Terms**  
As of the June 30, 2023 actuarial valuation, the following employees were covered by the benefit terms:  
- Active employees: 47  
- Inactive employees or beneficiaries currently receiving benefit payments: 43  
- **Total number of participants:** 90  

**Contributions**  
The Board of Directors grants the authority to establish and amend the contribution requirements of the District. During the year ended June 30, 2024, the District’s cash contributions to the trust were $284,632 and the benefit payments were $539,508, resulting in total payments of $824,140. In the fiscal year 2024, the District recognized $153,922 in implicit rate subsidy.  

**Net OPEB Liability**  
The District's net OPEB liability was measured as of June 30, 2023, and the total OPEB liability used to calculate the net OPEB liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2023.  

**Actuarial Assumptions**  
The total OPEB liability in the June 30, 2023 actuarial valuation was determined using the following actuarial assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement, unless otherwise specified:  
- **Discount rate:** 6.75%  
- **Inflation rate:** 2.50%  
- **Aggregate salary increases:** 2.75% per year  
- **Investment rate of return:** 6.75%  
- **Healthcare cost trend rate:** 4.0% annually  
- **Mortality rates:** Derived using CalPERS membership data  

Mortality information for active and retired employees was based on 2014 CalPERS tables. The pre-retirement turnover information was developed based on the 2009 CalPERS Turnover for Miscellaneous Employees table created by CalPERS.  

The long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of OPEB plan investment expense and inflation) was used and developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighing the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. The target allocation and best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class are summarized in the following table:

### Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total OPEB liability was 6.75%. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that District contributions will continue based upon the current funding policy.

Based on those assumptions, the OPEB plan's fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make projected future benefit payments for current members for all future years. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total OPEB liability.

Gains and losses related to changes in total OPEB liability and fiduciary net position are recognized in OPEB expense systematically over time. Amounts are first recognized in OPEB expense for the year the gain or loss occurs.

The remaining amounts are categorized as deferred outflows and deferred inflows of resources related to OPEB and are to be recognized in future OPEB expense.

The recognition period differs depending on the source of the gain or loss. The net difference between projected and actual earnings on OPEB plan investments is recognized over 5 years. The net difference between expected and actual experience are recognized over the expected average remaining service lifetime (EARSL), which was 6.8 years at the June 30, 2023 valuation date.

### (11) Risk Management

The District participates in the Association of California Water Agencies Joint Powers Insurance Authority (ACWA/JPIA) a public entity risk pool of California water agencies, for general and auto liability, public officials liability, property damage, fidelity insurance and workers compensation liability. ACWA/JPIA provides insurance through the pool up to a certain level, beyond which group-purchased commercial excess insurance is obtained.

The District pays an annual premium to ACWA/JPIA that includes its pro-rata share of excess insurance premiums, charges for the pooled risk, claims adjusting and legal costs, and administrative and other costs to operate the ACWA/JPIA. ACWA/JPIA may be terminated at any time by written consent of three-fourths of voting members at which time the members may be required to pay their share of any additional amount of premium in accordance with loss allocation formulas for final disposition of all claims and losses covered by the joint powers agreement. The ACWA/JPIA’s financial statements are available at 5620 Birdcage Street, Suite 200, Citrus Heights, CA 95610-7632.

| Contribution valuation date | June 30, 2021 | June 30, 2020 | June 30, 2019 | June 30, 2018 | June 30, 2017 |

### Methods and assumptions used to determine contribution rates:
- **Amortized cost method**: Entry age normal
- **Amortized method**: Level percentage of payroll, closed
- **Remaining amortization period**: Varies, not more than 30 years
- **Discount rate**: 6.90%
- **Inflation**: 2.50%
- **Salary increases**: Varies by entry age and service
- **Payroll growth**: 2.75%
- **Retirement age**: The probabilities of Retirement are based on the 2010 CalPERS study for the period from 1997 to 2007.
- **Mortality**: Most recent CalPERS Experience Study.
- **Post Retirement Benefit increase**: Purchasing Power applies, 2.50% thereafter.

The mortality table used was developed based on CalPERS' specific data. The table includes 15 years of mortality improvements using Society of Actuaries Scale 90% of scale MP 2016. For more details on this table, please refer to the December 2017 experience study report (based on CalPERS demographic data from 1997 to 2015) that can be found on the CalPERS website.

### Changes in Assumptions:
At its December 2016 meeting, the CalPERS Board of Administration lowered the discount rate from 7.50 percent to 7.00 percent using a three-year phase-in beginning with the June 30, 2016 valuations. The minimum employer percent to 7.00 percent using a three-year phase-in beginning with the June 30, 2016 valuations. The minimum employer contributions for Fiscal Year 2019-20 determined in this valuation were calculated using a discount rate of 7.25 percent.

On December 19, 2017 the CalPERS Board of Administration adopted new actuarial assumptions based on the recommendations in the December 2017 CalPERS Experience Study and Review of Actuarial Assumptions. This study reviewed the retirement rates, termination rates, mortality rates, rates of salary increases and inflation assumption for Public Agencies. In addition, the Board adopted a new asset portfolio as part of its Asset Liability Management. The new asset mix supports a 7.00 percent discount rate. The reduction of the inflation assumption will be implemented in two steps in conjunction with the decrease in the discount rate. For June 30, 2017 valuation an inflation rate of 2.625 percent will be used and a rate of 2.50 percent in the following valuation.

Note: In 1978 the voters of the State of California passed Proposition 13 which limited property taxes to a total maximum rate of 1% based upon the assessed value of the property being taxed. Each year, the assessed value of property may be increased by an "inflation factor" (limited to a maximum increase of 2%). With few exceptions, property is only reassessed at the time it is sold to a new owner. At that point, the new assessed value is reassessed at the purchase price of the property sold. The assessed valuation data shown above represents the only data currently available with respect to the actual market value of taxable property and is subject to the limitations described above.

**Note:**
- Beginning in Fiscal Year 2015, the population is based on the 2015 Urban Water Management Plan, which includes a new calculation methodology from the Department of Water Resources.
- Beginning in Fiscal Year 2020, the population is based on the 2020 Urban Water Management Plan, which includes a new calculation methodology from the Department of Water Resources. Fiscal Year 2020 has been adjusted to actual numbers based on the plan.
- A Retail Population is included in the Wholesale Population.
- Total Personal Income, Per Capita Personal Income and the Unemployment Rate are not available for the District's specific service area, so it includes totals for both Sacramento and Placer Counties.
- C Per Capita Personal Income calculation was adjusted for all years to use the Wholesale Population. The previous calculation included the Wholesale Population plus Retail Population, which resulted in the double counting of the Retail Population.

*A The Wholesale Capital Facility Fee and 30% of the Retail Capital Facility Fee were calculated using the Buy-In Methodology. This methodology results in a fee, or portion thereof, that is designed to reimburse the District's ratepayers for the current depreciated replacement value of the existing system. The value of the system, upon which the fee was calculated, is disclosed in the Wholesale and Retail Capital Facility Fee Studies, respectively. Both reports are available upon request.*

*The remaining 70% of the retail capital facility fee revenue is designated for projects that have an expansionary component, meaning the project, or a portion thereof, will use the system to accommodate future growth. The portion of the fee collected, but not yet spent is held in reserve. See Schedule 19(b) for a reporting of such assets/projects.*

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Andrew Pierson, Director of Engineering Services  
**Date:** December 18, 2024  
**Subject:** Esri Small Utility Enterprise Agreement (SUEA) Renewal  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to approve executing a three-year Small Utility Enterprise Agreement (SUEA) with Esri, the software firm that provides the licensed software for the District’s Geographic Information System (GIS), in the amount of $30,200 per year for a total authorized agreement amount of $90,600. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Finance Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
During the conceptual and scoping phases of the District’s 2017/18 GIS Improvements Project, the decision was made to choose Esri as the licensed software provider that would power the District’s then new GIS system. Other software options were considered; however, it was concluded that Esri provided the best long-term solution that would be supported well into the future.

When the GIS was ready for implementation at the beginning of 2019, the District executed a three-year SUEA with Esri as the least-cost option to employ the GIS software application. That original SUEA expired in 2022, and the District renewed the agreement at that time. The annual SUEA license cost in 2022 was $25,000 per year and the 2025 annual cost will be $30,200 per year for the three-year term.

In order to continue to be granted access to the Esri term licensed software, the District must renew the three-year Small Utility Enterprise Agreement (SUEA) that was originally executed in January 2019 and then renewed in January 2022. The current SUEA will expire on January 23, 2025, and the renewal would extend the license to use the GIS enterprise software until January of 2028.

---

**BUDGET IMPACT**  
In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 96, this agreement is considered a Subscription Based Technology Arrangement and is accounted for as a financing, not a software expense. Therefore, the budget includes both principal and interest expense for this item, at an imputed interest rate.

Due to the nature of GIS usage, all GIS costs are split 75% Retail, 25% Wholesale. This expense was anticipated in the current year budget and will be included in the next two fiscal year budgets if approved.

**AGENDA ITEM V-2**  

**STAFF REPORT**  

To: Board of Directors  
From: Tony Barela, Director of Operations  
Date: December 18, 2024  
Subject: Power Monitor Project (R/W)  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to authorize the Director of Operations to enter into a construction contract with Lords Electric, Inc. (Lords) for the District’s Power Monitor Project (Project) in the amount of $75,000 with a total authorized budget of $82,500, which includes a 10% contingency.  

**BACKGROUND**  
In the past several years, the District has made improvements to certain pump stations by installing jockey pumps and variable frequency drives (VFD) to better manage pumping efficiencies during low demands in the system. It was observed that these improvements had significant positive effects on power consumption and operational efficiency. These benefits were only recognized months later after the power consumption through billing was trended. Currently, Operations does not have the ability to track, in real time, the effectiveness of improvements, changes in operations, or identify when there is an unexpected power increase/draw due to system failure. In the past, unexpected excess power consumption was not realized for months until noticed through SMUD/PGE invoices.  

The primary focus of this project is to install power monitors at pump stations and facilities at the District’s main campus. This includes Hinkle, Crown Point, Lower Granite Bay Pump Stations, the solar facility, and the main feed to the water treatment plant. These power monitors will be connected to the District’s SCADA system for real time monitoring of power consumption. Integrated power monitors are already installed at Bacon and Upper Granite Bay Pump Stations.  

**CURRENT STATUS**  
On November 6, 2024, the District issued an invitation for bid for the installation of the power monitors. One (1) firm, Lords Electric, Inc., submitted a proposal on November 19, 2024. Staff has reviewed the proposal and it was found to be complete and acceptable. The engineer’s estimate for the project was $65,900.  

| Consultant          | Proposal Total Amount |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Lords Electric, Inc. | $75,000               |

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
The Project is included in the District’s approved Retail CIP budget in FY24/25.

# AGENDA ITEM V-3  
## STAFF REPORT  
**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance and Human Resources  
**Date:** December 18, 2024  
**Subject:** Presentation of Draft Retail Financial Plan and Rate Study  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION  
Receive presentation; direct staff to return with any modifications or prepare Proposition 218 Notice based on the rate schedule selected by the Board after receiving and considering the results of the study.  

### BACKGROUND  
The District completed the Retail Master Plan in FY 2020-21, which identified the capital improvements needed to the distribution system over the next 10 years. This informed the 2021 Financial Plan and rate schedule for 2022-2024 and continues to serve as an important driver for this update to the financial plan and new rate schedule.  

The District's last Retail Financial Plan and Rate Study was completed in March 2022, resulting in a three-year rate schedule ending January 1, 2024. The Board approved effective rate increases under that schedule were as follows:  
- February 2022: 8%  
- January 2023: 8%  
- January 2024: 8%  

The plan anticipated the following rate increase for the subsequent five years:  
- January 2025: 7%  
- January 2026: 6%  
- January 2027: 6%  
- January 2028: 6%

### CURRENT STATUS  
Hildebrand Consulting was selected in February 2024 to update the financial plan and develop recommendations for retail water rates for a five-year period from Calendar year 2025 through 2029. The purpose of the study was to ensure that the District’s water rates are sufficient to fund ongoing operations and maintenance.

**Retail Financial Plan and Rate Study**  
**Donna Silva**

---

Debt service (including meeting rate covenants) and capital improvements while maintaining prudent reserves.

The study builds upon the actual results for FY 2023-24 and generally utilized the FY 2024-25 budget as the base year for analysis. Certain one-time expenses were removed prior to applying inflation assumptions. The following cost inflation assumptions were used in the financial plan:

- **Salaries:** 3% per year  
- **Health Benefits:** 5% per year  
- **Utilities:** 5% per year  
- **Source of Supply:** 5% for two years then 4% thereafter  
- **Operating Expenses:** 3% per year  

The Financial Plan recommends the following rate increases:

| Overall Rate Revenue Increase --> | April 1, 2025 | Jan. 1, 2026 | Jan. 1, 2027 | Jan. 1, 2028 | Jan. 1, 2029 |

*Fire Line Rates are increased by 3% per year based on estimated cost inflation.

The proposed rate increases are lower than expected in the previous financial plan and are primarily driven by inflation assumptions. Increased capital spending from the historical average, and the desire to pay for most capital projects with reserves has a small impact on the rate increases as well.

The rate increases are lower than they otherwise would have been due to the many actions the District has taken over the past five years to control costs and increase cost recovery outside of water rates. Those actions include refinancing of

debt, pay down of the District’s unfunded pension liability, renegotiation of water contracts, water transfers to generate additional revenues, reducing the District’s salary schedule to market median for a three-year period, elimination of funding for unidentified projects from the capital improvement program, etc.

**Alternative Options:**  
The proposed rate increases assume that the District generally wishes to be on a pay-as-you-go basis for capital improvements, but anticipates issuing debt for large projects, specifically the Kokila Reservoir Replacement Project ($10.1 million), new pipeline in Cavitt Stallman from Sierra Ponds to Vogel Valley ($7.5 million), and acquisition of retail groundwater production facility ($5.15 million). The first two projects are expected to use the low-interest rate program through the State of California’s Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund (SRF). Since the retail groundwater production facility has yet to be defined, the study anticipates it will be financed through a costlier bond issuance. If the project ends up being the construction of a well, the project costs will increase above the $5.15 million assumed in the plan, but there will likely be grant opportunities and the District would be able to utilize the low-interest rate loan program through the SRF.

The consultant examined the following alternatives:

1. **Rate increases and no new debt:** this approach is not recommended as revenues would not be sufficient to keep up with inflation of operating costs and important capital projects would have to be eliminated.

2. **No debt issuance – all pay as you go:** while this option results in the lowest costs over time, due to the large upcoming projects it would require 12% rate increases for the next 4 years, at which time a 15% rate decrease could be implemented, followed by 2 years of no rate increases then resuming to inflationary 3% annual rate increases.

**Next Steps:**  
After receiving direction from the Board on the desired rate strategy, staff, in consultation with the rate consultant and legal counsel, will finalize the Retail Financial Plan and Rate Study Report and prepare and send the required Proposition 218 notice of public hearing. The rates published in the notice set the maximum amount of a potential rate increase. After the hearing, the Board could choose to approve rates lower than those noticed, but not higher. The notice must be sent at least 45 days prior to the public hearing. The public hearing on the proposed rates will be held in late winter or early spring.

# Reserve Policies

The following are established District reserve policies. In addition to protecting the District against unforeseen circumstances, these policies also contribute towards the District’s credit rating.

**"Minimum Reserve"**  
Operating Reserve: 20% of O&M budget ($2.8 million)

**"Target Reserve"**  
Capital Reserve:  
- Consistent with 2021 Recommendation: Propose a reserve level equal to 100% of average annual capital spending in order to support PayGo capital funding ($10.0M)

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** December 18, 2024  
**Subject:** Board Policy on the Prevention of Discrimination, Harassment, Violence in the Workplace and Abusive Behavior  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a Board motion to approve BOD-2.5 Policy on Prevention of Discrimination, Harassment, Violence in the Workplace and Abusive Conduct. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Legal Affairs Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.

**BACKGROUND**  
San Juan currently has policies against discrimination, harassment, violence in the workplace and abusive behavior (the latter called “bullying”), but these policies reside in the Personnel Manual. Portions of that Manual are approved by the Board of Directors, such as the Chapter on Wages and Benefits and the Chapter on Employer-Employee Relations. Other Chapters are approved by the General Manager. The policies against discrimination, harassment, violence in the workplace and abusive behavior are in Chapter 1, which is approved by the General Manager.

The Board has adopted Policy BOD-2.3 Ethics Policy, which mainly addresses issues of fairness and honesty, such as political contributions, protection of confidential information, protection of whistleblowers and similar topics. There are brief sections on fair and equal treatment and on interactions with staff (Sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.9). However, those sections do not provide the necessary level of detail to adequately address the topics covered by this proposed policy. With the adoption of this proposed draft policy, those sections would be deleted from the Ethics Policy.

The adoption of this proposed policy would clearly articulate the District’s requirements concerning the prevention of discrimination, harassment, violence in the workplace and abusive behavior; the parties to which this policy applies; and the consequences of violation of these policies.

# Board Policy Manual

**Section**: BOD-2 Board of Directors  
**Policy**: BOD-2.5 Policy on Prevention of Discrimination, Harassment, Violence in the Workplace and Abusive Conduct  
**Approval Date**: 11/20/24  
**Latest Revision**:  

## BOD-2.5 Discrimination, Harassment, Violence and Abusive Conduct Prevention Policy

The purpose of this policy is to confirm the District’s commitment to provide a professional work environment free of unlawful discrimination, harassment, violence and abusive conduct, including conduct based on a protected characteristic, and an environment free from retaliation for participating in any protected activity covered by this policy. This policy applies to all persons involved in the functions of the District, including directors, supervisors, managers, employees, contractors, consultants, vendors, and other third parties.

### 2.5.1 Policy
Discrimination, harassment, violence and/or abusive conduct in the workplace or in the course and scope of employment by any person in any form that is in violation of this policy is prohibited.

**Discrimination** is defined as the unequal treatment in any aspect of employment, based solely or in part on a protected characteristic, including an employee or applicant’s perceived protected characteristic. Protected categories include: race, color, religion, religious creed, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, physical or mental disability, medical condition, protected medical leaves, genetic information, marital status, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions), gender, gender identity, gender expression, age (40 years and over), sexual orientation, veteran and/or military status, domestic violence victim status, political affiliation, and any other characteristic protected by state or federal anti-discrimination law covering employment. Discrimination includes unequal treatment based upon an association with a member of these protected classes.

Discrimination may include but is not necessarily limited to: hostile or demeaning behavior directed due to a protected characteristic; allowing the protected characteristic to be a factor in hiring, transferring, promoting, terminating, separating, compensating or other employment-related or working condition decisions unless otherwise permitted by applicable law, and providing unwarranted assistance or withholding work-related assistance, cooperation, and/or information to applicants or employees because of their protected characteristic.

**Harassment** is defined as unwelcome disrespectful or unprofessional conduct, including disrespectful or unprofessional conduct based on any of the protected characteristics listed above. Harassment can be verbal (such as slurs, jokes, insults, epithets, gestures, or teasing), visual (such as the posting or distribution of offensive posters, symbols, cartoons, drawings, computer displays, or emails), or physical conduct (such as physically threatening another person, blocking someone’s way, or making physical contact in an unwelcome manner).

![Sexual Harassment Policy](https://example.com/image.png)

Sexual harassment is discrimination based on sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation. It can include all of the actions described above as harassment, as well as other unwelcome sex-based conduct, such as unwelcome or unsolicited requests for sexual favors, conversations regarding sexual activities, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.

Sexual harassment is generally categorized into two types:

- **“Quid pro quo” (“this for that”)**: Occurs when an individual in a position of authority over another (for example, a manager or supervisor) directly or indirectly demands sexual favors from a subordinate in exchange for some benefit such as a promotion or pay increase, or to avoid an adverse employment action such as demotion or termination.

- **“Hostile Work Environment”**: Occurs when unwelcome conduct or comments based on sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation by any person in the workplace unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance and/or creates an intimidating, hostile, threatening or offensive working environment.

Sexual harassment can occur regardless of if the harasser and the victim are of different sexes or the same sex. Individuals of any gender can be the target of sexual harassment. Unlawful conduct does not need to be motivated by sexual desire, but can occur as a result of hostile acts toward an individual because of the individual’s gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation.

Examples of sexual harassment include but are not limited to: unwelcome sexual advances, flirtation, teasing, sexually suggestive or obscene pictures, letters, invitations, emails, voicemails, or gifts; sex, gender or sexual orientation-related comments, slurs, jokes, remarks or epithets; leering, obscene or vulgar gestures; displaying or distributing sexually suggestive or derogatory objects, pictures, cartoons, or posters; impeding or blocking movement, touching or assaulting others; reprisals or threats after a negative response to sexual advances; and conduct or comments consistently targeted at one gender, even if the content is not sexual.

**Violence in the Workplace**, including acts or threats of physical violence, which also include intimidation, harassment, and/or coercion which involve or affect the District, which occur on District property, or occur during the performance of District business will not be tolerated.

Threats of violence include conduct against persons or property that is severe, offensive or intimidating or create a hostile, abusive, or intimidating work environment for one or more District employee. Such behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Threats of violence occurring on District property, regardless of the relationship of the individuals involved in the threat.

- Threats or acts of violence not occurring on District property but involving someone who is representing the District.

Page 2  
BOD-2.5 Discrimination, Harassment, Violence and Abusive Conduct Prevention Policy
<!-- Page 167 -->
- Threats or acts of violence not occurring on District property involving a District employee if the threats or acts of violence affect the interests of District.
  
- Any threats or acts resulting in the conviction of an employee or agent of District, or of an individual performing services on District’s behalf on a contract or temporary basis, under any criminal code relating to threats or acts of violence that adversely affect the legitimate interests and goals of the District.

Specific examples of behavior that may be considered a threat or act of violence include, but are not limited to:

- Hitting or shoving an individual.

- Threatening to harm an individual or their family, friends, associates, or their property.

- The intentional destruction or threat of destruction of property owned, operated or controlled by the District.

<!-- Page 168 -->
The District encourages all employees to immediately report any incidents of discrimination, harassment, violence and/or abusive conduct so that complaints can be addressed timely. The District will promptly and thoroughly investigate any complaint of discrimination, harassment, violence or abusive conduct of any type and will take whatever corrective and preventative action is deemed necessary, including disciplining or terminating any individual who is found to have violated this policy. All complaints and investigations will be designated as confidential to the extent possible and permitted by law.

**Policy** BOD-2.3 Ethics Policy  
**Approval Date** 10/23/03  
**Latest Revision** 09/28/22  

# BOD-2.3 Ethics Policy

The policy of the District is to maintain the highest standards of ethics from its Board members and its employees. The proper operation of the District requires decisions and policy to be made in the proper channels of governmental structure, that public office not be used for personal gain, and that all individuals associated with the District remain impartial and responsible towards the public. Accordingly, it is the policy of the District that Board members and District employees will maintain the highest standard of personal honesty and fairness in carrying out their duties. This policy sets forth the minimal ethical standards to be followed by the Board of Directors. The ethics policy for District employees is set forth in the District’s Personnel Manual.

## 2.3.1 Responsibility of Holding Public Office

Board members are obligated to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California. Board members will comply with applicable laws regulating their conduct, including conflict of interest and financial disclosure laws. Board members will work in cooperation, to the best interest of the District, with other public officials unless prohibited from so doing by law or officially-recognized confidentiality of their work.

## 2.3.2 Fair and Equal Treatment

Board members will not, in the performance of their official functions, discriminate against any person on the basis of race, religion, color, creed, age, marital status, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual preference, medical condition or disability. A Board member will not grant any special consideration, treatment or advantage to any person or group beyond that which is available to every other person or group in similar circumstances.

## 2.3.3 Proper Use and Safeguarding of District Property and Resources

Except as specifically authorized, a Board member will not use or permit the use of District-owned vehicles, equipment, telephones, materials or property for personal convenience or profit. A Board member will not ask or require a District employee to perform services for the personal convenience or profit of a Board member or employee. Each Board member must protect and properly use any District asset within his or her control, including information recorded on paper or in electronic form. The Board has adopted policies requiring that written records, including expense accounts, be kept in sufficient detail to reflect accurately and completely all transactions and expenditures made on the District's behalf, in accordance with the District’s policy for reimbursement of expenses of Board members.

![BOD-2.3 Ethics Policy](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=BOD-2.3+Ethics+Policy)

## 2.3.43 Use of Confidential Information
A Director is not authorized, without approval of the Board of Directors, to disclose information that qualifies as confidential information under applicable provisions of law to a person not authorized to receive it, that (1) has been received for, or during, a closed session meeting of the Board, or (2) is protected from disclosure under the attorney/client or other evidentiary privilege.

This section does not prohibit any of the following: (1) making a confidential inquiry or complaint to a district attorney or grand jury concerning a perceived violation of law, including disclosing facts to a district attorney or grand jury that are necessary to establish the alleged illegality of an action taken by the District, (2) expressing an opinion concerning the propriety or legality of actions taken by the District in closed session, including disclosure of the nature and extent of the allegedly illegal action, or (3) disclosing information acquired by being present in a closed session that is not confidential information. Prior to disclosing confidential information pursuant to (1) or (2), above, however, a Board member will first bring the matter to the attention of either the President of the Board or the full Board, to provide the Board an opportunity to cure an alleged violation.

A Director who willfully and knowingly discloses for pecuniary gain confidential information received by him or her in the course of his or her official duties may be guilty of a misdemeanor under Government Code section 1098.

## 2.3.54 Soliciting Political Contributions
Board members are prohibited from soliciting political funds or contributions at District facilities. A Board member will not accept, solicit or direct a political contribution from any person or entity who has a financial interest in a contract or other matter while that contract or other matter is existing or pending before the District. A Director will not use the District’s seal, trademark, stationary or other indicia of the District’s identity, or facsimile thereof, in any solicitation for political contributions contrary to state or federal law.

## 2.3.65 Revolving Door
For a period of one year after leaving office, Directors will not represent for compensation nongovernmental entities before the District with regard to any issues over which the Board of Directors of which that person was a member had decision-making authority during the three years prior to leaving office.

For purposes of this section, “represent” will mean for compensation to actively support or oppose a particular decision in a proceeding by lobbying in person the officers or employees of the District or otherwise acting to influence the officers of the District.

These restrictions will not apply to representation of not-for-profit charitable entities before the District.

These restrictions may be waived in specific cases by a two-thirds vote of the District’s Board of Directors.

Nothing in this section is intended or will be applied to prevent a former Director from participating in meetings of the Board in the same manner as other members of the public.

## 2.3.76 Improper Activities and the Protection of “Whistle Blowers”

The General Manager has primary responsibility for (1) ensuring compliance with the District’s Personnel Manual, and ensuring that District employees do not engage in improper activities, (2) investigating allegations of improper activities, and (3) taking appropriate corrective and disciplinary actions. The General Manager is obligated to operate the District according to law and the policies approved by the Board. Board members are encouraged to disclose to the General Manager to the extent not expressly prohibited by law, improper activities within their knowledge. Board members will not interfere with the General Manager’s responsibilities in identifying, investigating and correcting improper activities, unless the Board determines that the General Manager is not properly carrying out these responsibilities. Nothing in this section affects the responsibility of the Board to oversee the performance of the General Manager.

A Board member will not directly or indirectly use or attempt to use the authority or influence of his or her position for the purpose of intimidating, threatening, coercing, commanding or influencing any other person for the purpose of preventing such person from acting in good faith to report or otherwise bring to the attention of the General Manager or the Board any information that, if true, would constitute a work-related violation by a Board member or District employee of any law or regulation, gross waste of District funds, gross abuse of authority, a specified and substantial danger to public health or safety due to an act or omission of a District official or employee, use of a District office or position or District resources for personal gain, or a conflict of interest of a District Board member or District employee.

A Board member will not use or threaten to use any official authority or influence to effect any action as a reprisal against a Board member or District employee who reports or otherwise brings to the attention of the General Manager any information regarding the subjects described in this section.

Any person who believes that he or she has been subjected to any action prohibited by this section may file a confidential complaint with (1) the General Manager, or (2) a member of the Board of Directors if the complaint involves the conduct of the General Manager, who will thereupon refer the matter to the full Board to investigate the complaint. Upon the conclusion of the investigation, the General Manager (or the Board in the case of a complaint against the General Manager) will take appropriate action consistent with the District’s Personnel Manual and applicable law.

A perceived violation of this policy by a Board member should be referred to the President of the Board or the full Board of Directors for investigation, and consideration of any appropriate action warranted. A violation of this policy may be addressed by the use of such remedies as are available by law to the District, including but not limited to: (a) adoption of a resolution expressing disapproval of the conduct of the Board member who has violated this policy, (b) injunctive relief, or (c) referral of the violation to the District Attorney and/or the grand jury.

## 2.3.87 Values

Respect for each Board member’s interpersonal style will be a standard of operation. Courtesy and respect for individual points of view will be practiced at all times. All Board members shall respect each other’s right to disagree. All Board members shall practice a high degree of decorum and courtesy. When addressing the public in any way, all Board members shall make certain their opinions are expressed solely as their own, and do not in any way necessarily reflect the opinions of any other Board member or the District.

# AGENDA ITEM VI-3

## STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** December 18, 2024  
**Subject:** SJWD ADM-3.6 Records Management Policy Revisions (W & R)

---

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Staff requests a Board motion to adopt Resolution 24-08 revising Board Policy Adm-3.6 Records Management Policy. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Legal Affairs Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.

### BACKGROUND
The SJWD Records Management Policy was created to establish and describe the Records Management Policy (Policy) of the San Juan Water District (District). The Policy establishes the guidelines and procedures, under which District staff will retain, organize, purge, and destroy District records maintained by all departments. In addition, this Policy contains the District's Records Retention Schedule (Schedule) and provides references to the applicable state and federal statutes that regulate public records retention. The Policy was last updated on August 19, 2020.

### CURRENT STATUS
Review of the Policy and Schedule began in October of 2023, to bring the documents into compliance with the latest regulatory and statutory requirements. Both the Policy and the Schedule were significantly revised, as a result of the extensive analysis and deliberation that every Department in the District devoted to this project. This work has included ensuring that all District records are covered by the Schedule and that the appropriate retention period per specific sections of the Government Code or other applicable law was defined in the Schedule. Legal Counsel has reviewed the Policy revisions and the Schedule.

Since the revision to the Schedule was quite extensive, a clean version of the Schedule will be attached separately from the red-line version of the Policy and, once approved by the Board, will be incorporated into the Policy.

### Attachments:
- Resolution 24-08 - Record Management Policy  
- ADM-3.6 Records Management Policy (red-line)  
- Records Retention Schedule (clean)

![Page 5 of ADM-3.6 Records Management Policy](https://example.com/image-link)  
determine if the District has disclosable records, then Government Code section 7922.535 (b)(c) should be referenced.  

Pursuant to Government Code section 7922.530 (a), except with respect to public records exempt from disclosure by express provisions of law, the District will provide the requestor with exact copies of all requested public records unless impracticable to do so.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** December 18, 2024  
**Subject:** Overview of Deferred Compensation Options for Employee Retirement Savings  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Receive and provide direction to staff.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
At the October 16, 2024, Board meeting, Director Zamorano asked staff to investigate and report back to the Board on the District’s ability to offer a deferred compensation plan to its employees. The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the different kinds of deferred compensation plans which are available for use by the District. Additionally, this report highlights the potential benefits of offering an employer matching contribution to employees' deferred compensation plans.

---

**ANALYSIS**  
A deferred compensation plan is a voluntary retirement savings plan that allows an employee to defer any amount, subject to annual limits, from their paycheck, usually pre-tax. The funds are invested within the account and earn interest and dividends, which are also tax free until withdrawal. An employer may or may not choose to provide a matching contribution to encourage employees to utilize this retirement savings tool. Deferred Compensation plans are available under various sections of the Internal Revenue Code as follows:

1. **401(k) Plan**  
   - **Eligibility:** Primarily for private-sector employees. NOT AVAILABLE TO GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.  
   - **Contribution Limits:** Up to $23,000 for standard 401(k) plans in 2024, with lower limits for SIMPLE 401(k) plans.  
   - **Key Features:** Contributions grow tax-deferred until withdrawn. Withdrawals before age 59½ may incur a 10% penalty.  
   - **Catch-Up Contributions:** Available for participants over age 50.  

2. **403(b) Plan**  
   - **Eligibility:** Suited for employees in public schools, non-profits, and other public-sector roles.  
   - **Contribution Limits:** Up to $23,000 in 2024.  
   - **Key Features:** Similar to 401(k) plans, but tailored for non-profit and public-sector employees. Money cannot be withdrawn penalty free until retirement age of 59½.  
<!-- Page 225 -->
- Catch-Up Contributions: Includes additional options for employees with 15+ years of service.

3. 457(b) Plan
   - Eligibility: Designed for government employees.
   - Contribution Limits: Up to $23,000 in 2024.
   - Key Features: Contributions and earnings are tax-deferred until withdrawn. No penalties for early withdrawal upon separation from employment.
   - Catch-Up Contributions: Allows employees nearing retirement age to increase contributions if they did not maximize contributions in prior years.

The District currently offers a 457 plan to its employees through CalPERS. This is separate and distinct from the CalPERS Pension system. The CalPERS 457 Plan provides a convenient, low-cost way for employees of public agencies to save for retirement with several investment options and financial support resources. Key benefits include:

- Investment Options: Core investment options designed for public employees, including Target Retirement Date Funds and a self-directed brokerage option.
- Contributor Flexibility: Allows for both pre-tax and Roth after-tax contributions.
- Additional Support: CalPERS offers financial education and workshops to support employee financial literacy.
- Low Fees: Total fund expenses ranging from 0.21% to 0.34%.
- Roth 457 Option: Allows employees to make after-tax contributions with tax-free qualified withdrawals.

30 of the District’s 49 employees are currently utilizing the 457 Deferred Compensation plan, contributing an average of just under 9% of their wages. Of those participating, just over half are considered PEPRA employees, meaning their pension benefit is lower than those of the “classic” employees. Figure 1 provides additional employee participation information:

|---------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------|
| Classic T1          | $57,800.00                  | 6                                                            | 3                                                              | 9              | 67%        |
| Classic T2          | $107,382.00                 | 8                                                            | 5                                                              | 13             | 62%        |
| PEPRA               | $179,532.71                 | 16                                                           | 11                                                             | 27             | 59%        |
| Grand Total         | $344,714.71                 | 30                                                           | 19                                                             | 49             | 61%        |

Interestingly, the employee group with the highest pension benefit (Classic Tier 1) is utilizing the deferred contribution retirement savings plan the most, and the employee group with the lowest pension benefit is using it the least, in terms of participation percent, not raw number of employees participation.

## Benefits of Employer Matching Contribution
In addition to employee contributions, the 457 plan allows the employer to contribute on behalf of employees. Some employers will offer a match, up to a set percentage of pay to incentivize employee participation. For example, the District could offer a matching contribution of up to 3% of an employee compensation. If the employee does not participate in the program, the District contributes nothing. If the employee contributes 2% of their compensation to the plan, the District would match that by contributing an equal amount. If the employee contributed 5%, the District would contribute the maximum matching contribution of 3%.

The District could choose any amount to contribute, either as a match or not. The IRS annual contribution limits apply to the sum total of both employee and employer contributions. The plan itself allows for the District to offer a contribution to certain employees only, such as PEPRA employees. The law is less clear. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act prohibits an employer from providing a benefit to employees under the age of 40 that is not provided to employees over the age of 40. There is an exception for benefits that are based “on a reasonable factor other than age”. This exception would seem to apply in this instance there are many government entities that utilize this exemption to provide increased contributions to their PEPRA employees, but there is some risk involved.

The brief analysis below outlines the potential cost to the District if the Board decides to implement an employer match for current staff and assumes that all employees would choose to participate if the match is introduced.

An employer matching contribution is calculated for four different percentages ranging from two to six percent. Employer contributions are calculated as percentage of the employee salary limited to rules and regulations set forth from the IRS. Figure 2 below shows the maximum employer match contributions for all employees at different percentages of contributions.
<!-- Page 227 -->
![Employer Deferred Compensation Contribution (full employee participation)](attachment_url)

**Figure 2 - Employer Deferred Compensation Cost – Full Employee Participation**

The maximum annual employer total cost for full employee participation at a 2% match is $121,514, at 3% is $182,272, 4% is $243,029 and at 6% is $363,230. These costs are subject to increases as employees' salary increase due to annual COLA and employee performance reviews.

Implementing an employer matching contribution would enhance retirement readiness and bolster the District’s appeal as an employer of choice.

# We are CalPERS
CalPERS is the largest public pension fund in the U.S., with assets of approximately $400 billion. The retirement system administers retirement benefits for more than 2 million current and retired California State, public school, and local public agency employees and their families on behalf of nearly 3,000 public employers in the state. CalPERS also administers health benefits for 1.5 million enrollees and offers additional programs, including a deferred compensation retirement savings plan, member education services, and an employer trust for post-retirement benefits.

## Your CalPERS 457 Plan
All employees whose employers have adopted the CalPERS 457 Plan (the “Plan”) are eligible to join the Plan and there are currently no minimum service requirements to fulfill. The Plan is a voluntary savings program that allows you to defer any amount, subject to annual limits, from your paycheck on pre-tax and/or Roth after-tax basis (if your employer can process Roth contributions from their payroll). In addition, your contributions and their earnings, if any, can benefit from the power of tax-deferred compounding. What this means is that you don’t pay income taxes on your pre-tax investments or earnings until you start to take withdrawals, usually in retirement, and federal tax-free withdrawals of your Roth after-tax contributions and any earnings when you retire (qualifying factors apply).

### Designed with your interests in mind
- Promotes smart investing principles
- Easy payroll deduction of contributions
- Pre-tax contributions and earnings can benefit from the power of tax-deferral

The Target Retirement Date Funds have been designated as the default investment under the Plan. **IF YOU DO NOT MAKE AN AFFIRMATIVE INVESTMENT ELECTION PRIOR TO THE DATE THE FIRST CONTRIBUTION IS DEPOSITED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT, YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE INVESTED IN THE APPROPRIATE TARGET RETIREMENT DATE FUND, BASED ON YOUR DATE OF BIRTH AND ASSUMING YOU WILL RETIRE AT AGE 59.** Prior to investing you should carefully review all fund information and objectives and consider consulting with an outside investment adviser. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.

### Tips to planning.
Unexpected challenges will likely cross your path at some point or another over your career. By creating an action plan, you may have an easier time staying on track to meet your retirement goals. Here are a few things to consider as you get started:

- **Maintain an emergency fund.**  
  The Plan was not designed to be a short-term savings vehicle or to replace your household emergency fund. Therefore, it is important that you have another source of savings that you can access easily for emergencies.  
  *Most experts suggest having three to six months of your living expenses set aside in cash.*

- **Be consistent.**  
  Consistency is important to help you achieve your retirement goals.  
  *The contribution amount you select is made every pay period via payroll deduction, making the Plan a consistent and convenient way to save.*

- **Make small changes where you can.**  
  Keep a spending journal for a few weeks to help you track where your money is going and to identify saving opportunities, such as:  
  * Bring your lunch to work.  
  * Brew your own coffee.  
  * Drink tap water instead of buying bottled water.  
  * Stream a movie and pop your own popcorn on Saturday night.

- **Keep it together!**  
  If you have an eligible IRA or retirement plan from a previous employer, you may want to consider moving those funds into the CalPERS 457 Plan. Just complete a Rollover Contribution form to start the transfer process. Assets rolled over from another plan may be subject to additional restrictions.

![Step Two: How much can you save?](https://calpers457.com)

**STEP ONE: How much will you need?**

Today, many financial experts agree that you will need 70% or more of your current income to maintain your current lifestyle in retirement. Your long-term strategy not only has to work up to the day you retire, it will most likely need to continue generating growth and income throughout your retirement.

So, if you have 30 years before you retire, and you live another 30 years after you retire, you’re looking at creating and maintaining a 60-year investment strategy!

Chances are you’re going to need to rely on personal savings, over and above your Social Security and defined benefit pension benefits, when it comes to meeting your retirement income goals. Participating in the CalPERS 457 Plan is another way to save for your retirement goals.

---

**STEP TWO: How much can you save?**

Deciding how much to save is a personal decision. Check out the [My Retirement Overview®](https://voya.com/tool/how-much-do-i-need-to-retire) calculator at voya.com/tool/how-much-do-i-need-to-retire. It can help you determine how much you can really afford to save from each paycheck.

Don’t put off until tomorrow what you can do today. You might think you can’t afford to put much aside, but making small changes now could make a big difference over the long term. By investing early, your money has more time to work for you.

### Pay yourself first with Plan contributions.
This chart demonstrates the potential added value of contributing more money over time.

| Monthly contributions | Value after 30 years |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| $0                     | $0                   |
| $50 k                 | $36,000              |
| $100 k                | $97,570              |
| $150 k                | $126,841             |
| $200 k                | $156,112             |

- **Carol:** $100 per month ($50 per pay period) → $97,570
- **Charlie:** $130 per month ($65 per pay period) → $126,841
- **Connie:** $160 per month ($80 per pay period) → $156,112

This hypothetical example assumes bimonthly employee contributions and a 6% average annual return. Any fees, expenses or charges that may be associated with the Plan are not considered in this illustration. Plans having these charges would reflect lower net returns. Hypothetical assumptions are not guaranteed. Systematic investing does not ensure a profit nor guarantee against a loss in declining markets. You should consider your financial ability to consistently invest in up as well as down markets.

### Incentives to help you save.

**IRS Saver's Credit**  
To encourage low- and moderate-income individuals to save, the federal government offers a tax credit for contributions to eligible retirement plans. You may be eligible for a credit on your federal taxes based on your adjusted gross income. If you take this tax credit you can still deduct your contributions to qualified retirement savings plans as allowed under current law. For more information or to see if you qualify, contact your tax professional.

**Catch-Up Provisions**  
- **Age 50 Catch-Up** — allows a participant who is at least 50 before the end of the tax year to make additional contributions of $7,500, for a maximum of $30,500.
- **Special 3-Year Catch-Up** — allows a participant who meets special conditions and has not been contributing the maximum in previous tax years to contribute up to twice the maximum annual contribution amount during the three years prior to their Normal Retirement Age. The current annual limit is $46,000 or the amount of Catch-Up credit available to you, whichever is less.

IRS regulations state the Age 50 Catch-Up Provision cannot be used in the same calendar year as the Special 3-Year Catch-Up Provision.

### 2024 Maximum Annual Contribution Limits
- 100% of income, up to $23,000
- Age 50 Catch-Up: $7,500
- Special 3-Year Catch-Up: $46,000

Annual IRS contribution limits are subject to change.

### The Bottom Line.
**Start planning for your retirement early!**
- **Just starting out in your career?** You might think you can’t afford to put anything aside. By investing early, though, your investment has the opportunity to grow tax-deferred over a longer period. In the future you may want to consider increasing your contributions as your salary increases.
- **Nearing retirement?** When starting later in life it’s important to consider your investment and tax-shelter strategies carefully. Consider consulting with an investment and tax advisor prior to making investment decisions.

# STEP THREE:  
**What’s your investment strategy?**

When it comes to investing, people have different levels of risk tolerance and experience. There are some that have limited knowledge in actively developing an investment portfolio and there are those who prefer to select their own mix of investments.

Offering a simple approach to investing, the Plan’s investment lineup is organized into choices designed to match your level of interest in investing.

## Your choice, simplified.

| Your Choice      | Your Involvement                                                                 | The Investment Approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

**Target Date Funds vs. Index Funds**  

**What are target date funds?**  
Target date funds are diversified funds that are designed for investors who don’t have the time, desire, or expertise to choose an appropriate asset mix for their situation and actively manage it. Over time, the investment mix of a target date fund gradually shifts from a greater concentration of higher-risk investments to a greater concentration of lower-risk investments.  

Target date funds are designed for investors who intend to retire during or near the target date year that is included in the name or description of the fund. However, you should not choose a target date fund solely based on your age or intended retirement date. You should also consider factors such as your risk tolerance, personal circumstances, and complete financial situation. While target date funds are intended to offer a simpler way to diversify your portfolio, you should continue to monitor your investments and make adjustments as needed.  

**What are index funds?**  
Index funds are designed to produce results that mirror the performance of the index they track by buying and holding the stocks or bonds included in the index. That’s why these funds are often described as passively managed. If you want to invest in a certain asset class, such as the stocks or bonds of large U.S. companies, an index fund gives you a convenient way to invest without having to choose individual stocks or bonds.  

**What is an index?**  
A fund’s performance is usually compared with its market benchmark or index. An index is a grouping of stocks or bonds selected to represent a particular market. The best-known index is the Dow Jones Industrial Average that follows 30 of the largest U.S. companies. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index widens the range to include 500 of the largest U.S. companies for a broader reading of the market. An index is not managed and cannot be invested in directly.  

---

**Investing 102**  
**The Asset Classes**  
There are three basic asset classes and each has specific risks and returns to consider. There are also asset allocation investments, like the target date funds, that generally contain a mix of any of the three asset classes.  

| Asset Class      | Benefit                                               | Risk                                               |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Asset Allocation** | Professionals make the diversification, asset allocation and rebalancing decisions | Shifting to a conservative mix over time helps manage risk, but does not guarantee earnings growth |
| **Cash Equivalents** | Designed to protect original investment or principal | May not keep pace with inflation over time        |
| **Bond**         | Generally offer greater income potential than short-term investments and not as much risk as stocks | Lower growth potential                             |
| **Stocks**       | Historically, stocks have provided greater long-term returns than other asset classes | Due to market volatility the value of stocks can go up and down over short periods of time |

---

**Investing 103**  
**Investment risk vs. inflation risk**  
Investment risk is generally associated with the potential that investments may go down in value as a result of market volatility, though other risks exist. Stocks are generally considered riskier investments because they tend to fluctuate in value more than conservative investments like bonds. Conservative investments may help reduce investment risk, but over the long term they can expose you to another kind of risk — inflation risk. When investments are earning less than the rate of inflation, they are actually losing value.  

**The importance of asset allocation & diversification**  
Combining different types of investments through asset allocation and diversification may help you manage risk and maximize your return potential by smoothing out market fluctuations, while still taking advantage of the market’s potential for higher returns.  

Asset allocation involves assigning specific percentages of your investments to different asset classes according to your financial goals, risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversification is a risk management technique that mixes a variety of investments within a portfolio. It involves distributing your money among different securities, sectors, industries and strategies within a number of asset classes. Diversification through asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against loss.

**Target Retirement Date Funds — A diversified portfolio in a single fund.**

### CalPERS Target Date Funds
The Target Retirement Date Funds offer diversified portfolios for participants who don’t have the time, desire or expertise to choose an appropriate asset mix for their situation and actively manage it over time.

#### Funds that evolve over time.
Over time, the investment mix of each fund gradually shifts from a greater concentration of higher-risk investments (such as stock funds) to a greater concentration of lower-risk investments (such as bond funds). Each fund will reach its most conservative asset allocation seven years after the target date year. The shift, known as a “glide path,” focuses on asset accumulation to help achieve participants’ retirement objectives. This disciplined and systematic approach is designed to reduce volatility through diversification, especially as each fund approaches its target date and the years after retirement. However, there is no guarantee that a fund will achieve its strategic objective. The CalPERS Board of Administration reserves the right to change the target asset allocations, asset classes, underlying portfolios, and benchmarks at any time.

### Picking your target date fund.
Each fund is designed for an investor who intends to retire during or near the target date year that is included in the name of the fund. However, you should not choose a fund solely based on your age or intended retirement date. You should also consider factors such as your risk tolerance, personal circumstances, and complete financial situation. For example, even if you intend to retire in 2030, you may decide that the 2025, 2035 or other fund is more appropriate for you.

| If your birthdate is... | Your CalPERS Target Retirement Date Fund may be... |

| On or after 2004        | CalPERS Target Retirement 2065 Fund                |

| On or between 1994 and 1998 | CalPERS Target Retirement 2055 Fund            |
| On or between 1989 and 1993 | CalPERS Target Retirement 2050 Fund            |
| On or between 1984 and 1988 | CalPERS Target Retirement 2045 Fund            |
| On or between 1979 and 1983 | CalPERS Target Retirement 2040 Fund            |
| On or between 1974 and 1978 | CalPERS Target Retirement 2035 Fund            |
| On or between 1969 and 1973 | CalPERS Target Retirement 2030 Fund            |
| On or between 1964 and 1968 | CalPERS Target Retirement 2025 Fund            |
| On or between 1959 and 1963 | CalPERS Target Retirement 2020 Fund            |
| On or before 1958       | CalPERS Target Retirement Income Fund              |

*Based on assumption that retirement age is 59. The “target date” is the approximate date when a participant plans to retire (assuming a retirement age of 59). There is no guarantee that any investment option will achieve its stated objective. Principal value fluctuates and you may lose money, including losses near and following retirement, and there is no guarantee that the investment will provide adequate retirement income. Asset allocation, diversification and rebalancing do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.*

While target date funds are intended to offer a simpler way to diversify your portfolio, you should continue to monitor your Plan investments and make adjustments as needed.

**Core Funds**  
*A carefully selected list of passively managed investment options.*

If you like to pick, actively manage and design your asset allocation, you can choose from a carefully selected list of core investment fund options. CalPERS has selected a set of six index funds in different asset classes (stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents) so you can diversify your portfolio based on your personal situation.

| Index Fund                                   | Asset Class          |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| State Street Short Term Investment Fund      | Cash Equivalent       |
| State Street Real Asset Fund                 | Inflation Protection  |
| State Street U.S. Short-Term Government/    | Bond                 |
| Credit Bond Index Fund                       |                      |
| State Street U.S. Bond Index Fund           | Bond                 |
| State Street Russell All Cap Index Fund      | U.S. Stocks          |
| State Street Global All Cap Equity           | Global Stocks        |
| ex U.S. Index Fund                           |                      |

**A reminder about asset allocation.**  
Asset allocation helps to reduce investment risk by spreading your money among different investments, or across the main asset classes. Combining different types of investments, i.e. stocks, bonds and cash equivalents, may help you manage risk and maximize your return potential by smoothing out market fluctuations, while still taking advantage of the market’s potential for higher returns. However, diversification through asset allocation does not specifically ensure a profit or protect against loss.

**Be aware of inflation risk.**  
When you’re ready to retire, you’ll most likely be living in a much more expensive world than today. Conservative investments (like bonds) may help reduce volatility risk, but over the long term they can expose you to inflation risk. When investments are earning less than the rate of inflation, they are actually losing value.

**Building your investment portfolio.**  
It is important for you to determine how long you plan to keep your money invested, and your willingness to stay invested during market ups and downs, and build a portfolio appropriate for that strategy.

When developing your investment strategy, you need to consider:
- How much to save and invest today.
- Your investment time horizon.
- Your risk tolerance.

Once you determine the answers to these questions you can create an investment mix that will help you work toward your objective.

![Features of the CalPERS 457 Plan](https://calpers457.com)

**Tax Liability on Pre-Tax Distributions**  
Pre-tax distributions are treated as ordinary income in the year the money is paid and are subject to federal and state income taxes. 20% is withheld for federal tax purposes, as well as 2% for state taxes for California residents, at the time of payment on all distributions. A rollover to another eligible retirement plan or a traditional IRA is not subject to tax withholding.

**Purchasing Service Credit**  
You may choose to use your investments in the Plan to purchase Pension Service Credit, if eligible.

**In-service Withdrawals**  
Generally, you cannot withdraw money from your account while you are still employed by your employer with the exception of:  
- **Unforeseeable Emergency Withdrawals**  
  You may make an emergency withdrawal under qualifying circumstances prior to separating from service.  
- **Loan Privilege (if available)**  
  You may borrow from your account balance to assist you in meeting your financial needs only if your employer has adopted the loan provision of the Plan. Additional fees apply.

**Roth Plan Option***  
If your employer can process Roth contributions from their payroll, you can make contributions of money that has already been taxed. This helps you build a nest egg of federal tax-free income in retirement. Your qualified withdrawals of contributions and any earnings then come out federal tax-free, which means you could potentially end up with more in net distributions in retirement.

**Guidelines & Forms**

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** December 18, 2024  
**Subject:** Combination with Sacramento Suburban Water District  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Consider a motion to suspend further discussions with Sacramento Suburban Water District on combination of the two Districts.  

**BACKGROUND**  

**Initial Discussions**  
Combination discussions between the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) and San Juan Water District (SJWD) have been occurring since 2011. The two districts have historically worked together on multiple fronts. With the construction of the Cooperative Transmission Pipeline in 1996, and with its extension to SSWD’s Antelope Transmission Pipeline, the water transmission systems of both districts were connected. Since these transmission pipelines were built, SJWD has treated SSWD’s surface water entitlement from PCWA and its own water supplies and delivered them to SSWD as part of its successful conjunctive use program. The Antelope Pump Back facility was constructed and connected to the ATP to allow SSWD’s groundwater supplies to be pumped into SJWD whenever necessary.  

**Phase 1 Study**  
In 2013, the SJWD and SSWD Boards both voted unanimously to conduct the Phase 1 Study, which was a high-level assessment of the options of remaining separate (status quo), collaborating via additional contractual mechanisms and full merger of the two organizations. That report, completed in May 2014, identified the following benefits of proceeding with combination of the two Districts:  

- Economies of scale for district representation on regional, state and federal matters within the Lower American River region;  
- Flexibility to use Pre-1914 water and maximize the use of CVP supplies for SSWD, SJWD and the Wholesale Agencies resulting in increased water supply reliability;  
- Establish a historical record of using CVP supplies; and,  
- Avoid event-driven inter-agency negotiations for exchanges or transfers of water supplies during dry-year reductions or critically dry-year events.

![Staff Report – Combination with SSWD](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Staff+Report+%E2%80%93+Combination+with+SSWD)

**Staff Report – Combination with SSWD**  
December 18, 2024  

The SJWD Board voted unanimously to approve the Phase 1 report and proceed with the Phase 2A study, which would assess in more detail the potential configuration of a merged organization. The SSWD Board approved the actions by a 4-1 vote.

**Phase 2A Study**  

The Phase 2A study was completed in June of 2015, and it described in more detail the benefits of integrating the water supply systems of the two Districts, including expanding conjunctive use activities, utilizing more of SJWD’s excess surface water supplies and ensuring greater supply reliability in critical drought years. The report provided much more detail about the following benefits of combination:

- Greater ability for succession planning, career mobility, job training and promotion opportunities with combined staff.
- Better ability to respond to emergencies and workload variations with combined staff.
- Ability to combine resources to focus efforts on planning and prevention rather than reaction and response.
- Larger district would provide opportunity to gravitate to the newest and best performing information and computer-based systems as existing systems require replacement.
- Ability to reduce the impact of future rules and regulations and rules on rates with a greater base over which to spread future costs.
- Future rate increases might be reduced through economies of scale.
- Both districts have excellent credit ratings; combining the two districts might provide for even higher credit ratings resulting in savings should future debt issues be required.
- Potential ability to restructure debt for lower cost to customers.
- Potentially reduced cost due to improved purchasing power combination of districts would result in one legal counsel contract, one auditing firm with one annual audit, more efficient use of outside consultants, etc.
- Increase ability of executive staff to focus on external affairs through realignment of staff.
- Improved Regional, Statewide, and Federal advocacy and involvement.

In June 2015, the SJWD Board unanimously approved the Phase 2A report. However, the SSWD Board chose to discontinue the merger discussions.

**Actions from 2018-2021**  

In 2018, the SJWD Board unanimously directed their General Manager to communicate with SSWD, to inquire about restarting discussions concerning combination efforts. The two organizations set up a 2x2 Ad Hoc Committee, which met during 2018 and 2019. During 2019, SJWD and SSWD agreed to expand the discussion of potential combination to other interested agencies, and conducted a “collaboration/integration”

project with five other neighboring water agencies, to evaluate different alternatives that ranged from status quo operations to merger among the agencies. That project was completed in 2021.

**Reinitiated Combination Deliberations**  

In 2024, the SSWD Board directed their General Manager to send a letter to SJWD inquiring about their interest in conducting further discussions about potential combination of SSWD and SJWD. On May 25, 2024, the SJWD Board unanimously agreed to conduct joint meetings with the SSWD Board and provided three dates for the first meeting.

The two Boards met on June 25, 2024, and both unanimously directed their General Managers to prepare a Request for Proposals for a Business Case Analysis, which would be the Phase 2B analysis that was identified in 2015 as the next phase of the combination process. The RFP was completed and provided to the Boards for their consideration at a joint meeting on July 31, 2024. The Boards both approved the RFP unanimously, and it was distributed to five firms on August 17, 2024.

The RFP contained three tasks for two scenarios: a description of the existing characteristics, operations and assets of the two organizations; an analysis of the pros and cons of continuing to operate as independent organizations compared to combining into one organization; and the timelines and deliverables for the project. Two firms bid on the project, and after the General Managers conducted interviews on September 30, 2024, they recommended to the two Boards at the October 3, 2024 joint meeting that BakerTilly be the consultant to do the analysis. The SJWD Board approved BakerTilly by a vote of 3-2, and the SSWD Board unanimously approved BakerTilly at their October 21, 2024 meeting.

**Comments and Responses**  

The following comments have been made concerning the combination project and responses are provided.

**Comment:** A merger of SSWD and SJWD would result in layoffs of SJWD staff.  
**Response:** No layoffs were identified as necessary in the Phase 1 or Phase 2A reports. Both organizations used consultant support to conduct functions that existing staff do not have the time or resources to do, and most operations of the two Districts would not change with a merger (e.g., the treatment plant would continue to operate as it currently does). When Arden Arcade and Northridge Water Districts were merged to create SSWD in 2002 (which has been an example of a very successful merger), not only were there no layoffs, but staffing has increased significantly in the intervening years.

**Comment:** SSWD would “take over” SJWD and would dominate it politically.  
**Response:** The combined populations of the SSWD and SJWD service areas would be 330,000, of which 45% are in the current SJWD wholesale area and the rest in the SSWD retail area. Board members of either a County Water District or a Community Services District are mandated to represent all of the constituents of the complete
<!-- Page 243 -->
![Staff Report – Combination with SSWD](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Staff+Report+%E2%80%93+Combination+with+SSWD+p.+4+December+18%2C+2024)

District, and not just those who reside in their electoral division. SJWD has had periods during which Board members were concentrated in a specific area (four of the five Board members were from Granite Bay during the years of 2018-2022), yet they faithfully represented the interests of all SJWD constituents.

**Comment:** There is no need for a business case analysis because it has already been completed.

**Response:** In 2015, the two Boards reviewed the Phase 2A report, and stated that it was the precursor to the Phase 2B report (the business case analysis) and the Phase 3 report (the LAFCO municipal services review). SSWD and SJWD received many comments from various stakeholders, and in response, noted that many of the questions and comments that were raised concerning the Phase 2A report would be addressed in the Phase 2B business case analysis.

**Comment:** SJWD would be dissolved in a merger and would lose its water rights.

**Response:** The merger approach proposed in both the Phase 1 and Phase 2A studies was for SSWD to dissolve and SJWD to annex the SSWD service territory. Neither organization in any merger loses its assets – they become the property of the merged organization. In the proposed merger approach, nothing about San Juan’s water rights would change.

**Comment:** A merger would not require LAFCO approval (their decision would be ministerial) and constituents would have no vote.

**Response:** LAFCO approval of any merger would be required, and the decision is not ministerial. The LAFCO decisionmaking process includes a Municipal Services Review and a public hearing and vote on the proposal. Constituents would be notified of the potential approval by LAFCO, and LAFCO would have to conduct an election if 25% of the voters submitted protests.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Greg Zlotnick, Water Resources Manager  
**Date:** December 18, 2024  
**Subject:** Potential San Juan Retail Groundwater Well – Part 2  

---

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Continue to pursue partnerships with neighboring agencies (including Wholesale Customer Agencies) to expand groundwater banking/transfer activities and to improve dry year reliability. Only if such partnerships do not bear fruit should San Juan consider development of its own groundwater facilities.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
At the conclusion of its discussion regarding this issue at its October 16th meeting, the Board asked staff to return with additional information regarding the cost of beginning the process to develop a groundwater well, which would include identifying potential properties on which to site a well, and the availability of grant funding to support that process.

---

**DISCUSSION**  

**Property Identification**  
Staff thanks the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) for sharing relevant documentation and processes it developed for its own property identification and well siting needs to inform this discussion. SSWD retained West Yost (WY) consultants to undertake the property identification component of seeking to site a groundwater well through a GIS tool WY had developed. District staff met with WY to receive a briefing on their tool. WY’s GIS-based methodology provides for transparently, repeatably, objectively, and efficiently identifying potentially qualified sites for future groundwater wells. Once identified, additional site-specific investigation would be recommended for selected parcels.

To apply its GIS tool within only the Sacramento County portion of San Juan’s wholesale service area, WY very roughly estimated it would recommend a budget of $75,000 to $100,000, noting that additional refinement could alter those numbers. The higher end of the cost range would provide for application of the GIS-based well siting tool, a Well Siting Technical Memorandum (TM) detailing the
<!-- Page 245 -->
![STAFF REPORT Potential San Juan Retail Groundwater Well – Part 2 Greg Zlotnick](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT+Potential+San+Juan+Retail+Groundwater+Well+%E2%80%93+Part+2+Greg+Zlotnick)

work completed and documenting a recommended list of potential well site locations, as well as a board presentation on the study and outcome.

The criteria used to limit or expand the analysis would affect the budget. Moreover, WY assumed it would not need to undertake hydrogeological analyses since it has or would access existing data and analyses within the region. However, there is no guarantee that that assumption would hold true and further such analyses could still be necessary, which would result in an increased budget.

The following is a list comprising a “Property Acquisition Roadmap” used by SSWD, showing tasks that would take place after identifying potential parcels (Phase A in the list, fulfilled for example, through application of the WY GIS tool), and a chart describing additional external resources that would need to be contracted for as part of a well siting process:

- **Phase A – Identify Parcels**
- **Phase B – Determine Availability of Parcels**
- **Phase C – Perform Due Diligence**
- **Phase D – Negotiate Purchase Agreement**
- **Phase E – Proceed Through Escrow**
- **Phase F – Close Property Acquisition**
- **Phase G – Test Well**

Prior to Phase D, the General Manager would screen the potential properties that cleared the process favorably and bring a recommendation to the Board.

Rincon Consultants, another firm staff contacted that was willing to provide a rough, non-binding estimate for a Well Siting Report, indicated the cost could be $50,000 or more, while acknowledging that “Investigations of large areas with

**Potential San Juan Retail Groundwater Well – Part 2**  
Greg Zlotnick  

“multiple legal parcels, complicated regulatory environments, and/or significant hydrogeologic data gaps increase the effort required.”  

There would be additional costs to carry out necessary environmental site assessments. Based upon conversations with various consulting firms, a guesstimate for that work ranges widely from $50,000 to $100,000 or so.  

In addition to drilling pilot boreholes in recommended potential locations, ultimately drilling a test well (Phase G above) would be necessary, entailing additional costs beyond the property identification/acquisition process, environmental assessment, and pilot boreholes. As noted in the Staff Report last meeting, a test well is estimated to cost around $300,000. Consequently, the investment necessary to get to the point at which the design and construction of a well could begin is estimated to range in cost from approximately $400,000 to $500,000.  

**Funding Opportunities**  

The Ferguson Group (TFG), San Juan’s federal advocacy firm, is well versed in identifying and pursuing federal grants and appropriations (commonly referred to as “earmarks”) for agency projects.  

In fact, TFG recently worked to secure a $1.25M earmark for the District’s Kokila Reservoir project. In addition, the District facilitated TFG’s engagement with Orange Vale Water Company (OVWC) to secure earmarks totaling $2.075M in support of OVWC’s current well rehabilitation project.  

TFG provided the District with a comprehensive memo (attached) regarding the potential sources of federal grant funds and programs which could be targeted for appropriations through the earmark process to support San Juan’s development of a groundwater well project, including whether such financing is available for planning and/or construction.  

TFG confirmed, as reported in the Staff Report provided last month on this subject, there are no state grant programs available to pursue at this time for well projects and state programs generally will not support only planning efforts.  

TFG concluded the following regarding federal planning grant opportunities:  

“While many grant funding programs are available for the funding of full ground water well projects, very few opportunities exist for the sole purpose of planning. Most programs that allow for planning activities to be included in the project scope also require those activities to be accompanied with construction or implementation activities.”

With respect to pursuing an earmark for funding support, TFG advises:

“…given the political and competitive nature of earmarking, TFG recommends SJWD explore this method of funding when the project is further developed and is ready to move into implementation and/or construction.”

The only federal program TFG identified that could provide a grant in support of planning for a groundwater well is the Department of Interior’s “WaterSMART: Planning and Project Design Grants program”, which is administered by the Bureau of Reclamation.

TFG’s memo calls out several important “things SJWD should consider” relative to this particular program:

- The minimum award amount under this program is $100,000. The maximum award is $400,000.

- It is expected that applicants will have already performed some general planning work and preliminary studies that led to the identification of a specific location for project design. [Emphases added.]

- Project design projects should result in a final design package at approximately a 60% design level with the anticipation that the package will lead to applying for construction funding.

- Acceptance of planning funds under this program will not require SJWD to move in to construction on the project.

The next round of applications for this program will not be open until next summer. It then takes approximately 6 months for the selection of recipients, and an additional 4 or 5 months for the awards to be made. As a result of this timeline, funding from this program, were it to be made available to the District, would not be received until the spring of 2026.

As described in the TFG memo, there are a few other grant programs that the District could pursue in support of developing a well, but those funding sources are focused on support of actual project construction. Should the District ultimately decide to pursue development of a groundwater well, staff will work with TFG to seek funding support from those sources.

# STAFF REPORT
**Potential San Juan Retail Groundwater Well – Part 2**  
Greg Zlotnick

## Conclusion

Based on the foregoing, and the information provided in the Staff Report last month, staff’s recommendation remains the same with regard to whether the District should consider pursuing the development of its own groundwater well: (1) direct staff to continue to pursue potential partnerships with neighboring agencies (including Wholesale Customer Agencies) who already operate groundwater facilities, and only if such partnerships do not bear fruit should San Juan Retail consider development of its own groundwater facilities; and (2) defer any further consideration of the District developing its own groundwater well until a decision is made regarding the potential combination with SSWD.

**TO:** San Juan Water District  
**DATE:** November 4, 2024  

# Funding Opportunities for Groundwater Well Development Activities

## Overview

The San Juan Water District (SJWD) is interested in pursuing funding for the development of a groundwater well, specifically for costs associated with planning, initial property search, assessment, and land acquisition. While many grant funding programs are available for the funding of full groundwater well projects, very few opportunities exist for the sole purpose of planning. Most programs that allow for planning activities to be included in the project scope also require those activities to be accompanied with construction or implementation activities. Funding opportunities included in this memo are grouped by those ideal for planning only and those ideal for planning and/or construction.

In addition to competitive grant funding, SJWD could also consider pursuing congressionally directed spending (earmarks) in the FY 2026 appropriations cycle for a groundwater well project through programs and accounts administered by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. However, given the political and competitive nature of earmarking, TFG recommends SJWD explore this method of funding when the project is further developed and is ready to move into implementation and/or construction. Information on potential earmark funding accounts is included at the end of this memo.

## Program Summary Information

TFG has provided a summary for each of the programs identified as a potential funding opportunity. Each summary includes a brief synopsis of the program, eligibility requirements, funding amounts, award ranges, match commitment requirements, and most recent solicitation dates, or periods of time for which the program is open and accepting applications. Additional information can be found in the linked TFG Profile and Summary for the program as well as in the Things to Consider box.

Program information is based on the most recent solicitation available. Generally, grant programs change little from year-to-year, making previous solicitations reliable and accurate in predicting future solicitations. TFG has noted where any large-scale changes to programs are anticipated. Previous solicitation dates indicate when the program was last run and act as a good indicator of when a program might be re-run as the majority are released on an annual basis. TFG has checked that all existing programs included in this memo are

flexibility and reliability to help entities prepare for and address the impacts of drought and water supply shortages. Projects that may be funded under this program are divided into four task areas: Task A: Increasing the reliability of water supplies through infrastructure improvements; Task B: Increasing the reliability of water supplies through groundwater; Task C: Improving water management through decision support tools, modeling, and measurement; and Task D: Construction of domestic water supply projects of which the primary purpose is to provide domestic water supplies to Tribal or disadvantaged communities that do not have reliable access to water supplies. Applicants must also demonstrate that the proposed project is supported by an existing drought planning effort.

**ELIGIBILITY:** Eligible applicants are states, tribes, irrigation districts, water districts, and other state, regional, or local authorities with water or power delivery authority located in the Western United States, as well as nonprofit conservation organizations working in partnership with the entities listed above.

**FUNDING:** In FY 2025, an unspecified amount of funding is available to support an estimated 20-40 awards through this program. Awards are provided through separate funding groups:
- For Categories A through C:
  - Group I: Up to $750,000 will be available for projects generally completed within two years
  - Group II: Up to $3,000,000 will be available for projects completed within three years and funded on an annual basis, contingent upon future appropriations. Category A entities are limited to a total of $3,000,000. Category B applicants may be considered for multiple awards up to a total of $15,000,000, if the Category A partners are different for each project selected
- For Category D:

**EPA – Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) Program**

The purpose of the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program is to accelerate investment in the nation's water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure by providing long-term, low-cost, supplemental credit assistance under customized terms to creditworthy water infrastructure projects of national and regional significance. This program is implementing the following five key priorities of the funding agency including: increasing investment in economically stressed communities, making rapid progress on lead service line replacement, addressing perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and emerging contaminants, strengthening climate resilience in the water sector, and supporting one water innovation and resilience.

**ELIGIBILITY:** Eligible applicants are corporations, partnerships, joint ventures and trusts; state, local, and tribal governments; and state infrastructure financing authorities.

**FUNDING:** In FY 2024, approximately $6.5 billion is available to help finance an unspecified number of direct loans or loan guarantees. Projects must have eligible costs that are reasonably anticipated to be equal to or exceed $20 million, or for small communities (serving not more than 25,000 individuals), project costs that are reasonably anticipated to equal or exceed $5 million.

**MATCH AND COST SHARING:** In general, applicants must provide 51% of the project costs. The maximum amount of WIFIA credit assistance to a project is 49 percent of eligible project costs in almost all instances. The funding agency may offer small community prospective borrowers credit assistance up to 80 percent of the eligible project costs.

**NOTIFICATION:** September 10, 2024. Letters of intent accepted on a rolling basis.

**THINGS SJWD SHOULD CONSIDER:**
- Funding is administered through a long-term, low interest loan and funds 49% of the total project cost.
- The minimum project size is $20 million for large communities.
- The application process occurs in two steps. First, a Letter of Intent is submitted to EPA. Upon review, EPA will invite recommended entities to submit a full application for funding.

**DOI - Small Surface Water and Groundwater Storage Projects**

The purpose of this program is to enhance water storage opportunities for future generations. Award funding will support stakeholder efforts in the western United States to stretch scarce water supplies and avoid conflicts over water. Projects must include planning, design, and construction of small surface water and groundwater storage facilities. Projects are expected to enhance and make more reliable municipal and irrigation water supplies, provide opportunities to enhance groundwater management abilities, and provide water quality improvements and ecosystem benefits. Projects will provide western communities with new sources of water and increase water management flexibility, making water supplies more reliable and increasing resilience to climate change. A project must have a completed small storage feasibility study submitted to Reclamation for review prior to application submission.

**Congressionally Directed Spending (Earmarks)**

In addition to the competitive funding opportunities presented above, opportunities exist in the congressionally directed spending and the federal appropriations process to potentially fund construction of a ground water well.

**Corps of Engineers – Section 219 Environmental Infrastructure Program**

Section 219 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-580) authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to assist non-federal interests in carrying out water-related environmental infrastructure and resource protection and development projects. Such assistance may be in the form of technical, planning, and/or design assistance for water supply and storage, treatment and distribution systems; and wastewater treatment systems including treatment plants. Projects must specifically be authorized by Congress to be eligible for funds under this program. To be eligible to compete for assistance, a project must be within a state, county, city, or region specifically authorized by Congress to be eligible for funds under this program. A 25% non-federal match is required under this account.
<!-- Page 255 -->
![Funding Opportunities for Groundwater Well Development](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Funding+Opportunities+for+Groundwater+Well+Development)

NOTE: SJWD is an eligible participant on the Sacramento Area, CA Section 219 authorization and has already partners with the Corps on projects within the SJWD service area under the program.

### EPA – State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG)

The EPA STAG account funds local wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. This includes construction of and modifications to municipal sewage treatment plants and drinking water treatment plants. Dams and reservoirs are not eligible under this account. Projects must be publicly owned or owned by a nonprofit entity and eligible for the funding under the state’s Clean Water or Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRF) loan programs. Privately-owned projects are not eligible for infrastructure grants, even if they are otherwise eligible for assistance under a SRF program. A 20% match is required for any portion of a project funded through a STAG infrastructure grant.

NOTE: SJWD is an eligible participant on the Sacramento Area, CA Section 219 authorization and has already partners with the Corps on projects within the SJWD service area under the program.

### Next Steps

To best match a specific project with a program, TFG recommends consultation with funding agency staff, and congressional staff for congressionally directed spending, before the solicitation period opens. Funding agency staff are generally more willing to speak with prospective applicants and give tips and advice when the solicitation is not open. TFG is available to work with SJWD to meet with potential funding agencies, if desired, and to vet program eligibility as SJWD continues to explore groundwater well development.

**Conclusion:**
Water deliveries for the year continue to be strong as compared to the budget. Deliveries through November were 23.4% greater than anticipated. As shown in the chart above, the main drivers of the positive variance are greater than anticipated deliveries to the Sacramento Suburban Water District and the Fair Oaks Water District.

The positive variance in deliveries results in revenues being 15.4% greater than expected for this time of year.

### 1. Presentation of Independent Audit Results by DavisFarr, Certified Public Accountants - Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2024 (W & R)
Ms. Silva introduced Jennifer Farr from DavisFarr, Certified Public Accountants, and explained that they conducted the independent audit of the District’s financials for fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Ms. Farr informed the Committee that they started the audit procedures in June 2024 and moved onto the final audit in October 2024 after the District’s financial books were closed.

Ms. Farr reported that completed their work and issued an unmodified audit opinion on the financial statements on December 5, 2024. She explained that an unmodified audit opinion means that the financial statements are fairly stated in all material respect so that’s the highest level of audit opinion that can be received.

Ms. Farr explained that their audit approach was to look at internal controls for purposes of planning the audit, but no opinion is expressed on internal controls, and they evaluated the key control areas and performed certain tests of the controls. For the financial statement numbers, they substantively tested the assets and liabilities to determine that they are materially correct. She explained that, for revenue and expenses, they use an analytical approach which means if an expense is significantly higher than the prior year then they would conduct additional testing to verify the accuracy of the expense.

Ms. Farr stated that the areas of focus for the audit included the SRF loan transactions for the Hinkle Reservoir and Eureka Pipeline projects since they are a higher risk of error due to the significance of the transactions. She informed the Committee that there will be a required single audit on the federal grant awards since the grant amounts exceeded $750,000, which she expects to be completed by March 31, 2025.

Ms. Farr informed the Committee that the unpredictability test this year was on purchasing compliance. She explained that they looked at the five larger vendor payments to verify purchasing policy compliance. She reported that due to the nature of inventory purchases typically not exceeding the $50,000 threshold, District staff did not identify that one transaction required Board approval. District staff identified this issue prior to the auditors’ testing and took action to obtain retroactive Board approval prior to the start of the audit. She informed the committee that there were no material weaknesses in internal controls.

Ms. Farr informed the Committee that they found the books to be in excellent condition and District staff were prepared for the audit and responsive to their inquiries. There were no audit adjustments that were material in order to correct any accounting errors and no material instances of noncompliance. She commended staff for their high level of competency. She informed the Committee that they are completing the State Controller’s report as well.

In response to Director Tobin’s question, Ms. Farr explained that Fair Value Hierarchy means that you need to let the reader know how good your estimates are for fair value estimates. She reported that the District only has the fair value of investments that qualify under this standard.

In response to Director Zamorano’s question, Ms. Silva explained that the uncorrected misstatement detected during the audit process happened because there was interest earned in June, that wasn’t paid until July. The District did not record $46,000 of interest income and interest receivable as of June 30, rather it was recorded when received in July. Ms. Farr stated that the amount was immaterial to the financial statements taken as a whole.

The Committee commended the Finance Staff and the auditing firm for their good work.

**2. Review General Manager Reimbursements (W & R)**  
The Committee reviewed the October credit card charges for the General Manager and found them to be in order and there was no reimbursement request from the General Manager.

**3. Review Check Register from November 2024 (W & R)**  
The Committee reviewed the November 2024 check register and found it to be in order.

**4. Review of Legal Bills (W & R)**  
The Committee reviewed the legal bills and found them to be in order.

**5. Esri Small Utility Enterprise Agreement (SUEA) Renewal (W & R)**  
Mr. Pierson reviewed the staff report which was provided to the Committee members. He explained that using the GIS system with Esri has been a tremendous benefit to the District and is a great product. GM Helliker commented that Esri is the primary software used for GIS in the industry.

The Finance Committee recommends that the Board consider a motion to approve executing a three-year Small Utility Enterprise Agreement (SUEA) with Esri, the software firm that provides the licensed software for the District’s Geographic Information System (GIS).

**6. Other Finance Matters (W & R)**  
There were no other matters discussed.

**7. Public Comment**  
There were no public comments.

The meeting was adjourned at 4:32 p.m.
