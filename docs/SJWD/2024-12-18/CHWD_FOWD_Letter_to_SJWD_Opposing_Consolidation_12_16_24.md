**CITRUS HEIGHTS WATER DISTRICT**

**RESOLUTION NO. 12-2024**

**RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CITRUS HEIGHTS WATER DISTRICT**

**OPPOSING THE PROPOSED MERGER OF THE SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT AND SACRAMENTO SUBURBAN WATER DISTRICT**

WHEREAS, in 1954 the ratepayers of the Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD) and Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) helped form the San Juan Water District (SJWD) and purchase the water rights and existing water facilities of the North Fork Ditch Company for the benefit of the SJWD service area; and

WHEREAS, the entire CHWD and FOWD service areas are within the boundaries of the SJWD service area; and

WHEREAS, the CHWD and FOWD represent a majority of SJWD wholesale customers; and

WHEREAS, the combination of the surface water rights obtained from the purchase of North Fork Ditch Company assets and groundwater assets within the SJWD service area are sufficient to meet the ultimate water demands of the existing SJWD service area; and

WHEREAS, the CHWD and FOWD see access and protection of access to SJWD “Water Right Water” (WRW) as a top priority for its ratepayers; and

WHEREAS, multiple studies and reports completed analyzing the merger of the SJWD and Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) have not demonstrated significant benefit to the FOWD and CHWD.

NOW, THEREFORE, the Board of Directors of the Citrus Heights Water District hereby finds, determines, declares, and resolves as follows:

1. A merger between SJWD and SSWD will result in a loss of governance/local control of the wholesale agency, including its water supply and other assets, by communities within the existing SJWD due to SSWD’s service area population being larger than the existing SJWD service area population.

2. Existing water supply agreements between SJWD Wholesale Customer Service Agencies (WCAs) may be insufficient to protect WRW in perpetuity for the WCAs in the event of a merger between SJWD and SSWD.

3. The significant components of a potential merger of the SJWD and SSWD are known, and additional analysis is not necessary; and
<!-- Page 4 -->
4. It will benefit all SJWD customers to immediately stop spending SJWD resources on additional analysis of a merger with SSWD and other merger-related activities; and

5. The potential benefits of a merger between the SJWD and SSWD are not worth the long-term impacts of sharing existing WRW with SSWD; and

6. The potential benefits of a merger between the SJWD and SSWD for all SJWD customers can be obtained through collaborative operations and agreements among WCAs; and

7. The CHWD Board of Directors and FOWD Board of Directors, representing a majority of SJWD wholesale customers, agree with and support the content of this resolution.

I certify that the foregoing Resolution was adopted by the Board of Directors of the Citrus Heights Water District at a special meeting held on the 29th day of November 2024, by the following vote:

AYES: Directors: Riehle, Wheaton, Sheehan
