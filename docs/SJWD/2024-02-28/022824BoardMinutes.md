1. **Lime Silo and Thickener Improvements Project – WSC Amendment #2**  
   Mr. Barela reviewed the staff report which was included in the Board packet. He explained that this amendment covers engineering services during construction for the first project, which includes the fabrication and installation of custom pivoting ladders for access into the District’s thickener tanks and replacement of appurtenances on the District’s lime silo, and the second project, which includes the recoating of the lime silo.  
   Director Tobin moved to approve the Director of Operations to sign a construction contract with Clyde G. Steagall, Inc. (Steagall) for the Lime Silo and Thickener Improvements Project. Director Rich seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

2. **District Cyber Security Program (W & R)**  
   Mr. Chris von Collenberg conducted a brief presentation regarding the District’s Cyber Security Program. He explained that, since he has been at the District for the past 17 years, the District’s systems have been under attack by outside forces on a daily basis, and the system has never been breached. In addition, he informed the Board that the District’s cyber security remains the same and is based on security best practices. He explained that the District utilizes layered security, and he would be notified at any time of the day or night if there was ever a breach.  
   GM Helliker informed the Board that staff are in the process of enhancing the District’s physical security, and explained that once the new Administrative Building is built, then public access will be confined to that building only.

3. **2023 Rebate to CHWD and FOWD (W)**  
   GM Helliker reviewed the staff report which was included in the Board packet. He explained that the allocation methodology used for the Board approved 2023 wholesale fixed charges was different than what had been used in the past. It used 4 years of water use instead of the past 5 years. Vice President Costa inquired if the different methodology used was due to adding and dropping a year for calculating the rates on the rolling average. GM Helliker confirmed and further explained that the 2023 process for wholesale rate setting was the last time the rolling average will be used. GM Helliker explained that there is no Board policy on setting the wholesale rates. In addition, GM Helliker reminded the Board that they adopted the wholesale.

rates in December 2023, and they are structured on a five-year rate schedule based on the previous 10-year fixed average.

Ms. Suzanne Jones addressed the Board and voiced concern that there is no Board policy for setting rates and that there should be a policy. GM Helliker explained that the previous rate setting process that was conducted in 2017 allocated the fixed charges based on the previous 5 years of water use. In 2019, at the request of the wholesale customer agencies, the Board approved a revised rate schedule for Calendar year 2020 wherein the fixed charges were re-allocated using the most recent 5-years of respective water deliveries. In each subsequent year, staff presented a revised rate schedule updating the allocation for recent water use. He further explained that the Wholesale Financial Plan that the Board adopted constitutes the Board policy on rate setting. Ms. Silva explained that, from 2017-2019, the District had consistency with the previous financial plans and rate schedules, then at the request of the customers, the District changed the formula to the rolling average. She informed the Board that this resulted in volatility and was more susceptible to errors when changing the rate annually; therefore, the District reverted back to the fixed average approach for the most recently adopted Wholesale Financial Plan and Rate Schedule.

Director Tobin moved to approve a rebate of $77,108.97 to Citrus Heights Water District and a rebate of $751.19 to Fair Oaks Water District. Director Rich seconded the motion and it with 4 Aye votes and 1 No vote (Costa).

5. Director Compensation (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed a staff report which was included in the Board packet. He informed the Board that this topic was brought up at the last Board meeting and he discussed the topic with President Zamorano. He explained that the last time the Board compensation was adjusted was in 2005 and Water Code 20202 allows a 5% annual increase since the last adjustment which could potentially bring the compensation up to $315.87 per meeting should the Board approve that amount.

The Board discussed the topic and there were suggestions to increase the compensation at the same rate as the employee COLAs, to leave it as is, or to increase the amount of compensation and reduce the number of meetings to 5 per month.

President Zamorano moved to increase the compensation to $250 per meeting with a limit of 5 meetings per month. There was no second, the motion failed.

Legal Counsel Jones informed the Board that any action taken tonight would be to give staff direction for returning to the Board with an ordinance amendment if that is the direction that the Board takes.

In response to Director Miller’s question, the Board Secretary informed the Board that the Board as a whole averaged 5.6 meetings per month for the last couple of

Page 5

years; however, she indicated that Director Tobin averaged 10 per month during that time since Director Tobin was on the ACWA board and the rest of the Board was considerably less per month.

Director Rich moved to give staff direction for the amendment to show an increase in the stipend to $200 per meeting with a limit of 5 meetings per month. Vice President Costa seconded the motion.

Ms. Jones addressed the Board and commented that she received $300 per month, regardless of the number of meetings that she attended, along with mileage and the cost to send a director to a conference is not compensation to the director. Director Miller commented that directors do not receive mileage to attend meetings at the District any longer since the government does not allow that, and the Board policy for out of state travel was implemented for the ACWA DC2024 conference and the Board voted not to allow the travel to attend that conference.

President Zamorano made a substitute motion to give staff direction for the amendment to show an increase in the stipend to $200 per meeting with a limit of 5 meetings per month with a requirement that a director must request, in writing to the General Manager, that they receive the increase. Director Rich seconded the motion.

Legal Counsel Jones stated that a motion was not needed, just Board consensus on what to bring back to the next meeting.

In response to Board discussion, Legal Counsel Jones informed the Board that he will confirm that a director can elect to not receive a stipend or to receive a reduced amount. In response to Ms. Silva’s question, President Zamorano stated that the number of meetings should stay at five per month regardless of the amount received per meeting.

Legal Counsel Jones informed the Board that at the next Board meeting, the Board will review the draft ordinance amendment with the provisions that the motion has stated in it.

V. OLD BUSINESS

1. 2024 Committee Assignments (W & R)  
GM Helliker announced that the 2024 committee assignment list was included in the Board packet, and the only change was for an agreed upon swap with Director Tobin becoming Chair of the Finance Committee and Vice President Costa joining the Public Information Committee.

<!-- Page 6 -->
2. Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker informed the Board that analysis of the wholesale and retail systems identified these needs: groundwater production for backup supplies during critically dry years for SJWD Retail, Folsom and Orangevale; sufficient groundwater production to meet the substitution transfer volumes that are agreed to with CHWD, FOWD, OWWC and SSWD; groundwater production for substitution transfers at market rates; and, with regard to recharge, meet sustainability goals with partners and, as necessary, provide additional recharge to make sure that the groundwater resources are available to meet future needs. He indicated that the analysis document was previously emailed to the Board members.

GM Helliker explained that there are three alternatives that have been discussed: (1) buy into facilities; (2) buy capacity in a facility; and (3) buy water as needed. He informed the Board that there has not been a lot of discussion with CHWD or FOWD, but there have been discussions with SSWD, and OWWC is also interested in discussing this topic. Mr. Zlotnick explained that this is regarding physical infrastructure with regard to partnering with agencies that have facilities or are looking to have facilities with groundwater that they can access. Mr. Zlotnick confirmed that these options, along with in lieu of or ASR, make banking of water a possibility for the District. GM Helliker emphasized that the most critical need that the District has is groundwater production and having access to groundwater during a drought.

In response to Vice President Costa’s comment, GM Helliker explained that the 2008 Shortage Policy that the District had with the CHWD and FOWD was cancelled and replaced with another policy which now states that if there is a shortage of surface water and not enough to meet all the needs of the wholesale area, then the surface water will be distributed in a prorated amount, based on the last five years of use.

GM Helliker reviewed two scenarios regarding backup supplies for critically dry years and explained the well capacity needs of the District. In addition, he reviewed the last ten years of water use by CHWD and FOWD and their current demands, along with data from monitoring wells that show groundwater sustainability levels. He reviewed the various amounts of water that the District, CHWD, FOWD, OWWC and SSWD are required to deliver as it pertains to the Voluntary Agreement.

GM Helliker informed the Board that Mr. Zlotnick has completed some research regarding grant opportunities for groundwater facilities. Mr. Zlotnick explained that there are three opportunities through the federal government with the Army Corp of Engineers and their Environmental Infrastructure Account Section 219, the Environmental Protection Agency State & Tribal Assistance Grants Program, and Reclamation’s Water Smart Program. Mr. Zlotnick reviewed the options that are available to the District to secure funding.

3. 2024 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed data which included the current reservoir storage levels across the state, data on releases, temperature and precipitation outlooks, and storage levels and projections at Folsom Reservoir.

Mr. Zlotnick informed the Board that staff plans to purchase some CVP water this year, along with all of the water rights water and some PCWA water and will balance the water supply cost with the budget. He explained that using CVP water helps to build the historic use when there are times of water shortage allocations from Reclamation.

He indicated that there were many questions and concerns regarding adding water transfers as it may lead to some implications for the annual transfers that the District conducts.

GM Helliker informed the Board that he hasn’t had a conversation with Mr. Lamar for about a year and was not involved in the Board’s decision regarding her attendance at the conference. Director Tobin started to discuss the democracy of voting when President Zamorano called for a point of order. Director Tobin stated the District missed an opportunity for her to meet with various federal representatives on important water matters. In addition, she stated that the conference was budgeted then the Board voted not to allow her attendance as punishment and is not allowing her to do her job and duties as agreed upon. President Zamorano called for a point of order. In response to Director Tobin’s request, Legal Counsel Jones informed Director Tobin that she has the floor for her report as long as it is related to ACWA.
