All items under the Consent Calendar are considered to be routine and are approved by one motion. There was no separate discussion of these items unless a member of the Board, audience, or staff requested a specific item removed.

   **Recommendation:** Approve draft minutes

Director Costa moved to approve the Consent Calendar. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

IV. **NEW BUSINESS**

1. **2024 Board Committees (W & R)**  
   President Zamorano opened the floor for Board discussion. Director Costa informed the Board that he and Director Tobin discussed switching committees and Director Tobin would like to be on the Finance Committee and Director Costa would like to be on the Public Information Committee. Director Tobin requested that her assignments to the ACWA Foundation and the Sacramento LAFCO be added to the committee list. President Zamorano would like any changes to be submitted to him by February 20, 2024.

2. **ACWA DC2024 Conference Attendance (W & R)**  
   Director Tobin informed the Board that attending the ACWA DC2024 conference is one of her requirements as Immediate Past President of ACWA. She commented that she is registered for the conference unless the Board does not approve her attendance and she reviewed the conference agenda.

   Director Rich questioned the benefit to the District of Director Tobin attending the conference. Director Tobin commented that water rights is a big topic at the conference which benefits the District along with the District being represented at the conference. In response to President Zamorano’s question, the Board Secretary confirmed that approximately $3,200 was budgeted for the conference which would cover the registration, hotel, meals and transportation. Director Tobin confirmed that ACWA does not cover any of the ACWA DC2023 expenses but will cover the registration for the ACWA Spring and Fall conferences.

   President Zamorano requested that Director Tobin be more accommodating with regard to ACWA appointments and Director Tobin explained that she has no jurisdiction with regard to making appointments; however, she stated that she can make recommendations.

![January 24, 2024, Board Minutes Page 3](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=January+24%2C+2024%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+3)

Director Costa moved to approve Director Tobin’s out of state attendance at the ACWA DC2024 Conference. Director Tobin seconded the motion and the motion failed with 2 Aye votes and 3 No votes (Miller, Rich and Zamorano).

Director Tobin voiced concern that the Board put forth a frivolous $100,000 rebate while denying the expenditure of $3,200 to represent the District in Washington, D.C., and she stated that the Board is headed in the wrong direction with very limited leadership.

3. American River Watershed Sanitary Survey Update (W)  
Mr. Barela informed the Board that the American River Watershed Sanitary Survey is completed every five years, which is an evaluation of the watershed. Mr. Greg Turner, Water Treatment Plant Manager, conducted a brief presentation which will be attached to the meeting minutes.

Mr. Turner informed the Board that the American River Watershed Sanitary Survey focused on Watershed and Water Supply Systems, American River Water Quality, Contaminating Sources, and Findings and Recommendations. He reported that the study showed that the American River continues to provide an excellent source of water, that SJWD water treatment continues to meet all drinking water standards, and that no constituents were found to require additional treatment.

4. CCTM1 Lease Agreement Approval (W & R)  
Mr. Barela provided the Board with a staff report which was included in the Board packet and conducted a brief presentation. He explained that the lease agreement with CCTM1 (T-Mobile) ends in 2026; however, they reached out to the District to negotiate a new contract which would extend the contract 30 years (which is structured as automatic 5-year renewals) and include terms to allow them to have DISH equipment installed on their existing tower which is known as co-location. He explained that the agreement was reviewed by legal counsel and includes an increasing rate structure along with terms for co-location. He explained that the District would receive 50% of the amount of the rental fee that T-Mobile would assess DISH.

Mr. Barela informed the Board that this item was taken to the last Finance Committee meeting for review and staff recommends that the Board approve staff to execute the contract with T-Mobile. Director Costa voiced concern that the Board was not aware that staff was negotiating with T-Mobile and that T-Mobile already signed the contract, so he suggested that the Board be notified in the future on items like this and that staff discuss the process with the General Manager. The Board discussed the lease agreement and Legal Counsel Jones confirmed that he worked closely with staff regarding the contract terms and recommends Board approval.

Director Tobin moved to approve the execution of a lease agreement with CCTM1, LLC related to the property containing CCTM1’s cell tower and instrumentation. Director Costa seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

## V. OLD BUSINESS

1. **FY 2023-24 Operations Plan Report Card (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker reviewed the 2nd quarter progress on the FY 2023-24 Operations Plan Report Card. He informed the Board that staff is on track to meet the goals, with some projects already completed or slightly delayed.

2. **Strategic Plan Update (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker informed the Board that staff revised the Strategic Plan as discussed at a previous Board meeting. He started to review the edited plan that was included in the Board packet; however, Director Tobin voiced concern that the Board was not included in the revision of the plan. GM Helliker suggested that a workshop be conducted with the Board. The Board discussed the suggestion and agreed that they would like to hold a separate workshop in the evening to discuss the Strategic Plan.

3. **San Juan and the Regional Water Authority (W & R)**  
   Mr. Zlotnick reminded the Board that there was a desire to discuss the District’s relationship with RWA and he reported that Jim Peifer, RWA Executive Director, will be at the March Board meeting. He informed the Board that it will be an opportunity for them to discuss any issues they have with RWA at that meeting. He suggested that the Board develop a list of topics to discuss which can be distributed to RWA in advance of the meeting, and that the meeting would not be limited to just those topics.  
   The Board discussed some topics that they would like to discuss in March which includes the benefit of the annual membership dues, grants received, development of the water bank, conjunctive use, governance, SG membership, RWA staff salaries, annual cost per connection paid to RWA by San Juan and other agencies, return on investment over the last 5-10 years, funding for wells in the region, and the cost to terminate membership since that was mentioned in a previous meeting with RWA. The Board was informed that if they have any other topics to address, then they can send an email to GM Helliker and Mr. Zlotnick.

4. **Ad Hoc Health Benefits Committee Update (W & R)**  
   Ms. Silva reviewed the staff report which was included in the Board packet. She provided the Board members with the consultant’s report and explained that even though ACWA-JPIA’s premiums were less than CalPERS, ACWA-JPIA does not manage retiree medical which would require an additional staff person to manage it in-house, which would negate the premium savings. She informed the Board that the committee and staff do not recommend switching health benefit providers. The Board thanked staff and the committee for their work on this item. Ms. Silva informed the Board that staff will continue to monitor the health benefits.

5. **Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker reported that he and Mr. Zlotnick met with Dan York, Sacramento Suburban Water District General Manager, to discuss the groundwater bank project with RWA, and potential water transfers this year. GM Helliker reported that SSWD is interested in buying water from SJWD this year, and possibly conducting a groundwater substitution transfer. GM Helliker reported that he is completing the
<!-- Page 8 -->

banking description for SSWD and will be meeting with SSWD to discuss a potential banking partnership and taking advantage of the funding in the retail budget.

GM Helliker reported that there have been no further meetings with Fair Oaks Water District and Citrus Heights Water District; however, there was an email exchange today regarding banking partnership agreements.

6. 2024 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed data which included the current reservoir storage levels across the state, data on releases, temperature and precipitation outlooks, and storage levels and projections at Folsom Reservoir.

1.1 General Manager’s Monthly Report (W & R)  
GM Helliker provided the Board with a written report for December which was included in the Board packet.

1.2 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence  
GM Helliker reported that the Legislative Analyst’s Office released a report on the conservation regulations which confirmed the water agencies’ stance on the proposed regulations. The report showed that the proposed regulations are very complex, very onerous, and not cost effective.

GM Helliker reported that comments on the voluntary agreements were due last Friday and the District participated in two sets of comments – one with Northern California Water Association and the other with RWA. He explained that if the State Water Board were to implement their proposal on the American River, it would prevent Reclamation from meeting temperature requirements under the Endangered Species Act.

2. DIRECTOR OF FINANCE’S REPORT  
2.1 Rates/Fees/Charges updated by 3.13% CPI or 2.55% CCI effective Jan. 1, 2024, where applicable

2.2 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence  
Ms. Silva reported that a check for $21.6 million was received this week from the State Revolving loan fund for the Hinkle Reservoir project. She explained that the funds were deposited and are in the process of being transferred to LAIF and possibly another investment pool which will earn a higher interest rate.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** February 28, 2024  
**Subject:** Treasurer’s Report – Quarter Ending December 31, 2023  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
This report is for information only and will be filed with the meeting minutes.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
The purpose of the treasurer’s report is to update the Board and the public on the status of the District’s cash balances and investments and highlight material changes from one period to another. The scope of this report covers the second quarter of fiscal year 2023-2024, ending December 31, 2023.

The District’s investment objectives are established by the Board approved Investment Policy. The Investment Policy is guided and constrained by the California Government Code. The Board periodically reviews and adjusts the Investment Policy to ensure ongoing compliance with the government code and to maximize investment flexibility as permitted. The current Investment Policy has the following objectives for the portfolio:

1. Safety  
2. Liquidity  
3. Yield  

Attached is the quarterly Treasurer’s Report for the three months ended December 31, 2023.

At September 30, 2023, the end of the previous quarter, the value of the District’s total portfolio was $25.9 million. Since that time, the value of the District’s portfolio increased by $2.1 million for an ending balance of $28 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in the portfolio is due to the slowing down of cash outlays for the Hinkle Reservoir project. Cash and short-term investments increased by $1,958,129. Medium term investments decreased by $76,011 and long-term investments increased by $215,339.

The funds are currently held as follows:

- **Cash at Banking Institutions**: $4,186,928.06  
- **Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF)**: $13,880,502.83  
- **PFM Managed Investment Portfolio**: $9,895,363.75  
- **Total**: $27,962,794.64  
<!-- Page 13 -->
The overall portfolio is diversified with 37% invested in marketable securities (PFM Portfolio), 53% invested in short-term investments that are considered liquid (LAIF) and 10% on deposit with US Bank. Staff, in conjunction with your financial advisors, periodically review the mix of liquid and long-term investments and adjusts the portfolio according to the market conditions and the District’s short term cash needs.

All securities held are in conformance with those permitted by the District’s Investment Policy. There are sufficient funds to meet the District’s expenditure requirements for the next six months.

The mix and duration of investments are displayed in the following charts:

![Distribution of Investments](attachment://chart.png)

- Cash In Checking 15%
- LAIF 50%
- PFM Portfolio 35%
<!-- Page 14 -->
![Mix of Investments - PFM Portfolio](https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png?text=Mix+of+Investments+-+PFM+Portfolio)

- U.S. Treasury Bonds/Notes
- Federal Agency Bonds/Notes
- Corporate Notes
- Federal Agency Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities
- U.S. Treasury Bills
- Asset-Backed Security/Collateralized Mortgage Obligations
- Municipal Bonds/Notes
- Supra-National Agency Bonds/Notes

![Duration of PFM Portfolio](https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png?text=Duration+of+PFM+Portfolio)

- Cash: $100,218
- Short-Term (less than 1 year): $1,630,755
- Medium-Term (1-3 years): $4,970,989
- Long-Term (greater than 3 years): $3,193,402

Inflation continued a cooling trend throughout the quarter, resulting in the Federal Reserve signaling an end to its cycle of interest rate hikes and projecting cuts to the short-term Fed funds rate. This likely means interest rates have peaked.

The portfolio continues to perform well relative to the benchmark (Bank of America Merrill Lynch “BAML” 0-5 year Treasury Index) on an historical basis.

**AGENDA ITEM III-3**  

**STAFF REPORT**  

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Finance Director  
**Date:** February 28, 2024  
**Subject:** FIN-5.2 Capital Asset Policy Revisions  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Approve amendments to the Capital Asset Policy for the San Juan Water District. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Finance Committee, which recommends review and approval by the Board of Directors.  

**BACKGROUND**  
Capital Assets is a term used to describe assets that are used in operations, above a certain value threshold, and that have initial lives extending beyond a single reporting period (fiscal year). Capitalization is primarily a financial reporting issue. What this means is that the District’s primary concern in setting a capitalization policy should be the anticipated information needs of the users of the District’s external financial reports. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require the matching of expenses to the period of benefit. Since capital assets provide benefits over their entire life, GAAP require that they be expensed or “depreciated” over the same time period.  

There are many policy decisions that should be made and periodically reviewed by the Board of Directors to adequately guide staff in the identification, capitalization and depreciation of capital assets, such as capitalization thresholds, estimated useful lives of asset categories, how to determine the value of donated assets, etc.  

The Board first adopted a Capital Asset Policy in October 2017. The policy was reviewed and amended by the Board in August 2020, April 2022 and in December 2022.  

The most recent amendment to the policy, in December 2022 removed the $100,000 threshold for bundled assets and added language to include service lateral replacements as a bundle of assets.  

With the recent completion of the FY 22-23 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR), staff identified language in the policy that is inconsistent with GAAP and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) current standards for the disposal or replacement of capital assets by a government entity.  

**Proposed Changes and Rationale:**  

The existing policy states that a depreciable capital asset whose book value is determinable will be removed from the books when the replacement is recorded. According to GASB the depreciable capital asset whose book value is determinable should be removed from the books at the time of disposal or when it is placed out of service. For example, if one of the District’s pump stations generators is being replaced, the old generator being disposed of will

## FIN-5.2 Capital Asset Policy Revisions  

be removed from the books (written off) the moment it goes offline and not when the replacement goes online.  

Staff recommends adding language to specifically include that capital assets should be written off when they are disposed of or placed out of service.  

A clean version of the proposed policy, as well as a redline version of the existing policy are attached for review.

## FIN-5.2 Capital Asset Policy

### 5.2.1 Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidance in identifying, capitalizing, depreciating, and accounting for District capital assets.

### 5.2.2 Definitions
A capital asset is defined under this Policy as an asset owned by the District that is: 1) acquired for use in District operations, and 2) long-term in nature.

### 5.2.3 Capital Improvement Program
District infrastructure will be maintained at a level that ensures the delivery of a reliable water supply of the highest quality at reasonable and equitable costs. Long-term capital improvement plans are created with each Master Plan. The capital improvement plan is a planning tool which assists the District in the construction and replacement of capital facilities required to provide water service to current and future customers. The Long Term Capital Improvement Plan is updated each year based on a number of factors including new projects not identified in Master Plan, funding availability, and available staff resources.

### 5.2.4 Categories
Capital assets shall be segregated into the following categories:

A. Land (non-depreciable)  
B. Land Improvements with a limited life, such as driveways, walks, fences, landscaping, and parking areas.  
C. Pump Stations and Improvements  
D. Buildings and Improvements (excluding Water Treatment Plant)  
E. Water Treatment Plant and Improvements  
F. Mains/Pipelines and Improvements  
G. Meters & Endpoints  
H. Reservoirs and Improvements  
I. Equipment and Furniture, such as large tools, vehicle trailers, tractors, meters, hydrants, computer equipment, furniture, and fixtures  
J. Vehicles, such as cars and trucks  
K. Software  
L. Subscription Based Technology Arrangements  
M. Other Intangibles

# 5.2.5 Capitalization Thresholds

Capital assets eligible for capitalization, must have:

A. An estimated useful life of greater than 1 year from the date of acquisition; and  
B. A minimum individual asset value of $5,000. If the asset is shared between Wholesale and Retail, the combined total value must be at least $5,000 to qualify for capitalization.  
C. Assets cannot be grouped together to meet the minimum $5,000 value, with the exception of bundled assets as mentioned below.  
D. Bundled Assets: assets whose individual acquisition costs are less than $5,000 if the bundle of assets in the aggregate are significant. The District considers the following to be bundled assets:  
   - All meter replacements, capitalize as an annual asset  
   - Service Lateral installation and replacements: capitalize by development project and/or as one annual asset  
E. A lease agreement that extends beyond one year (including extensions) and a total lease value of at least $100,000.  

# 5.2.6 Valuation of Capital Assets

The value assigned to capital assets shall be determined as follows:

A. Purchased or Constructed Capital Assets  
The value is determined using the original cost of the asset, including all reasonably identifiable costs incurred to acquire, construct, and place an asset into service. Studies are not capitalized, unless they can be related to a specific asset.  

B. Donated Capital Assets  
The capitalized value of donated assets shall be determined using the fair market value at the time of donation. If the fair market value of the asset is not available or cannot be reasonably determined, an estimated cost may be determined using the best available information. The value of donated intangible assets shall be accounted for separate from donated tangible capital assets.  

Fair Market or Appraised Value at date of donation includes:  
- Installation costs;  
- Professional fees of engineers, inspectors, attorneys, consultants, etc.;  
- Other normal or necessary costs required to place the asset in its intended location and condition for use.  

Leased Assets (Right to Use)  
- Value of lease liability;  
- Lease prepayments made for future periods;  
- Direct ancillary costs necessary to place asset into service (excluding debt issuance costs).

# 5.2.7 Capitalization of Costs Subsequent to Acquisition

Additional costs incurred after a capital asset is placed in use shall be accounted for as follows:

## A. Additions:
An “Addition” is defined as an expenditure that either significantly extends the useful life or productivity of an existing capital asset or creates a new capital asset. All “Additions” to existing capital assets should be capitalized as long as the asset meets the criteria of section 5.2.5 above.

## B. Improvements and Replacements:
“Improvements and Replacements” are defined as expenditures that involve substituting a similar capital asset, or portion thereof, for an existing one. All “Improvements and Replacements” to existing capital assets should be capitalized as long as the asset meets the criteria of section 5.2.5 above. If the existing asset’s book value is determinable, then the existing asset should be removed from the books when taken out of service. If the existing asset is not separately identifiable, then the replacement may be capitalized as the existing asset’s book value is assumed to be negligible. The Director of Finance is authorized to make a determination when this policy does not provide clear direction.

## C. Rearrangement or Reinstallation:
“Rearrangement or Reinstallation” costs are defined as expenditures that involve moving an existing asset to a new location or reinstalling a similar asset in place of an existing asset. All “Rearrangement or Reinstallation” costs should be expensed in the period incurred.

## D. Repairs and Maintenance:
“Repairs and Maintenance” costs are defined as expenditures that involve maintaining the asset in good or ordinary repair. All “Repairs and Maintenance” costs should be expensed in the period incurred.

# 5.2.8 Depreciation or Amortization of Capital Assets

Capital assets shall be depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis beginning the first day of the month following acquisition in accordance with the following schedule:

A physical inventory of the following categories of capital assets shall be performed at least annually:
A. Machinery and Equipment  
B. Fleet Equipment  
C. Office Furniture and Fixtures

5.2.10 Disposal of Capital Assets  
Capital assets that have become obsolete shall be disposed of in a manner that returns the maximum value to the District and its ratepayers.

In most cases the assets are sent to auction; however, the Finance Director determines the best method of disposal.

State law prohibits District employees from purchasing District property (Government Code section 1090).

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Donna Silva, Director of Finance**  
**Date:** February 28, 2024  
**Subject:** 2023 Fixed Charges – Rebate to CHWD and FOWD  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Approve rebate  

**BACKGROUND**  
The San Juan Water District's (San Juan) 2017 Wholesale Financial Plan resulted in a five-year rate schedule, which implemented rate increases through January 2021. In that rate structure, 74% of the revenue requirements were to be recovered through fixed rates and 26% through the variable rate. Most of the fixed service charge was allocated to each agency based upon their average water deliveries during calendar years 2012-2016. 

Commencing in January 2020, at the request of the Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks Water Districts (CHWD and FOWD), the fixed service charge was re-allocated each calendar year based upon the most recent 5-year average of water deliveries. Under this new methodology, the total amount of revenue to be collected via the service charge remained as set by the Financial Plan, but the allocation changed each January, based upon the past five fiscal years of water deliveries per agency. Each year, the finance team calculated the new allocation by dropping off the older year and adding in the water use from the most recent fiscal year. Even though the total amount to be collected by the fixed charge did not change from the originally approved rate schedule, the amount due by each agency shifted, based on changes in the most recent five years of water use. Since the fixed charges changed at the customer level, San Juan was required to send out the 150-Day notice of proposed changes in rates (each July), and the San Juan Board of Directors approved the re-allocation of the rates after the end of the comment period.

The 150-Day Notice to Change Rates for calendar year 2023 was sent to the wholesale customer agencies on July 18, 2022. The calculation of the rate allocation and the impact per agency, along with the proposed rate schedule, were included in the transmittal. The notice and transmittal email are attached. No comments were received from the customer agencies. The proposed rate schedule was reviewed by the Finance Committee on January 24, 2023, and approved by the Board January 25, 2023, and was effective January 1, 2023.

While preparing the wholesale revenue budget for fiscal year 2023-24, staff noticed that the fixed charge calculation for FY 2023 differed from the previous methodology. Specifically, the formula used the total of four previous years of water deliveries (FY 2017-18 through FY 2020-21), rather than the five years used in prior recalculations.

On November 16, 2023, staff received an email from the CHWD notifying us of a potential error in the calculation of the fixed charge allocation for CY 2023. They correctly noticed
<!-- Page 36 -->
![Staff Report – Calendar Year 2023 Wholesale Fixed Charges Page 2](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Staff+Report+%E2%80%93+Calendar+Year+2023+Wholesale+Fixed+Charges+Page+2)

that FY 2021-22 water usage was omitted from the calculation, resulting in a four-year average, instead of a five-year average. Staff explained that the rate schedule had gone through the required comment period and no comments had been received, and the schedule had received Board approval and had been implemented. On December 20, 2023, we received the attached letter wherein CHWD requests a change in rates, and a rebate and advises that it will be paying all future invoices “under protest”.

The chart below shows the original fixed rate allocation and amount per agency, as originally approved with the 2017 Wholesale Financial Plan. It also shows the current rates in effect (using the 4-year average water use) and what the allocation and rates would be had the District used the 5-year water use allocation methodology.

| Per 2017 Financial Plan/Rate Schedule | Approved Rates (4-Yr. Allocation) | Allocation & Rates Using 5-Yr. Allocation |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Agency                                 | Annual Fixed Charge                | Annual Fixed Charge                       | Annual Fixed Charge                       |
| San Juan Water District                | 30.85% $ 2,230,048                 | 33.55% $ 2,315,233                       | 34.41% $ 2,374,961                       |
| Citrus Heights Water District          | 32.22% $ 2,239,152                 | 30.93% $ 2,134,283                       | 29.81% $ 2,057,714                       |

| Orange Vale Water Company              | 10.56% $ 763,612                   | 11.00% $ 758,942                         | 11.32% $ 774,654                         |
| City of Folsom                        | 3.06% $ 221,228                    | 2.35% $ 224,559                          | 3.39% $ 226,979                          |
| Totals                                 | 100% $ 7,228,508                   | 100% $ 6,900,984                         | 100% $ 6,900,984                         |

The fiscal impact of the approved rates versus the rates that would have been assessed if the 5-year water use allocation methodology had been utilized is as follows:

| Agency                                 | Annual Fiscal Impact               |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| San Juan Water District                | $ 59,728.00                        |
| Citrus Heights Water District          | ($77,108.97)                       |
| Fair Oaks Water District               | ($751.19)                          |
| Orange Vale Water Company              | $ 15,711.67                        |
| City of Folsom                        | $ 2,420.48                         |
| Totals                                 | $ (0.00)                           |

While the allocation methodology employed does not affect total revenues to the Wholesale division, it does affect the amount of fixed charges due in the calendar year by each customer. CHWD is requesting a refund of the $77,108.97.

Section 5(B) of the Wholesale Water Supply Agreements with CHWD and FOWD specifies that San Juan shall use the net revenues from water transfers to defray the costs that are recovered through San Juan’s wholesale water rates and charges. San Juan generated adequate net revenues from the 2022 groundwater substitution transfers that it conducted to fund the rebate requested by CHWD (and a refund of $751.19 to FOWD). Staff requests that the Board authorize these rebates.

Subject: 150-Day Advance Written Notice of Proposed Changes in Water Rates and Charges  

Gentlemen:

This letter is sent in accordance with Section 11 of the Wholesale Water Supply Agreements between the San Juan Water District and your agencies, to advise of a proposed change in the allocation of the fixed quarterly charge for calendar year 2023.

In December 2019, at the request of the Wholesale Customer Agencies, the San Juan Water District’s Board of Directors approved a change in the allocation of the fixed service charge. Prior to the change, the fixed service charge was allocated to each agency based upon a blend of their average water deliveries during calendar years 2012-2016 and the relative number of customer accounts. In December 2019, the Board approved a new methodology wherein the service charge is allocated each calendar year based upon the rolling 5-year average of water deliveries. Under this new methodology, the total amount of revenue to be collected via the service charge remains as set by the Financial Plan, but the allocation changes each January based upon the past five years of water deliveries per agency.

The Financial Plan set rates for a five year period, with the final rate increase applied January 1, 2021. The District intends to conduct the next Wholesale Financial Plan Rate Study after the completion of the Wholesale Master Plan, which should be soon. As such, the total quarterly service charge for calendar year 2023 will remain the same as the current year. However, the allocation between the customer agency will change based upon the updated rolling 5-year average of water deliveries. However, the District
<!-- Page 39 -->
may issue another 150-Day Notice of Proposed Changes in Rates, based upon the recommendations from the upcoming Wholesale Financial Plan.

The calculation of the proposed rate change, as well as the effect upon each agency, and the proposed rate schedule is included as an attachment to this letter. The 150-day comment period provided in Section 11 of the Wholesale Water Supply Agreements will end on December 12, 2022. The District’s Board of Directors will consider adopting the revised rates at the December 14, 2022 Board Meeting.

If you have any questions or need further information, please feel free to contact Finance Director Donna Silva, or myself.

Re: Notice of Payment Under Protest of Fixed Quarterly Charges  

Dear Paul,  

Enclosed please find Citrus Heights Water District’s (“CHWD”) payment for Invoice No. INV02753. In preparing the payment, CHWD has determined that San Juan Water District (“SJWD”) has overcharged CHWD in the amount of $19,277.23 per quarter in calendar year 2023, resulting in a total overcharge of $77,108.92 in calendar year 2023.  

Notice is hereby given that all amounts owed by CHWD to SJWD for the fixed quarterly charge for October through December 2023, as well as those already-invoiced for the period of January through October 2023, are paid under protest, until such time as SJWD reimburses CHWD for the overcharges. This notice is provided in accordance with any legal requirement for payment under protest of any unlawfully collected taxes, fees, or charges, including the requirements of California Health and Safety Code §§ 5470 et seq. and California Revenue and Taxation Code §§ 5140 et seq., to the extent such laws or such requirement for payment under protest applies. Payment under protest shall continue until such time that SJWD corrects the error and reimburses CHWD for all overcharged amounts.  

Additionally, CHWD invokes Section 11(B) of the San Juan Water District and Citrus Heights Water District Wholesale Water Supply Agreement, and requests that SJWD return to CHWD the overcharges within 45 days.  

Based on CHWD’s review of the relevant documentation, it appears that the overcharge is a result of SJWD’s miscalculation of the fixed charge allocation to CHWD. Under the rates applicable to the 2023 invoices, fixed charges are calculated based on the average water usage by each member agency over the previous five years. (2017 Wholesale Rate Study.) However, SJWD’s invoice for fixed charges did not account for CHWD’s water use for Fixed Year 2021-2022 in the calculation. This miscalculation led SJWD to overcharging CHWD in the amount of $19,277.23 per quarter, which amounts to $77,108.92 for calendar year 2023.  

Until SJWD corrects this mistake and refunds CHWD the amounts overpaid as of the date of this letter, any charges imposed on CHWD are imposed in violation of applicable law, and any payment for such fixed service charges shall be made under protest.  

Nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of any other right or remedy available to CHWD. While this letter serves as full and complete notice that CHWD is paying under protest for the fixed quarterly charges received until such time as the overcharges discussed herein are reimbursed and CHWD informs SJWD that payments are no longer

being made under protest, CHWD will also include the enclosed letter in substantially the form attached hereto with checks for fixed service charges.  

If you have any questions, please contact me at your earliest convenience.

# AGENDA ITEM IV-5

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** February 28, 2024  
**Subject:** Director Compensation  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Consider potential modification to Director compensation  

**BACKGROUND**  
Similar to other public agencies across the region and state, members of the San Juan Water District Board of Directors (Directors) are compensated for the service they provide in official capacities. Current compensation is $125 per day for each day’s attendance and service at specified meetings and events as provided in District Board Policy BOD-2.2. California Water Code (Water Code) Section 20202 allows annual updates to Director compensation, in an amount not to exceed 5%, for each year that has elapsed since compensation was last increased. It also limits entitlement to compensation to 10 days per month. The last time Director compensation was increased was on April 13, 2005, when the Board adopted Ordinance 05-001 increasing Director compensation from $100 to $125 per day for a meeting or event.

**CURRENT STATUS**  
Since the last increase was adopted nearly 19 years ago, Director compensation has not been adjusted at the annual 5% rate as allowed per the Water Code. Staff has conducted an analysis of Director compensation for agencies in the region – see the attached spreadsheet. The Board can choose to increase compensation per day of service to any figure up to $315.87, which is the maximum allowed by Water Code 20202. In reviewing the compensation from surrounding agencies, staff has determined that the average rate, based on 5.6 meetings per month, is $121.09. The SJWD Directors averaged a total of 28 meetings per month (5.6 meetings per month per director) over the last 3 fiscal years for Board meetings, committee meetings, external meetings, and events.

Should the Board desire to increase compensation, the Board would need to direct staff to initiate an ordinance revision to increase compensation and would need to publish the ordinance summary in a newspaper for two successive weeks prior to its adoption, per the California Water Code. Accordingly, the Board of Directors could adopt an ordinance at its April 24, 2024, meeting. There is a 60-day waiting period after the ordinance is adopted until it is effective, which would make July 1, 2024, the earliest effective date.

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
The District's current budget provides $75,000 for annual Director compensation, which allows for 10 meetings per month per Director. The average amount paid over the last three fiscal years has been $42,000 annually.

# AGENDA ITEM V-2  
## Scenarios for Groundwater Recovery and Use  
February 6, 2024  

### Supplemental Drought Supply – San Juan Retail, Orange Vale Water Company and Folsom-Ashland  

**Potential Production Need: 0-4 MGD dry year winter minimum (0–2,800 GPM) and 4.0-10.6 MGD dry year summer maximum (2,800-7,400 GPM)**  

While San Juan Wholesale (“San Juan”) has never failed to have adequate surface water supplies to meet wholesale customer demands, its ability to receive deliveries from Folsom Reservoir could be reduced, should the storage level in the Reservoir fall below 110,000 AF. Below that level, San Juan and the City of Roseville would be forced to rely on, and share, the maximum 60 cubic feet per second (cfs), or 38.78 million gallons per day (MGD) capacity of an emergency pump operated by the Bureau of Reclamation. While this pumping capacity has not been formally allocated, given the relative typical water supply demands of San Juan and the City of Roseville, it is reasonable to expect that approximately 50% of this capacity would be available for San Juan’s use, or 30 cfs (19.39 MGD). This supply could be augmented with emergency supplies from an intertie with PCWA that can deliver 2.9 MGD, resulting in a total of 22.29 MGD.  

San Juan’s shortage allocation methodology specifies that, in a situation in which there is inadequate surface water supply to meet demand in San Juan’s wholesale service area, available supplies will be allocated to each Wholesale Customer Agency (WCA) based on the average of the past five non-transfer years’ worth of demand divided by the average of total WCA demand. Using the years of 2017, 2019-2021 and 2023, the aggregated proportion of surface water supplies available to San Juan Retail, Orange Vale Water Company (OVWC) and Folsom-Ashland (Folsom) would be 49.72%, or 11.08 MGD.  

This capacity would be available until reservoir levels dropped below approximately 50,000 AF, at which point water supplies would have to be pumped from floating pump stations deployed upstream of the dam into the power penstocks, on which Reclamation’s emergency pump is situated. The capacity of such floating pump stations has not been determined, but if the floating pump stations that would be serving the City of Folsom (Folsom) during such a situation are any indicator, it would be a maximum of 30 cfs total (19.39 MGD). Adding 50% of this capacity to the 2.9 MGD in intertie supplies from PCWA results in surface water supplies of 12.60 MGD. Using the shortage allocation methodology just noted, the proportion of aggregated supplies available to San Juan Retail, OVWC and Folsom would be 6.26 MGD.  

San Juan’s water rights allow for diversion of up to 75 cfs (48.47 MGD) during the peak summer months, and its diversions of supplies from the Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) and its CVP water add to this total amount. Since 2016, San Juan deliveries have reached a daily peak of 131.05 cfs (84.7 MGD), with minimum deliveries ranging.

from 5.89 cfs (3.17 MGD) to 22.30 cfs (12 MGD). Data for two recent years, 2021 (a critically dry year) and 2023 (a wet year), is shown in the table on the next page.

In the scenario in which Folsom Reservoir storage is between 110,000 AF and 50,000 AF, San Juan Retail, OWVC and Folsom jointly face the prospect of having only 11.08 MGD of surface water supply. For storage below 50,000 AF, the three agencies would expect no more than 6.26 MGD of supply. In the first scenario, the three agencies would likely invoke their water shortage contingency plans to require a 25% reduction in demand (focused on outdoor use in the summer), thus potentially reducing the peak dry year demand from 28.9 MGD to 21.7 MGD. But this would still leave a shortfall of 10.6 MGD (7,400 GPM). In the second scenario, the agencies would likely require no outdoor irrigation, dropping demand to winter levels. The shortfall in that scenario would be 4.0 MGD (2,800 GPM).

The three agencies own 14.4 MGD (10,000 GPM) capacity in the Antelope Pump Station that is owned and operated by the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD). There is no dedicated groundwater production capacity associated with this pumping capacity, but an agreement with SSWD could establish such capacity.

![Groundwater Substitution Transfers – Voluntary Agreement/DWR Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Groundwater+Substitution+Transfers+%E2%80%93+Voluntary+Agreement/DWR+Agreement)

**Potential Production Need:** 7,797 AF/yr (4,833 GPM)

The American River Voluntary Agreement (VA) includes a flow contribution of 30,000 AF of groundwater substitution transfers in up to three dry or critical years during the eight years of the VA or potentially out to 2036 if less than three calls for water are made in the initial 8-year period. This additional time allowance was a commitment the VA groundwater substitution transfer participants made as part of an agreement with the California Department of Water Resources and the Regional Water Authority to receive $55 million in grant funding.

San Juan expects to participate in these agreements with its groundwater production partners, in the following amounts (the amounts in columns 2 and 3 incorporate application of any streamflow depletion factor):

| Groundwater Partner                     | Annual Amount (AF) | Annual Amount (GPM) |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Citrus Heights Water District           | 1,963               | 1,217                |
| Fair Oaks Water District                | 1,374               | 852                  |
| Orange Vale Water Company               | 460                 | 285                  |
| Sacramento Suburban Water District      | 4,000               | 2,480                |

These annual production amounts for replenishing VA releases from Folsom Reservoir can be distributed across 12 months, and the schedule for producing the groundwater to allow for these amounts of required groundwater substitution transfers is within the discretion of the groundwater providers in coordination with San Juan. The actual amount of daily production capacity would likely be defined by the production profile for the VA/DWR agreement “replenishment” actions.

**Groundwater Substitution Transfers – Market Rate**

**Potential Production Need:** 2-4,000 AF/provider over 4-5 months (3,017 - 7,543 GPM)

San Juan has partnered with CHWD and FOWD in the past to conduct market-based groundwater substitution transfers. The target amounts of those transfers were approximately 2,000 AF per groundwater provider, and the transfer window was expanded in 2019 to July through November. San Juan has also been transferring 4-6,000 AF of conserved surface water to SSWD since 2020, thus establishing a foundation for a similar partnership on future market-based groundwater substitution transfers.

*Note that San Juan and its groundwater substitution partners may wish to also pursue market transfers in VA call years, which would necessitate increased groundwater production.*

### Conclusion:
July through January deliveries were higher than anticipated by 5,073 acre feet or 19.7%. As shown in the table above the main drivers of the positive variance are deliveries to SSWD and the Citrus Heights Water District. Deliveries to SSWD are 62.9% greater than anticipated for this point in the year and deliveries to Citrus Heights Water District are 14.3% higher than anticipated.

The 19.7% positive variance in deliveries results in year to date revenues that are 16.2% greater than anticipated in the budget for this point in the year.

State Water Resources Control Board  
E. Joaquin Esquivel, Chair  
1001 I Street  
Sacramento, CA 95814  

**RE: Support for the Agreements to Support Healthy Rivers and Landscapes**

Dear Chair Esquivel and Board Members:

We write to express our support for, and to encourage you to take definitive action to approve, the Agreements to support Healthy Rivers and Landscapes as the approach for the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan Update.

As you know, on March 29, 2022, the Governor convened federal, state, and local water leaders to announce broad agreement on measures to provide additional water flows and new habitat to help improve conditions in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta watershed. This agreement, referred to as the Healthy Rivers and Landscapes proposals, are the culmination of more than five years of collaboration among the California Natural Resources Agency, the California Environmental Protection Agency, public water agencies throughout California, and other stakeholders to develop a modern approach to protecting all beneficial uses of water in the Bay-Delta watershed.

Water suppliers acknowledge flows as an important component of habitat – and the Healthy Rivers and Landscapes proposal dedicates between 500,000 acre-feet and 700,000 acre-feet of water to the environment in many water years – but we need a new approach where every drop of water serves a specific and targeted beneficial use or multiple uses. The updated Delta water quality standards should protect all beneficial uses. The unimpaired flow (flow-only) approach that is also on the table, will not improve fish and wildlife and will not protect all beneficial uses, including water supplies for millions of Californians and hydroelectric power generation that is essential to California’s resilient energy grid.
<!-- Page 80 -->
![Healthy Rivers and Landscapes Proposal](https://example.com/image.png)

The Healthy Rivers and Landscapes proposal would check off substantial needs to advancing a comprehensive and integrated approach to updating the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan, including:

- Substantial dedication of water flows to the environment;
- Significantly reduced environmental effects throughout California;
- A comprehensive portfolio of actions designed to reactivate floodplains for robust populations of fish and wildlife;
- A commitment to over $2.5 billion in funding to support the proposals;
- Actions throughout the state designed to restore ecosystem function;
- Recognition of the important contribution that hydroelectric generation during the summer provides for California’s grid stability and reliability;
- Inclusive governance that will address changing climate conditions and support research to improve management actions;
- Commitment to collaborative and structured science programs; and
- Processes for resolving litigation and regulatory issues that have stifled implementing innovative water resources stewardship and management practices.

While there have been some notable successes, the various efforts to manage the Bay-Delta over the recent decades have not worked as planned overall, as both important species and water supply reliability have declined in the Bay-Delta and throughout the state. To change course and offer a different approach and trajectory, it is important to advance these innovations and agreements that will improve environmental conditions more quickly and holistically than traditional regulatory requirements, and will provide more certainty to communities, farms, and businesses.

California’s recent dry years have shown us how quickly we need to move and how much we can get done with mutual commitments to additional flows, accelerated habitat restoration, and learning together what works best – so that we can do more of it.

We encourage the State Water Board’s adoption of the Healthy Rivers and Landscapes proposals as the best alternative for meeting the objectives for the Delta Plan update and to fulfill the State Water Board’s obligation to reasonably balance the multitude of factors and considerations when updating the Delta Plan.

Sincerely,

CECILIA AGUIAR-CURRY

   GM Helliker introduced Prosio Communications to the committee members and they spoke briefly about their background and experience in the public sector. GM Helliker explained the scope of work that was included in the contract from July 2023. He informed the committee that the 2023 activities included producing the wholesale mailer and working on the Hinkle Project communications. He reported that the 2024 activities will include another wholesale mailer and a retail Customer Satisfaction Survey.  

   Director Costa pointed out that the District needs to get the message out and make sure that it is understood.
