![October 16, 2024, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=October+16%2C+2024%2C+Board+Minutes)

Vice President Costa voiced concern that Consent Calendar Item 3 had a large dollar amount that did not go to the Finance Committee for review. GM Helliker informed the Board that the item was reviewed by the Engineering Committee since it is an engineering project. Director Rich reported that the Engineering Committee addressed Vice President Costa’s concerns regarding the cost difference between the two bidders and the engineer’s estimate and recommended awarding the contract. Ms. Silva commented that she attended the Engineering Committee meeting and provided information on the budget.

Vice President Costa moved to approve Consent Calendar Items 3. Director Miller seconded the motion, and it carried unanimously.

IV. NEW BUSINESS

1. Hydropower Potential Update (W)  
Mr. Barela conducted a brief presentation which was provided in the Board packet. He reviewed the wholesale water system, what is needed for hydropower, and limitations on CTP generators. GM Helliker reiterated that Mr. Barela was showing the Board that there is no place in the gravity system where you can effectively install a hydropower system.

Mr. Barela informed the Board that, in 2012, SSWD conducted a study which concluded that it would take about 20 years to pay off the debt, and there were a few criteria needed in order to be successful.

Mr. Barela reported that he contacted SMUD and they are currently offering $0.074/kWh, as opposed to $0.10/kWh in 2010. In addition, he estimates that the cost to construct the system will be nearly double. GM Helliker explained that the system would need to be installed in a location that has or needs a pressure differential that can be isolated from the rest of the system, and the only location in the current system that meets that requirement is at the Antelope Pressure Reducing Station. Vice President Costa disagreed with staff’s analysis of the possibility to install a hydropower system and requested that the District keep looking at this project, possibly contracting with a consultant. Director Miller stated that there were two studies completed – one by SSWD and one by staff – and both indicate that it is not feasible to install a hydropower system; however, if the Board wants to revisit this in a few years, then they can make that directive. Mr. Barela informed the Board that the 2012 SSWD report was very clear that it doesn’t work; therefore, he did not perform a deep analysis of hydropower and instead evaluated our system, had conversations with the engineers who completed the 2012 report, discussed with SSWD what they saw as viable, and discussed with CHWD their consideration of hydropower to reduce pressure in their system. He stated that CHWD came to the same conclusion that it wasn’t cost effective.

Director Miller called for a point of order that it was time to move forward to the next agenda item. President Zamorano asked for clarification from Vice President Costa on his intent regarding this agenda topic. Vice President Costa stated that he will contact the consultant that he knows to discuss the topic.

2. Evaluation of Potential Groundwater Well Sites (W & R)  
Mr. Zlotnick provided a staff report which was included in the Board packet. He explained that the staff report contains detailed information regarding the Board’s desire to pursue a groundwater well. He stated that for the reasons stated in the report, staff does not feel that this is the time to pursue a District groundwater well, particularly with the ongoing discussions with SSWD regarding a merger. He explained that if a merger does occur then there would be plenty of wells available at that point and if a merger does not occur then there are still other options that make more sense regarding partnering. In addition, he informed that Board that SSWD is in the process of providing the District with a proposal regarding potential options and the financial arrangements that would be related to each of the options.

Mr. Zlotnick informed the Board that the cost to construct and maintain a District groundwater well does not pencil out and explained that this will be a long process. He stated that there are potential opportunities with SSWD, CHWD, FOWD and OVWD that could probably be completed faster than the schedule for pursuing our own well. He also stated that the report includes sources of revenue to fund a potential groundwater well.

The Board discussed grant funding that has been used for groundwater wells in the area. Mr. Zlotnick explained that there needs to be a project prior to applying for grant funding, and he spoke with The Ferguson Group regarding this type of funding which they stated could be done in a few years. The Board also discussed other agencies that are under construction and partnerships that are available. Mr. Zlotnick informed the Board that he will follow-up with The Ferguson Group regarding what funding is available, but his concern is that there is no identified project even for planning funds.

President Zamorano moved to contact The Ferguson Group to see what kind of planning money the District could get to start the plan.  
Director Rich moved to amend the motion to develop a project description in order to present for grant funding.  
[neither motion went to a vote]

Ms. Silva pointed out that the funding information and list of tasks are in the staff report. In response to President Zamorano’s question, Ms. Silva stated that there is no allocation in the budget for this, however, the Board could always do a budget amendment. She informed the Board that the Retail Financial Plan is being worked on and once a project is determined by the Board, then that could be incorporated into the plan. In addition, she explained that adding a non-budgeted item to the budget may result in a delay in another project or a rate increase for customers.

Director Miller stated that staff provided a plan, with off-ramps, and he suggested that the Board wait a few months until the consultant’s report is provided regarding the merger between the District and SSWD. GM Helliker reiterated staff’s recommendation to wait as suggested by Director Miller since there would be 75 wells available to the District after a merger, and in the meantime staff could continue working on and finalizing a partnership with SSWD and look at options to partner with OVWD, CHWD and/or FOWD, and if those options do not work then, and only then, the District could start the process to identify properties and look into a District-owned well. GM Helliker noted that
<!-- Page 8 -->
![October 16, 2024, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=October+16%2C+2024%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+5)

to obtain additional support funding, a property needs to be identified and test wells need to be drilled to determine the design. Mr. Zlotnick suggested that the Board identify the purpose and need for a District-owned well.

In response to President Zamorano’s comment about next steps, GM Helliker informed the Board the staff can identify what it would take to move forward with a $250,000 consultant contract provided there is Board direction to do so. Director Rich suggested that the projects run parallel since grant funding can take a long time to obtain. Mr. Zlotnick informed the Board that he will follow-up with the District’s advocate to obtain more specificity of what planning grants are available. Ms. Silva pointed out that, from a financial perspective, the Board wants the steps and timeline laid out in order to know how long this will take and which budgets will be affected. Mr. Zlotnick stated that completing a property survey does not mean that the District would necessarily go to the next step.

Director Rich commented that he feels that the Board’s frustration is due to not being able to rely on others to complete this to the best interest of the District. Vice President Costa suggested that the District not buy property but instead look into 10-year or other options on property to construct a test well. In response to Director Tobin’s comments on funding, Mr. Zlotnick informed the Board that his staff report covers the funding programs that Director Tobin mentions.

GM Helliker reiterated that staff proposed the steps that are laid out in the staff report and if the Board wants to go a different direction, then the first step would be to issue an RFP for real estate and hydrogeology once the budget is determined, and a Board motion would be required to proceed, which was not on the agenda tonight. President Zamorano requested that the November Board agenda include an action item for the Board to consider issuing an RFP. GM Helliker stated that staff will refine the consultant estimate with budget information and place the item on the November Board agenda. Director Tobin requested that staff also provide a detailed step list/plan – President Zamorano suggested that this wait until staff provides the information at the November Board meeting.

3. Proposition 4 (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed the staff report which was provided in the Board packet. The Board discussed the pros and cons of the proposition.

President Zamorano moved to support Proposition 4. Director Tobin seconded the motion, and it failed with 2 Aye votes and 3 No votes (Costa, Miller and Rich).

V. OLD BUSINESS

1. Low Income Rate Assistance Program (R)  
Ms. Silva reviewed the staff report which was provided in the Board packet. She explained that the San Juan Retail Service area has only one low-income census tract which is comprised of 5 homes. She estimates that 1% or fewer of the retail customers (approximately 110 customers) would participate in a Low Income Rate Assistance Program, which would equate to a rate increase of less than 1%.
<!-- Page 9 -->
![October 16, 2024, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=October+16,+2024,+Board+Minutes)

The Board discussed the program. Director Rich requested that staff track customer requests for assistance and report back to the Board every six months. Vice President Costa suggested that staff also research if the 1978 Property Tax revenue required specific use of funds.

2. FY 2024-25 Operations Plan Report Card (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed the 1st quarter progress on the FY 2024-25 Operations Plan Report Card. He reviewed a couple of upcoming items, noted a few delays in the plan which are shown in the report card, and reported that most items are on track.

3. Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)  
No report.

4. 2024 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed data which included the current reservoir storage levels across the state, data on releases, temperature and precipitation outlooks, and storage levels and projections at Folsom Reservoir.

VI. INFORMATION ITEMS

1. GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT

1.1 General Manager’s Monthly Report (W & R)  
GM Helliker provided the Board with a written report for September which was included in the Board packet.

1.2 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence  
GM Helliker reported that the Water Bank Program Committee met today and discussed the additional funds that RWA is requesting. He explained that two of the items be removed from the workplan; however, his request did not get accepted by the committee and will result in an additional $150,000 cost for the project. The fee to the District would be approximately $33,000. Unless the Board has any objections, he plans to have the District participate in the Phase 3 program.

GM Helliker reported that the Water Forum draft agreement is targeted to be completed in December. In addition, there will be negotiations regarding the allocation of extra fees due to the County of Sacramento reducing their contribution of $800,000 to the Water Forum.

GM Helliker informed the Board that he and Mr. Zlotnick participated in a discussion last Friday regarding the purveyor specific agreements. At that meeting, there was a presentation regarding the River Arc project and discussion about the water bank. With regard to the water bank presentation by RWA, GM Helliker had requested, prior to the meeting that a couple slides be removed regarding an environmental block of water since agencies cannot store water in Folsom Reservoir; however, the slides remained in the presentation and GM Helliker then had to explain the problems with this concept.

3. DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS’ REPORT  

3.1 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence  
Mr. Barela reported that the Board had previously approved staff to replace all the end-points on the meters with radio-read end-points. He explained that by doing this District staff can now drive through neighborhoods and collect data without having to physically touch each meter. He reported that this project is now complete, and the retail service area meters are now all radio-read meters, which will help the District transition to AMI or monthly billing in the future.  

Mr. Barela reported that the Lead and Copper Rule survey was completed. It was submitted and accepted by the State. He reported that there are no lead piping or fittings in the water system. He commended staff for their effort in completing these two projects.

![Investment Portfolio Chart](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Investment+Portfolio+Chart)

In the third quarter of 2024, the U.S. economy showed strong growth with low unemployment, high consumer spending, and progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. In response, the Fed cut interest rates for the first time in over four years and signaled more cuts to come through 2025. This means the yield in LAIF and CAMP will be falling over the next year. Therefore, staff locked in $10 million within the CAMP portfolio in a 4.66% fixed rate investment through July 2025.

The portfolio continues to perform well relative to the benchmark (Bank of America Merrill Lynch “BAML” 0-5 year Treasury Index) on an historical basis.

Staff requests a Board motion to approve BOD-2.5 Policy on Prevention of Discrimination, Harassment, Violence in the Workplace and Abusive Conduct. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Legal Affairs Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
San Juan currently has policies against discrimination, harassment, violence in the workplace and abusive behavior (the latter called “bullying”), but these policies reside in the Personnel Manual. Portions of that Manual are approved by the Board of Directors, such as the Chapter on Wages and Benefits and the Chapter on Employer-Employee Relations. Other Chapters are approved by the General Manager. The policies against discrimination, harassment, violence in the workplace and abusive behavior are in Chapter 1, which is approved by the General Manager.

The Board has adopted Policy BOD-2.3 Ethics Policy, which mainly addresses issues of fairness and honesty, such as political contributions, protection of confidential information, protection of whistleblowers and similar topics. There are brief sections on fair and equal treatment and on interactions with staff (Sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.9). However, those sections do not provide the necessary level of detail to adequately address the topics covered by this proposed policy. With the adoption of this proposed draft policy, those sections would be deleted from the Ethics Policy.

The adoption of this proposed policy would clearly articulate the District’s requirements concerning the prevention of discrimination, harassment, violence in the workplace and abusive behavior; the parties to which this policy applies; and the consequences of violation of these policies. Staff recommend that the Legal Affairs Committee request Board approval of this policy.

### BOD-2.5 Discrimination, Harassment, Violence and Abusive Conduct Prevention Policy

The purpose of this policy is to confirm the District’s commitment to provide a professional work environment free of unlawful discrimination, harassment, violence and abusive conduct, including conduct based on a protected characteristic, and an environment free from retaliation for participating in any protected activity covered by this policy. This policy applies to all persons involved in the functions of the District, including directors, supervisors, managers, employees, contractors, consultants, vendors, and other third parties.

#### 2.5.1 Policy
Discrimination, harassment, violence and/or abusive conduct in the workplace or in the course and scope of employment by any person in any form that is in violation of this policy is prohibited.

**Discrimination** is defined as the unequal treatment in any aspect of employment, based solely on or in part on a protected characteristic, including an employee or applicant’s perceived protected characteristic. Protected categories include: race, color, religion, religious creed, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, physical or mental disability, medical condition, protected medical leaves, genetic information, marital status, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions), gender, gender identity, gender expression, age (40 years and over), sexual orientation, veteran and/or military status, domestic violence victim status, political affiliation, and any other characteristic protected by state or federal anti-discrimination law covering employment. Discrimination includes unequal treatment based upon an association with a member of these protected classes.

Discrimination may include but is not necessarily limited to: hostile or demeaning behavior directed due to a protected characteristic; allowing the protected characteristic to be a factor in hiring, transferring, promoting, terminating, separating, compensating or other employment-related or working condition decisions unless otherwise permitted by applicable law, and providing unwarranted assistance or withholding work-related assistance, cooperation, and/or information to applicants or employees because of their protected characteristic.

**Harassment** is defined as unwelcome disrespectful or unprofessional conduct, including disrespectful or unprofessional conduct based on any of the protected characteristics listed above. Harassment can be verbal (such as slurs, jokes, insults, epithets, gestures, or teasing), visual (such as the posting or distribution of offensive posters, symbols, cartoons, drawings, computer displays, or emails), or physical conduct (such as physically threatening another person, blocking someone’s way, or making physical contact in an unwelcome manner).

Sexual harassment is discrimination based on sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation. It can include all of the actions described above as harassment, as well as other unwelcome sex-based conduct, such as unwelcome or unsolicited requests for sexual favors, conversations regarding sexual activities, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.

Sexual harassment is generally categorized into two types:

- **“Quid pro quo” (“this for that”)**: Occurs when an individual in a position of authority over another (for example, a manager or supervisor) directly or indirectly demands sexual favors from a subordinate in exchange for some benefit such as a promotion or pay increase, or to avoid an adverse employment action such as demotion or termination.

- **“Hostile Work Environment”**: Occurs when unwelcome conduct or comments based on sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation by any person in the workplace unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance and/or creates an intimidating, hostile, threatening or offensive working environment.

Sexual harassment can occur regardless of if the harasser and the victim are of different sexes or the same sex. Individuals of any gender can be the target of sexual harassment. Unlawful conduct does not need to be motivated by sexual desire, but can occur as a result of hostile acts toward an individual because of the individual’s gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation.

Examples of sexual harassment include but are not limited to: unwelcome sexual advances, flirtation, teasing, sexually suggestive or obscene pictures, letters, invitations, emails, voicemails, or gifts; sex, gender or sexual orientation-related comments, slurs, jokes, remarks or epithets; leering, obscene or vulgar gestures; displaying or distributing sexually suggestive or derogatory objects, pictures, cartoons, or posters; impeding or blocking movement, touching or assaulting others; reprisals or threats after a negative response to sexual advances; and conduct or comments consistently targeted at one gender, even if the content is not sexual.

**Violence in the Workplace**, including acts or threats of physical violence, which also include intimidation, harassment, and/or coercion which involve or affect the District, which occur on District property, or occur during the performance of District business will not be tolerated.

Threats of violence include conduct against persons or property that is severe, offensive or intimidating or create a hostile, abusive, or intimidating work environment for one or more District employee. Such behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Threats of violence occurring on District property, regardless of the relationship of the individuals involved in the threat.

- Threats or acts of violence not occurring on District property but involving someone who is representing the District.
<!-- Page 22 -->
- Threats or acts of violence not occurring on District property involving a District employee if the threats or acts of violence affect the interests of District.
  
- Any threats or acts resulting in the conviction of an employee or agent of District, or of an individual performing services on District’s behalf on a contract or temporary basis, under any criminal code relating to threats or acts of violence that adversely affect the legitimate interests and goals of the District.

Specific examples of behavior that may be considered a threat or act of violence include, but are not limited to:

- Hitting or shoving an individual.

- Threatening to harm an individual or their family, friends, associates, or their property.

- The intentional destruction or threat of destruction of property owned, operated or controlled by the District.

- Making harassing or threatening telephone calls, sending harassing or threatening letters or other forms of written or electronic communication.

- Intimidating or attempting to coerce an employee to do wrongful acts that would affect the interests of the District or its members.

- Harassing surveillance, also known as “stalking”, the willful, malicious and repeated following of another person and making credible threats with the intent to place the other person in reasonable fear for their safety.

- Making a suggestion or otherwise intimidating comment regarding the injuring of persons or property.

- Carrying weapons either on their person or in their vehicle while performing District business.

**Abusive Conduct** is defined as conduct of any individual in the workplace, with malice, that a reasonable person would find hostile, offensive, and unrelated to the District’s legitimate business interests.

The District considers the following types of behavior examples of abusive conduct:

- **Verbal Abuse:** Slandering, ridiculing or maligning a person or their family; persistent name calling that is hurtful, insulting or humiliating; using a person as the focus of jokes; abusive and offensive remarks.

- **Physical Abuse:** Pushing, shoving, kicking, poking, tripping, assault or threat of physical assault; damage to a person’s work area or property.

- **Non-Physical Abuse:** Nonverbal threatening gestures or glances that convey threatening messages.

- **Exclusion:** Socially or physically excluding or disregarding a person in work-related activities.

- **Work interference or sabotage that prevents work from getting done.**

BOD-2.5 Discrimination, Harassment, Violence and Abusive Conduct Prevention Policy  
Page 3
<!-- Page 23 -->
The District encourages all employees to immediately report any incidents of discrimination, harassment, violence and/or abusive conduct so that complaints can be addressed timely. The District will promptly and thoroughly investigate any complaint of discrimination, harassment, violence or abusive conduct of any type and will take whatever corrective and preventative action is deemed necessary, including disciplining or terminating any individual who is found to have violated this policy. All complaints and investigations will be designated as confidential to the extent possible and permitted by law. However, complete confidentiality of an investigation cannot be guaranteed when it interferes with the District’s ability to fulfill its obligations under this policy or the law.

If an employee chooses, they may file a complaint with the State of California Civil Rights Department (CRD) and/or with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). These agencies are charged with the responsibility of accepting and reviewing all complaints.

The District will not retaliate against an employee for reporting an allegation of discrimination or harassment, and it will not tolerate or permit retaliation by other employees against the reporting employee or any employees participating in the investigation of a discrimination, harassment, violence or abusive conduct complaint. Any employee who believes they have been retaliated against because of a claim of discrimination or harassment, violence, abusive conduct or from participation in an investigation, may file a claim of retaliation with the District, the CRD and/or the EEOC.

**Section**: BOD-2 Board of Directors  
**Policy**: BOD-2.3 Ethics Policy  
**Approval Date**: 10/23/03  
**Latest Revision**: 09/28/22  

# BOD-2.3 Ethics Policy

The policy of the District is to maintain the highest standards of ethics from its Board members and its employees. The proper operation of the District requires decisions and policy to be made in the proper channels of governmental structure, that public office not be used for personal gain, and that all individuals associated with the District remain impartial and responsible towards the public. Accordingly, it is the policy of the District that Board members and District employees will maintain the highest standard of personal honesty and fairness in carrying out their duties. This policy sets forth the minimal ethical standards to be followed by the Board of Directors. The ethics policy for District employees is set forth in the District’s Personnel Manual.

## 2.3.1 Responsibility of Holding Public Office

Board members are obligated to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California. Board members will comply with applicable laws regulating their conduct, including conflict of interest and financial disclosure laws. Board members will work in cooperation, to the best interest of the District, with other public officials unless prohibited from so doing by law or officially-recognized confidentiality of their work.

## 2.3.2 Fair and Equal Treatment

Board members will not, in the performance of their official functions, discriminate against any person on the basis of race, religion, color, creed, age, marital status, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual preference, medical condition or disability. A Board member will not grant any special consideration, treatment or advantage to any person or group beyond that which is available to every other person or group in similar circumstances.

## 2.3.3 Proper Use and Safeguarding of District Property and Resources

Except as specifically authorized, a Board member will not use or permit the use of District-owned vehicles, equipment, telephones, materials or property for personal convenience or profit. A Board member will not ask or require a District employee to perform services for the personal convenience or profit of a Board member or employee. Each Board member must protect and properly use any District asset within his or her control, including information recorded on paper or in electronic form. The Board has adopted policies requiring that written records, including expense accounts, be kept in sufficient detail to reflect accurately and completely all transactions and expenditures made on the District's behalf, in accordance with the District’s policy for reimbursement of expenses of Board members.

<!-- Page 25 -->
![BOD-2.3 Ethics Policy](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=BOD-2.3+Ethics+Policy)

## 2.3.43 Use of Confidential Information
A Director is not authorized, without approval of the Board of Directors, to disclose information that qualifies as confidential information under applicable provisions of law to a person not authorized to receive it, that (1) has been received for, or during, a closed session meeting of the Board, or (2) is protected from disclosure under the attorney/client or other evidentiary privilege.

This section does not prohibit any of the following: (1) making a confidential inquiry or complaint to a district attorney or grand jury concerning a perceived violation of law, including disclosing facts to a district attorney or grand jury that are necessary to establish the alleged illegality of an action taken by the District, (2) expressing an opinion concerning the propriety or legality of actions taken by the District in closed session, including disclosure of the nature and extent of the allegedly illegal action, or (3) disclosing information acquired by being present in a closed session that is not confidential information. Prior to disclosing confidential information pursuant to (1) or (2), above, however, a Board member will first bring the matter to the attention of either the President of the Board or the full Board, to provide the Board an opportunity to cure an alleged violation.

A Director who willfully and knowingly discloses for pecuniary gain confidential information received by him or her in the course of his or her official duties may be guilty of a misdemeanor under Government Code section 1098.

## 2.3.54 Soliciting Political Contributions
Board members are prohibited from soliciting political funds or contributions at District facilities. A Board member will not accept, solicit or direct a political contribution from any person or entity who has a financial interest in a contract or other matter while that contract or other matter is existing or pending before the District. A Director will not use the District’s seal, trademark, stationary or other indicia of the District’s identity, or facsimile thereof, in any solicitation for political contributions contrary to state or federal law.

## 2.3.65 Revolving Door
For a period of one year after leaving office, Directors will not represent for compensation nongovernmental entities before the District with regard to any issues over which the Board of Directors of which that person was a member had decision-making authority during the three years prior to leaving office.

For purposes of this section, “represent” will mean for compensation to actively support or oppose a particular decision in a proceeding by lobbying in person the officers or employees of the District or otherwise acting to influence the officers of the District.

These restrictions will not apply to representation of not-for-profit charitable entities before the District.

These restrictions may be waived in specific cases by a two-thirds vote of the District’s Board of Directors.

Nothing in this section is intended or will be applied to prevent a former Director from participating in meetings of the Board in the same manner as other members of the public.

## 2.3.76 Improper Activities and the Protection of “Whistle Blowers”

The General Manager has primary responsibility for (1) ensuring compliance with the District’s Personnel Manual, and ensuring that District employees do not engage in improper activities, (2) investigating allegations of improper activities, and (3) taking appropriate corrective and disciplinary actions. The General Manager is obligated to operate the District according to law and the policies approved by the Board. Board members are encouraged to disclose to the General Manager to the extent not expressly prohibited by law, improper activities within their knowledge. Board members will not interfere with the General Manager’s responsibilities in identifying, investigating and correcting improper activities, unless the Board determines that the General Manager is not properly carrying out these responsibilities. Nothing in this section affects the responsibility of the Board to oversee the performance of the General Manager.

A Board member will not directly or indirectly use or attempt to use the authority or influence of his or her position for the purpose of intimidating, threatening, coercing, commanding or influencing any other person for the purpose of preventing such person from acting in good faith to report or otherwise bring to the attention of the General Manager or the Board any information that, if true, would constitute a work-related violation by a Board member or District employee of any law or regulation, gross waste of District funds, gross abuse of authority, a specified and substantial danger to public health or safety due to an act or omission of a District official or employee, use of a District office or position or District resources for personal gain, or a conflict of interest of a District Board member or District employee.

A Board member will not use or threaten to use any official authority or influence to effect any action as a reprisal against a District Board member or District employee who reports or otherwise brings to the attention of the General Manager any information regarding the subjects described in this section.

Any person who believes that he or she has been subjected to any action prohibited by this section may file a confidential complaint with (1) the General Manager, or (2) a member of the Board of Directors if the complaint involves the conduct of the General Manager, who will thereupon refer the matter to the full Board to investigate the complaint. Upon the conclusion of the investigation, the General Manager (or the Board in the case of a complaint against the General Manager) will take appropriate action consistent with the District’s Personnel Manual and applicable law.

A perceived violation of this policy by a Board member should be referred to the President of the Board or the full Board of Directors for investigation, and consideration of any appropriate action warranted. A violation of this policy may be addressed by the use of such remedies as are available by law to the District, including but not limited to: (a) adoption of a resolution expressing disapproval of the conduct of the Board member who has violated this policy, (b) injunctive relief, or (c) referral of the violation to the District Attorney and/or the grand jury.

## 2.3.87 Values

Respect for each Board member’s interpersonal style will be a standard of operation. Courtesy and respect for individual points of view will be practiced at all times. All Board members shall respect each other’s right to disagree. All Board members shall practice a high degree of decorum and courtesy. When addressing the public in any way, all Board members shall make certain their opinions are expressed solely as their own, and do not in any way necessarily reflect the opinions of any other Board member or the District.
<!-- Page 27 -->
![Interaction of the Board with Staff](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Interaction+of+the+Board+with+Staff)

## 2.3.9 Interaction of the Board with Staff

## STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** November 20, 2024  
**Subject:** SJWD ADM-3.6 Records Management Policy Revisions (W & R)

---

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Staff requests a Board motion to adopt Resolution 24-08 revising Board Policy Adm-3.6 Records Management Policy. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Legal Affairs Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.

### BACKGROUND
The SJWD Records Management Policy was created to establish and describe the Records Management Policy (Policy) of the San Juan Water District (District). The Policy establishes the guidelines and procedures, under which District staff will retain, organize, purge, and destroy District records maintained by all departments. In addition, this Policy contains the District's Records Retention Schedule (Schedule) and provides references to the applicable state and federal statutes that regulate public records retention. The Policy was last updated on August 19, 2020.

### CURRENT STATUS
Review of the Policy and Schedule began in October of 2023, to bring the documents into compliance with the latest regulatory and statutory requirements. Both the Policy and the Schedule were significantly revised, as a result of the extensive analysis and deliberation that every Department in the District devoted to this project. This work has included ensuring that all District records are covered by the Schedule and that the appropriate retention period per specific sections of the Government Code or other applicable law was defined in the Schedule. Legal Counsel has reviewed the Policy revisions and the Schedule.

Since the revision to the Schedule was quite extensive, a clean version of the Schedule will be attached separately from the red-line version of the Policy and, once approved by the Board, will be incorporated into the Policy.

### Attachments:

Any record of the District that is the subject of a pending request made under the California Public Records Act, Government Code sections 6250 through 6276.48, until the District has either (a) complied with the request or (b) withheld the record and provided written notice to the requestor denying the request;
2. Documents related to public works not accepted by the District or to which a stop notice claim may be legally presented;
3. Documents related to any non-discharged District debt; and
4. Any document that has not yet fulfilled the administrative, fiscal, or legal purpose for which it was created or received by the District.
5. Documents related to a Natural Disaster or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) claim.

## 3.6.5.2 
The District may dispose of the following records at any time, without maintaining a copy:

1. Duplicates, the original or a permanent photographic record of which is on file;
2. Rough drafts, working papers and audio recordings prepared or kept by any employee or accumulated in the preparation of a communication, study or report of the document, including but not limited to meter books after the contents thereof have been transferred to other records;
3. Cards, listings, non-permanent indices, other papers used for controlling work and transitory files including letters of transmittal, suspense letters, and tracer letters;
4. Canceled coupon sheets from registered bonds; and
5. Telephone messages and inter-departmental notes.

# 3.6.6 Public Record Requests
A person or entity may obtain copies of public records of the District, preferably via written request, though verbal requests may be acceptable. The District reserves the right to require a written request. Public records of the District are open to inspection during regular business hours and every person has a right to inspect these records. Officers, agents and employees of the District are not required to request records in compliance with this section when acting within the course and scope of employment or office holding.

Copies of requested public records will be provided by the District within ten days or the District will notify the requestor within ten days when the requested public records will be provided. Pursuant to Government Code section 7922.535 (a), within 10 days of receipt of the request, the District will determine whether the request, in whole or in part, seeks copies of disclosable public records in the possession of the District and shall promptly notify the person making the request of the determination and the reasons therefor. If the agency determines that the request seeks disclosable public records, the agency shall also state the estimated date and time when the records will be made available. However, if additional time is needed to
<!-- Page 34 -->
![Page 5 of ADM-3.6 Records Management Policy](https://example.com/image-link)

determine if the District has disclosable records, then Government Code section 7922.535 (b)(c) should be referenced.

Pursuant to Government Code section 7922.530 (a), except with respect to public records exempt from disclosure by express provisions of law, the District will provide the requestor with exact copies of all requested public records unless impracticable to do so. If unless a record is in electronic form or in a specialized format, in which case then the District will provide the most accurate copy possible within the limits of available technology and the requestor’s instructions and agreement to pay the legally chargeable costs to retrieve and reproduce copies of such non-standard records. The requestor will be informed of the copying costs and payment must be received prior to copying the records.

Certain public records are exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act (Government Codes sections 7922.5256250-6276.48). The District will justify withholding a record by demonstrating that it is exempt under the express provisions of Government Code section 7922.7065254 or by demonstrating in accordance with Government Code section 6255 7922.000 that the public interest served by not making the record available clearly outweighs the public interest served by disclosing the record. The District will provide a requestor with written notice of an intent to withhold a record stating the reasons for the withholding within ten days of the request for inspection as required by Government Code sections 7922.5406253, subdivision (a) and 6255, subdivision (b).

3.6.6.1 Copy Charge  
The District may charge a per page fee to copy a record, in an amount specified on the District’s current Schedule of Rates, Fees, Charges and Deposits. If the request includes public records created in an electronic format, the District may charge the costs of producing such records in accordance with Government Code section 6253.97922.575. No charge will be imposed for staff time to locate recordsresearch. The District reserves the right to have copies of specialized, oversized and color records printed by an outside copy service and to charge the requestor the actual costs for such outside copy services. The District also reserves the right to require a requestor to deposit the estimated amount of copying fees and any costs for mailing before copying and delivering requested records.

3.6.6.2 Request List  
The District will maintain a log of Public Record Act requests for inspection that are denied and the reasons for the denial.

3.6.7 Public Counter Records  
3.6.7.1 Except for writings exempt from public disclosure, the District Board Secretary will maintain a duplicate copy of the last approved Board meeting minutes and the agenda and written materials distributed to the Board for discussion or consideration at the next scheduled Board meeting. These records will be maintained at the public counter located in the District’s administrative office. Public records discussed during a public meeting but not previously available will be made available before the commencement of discussion at such meeting or as soon thereafter as practicable. In accordance with

ADM-3.6 Records Management Policy Page 5
<!-- Page 35 -->
![Image](https://www.sjwd.org)

Government Code section 54957.5, the agenda and Board meeting packet for an open session of a regular meeting shall be made available for public inspection.

3.6.7.2 No charge will be imposed for the use or review of the records described in this section. The District will, however, impose a copy charge if a copy of a public counter record is requested.

3.6.7.3 The District shall also post on its website copies of all public counter records, archived Board meeting minutes and agendas, current Board policies, and other important District documents. Requestors are encouraged to view and obtain copies of available documents on the District’s website by visiting: www.sjwd.org

The District currently has 5 Water Treatment Plant Operators and one Chief Operator who collectively are responsible for the non-stop operation of the plant. The operators work various schedules to provide continuous operations.  

The Chief Operator works Monday through Friday from 6:30 am to 3:00 pm. The two “day operators” work four 10-hour days, one from Monday through Thursday and the other Tuesday through Friday, both work from 6:00 am to 4:30 pm on their respective days. For these three positions, the schedule is fixed, it does not shift from week to week, similar to the other employees of the District.  

The other three operators, referred to as “shift operators,” are generally the most senior operators and work a staggered, revolving schedule, generally two days on, four days off. A “shift” begins at 6:45 in the morning and ends at 7:15 in the morning, two days later. After everyone else leaves for the day, the shift operator remains onsite alone and ensures the safe and continuous operation of the plant until the rest of the crew returns the next morning.  

There is a dormitory at the treatment plant where, barring alarm interruptions, they are allowed to sleep 8 hours per night, from 9:00 pm to 5:00 am. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) allows for their sleep shift to be unpaid, so long as they have sleeping quarters and can usually enjoy an uninterrupted night’s sleep; however, for this to be legal, the employees must agree to the unpaid sleep shift. Because of their unique schedule, and to document their agreement of the unpaid sleep shift, the operators have worked under the terms of a special Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for well over 20 years. This MOU has served as their agreement to the unpaid sleep shift and has covered situations that are unique to the shift operators such as sleep shift interruption pay, holiday pay, extra shifts, mealtimes, etc.

**Water Treatment Plant Operators Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)**  
p. 2  
November 20, 2024  

After attending multiple CalPERS conferences, researching the law and consulting with legal counsel, we have learned that their pensions are at risk because the MOU is not in compliance with the law, specifically California Code of Regulations (CCR) Section 571 – Definition of Special Compensation. CCR 571(a) lists items that are considered special compensation. For the shift operators, this includes their holiday pay and any overtime they incur as part of their regular schedule. CCR 571(b) states that for these elements of their pay to be pensionable, they must:

- be contained in a written labor policy or agreement that has been duly approved and adopted by the employer’s governing body.
- The MOU must indicate the conditions for payment of the item of special compensation.
- The MOU cannot reference another document in lieu of disclosing the item of special compensation.

Without Board approval, the shift operators will not be entitled to a pension that is based on the compensation they receive for working their assigned normal work schedule under the terms of the MOU that has governed their employment for the past 20 years.

**ANALYSIS**

The MOU, as presented for your approval, does not make substantive changes to the current working hours, holidays, pay, or benefits of the operators. However, there are two changes that should be pointed out.

First, the shift operators’ work week is currently different than that of the rest of the District. Because of this difference, they are not able to use the District’s electronic timesheet system. They complete manual timesheets, which Finance/HR must manually enter in the payroll system. The shift operators have agreed to change their work week from Saturday 3:00 pm through Saturday 2:59 pm to Saturday 12:00 am through Friday 11:59 pm so that they can be in alignment with the rest of the District and utilize the electronic timesheet system. This increases the efficiency of payroll processing.

Second, the MOU has been edited to reflect a change in their work schedule that was implemented during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, they worked one 24-hour day on, and two off. Because of the OSHA mandated cleaning protocols, and to limit employee’s exposure to one another, their schedule was changed to two days on-four days off. The shift operators enjoy this schedule and there are no adverse impacts to the District; therefore, to make it permanent, it needs to be reflected in the MOU.

Because there is already an MOU for the operators, it seems prudent to ensure that all items pertaining to FLSA and pensionable compensation be contained in the MOU and that it be Board approved. Therefore, while nothing substantive has changed, a lot of text has been added to the MOU to ensure compliance with CCR 571 and to protect the pension benefits of the shift operators. The list of District holidays and the description of the uniform allowance have both been added to the MOU, from the existing Personnel.

Manual to satisfy this requirement. Other changes have been made to improve readability and increase clarity.

The fiscal impact of implementing the approved MOU will be approximately $7,500 per year, an amount that can easily be absorbed by the wholesale operating budget.

If approved by the Board, staff will be sending the MOU to the CalPERS Special Compensation unit for review. It can take three to six months for them to initiate and complete their review. If there are substantive issues with the MOU, staff will return to the Board with recommended edits. Additionally, both the shift operators and the day operators would like to further discuss and analyze the unpaid sleep shift. Any recommended changes to the sleep shift compensation, or lack thereof, will be brought to the Board for consideration.

## MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING  

**TO:** Water Treatment Plant Operators  
**SUBJECT:** Work Shift Requirements  
**EFFECTIVE:** July 1, 2024  

---

### GENERAL:  
Water treatment plant operators may regularly, periodically, or on a temporary or substitution basis be assigned to work 48.5-hour shifts at the WTP, or a portion thereof when substituting. When working all or a portion of the 48.5-hour shift, the operator is referred to as a Shift Operator with specific work shift requirements and hourly wage compensation considerations as defined below.  

### WORK SHIFT:  

- **Work Period** - The defined workweek for Shift Operators is Saturday 12:00 a.m. through Friday 11:59 pm. Shift Operators are required to work a shift that starts at 6:45 a.m. and finishes at 7:15 a.m. two days later. A shift consists of the following segments, resulting in 32.50 paid hours.  
  - 6:45 am to 9:00 pm 14.25 hours  
  - 9:00 pm to 5:00 am Unpaid Sleep Shift  
  - 5:00 am to 9:00 pm 16 hours  
  - 9:00 pm to 5:00 am Unpaid Sleep Shift  
  - 5:00 am to 7:15 am 2.25 hours  

- **Sleep Shift** - During each work shift, it is intended the Shift Operator shall have two eight (8) hour periods designated as sleep time. Except as provided herein, this sleep shift shall be uncompensated and not considered as "time worked".  
  - **Interrupted Sleep Shift**  
    - When sleep periods are interrupted, the Shift Operator shall be entitled to a minimum of two (2) hours pay, regardless of if the hours actually worked are less than two (2) hours. Time worked beyond the initial two hours shall be paid per actual time worked.  
    - Multiple interruptions within a 2-hour window of initial interruption shall not entitle the Shift Operator to more than two (2) hours compensation, unless the actual time worked exceeds two (2) hours, provided, however, that if the minimum consecutive hours of sleep required under U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) regulations is not met, then the entire eight-hour period shall be counted as hours worked.

Shift Operator MOU  
<!-- Page 85 -->
- There will never be more than one 2-hour minimum call out pay in a 4-hour period. Whenever a Shift Operator receives more than one wake-up call within the time periods discussed above, the employee will be compensated based on actual hours worked beyond the first wake-up period.

- All hours worked due to work-related interrupted sleep shall be paid at the Shift Operator's straight time rate of pay unless the hours worked qualify as Overtime as defined below.

- Each Shift Operator shall make daily written reports of periods when their sleep shifts are interrupted by emergencies or other work requirements. The daily reports shall be provided to the Shift Operator's supervisor at the end of each work shift.

- If, due to interrupted sleep shifts or work scheduled outside of their normal shift, a Shift Operator is unable to obtain generally 6 to 8 hours of sleep, the Chief Operator or Water Treatment Plant Manager, can send the employee home or to the dormitory to rest before commencing their next shift. In such situations, the Chief Operator or Treatment Plant Manager should generally strive to ensure their employees have the opportunity to receive a combined total of 8 hours of sleep between regularly scheduled shifts and are adequately rested before returning to duty. Required rest periods will be considered time worked for overtime and regular pay purposes.

• Overtime -
  - A Shift Operator’s regularly scheduled work hours may include overtime. Any time worked beyond forty (40) hours in a defined calendar work week, or as defined below under Extra Shifts Worked, is considered overtime and will be compensated at 1½ times the Shift Operator’s regular rate of pay.
  
  - Paid leaves and Holiday Pay are considered time worked for purposes of determining overtime hours. Minimum time for sleep shift interruption is considered time worked for purposes of calculating overtime, even if the full two hours was not actually worked.

• Extra Shifts Worked -
  - If a Shift Operator is required to cover all or a portion of an additional shift that results in the number of worked hours within a pay period being greater than originally scheduled, the operator will be compensated at 1½ times the regular rate of pay for the additional shift and extra time worked when sleep periods are interrupted. The compensation for the additional shift shall not be less than 4 hours and the four hours will be considered time worked for purposes of calculating overtime, even if the whole 4 hours were not worked. The coverage of an additional shift usually occurs when the regularly scheduled Shift Operator is on vacation or sick leave.

- compensated for their actual time worked, but not less than 2 hours, in accordance with the FLSA.

- **Partial Shifts Worked** - If an operator is unable to work his or her full 48.5-hour shift, they will be compensated for the portion they were able to work in accordance with the “Work Period” schedule described above. The operator picking up the partial shift will be compensated for the portion of the shift they worked, also in accordance with the “Work Period” schedule described above.

- **Mealtimes** - During each work shift, Shift Operators shall be entitled to meal periods as follows: thirty (30) minutes for breakfast, thirty (30) minutes for lunch and one hour for dinner. Each such period shall be compensated for and be counted as "hours worked" for the purpose of calculating pay and overtime pay. Shift Operators are obligated to respond to work situations during meal periods without additional compensation.

- **On-Site Limitations** - Shift Operators shall not leave the Water Treatment Plant premises during their work shift without approval from their supervisor or manager. If there is an emergency which requires a Shift Operator to leave the Water Treatment Plant gate, the Shift Operator will contact his or her supervisor immediately to inform them of the emergency and the actions taken. See the Water Treatment Department's emergency response procedures for additional requirements for emergency actions.

**HOLIDAYS:**
- Shift Operators are entitled to thirteen (13), eight (8) hour holidays (104 hours total) per year, which includes a floating holiday, as follows:

  | Holiday                     | Date                        |
  |-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
  | New Year’s Day              | January 1st                 |
  | Martin Luther King Day      | Third Monday in January      |
  | President’s Day             | Third Monday in February     |
  | Memorial Day                | Last Monday in May           |
  | Juneteenth                  | June 19th                   |

  | Labor Day                   | First Monday in September    |
  | Indigenous Peoples Day      | Second Monday in October      |
  | Veterans Day                | November 11th                |
  | Thanksgiving                | Fourth Thursday and Friday in November |
  | Christmas                   | December 25th                |
  | Floating Holiday            | As designated by each employee |

- Holiday Pay will be reported to CalPERS as Special Compensation under the following terms and conditions:
  - Holidays which fall on a work shift: Shift Operator is compensated by receiving pay at 1½ times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked plus eight (8) holiday hours.
  - Holidays which fall on a normal day off: The Shift Operator will be compensated for eight (8) hours Holiday Pay.
  - Holiday Pay is considered time worked. Therefore, Holiday Pay may be paid at either the straight time rate of pay, or the OT rate of pay in the same pay period in which the holiday falls, depending upon where it falls in the workweek. For example, if Holiday Pay is earned in workweek before the Shift Operator has worked more than 40 hours, including the holiday hours, then the holiday will be paid at the Operator's straight rate of pay. Any portion of Holiday Pay earned after the Operator has worked 40 hours in a work week will be compensated at the OT rate of pay.
  - If a Shift Operator chooses, and the supervisor approves, the Shift Operator may choose to instead create a Holiday Pay bank for up to 32 hours for future time off. The bank may not be replenished in the same fiscal year as it is used. The Shift Operator understands he or she is choosing this option in place of the above standard procedure and understands that this option could impact annual pay, including a possible reduction in total annual pay, as the Shift Operator could ultimately work and receive pay for less hours in a year. This option will only be considered if requested in writing by the Shift Operator prior to the pay period in which the holiday occurs. Unused saved holiday time shall automatically be paid to the employee at the straight time rate of pay at the end of the fiscal year. No saved holiday time will be allowed to carry over beyond the last day of the fiscal year.
  - Up to 16 hours of floating holiday may be carried over to the next fiscal year or be paid out at the end of the fiscal year at the Operator's straight time rate of pay. The pensionable portion will be reported at the straight rate of pay in effect when earned, not paid.

UNIFORM ALLOWANCE:
Water Treatment Plant Operators are required to wear District uniforms. Uniforms will be issued on an “as needed” basis during each fiscal year, not to exceed an annual value of $1,000. The value of the uniforms provided is reported to CalPERS as compensation subject to retirement contributions for employees in classic retirement tiers (not PEPRA). The General Manager has the authority to set or change uniform requirements including brand, quantity, and clothing type for each employee as long as

the total annual value per employee does not exceed $1,000 (excluding safety items).

Water Treatment Plant Operators are required to maintain their uniforms in clean and good condition. Old uniforms are to be turned into the Purchasing Agent before issuance of new uniforms (except pants) and upon separation of employment with the District. Water Treatment Plant Operators will generally be provided with:

- Choice of five shirts: Safety green/yellow, orange and/or navy blue t-shirt with breast pocket, or polo style shirt as provided by the Purchasing Agent.
- Up to five pair of pants (any combination) such as denim jeans, Dockers or Carhartt, or other appropriate/durable work pants. Purchase of replacement pants may be made by the Water Treatment Plant Operator either with District CalCard or on a reimbursement basis, but advance approval from supervisor/Department Manager is required. Pant color subject to Department Manager approval. No exchanges for upgrades in style will be allowed.

I have read and understand the above terms, have had the opportunity to clarify any terms that I did not understand, and voluntarily sign below to signify my acceptance of the terms of this MOU. I understand that this MOU will be open for review at least once every three years.

Page 3 of 3  
S:\Human Resources\Payroll Process\WTP Operator MOU 2017-05  
Shift Operators MOU
<!-- Page 90 -->
![Shift Operators MOU](https://example.com/image.png)

Whenever a Shift Operator receives more than one wake-up call within the time periods discussed above, the employee will be compensated based on actual hours worked beyond the first wake-up period.

- All hours worked due to work-related interrupted sleep shall be paid at the Shift Operator's straight time rate of pay unless the hours worked qualify as Overtime as defined below.

- Each Shift Operator shall make daily written reports of periods when their sleep shifts are interrupted by emergencies or other work requirements. The daily reports shall be provided to the Shift Operator's supervisor at the end of each work shift.

- If, due to interrupted sleep shifts or work scheduled outside of their normal shift, a Shift Operator is unable to obtain generally 6 to 8 hours of sleep, the Chief Operator or Water Treatment Plant Manager can send the employee home or to the dormitory to rest before commencing their next shift. In such situations, the Chief Operator or Treatment Plant Manager should generally strive to ensure their employees have the opportunity to receive a combined total of 8 hours of sleep between regularly scheduled shifts and are adequately rested before returning to duty. Required rest periods will be considered time worked for overtime and regular pay purposes.

### Overtime

- A Shift Operator’s regularly scheduled work week may include overtime. Any time worked beyond forty (40) hours in a defined calendar work week, or as defined below under Extra Shifts Worked, is considered overtime and will be compensated at 1½ times the Shift Operator's straight time regular rate of pay.

- Paid leave and Holiday Pay are considered time worked for purposes of determining overtime hours. Minimum time for sleep shift interruption is considered time worked for purposes of calculating overtime, even if the full two hours was not actually worked.

### Extra Shifts Worked

- If a Shift Operator is working two shifts in a row and did not obtain the minimum amount of sleep required under FLSA regulations during the first shift completed, whether the Shift Operator is fatigued and should be sent home will be determined by the supervisor in consultation with the Shift Operator. Should the Shift Operator be determined to be fatigued, the appropriate rest period spent at home is uncompensated and not considered time worked.

- If a Shift Operator is required to cover all or a portion of an additional shift that results in the number of worked shifts hours within a pay period being greater than originally scheduled, the operator will be compensated at 1½ times the straight time rate of pay for the 16.25 hours of the additional shift and extra time worked when sleep periods are interrupted. The compensation for the additional shift shall not be less than 4 hours and the four hours will be considered time worked for purposes of calculating overtime, even if the whole 4 hours were not worked. The coverage of an additional shift usually occurs when the regularly scheduled Shift Operator is on vacation or sick leave.

- Shift Operators called into work during their normally scheduled time off to cover a partial shift due to an emergency or illness requiring the regularly scheduled Shift Operator to leave the treatment plant, shall be compensated for actual time worked, except that compensation for the additional shift shall not be less than 4 hours. 

If a Shift Operator gets called into work during their normally scheduled time off for...

- Partial Shifts Worked - If an operator is unable to work his or her full 48.5 hour shift, they will be compensated for the portion they were able to work in accordance with the “Work Period” schedule described above. The operator picking up the partial shift will be compensated for the portion of the shift they worked, also in accordance with the “Work Period” schedule described above.
  
- Meal Times - During each work shift, Shift Operators shall be entitled to meal periods as follows: thirty (30) minutes for breakfast, thirty (30) minutes for lunch and one hour for dinner. Each such period shall be compensated and be counted as "hours worked" for purposes of calculating pay and overtime pay. Shift Operators are obligated to respond to work situations during meal periods without additional compensation.

- On-Site Limitations - Shift Operators shall not leave the Water Treatment Plant premises during their work shift without approval from their supervisor or manager. If there is an emergency which requires a Shift Operator to leave the Water Treatment Plant gate, the Shift Operator will contact his or her supervisor immediately to inform them of the emergency and the actions taken. See the Water Treatment Department's emergency response procedures for additional requirements for emergency actions.

  - Holidays which fall on a normal day off.
<!-- Page 92 -->
- The Shift Operator will be compensated for eight (8) hours holiday pay, at the Shift Operator's.

Holiday pay is considered time worked. Therefore, Holiday Pay may be paid at either the straight time rate of pay, or the OT rate of pay in the same pay period in which the holiday falls, depending upon where it falls in the workweek. For example, if holiday pay is earned in a workweek before the Shift Operator has worked more than 40 hours, including the holiday hours, then the holiday will be paid at the Operator's straight rate of pay. Any portion of holiday pay earned after the Operator has worked 40 hours in a work week will be compensated at the OT rate of pay.

- If a Shift Operator chooses, and the supervisor approves, the Shift Operator may choose to instead save-create a holiday pay bank for up to 32 hours for future time off. The bank may not be replenished in the same fiscal year as it is used. The Shift Operator understands he or she is choosing this option in place of the above standard procedure and understands that this option could impact annual pay, including a possible reduction to total annual pay, as the Shift Operator could ultimately work and receive pay for less hours in a year. This option will only be considered if requested in writing by the Shift Operator prior to the pay period in which the holiday occurs. Unused saved holiday time shall automatically be paid to the employee at the straight time rate of pay at the end of the fiscal year. No saved holiday time will be allowed to carry over beyond the last day of the fiscal year.

- The Up to 16 hours of floating holiday may be carried over to the next fiscal year in accordance with the Employee Manual or be paid out at the end of the fiscal year at the Operator's straight time rate of pay.

- Sick Leave
  - Accrual - Sick Leave shall be accumulated at the accrual rate listed in the Employee Manual.

- Vacation Leave
  - Vacation leave shall be paid at an Operator's straight time rate of pay; i.e. vacation leave shall not be paid at the Overtime rate.

UNIFORM ALLOWANCE:
Water Treatment Plant Operators are required to wear district uniforms. Uniforms will be issued on an “as needed” basis during each fiscal year, not to exceed an annual value of $1,000. The value of the uniforms provided is reported to CalPERS as compensation subject to retirement contributions for employees in classic retirement tiers (not PEPRA). The General Manager has the authority to set or change uniform requirements including brand, quantity, and clothing type for each employee as long as the total annual value per employee does not exceed $1,000 (excluding safety items).

Water Treatment Plant Operators are required to maintain their uniforms in clean and good condition. Old uniforms are to be turned into the Purchasing Agent before issuance of new uniforms (except pants) and upon separation of employment with the District. Water Treatment Plant Operators will generally be provided with:
- Choice of five shirts: Safety green/yellow, orange and/or navy blue t-shirt with breast pocket, or polo style shirt as provided by the Purchasing Agent.

# AGENDA ITEM IV-4  
## STAFF REPORT  

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** November 20, 2024  
**Subject:** Overview of Deferred Compensation Options for Employee Retirement Savings  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION  
Receive and provide direction to staff.  

### BACKGROUND  
At the October 16, 2024, Board meeting, Director Zamorano asked staff to investigate and report back to the Board on the District’s ability to offer a deferred compensation plan to its employees. The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the different kinds of deferred compensation plans, and which are available for use by the District. Additionally, this report highlights the potential benefits of offering an employer matching contribution to employees' deferred compensation plans.  

### ANALYSIS  
A deferred compensation plan is a voluntary retirement savings plan that allows an employee to defer any amount, subject to annual limits, from their paycheck, usually pre-tax. The funds are invested within the account and earn interest and dividends, which are also tax free until withdrawal. An employer may or may not choose to provide a matching contribution to encourage employees to utilize this retirement savings tool. Deferred Compensation plans are available under various sections of the Internal Revenue Code as follows:  

1. **401(k) Plan**

The District currently offers a 457 plan to its employees through CalPERS. This is separate and distinct from the CalPERS Pension system. The CalPERS 457 Plan provides a convenient, low-cost way for employees of public agencies to save for retirement with several investment options and financial support resources. Key benefits include:

- **Investment Options:** Core investment options designed for public employees, including Target Retirement Date Funds and a self-directed brokerage option.
- **Contributor Flexibility:** Allows for both pre-tax and Roth after-tax contributions.
- **Additional Support:** CalPERS offers financial education and workshops to support employee financial literacy.
- **Low Fees:** Total fund expenses ranging from 0.21% to 0.34%.
- **Roth 457 Option:** Allows employees to make after-tax contributions with tax-free qualified withdrawals.

30 of the District’s 49 employees are currently utilizing the 457 Deferred Compensation plan, contributing an average of just under 9% of their wages. Of those participating, just over half are considered PEPRA employees, meaning their pension benefit is lower than those of the “classic” employees. Figure 1 provides additional employee participation information:

| CalPERS Member Type | Currently Enrolled Employees | Annual Deferred Compensation Plan | Employees Currently Enrolled in a Deferred Compensation Plan | Employees Not Currently Enrolled in a Deferred Compensation Plan | Total Employees | % Enrolled |
|---------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------|
| Classic T1          | $57,800.00                   | 6                                | 3                                                             | 9                                                              | 67%            |
| Classic T2          | $107,382.00                  | 8                                | 5                                                             | 13                                                             | 62%            |
| PEPRA               | $179,532.71                  | 16                               | 11                                                            | 27                                                             | 59%            |
| **Grand Total**     | **$344,714.71**              | **30**                           | **19**                                                        | **49**                                                         | **61%**       |

**Figure 1 - Employees Currently Enrolled**
<!-- Page 96 -->
Interestingly, the employee group with the highest pension benefit (Classic Tier 1) is utilizing the deferred contribution retirement savings plan the most, and the employee group with the lowest pension benefit is using it the least.

**Benefits of Employer Matching Contribution**  
In addition to employee contributions, the 457 plan allows the employer to contribute on behalf of employees. Some employers will offer a match, up to a set percentage of pay to incentivize employee participation. For example, the District could offer a matching contribution of up to 3% of an employee compensation. If the employee does not participate in the program, the District contributes nothing. If the employee contributes 2% of their compensation to the plan, the District would match that by contributing an equal amount. If the employee contributed 5%, the District would contribute the maximum matching contribution of 3%.

The District could choose any amount to contribute, either as a match or not. It could also choose to offer a contribution to certain employees only, such as PEPRA employees. The IRS annual contribution limits apply to the sum total of both employee and employer contributions.

The brief analysis below outlines the potential cost to the District if the Board decides to implement an employer match for current staff and assumes that all employees would choose to participate if the match is introduced.

An employer matching contribution is calculated for four different percentages ranging from two to six percent. Employer contributions are calculated as a percentage of the employee salary limited to rules and regulations set forth from the IRS. Figure 2 below shows the maximum employer match contributions for all employees at different percentages of contributions.

**Employer Deferred Compensation Contribution (full employee participation)**

| Contribution Percentage | Classic T1 | Classic T2 | PEPRA |
|-------------------------|------------|------------|-------|
| Employer Contribution Cost @ 2.00% | 23,782 | 40,040 | 57,593 |
| Employer Contribution Cost @ 3.00% | 35,673 | 60,060 | 86,539 |
| Employer Contribution Cost @ 4.00% | 47,564 | 80,080 | 115,385 |
| Employer Contribution Cost @ 6.00% | 71,346 | 118,806 | 173,078 |

Figure 2 - Employer Deferred Compensation Cost - Full Employee Participation
<!-- Page 97 -->
The maximum annual employer total cost for full employee participation at a 2% match is $121,514, at 3% is $182,272, 4% is $243,029 and at 6% is $363,230. These costs are subject to increases as employees' salary increase due to annual COLA and employee performance reviews.

Implementing an employer matching contribution would enhance retirement readiness and bolster the District's appeal as an employer of choice.

# We are CalPERS
CalPERS is the largest public pension fund in the U.S., with assets of approximately $400 billion. The retirement system administers retirement benefits for more than 2 million current and retired California State, public school, and local public agency employees and their families on behalf of nearly 3,000 public employers in the state. CalPERS also administers health benefits for 1.5 million enrollees and offers additional programs, including a deferred compensation retirement savings plan, member education services, and an employer trust for post-retirement benefits.

## Your CalPERS 457 Plan
All employees whose employers have adopted the CalPERS 457 Plan (the “Plan”) are eligible to join the Plan and there are currently no minimum service requirements to fulfill. The Plan is a voluntary savings program that allows you to defer any amount, subject to annual limits, from your paycheck on pre-tax and/or Roth after-tax basis (if your employer can process Roth contributions from their payroll). In addition, your contributions and their earnings, if any, can benefit from the power of tax-deferred compounding. What this means is that you don’t pay income taxes on your pre-tax investments or earnings until you start to take withdrawals, usually in retirement, and federal tax-free withdrawals of your Roth after-tax contributions and any earnings when you retire (qualifying factors apply).

### Designed with your interests in mind
- Promotes smart investing principles
- Easy payroll deduction of contributions
- Pre-tax contributions and earnings can benefit from the power of tax-deferral
- Withdrawals of pre-tax contributions and earnings are taxed as ordinary income when distributions begin
- Roth after-tax contributions can be made, if your employer can process Roth contributions from their payroll
- Dedicated Account Managers can help you define retirement goals and integrate them with existing defined benefit planning
- Access to financial learning resources, provided by Voya Institutional Plan Services, LLC.

This Guide is intended to introduce you to general investment concepts and help you understand the investment options available to you as a participant in the Plan. This Guide is not intended to provide investment advice. You should consider consulting with an outside investment advisor prior to investing.

### Preparing your action plan.
It’s never too late to start and it’s never too small an amount to invest when it comes to planning for your retirement.

You may enroll in the Plan at any time, as there is no waiting or enrollment period. Your contributions are made through easy payroll deductions and the Plan is flexible so you may stop, increase, or decrease your contributions as often as your employer allows without penalty or cost.

The Target Retirement Date Funds have been designated as the default investment under the Plan. **IF YOU DO NOT MAKE AN AFFIRMATIVE INVESTMENT ELECTION PRIOR TO THE DATE THE FIRST CONTRIBUTION IS DEPOSITED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT, YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE INVESTED IN THE APPROPRIATE TARGET RETIREMENT DATE FUND, BASED ON YOUR DATE OF BIRTH AND ASSUMING YOU WILL RETIRE AT AGE 59.** Prior to investing you should carefully review all fund information and objectives and consider consulting with an outside investment adviser. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.

### Tips to planning.
Unexpected challenges will likely cross your path at some point or another over your career. By creating an action plan, you may have an easier time staying on track to meet your retirement goals. Here are a few things to consider as you get started:

- **Maintain an emergency fund.**  
  The Plan was not designed to be a short-term savings vehicle or to replace your household emergency fund. Therefore, it is important that you have another source of savings that you can access easily for emergencies.  
  *Most experts suggest having three to six months of your living expenses set aside in cash.*

- **Be consistent.**  
  Consistency is important to help you achieve your retirement goals.  
  *The contribution amount you select is made every pay period via payroll deduction, making the Plan a consistent and convenient way to save.*

- **Make small changes where you can.**  
  Keep a spending journal for a few weeks to help you track where your money is going and to identify saving opportunities, such as:  
  * Bring your lunch to work.  
  * Brew your own coffee.  
  * Drink tap water instead of buying bottled water.  
  * Stream a movie and pop your own popcorn on Saturday night.

- **Keep it together!**  
  If you have an eligible IRA or retirement plan from a previous employer, you may want to consider moving those funds into the CalPERS 457 Plan. Just complete a Rollover Contribution form to start the transfer process. Assets rolled over from another plan may be subject to additional restrictions.

**STEP ONE: How much will you need?**

Today, many financial experts agree that you will need 70% or more of your current income to maintain your current lifestyle in retirement. Your long-term strategy not only has to work up to the day you retire, it will most likely need to continue generating growth and income throughout your retirement.

So, if you have 30 years before you retire, and you live another 30 years after you retire, you’re looking at creating and maintaining a 60-year investment strategy!

Chances are you’re going to need to rely on personal savings, over and above your Social Security and defined benefit pension benefits, when it comes to meeting your retirement income goals. Participating in the CalPERS 457 Plan is another way to save for your retirement goals.

---

**STEP TWO: How much can you save?**

Deciding how much to save is a personal decision. Check out the [My Retirement Overview®](https://voya.com/tool/how-much-do-i-need-to-retire) calculator at voya.com/tool/how-much-do-i-need-to-retire. It can help you determine how much you can really afford to save from each paycheck.

Don’t put off until tomorrow what you can do today. You might think you can’t afford to put much aside, but making small changes now could make a big difference over the long term. By investing early, your money has more time to work for you.

**Pay yourself first with Plan contributions.**  
This chart demonstrates the potential added value of contributing more money over time.  

| Monthly contributions | Value after 30 years |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| $200 k                |                      |
| $150 k                |                      |
| $100 k                |                      |
| $50 k                 |                      |
| $0                    |                      |

- **Carol:** $100 per month ($50 per pay period)  
  Value after 30 years: $97,570  
- **Charlie:** $130 per month ($65 per pay period)  
  Value after 30 years: $126,841  
- **Connie:** $160 per month ($80 per pay period)  
  Value after 30 years: $156,112  

This hypothetical example assumes bi-monthly employee contributions and a 6% average annual return. Any fees, expenses or charges that may be associated with the Plan are not considered in this illustration. Plans having these charges would reflect lower net returns. Hypothetical assumptions are not guaranteed. Systematic investing does not ensure a profit nor guarantee against a loss in declining markets. You should consider your financial ability to consistently invest in up as well as down markets.

**Incentives to help you save.**  

**IRS Saver’s Credit**  
To encourage low- and moderate-income individuals to save, the federal government offers a tax credit for contributions to eligible retirement plans. You may be eligible for a credit on your federal taxes based on your adjusted gross income. If you take this tax credit you can still deduct your contributions to qualified retirement savings plans as allowed under current law. For more information or to see if you qualify, contact your tax professional.

**Catch-Up Provisions**  
- **Age 50 Catch-Up** — allows a participant who is at least 50 before the end of the tax year to make additional contributions of $7,500, for a maximum of $30,500.  
- **Special 3-Year Catch-Up** — allows a participant who meets special conditions and has not been contributing the maximum in previous tax years to contribute up to twice the maximum annual contribution amount during the three years prior to their Normal Retirement Age. The current annual limit is $46,000 or the amount of Catch-Up credit available to you, whichever is less.  

IRS regulations state the Age 50 Catch-Up Provision cannot be used in the same calendar year as the Special 3-Year Catch-Up Provision.

**2024 Maximum Annual Contribution Limits**  
- 100% of income, up to $23,000  
- Age 50 Catch-Up: $7,500  
- Special 3-Year Catch-Up: $46,000  

Annual IRS contribution limits are subject to change.

**The Bottom Line.**  
**Start planning for your retirement early!**  
- **Just starting out in your career?** You might think you can’t afford to put anything aside. By investing early, though, your investment has the opportunity to grow tax-deferred over a longer period. In the future you may want to consider increasing your contributions as your salary increases.  
- **Nearing retirement?** When starting later in life it’s important to consider your investment and tax-shelter strategies carefully. Consider consulting with an investment and tax advisor prior to making investment decisions.

![STEP THREE: What's your investment strategy?](https://calpers457.com)

When it comes to investing, people have different levels of risk tolerance and experience. There are some that have limited knowledge in actively developing an investment portfolio and there are those who prefer to select their own mix of investments.

Offering a simple approach to investing, the Plan’s investment lineup is organized into choices designed to match your level of interest in investing.

### Your choice, simplified.

| Your Choice      | Your Involvement                                                                 | The Investment Approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Help-Me-Do-It** | You select the fund, CalPERS manages the asset allocation of the fund.          | Over time, the investment mix of each fund gradually shifts from a greater concentration of higher-risk investments to a greater concentration of lower-risk investments. This disciplined and systematic approach is designed to reduce volatility through diversification, especially as each fund approaches its target date and the years after retirement. However, there is no guarantee that a fund will achieve its strategic objective. |
| **Do-It-Myself**  | You select your funds and actively design and manage your asset allocation over time. | CalPERS has selected a set of six index funds in different asset classes (stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents) so you can diversify your portfolio based on your personal situation.                                                                 |

### Personal Choice Retirement Account®
The Personal Choice Retirement Account® (PCRA) is a fee-based brokerage account that affords you more flexibility in choosing your own retirement savings investments, with access to thousands of different mutual funds from hundreds of fund families. Investments are limited to mutual funds made available by the Schwab Account. Please call the Plan Information Line at **800-260-0659** for information on how to enroll into the PCRA option.

### Participant Fees
We strive to provide investments and services at a reasonable cost using a simple fee schedule with an overall objective of minimizing expenses. There are costs associated with investing in the underlying investment fund options offered under the Plan. Each of the investment fund options currently have an annual fee of less 0.40%, prorated daily based on your account balance. CalPERS periodically reviews fees and operating costs, and changes to fees and costs may be made at any time.

![Investing 101: Target Date Funds vs. Index Funds](https://calpers457.com)  
**What are target date funds?**  
Target date funds are diversified funds that are designed for investors who don’t have the time, desire, or expertise to choose an appropriate asset mix for their situation and actively manage it. Over time, the investment mix of a target date fund gradually shifts from a greater concentration of higher-risk investments to a greater concentration of lower-risk investments.  

Target date funds are designed for investors who intend to retire during or near the target date year that is included in the name or description of the fund. However, you should not choose a target date fund solely based on your age or intended retirement date. You should also consider factors such as your risk tolerance, personal circumstances, and complete financial situation. While target date funds are intended to offer a simpler way to diversify your portfolio, you should continue to monitor your investments and make adjustments as needed.  

**What are index funds?**  
Index funds are designed to produce results that mirror the performance of the index they track by buying and holding the stocks or bonds included in the index. That’s why these funds are often described as passively managed. If you want to invest in a certain asset class, such as the stocks or bonds of large U.S. companies, an index fund gives you a convenient way to invest without having to choose individual stocks or bonds.  

**What is an index?**  
A fund’s performance is usually compared with its market benchmark or index. An index is a grouping of stocks or bonds selected to represent a particular market. The best-known index is the Dow Jones Industrial Average that follows 30 of the largest U.S. companies. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index widens the range to include 500 of the largest U.S. companies for a broader reading of the market. An index is not managed and cannot be invested in directly.  

---

**Investing 102**  
**The Asset Classes**  
There are three basic asset classes and each has specific risks and returns to consider. There are also asset allocation investments, like the target date funds, that generally contain a mix of any of the three asset classes.  

| Asset Class      | Benefit                                               | Risk                                               |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Asset Allocation** | Professionals make the diversification, asset allocation and rebalancing decisions | Shifting to a conservative mix over time helps manage risk, but does not guarantee earnings growth |
| **Cash Equivalents** | Designed to protect original investment or principal | May not keep pace with inflation over time        |
| **Bond**         | Generally offer greater income potential than short-term investments and not as much risk as stocks | Lower growth potential                             |
| **Stocks**       | Historically, stocks have provided greater long-term returns than other asset classes | Due to market volatility the value of stocks can go up and down over short periods of time |

---

**Investing 103**  
**Investment risk vs. inflation risk**  
Investment risk is generally associated with the potential that investments may go down in value as a result of market volatility, though other risks exist. Stocks are generally considered riskier investments because they tend to fluctuate in value more than conservative investments like bonds. Conservative investments may help reduce investment risk, but over the long term they can expose you to another kind of risk — inflation risk. When investments are earning less than the rate of inflation, they are actually losing value.  

**The importance of asset allocation & diversification**  
Combining different types of investments through asset allocation and diversification may help you manage risk and maximize your return potential by smoothing out market fluctuations, while still taking advantage of the market’s potential for higher returns.  

Asset allocation involves assigning specific percentages of your investments to different asset classes according to your financial goals, risk tolerance and time horizon. Diversification is a risk management technique that mixes a variety of investments within a portfolio. It involves distributing your money among different securities, sectors, industries and strategies within a number of asset classes. Diversification through asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against loss.

The Target Retirement Date Funds offer diversified portfolios for participants who don’t have the time, desire or expertise to choose an appropriate asset mix for their situation and actively manage it over time.

## Funds that evolve over time.
Over time, the investment mix of each fund gradually shifts from a greater concentration of higher-risk investments (such as stock funds) to a greater concentration of lower-risk investments (such as bond funds). Each fund will reach its most conservative asset allocation seven years after the target date year. The shift, known as a “glide path,” focuses on asset accumulation to help achieve participants’ retirement objectives. This disciplined and systematic approach is designed to reduce volatility through diversification, especially as each fund approaches its target date and the years after retirement. However, there is no guarantee that a fund will achieve its strategic objective. The CalPERS Board of Administration reserves the right to change the target asset allocations, asset classes, underlying portfolios, and benchmarks at any time.

## Picking your target date fund.
Each fund is designed for an investor who intends to retire during or near the target date year that is included in the name of the fund. However, you should not choose a fund solely based on your age or intended retirement date. You should also consider factors such as your risk tolerance, personal circumstances, and complete financial situation. For example, even if you intend to retire in 2030, you may decide that the 2025, 2035 or other fund is more appropriate for you.

*Based on assumption that retirement age is 59. The “target date” is the approximate date when a participant plans to retire (assuming a retirement age of 59). There is no guarantee that any investment option will achieve its stated objective. Principal value fluctuates and you may lose money, including losses near and following retirement, and there is no guarantee that the investment will provide adequate retirement income. Asset allocation, diversification and rebalancing do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.*

While target date funds are intended to offer a simpler way to diversify your portfolio, you should continue to monitor your Plan investments and make adjustments as needed.

# Core Funds
**Core Funds – A carefully selected list of passively managed investment options.**

If you like to pick, actively manage and design your asset allocation, you can choose from a carefully selected list of core investment fund options. CalPERS has selected a set of six index funds in different asset classes (stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents) so you can diversify your portfolio based on your personal situation.

| Index Fund                                   | Asset Class          |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| State Street Short Term Investment Fund      | Cash Equivalent       |
| State Street Real Asset Fund                 | Inflation Protection  |
| State Street U.S. Short-Term Government/    | Bond                 |
| Credit Bond Index Fund                       |                      |
| State Street U.S. Bond Index Fund            | Bond                 |
| State Street Russell All Cap Index Fund      | U.S. Stocks          |
| State Street Global All Cap Equity           | Global Stocks        |
| ex U.S. Index Fund                           |                      |

## A reminder about asset allocation.
Asset allocation helps to reduce investment risk by spreading your money among different investments, or across the main asset classes. Combining different types of investments, i.e. stocks, bonds and cash equivalents, may help you manage risk and maximize your return potential by smoothing out market fluctuations, while still taking advantage of the market’s potential for higher returns. However, diversification through asset allocation does not specifically ensure a profit or protect against loss.

## Be aware of inflation risk.
When you’re ready to retire, you’ll most likely be living in a much more expensive world than today. Conservative investments (like bonds) may help reduce volatility risk, but over the long term they can expose you to inflation risk. When investments are earning less than the rate of inflation, they are actually losing value.

## Building your investment portfolio.
It is important for you to determine how long you plan to keep your money invested, and your willingness to stay invested during market ups and downs, and build a portfolio appropriate for that strategy.

When developing your investment strategy, you need to consider:
- How much to save and invest today.
- Your investment time horizon.
- Your risk tolerance.

Once you determine the answers to these questions you can create an investment mix that will help you work toward your objective.

![Features of the CalPERS 457 Plan](https://calpers457.com)

**Tax Liability on Pre-Tax Distributions**  
Pre-tax distributions are treated as ordinary income in the year the money is paid and are subject to federal and state income taxes. 20% is withheld for federal tax purposes, as well as 2% for state taxes for California residents, at the time of payment on all distributions. A rollover to another eligible retirement plan or a traditional IRA is not subject to tax withholding.

**Purchasing Service Credit**  
You may choose to use your investments in the Plan to purchase Pension Service Credit, if eligible.

**In-service Withdrawals**  
Generally, you cannot withdraw money from your account while you are still employed by your employer with the exception of:  
- **Unforeseeable Emergency Withdrawals**  
  You may make an emergency withdrawal under qualifying circumstances prior to separating from service.
  
- **Loan Privilege (if available)**  
  You may borrow from your account balance to assist you in meeting your financial needs only if your employer has adopted the loan provision of the Plan. Additional fees apply.

**Roth Plan Option***  
If your employer can process Roth contributions from their payroll, you can make contributions of money that has already been taxed. This helps you build a nest egg of federal tax-free income in retirement. Your qualified withdrawals of contributions and any earnings then come out federal tax-free, which means you could potentially end up with more in net distributions in retirement.

**Guidelines & Forms**  
Guidelines on distributions, tax liability and in-service withdrawals are available on calpers457.com.

All forms noted in this brochure can be found at calpers.voya.com (go to Plan Information > CalPERS 457 Plan Information, then go to Plan Information > Forms at the top of the page) or obtained by calling the Plan Information Line at 800-260-0659.

*CalPERS does not offer legal or tax advice. You should consult with your independent tax and legal advisors regarding your individual situation and if the Roth plan option is appropriate for you.

**Back to Agenda**  
**AGENDA ITEM V-1**  

**STAFF REPORT**  

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** November 20, 2024  
**Subject:** Fiscal Year 2023-2024 Results of Operations – Budget to Actual  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Receive report.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The Board of Directors adopted the Fiscal Year 2023-2024 Operating and Capital Budget on June 28, 2023. The Board of Directors received monthly budget to actual reports at each Board meeting during the fiscal year and a mid-year budget review was provided to the Board on March 27, 2024. The audit is complete, and staff are working with the auditors to produce the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, which will be presented to the Finance Committee in December, along with their reports on the District’s internal controls.  

The purpose of this report is to provide an analysis to the Board of Directors on the actual activity of the District’s four funds (Wholesale Operations, Wholesale Capital, Retail Operations, and Retail Capital), on the budgetary basis of accounting for Fiscal Year 2023-2024, as compared to the budget.  

**Wholesale Operations:**  
As illustrated in the graph below, Wholesale Operating revenues came in $2.7 million, or 25.5%, greater than anticipated in the original budget, and 9.3% greater than anticipated at mid-year.  

Revenues from sales to the Wholesale Customer Agencies were as expected in the mid-year budget, which was slightly higher than the original budget (6.71% estimated at mid-year, actual was 6.98% above budget). The majority of the additional $2.7 million of revenues is due to treating more water than anticipated for the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) at an increased rate (effective January 2024). SSWD ceased taking their PCWA supplies in February. The mid-year budget estimate assumed no further revenues from treating their PCWA water. However, they resumed taking the water in March, resulting in SJWD treating another 3,326-acre feet of their water, thereby generating the additional revenues.  

While various expense categories came in over budget, on the whole expenses came in $431,825, or 4.2%, below the original budget - quite close to the mid-year budget review estimate of 3.6% below budget. As reported during the mid-year budget review, the District had budgeted $275,000 for Warren Act and NEPA work, but shortly after starting work the project was put on hold waiting for modeling information which was not available.

**Wholesale Operating**  
**Budget to Actual**  
**Fiscal Year 2023-24**

| Category         | Budget       | Mid-Year Estimate | Actual       |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Revenues         | $10,584,700  | $12,147,900       | $13,282,223  |
| Expenses         | $10,304,900  | $9,936,800        | $9,873,075   |

As of the end of the fiscal year, Salaries and Benefits came in under budget by $206,537, or 4.8%, due to salary increases and benefit costs being less than anticipated in the budget. Professional Services expenses exceeded the budget by $250,317 due to legal expenses being higher than anticipated due primarily, but not solely, to litigation brought against the District by the Citrus Heights Water District. These additional legal fees were offset by savings in other expense categories.

As a result of the increased revenues, lower than anticipated expenses, and a delay in the establishment of the Hinkle Reservoir Debt Service Reserve, staff was able to transfer $3,204,740 into the capital reserve, $4.16 million more than anticipated.

At the end of the fiscal year, the Wholesale Operating fund had an available reserve balance of $2,306,100, which is in conformance with the Board’s Reserve Policy.

**Wholesale Capital:**  
Wholesale Capital revenues were in line with expectations, with final revenues being greater than anticipated in the budget by less than 1%.

**Wholesale Capital Budget to Actual Fiscal Year 2023-24**

|                | Revenues         | Expenses         |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Budget         | $23,927,800       | $5,043,200        |
| Mid-Year Estimate | $24,096,072    | $2,824,200        |
| Actual         | $24,113,659       | $2,683,207        |

The Wholesale Capital expenditure budget funded 34 projects/equipment purchases totaling $5,043,200; actual expenses were $2,683,207. As reported in the mid-year budget review, the Hinkle Reservoir project took longer than anticipated to complete, taking time away from staff’s ability to complete all planned projects. Ten projects/purchases were completed, the largest of which was the Hinkle Overflow Channel Lining, and another 7 were started but not complete by year’s end. The Hinkle Reservoir, while substantially complete, was not accepted as complete until after the new fiscal year had begun. The projects that were not started, or started but not completed, were carried over and included in the Fiscal Year 2024-25 budget.

The budget anticipated Wholesale Capital reserves of $19.08 million. Due to lower than anticipated capital expenditures, and favorable results in the operating fund, the ending capital reserve as of June 30, 2024, is $27,364,647.

**Retail Operations:**

The graph below depicts Retail Operating revenues and expenses as compared to the original budget and the mid-year review.

![Retail Operating Fund Budget to Actual Fiscal Year 2023-24](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Retail+Operating+Fund+Budget+to+Actual+Fiscal+Year+2023-24)

**Retail Operating Fund Budget to Actual Fiscal Year 2023-24**

|                | Revenues         | Expenses         |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Budget         | $17,257,500      | $14,522,300      |
| Mid-Year Estimate | $17,586,100   | $13,564,600      |
| Actual         | $17,821,558      | $12,906,115      |

Retail Operating revenues of $17,821,558 were 3.3% greater than the original budget and close to the mid-year estimate (greater by 1.34%). As discussed during the mid-year budget review, the small excess is due to a combination of higher-than-expected water sales and slightly more customers than anticipated in the budget.

Retail Operating expenses of $12,906,115 were $1.6 million less than the original budget, a variance of -11% and were 5% below the mid-year estimate. While every operating expense category came in under budget, most of the savings were from the following:

- $476,000 of the variance is from lower-than-expected service area maintenance contractor costs. Staff utilize the services of Flowline Contractors for repairing leaks and assisting with the Service Lateral Replacement Program. A portion of their work is considered to be capital expenditures and is recorded in the Retail Capital Fund. It is difficult at the beginning of the year to determine the nature of their work for the year and therefore which fund it will draw from.
  
- $402,000 of the variance is from lower-than-expected Professional Services costs in a wide variety of departments. Customer Service and Water Efficiency came in under budget due to several projects/tasks costing less than anticipated including the Customer Service Satisfaction Survey, aerial imaging photography, bill printing, and the delinquent lien process. The majority of the rest came from savings in the Engineering Department, most of which was due to an easement evaluation being budgeted but not performed. The remainder was due to savings in surveying, developer-related expenses, and support for the Cityworks work order and asset management system.

**November 20, 2024**
<!-- Page 115 -->
![STAFF REPORT FY 2023-24 Financial Results Donna Silva](attachment://image.png)

- Lastly, Materials & Supplies came in under budget by over $200,000, most of which was due to failed meters budgeted in operations, but being correctly recorded in the Retail Capital fund.

The budget anticipated a transfer out to capital reserves of $2,427,000. As a result of favorable operations, the transfer was actually $4,607,311.

At $3,099,820, the Retail Operating Reserve is in conformance with the District’s Reserve Policy. In addition, the required Reserve for the Eureka Road Transmission Pipeline Replacement Loan SRF Loan was established in the amount of $131,521. This reserve must remain until the loan is paid off in its entirety.

Retail Capital:

Retail Capital Fund revenues came in at $6,847,754, which was $8.1 million less than budgeted due to the delay on the Kokila Reservoir Replacement Project, for which we anticipate receiving a loan of $8.9 million. The project is on hold while the District works through the grant application process, another funding source for the process.

But for the loan proceeds not received, revenues were $1.5 million more than budgeted due primarily to more capital fees being received than anticipated. Capital Facility Fees are paid on the development community’s timeline and are extremely difficult to predict. Most of the Capital Facility Fees are for designated projects and are held in reserve until those projects commence.

|                | Revenues       | Expenses       |

| **Budget**     | $14,653,600    | $25,107,100    |
| **Mid-Year Estimate** | $6,484,000     | $8,813,600     |
| **Actual**     | $6,847,754     | $6,784,518     |

Retail Capital expenditures came in at $6,784,518, which was $16,293,600 (65%) below the budget of $25,107,100. This was anticipated during the mid-year budget review. $15 million of the budget variance comes from two projects. First, the budget included the $12.5 million Kokila Reservoir Replacement Project. Two factors have caused the delay of this project. First, the Hinkle Reservoir project took longer than expected and staff could not pivot to the Kokila Reservoir project. Second, the District received an appropriation for a federal grant for the Kokila Reservoir project. The grant application process can take 6 months to a year or more to complete. Construction cannot commence until the grant agreement is executed, which we do not expect to occur until near the end of Fiscal Year 2024-25.

Second, the budget included $2,575,000 for the Retail Groundwater Production Facilities Project, which would be either a purchase in capacity of a neighboring water district’s well system, or the construction of the District’s own well. This project did not incur expenses in FY 2023-24.

The remainder of the difference comes from the various ongoing asset replacement programs that the District implemented in Fiscal Year 2022-23. This includes annual replacements of service lines, air-release valves, blow off valves, fire hydrants and meters. Due to the District-wide effort necessary to manage construction and operations during the Hinkle Reservoir project, staff were unable to go out to bid on these annual replacements.

**November 20, 2024**

replacement programs in time for them to be completed in their first year. Staff attempted to catch up in FY 2023-24 and while considerable progress was made, staff were unable to fully catch up. However, the follow assets were replaced during the year:

- 3,051 Meter Endpoints (allows drive by meter reading)
- 424 Meters
- 190 Service Laterals lines
- 47 Air Release Valves (ARV’s)
- 10 Blow-off Valves
- 9 Fire Hydrants

Due to the lower-than-expected expenditures, and a higher-than-expected transfer in from the Operating Fund, Retail Capital Reserves at the end of the year are $23,110,283. $3,380,308 of this is reserved for specific future project expenditures.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Greg Zlotnick, Water Resources Manager  
**Date:** November 20, 2024  
**Subject:** Potential San Juan Retail Groundwater Well – Part 2  

---

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Continue to pursue partnerships with neighboring agencies (including Wholesale Customer Agencies) to expand groundwater banking/transfer activities and to improve dry year reliability. Only if such partnerships do not bear fruit should San Juan consider development of its own groundwater facilities.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
At the conclusion of its discussion regarding this issue at its October 16th meeting, the Board asked staff to return with additional information regarding the cost of beginning the process to develop a groundwater well, which would include identifying potential properties on which to site a well, and the availability of grant funding to support that process.

---

**DISCUSSION**  

**Property Identification**  
Staff thanks the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) for sharing relevant documentation and processes it developed for its own property identification and well siting needs to inform this discussion. SSWD retained West Yost (WY) consultants to undertake the property identification component of seeking to site a groundwater well through a GIS tool WY had developed. District staff met with WY to receive a briefing on their tool. WY’s GIS-based methodology provides for transparently, repeatably, objectively, and efficiently identifying potentially qualified sites for future groundwater wells. Once identified, additional site-specific investigation would be recommended for selected parcels.

To apply its GIS tool within only the Sacramento County portion of San Juan’s wholesale service area, WY very roughly estimated it would recommend a budget of $75,000 to $100,000, noting that additional refinement could alter those numbers. The higher end of the cost range would provide for application of the GIS-based well siting tool, a Well Siting Technical Memorandum (TM) detailing the
<!-- Page 119 -->
# STAFF REPORT  
**Potential San Juan Retail Groundwater Well – Part 2**  
**Greg Zlotnick**  

work completed and documenting a recommended list of potential well site locations, as well as a board presentation on the study and outcome.

The criteria used to limit or expand the analysis would affect the budget. Moreover, WY assumed it would not need to undertake hydrogeological analyses since it has or would access existing data and analyses within the region. However, there is no guarantee that that assumption would hold true and further such analyses could still be necessary, which would result in an increased budget.

The following is a list comprising a “Property Acquisition Roadmap” used by SSWD, showing tasks that would take place after identifying potential parcels (Phase A in the list, fulfilled for example, through application of the WY GIS tool), and a chart describing additional external resources that would need to be contracted for as part of a well siting process:

- **Phase A – Identify Parcels**  
- **Phase B – Determine Availability of Parcels**  
- **Phase C – Perform Due Diligence**  
- **Phase D – Negotiate Purchase Agreement**  
- **Phase E – Proceed Through Escrow**  
- **Phase F – Close Property Acquisition**  
- **Phase G – Test Well**  

Prior to Phase D, the General Manager would screen the potential properties that cleared the process favorably and bring a recommendation to the Board.

### External Resources

multiple legal parcels, complicated regulatory environments, and/or significant hydrogeologic data gaps increase the effort required.” There would be additional costs to carry out necessary environmental site assessments. Based upon conversations with various consulting firms, a guesstimate for that work ranges widely from $50,000 to $100,000 or so.

In addition to drilling pilot boreholes in recommended potential locations, ultimately drilling a test well (Phase G above) would be necessary, entailing additional costs beyond the property identification/acquisition process, environmental assessment, and pilot boreholes. As noted in the Staff Report last meeting, a test well is estimated to cost around $300,000. Consequently, the investment necessary to get to the point at which the design and construction of a well could begin is estimated to range in cost from approximately $400,000 to $500,000.

## Funding Opportunities

The Ferguson Group (TFG), San Juan’s federal advocacy firm, is well versed in identifying and pursuing federal grants and appropriations (commonly referred to as “earmarks”) for agency projects.

In fact, TFG recently worked to secure a $1.25M earmark for the District’s Kokila Reservoir project. In addition, the District facilitated TFG’s engagement with Orange Vale Water Company (OVWC) to secure earmarks totaling $2.075M in support of OVWC’s current well rehabilitation project.

TFG provided the District with a comprehensive memo (attached) regarding the potential sources of federal grant funds and programs which could be targeted for appropriations through the earmark process to support San Juan’s development of a groundwater well project, including whether such financing is available for planning and/or construction.

TFG confirmed, as reported in the Staff Report provided last month on this subject, there are no state grant programs available to pursue at this time for well projects and state programs generally will not support only planning efforts.

TFG concluded the following regarding federal planning grant opportunities:

“While many grant funding programs are available for the funding of full ground water well projects, very few opportunities exist for the sole purpose of planning. Most programs that allow for planning activities to be included in the project scope also require those activities to be accompanied with construction or implementation activities.” [Emphases added.]

![STAFF REPORT Potential San Juan Retail Groundwater Well – Part 2 Greg Zlotnick](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT+Potential+San+Juan+Retail+Groundwater+Well+%E2%80%93+Part+2+Greg+Zlotnick)

With respect to pursuing an earmark for funding support, TFG advises:

“…given the political and competitive nature of earmarking, TFG recommends SJWD explore this method of funding when the project is further developed and is ready to move into implementation and/or construction.”

The only federal program TFG identified that could provide a grant in support of planning for a groundwater well is the Department of Interior’s “WaterSMART: Planning and Project Design Grants program”, which is administered by the Bureau of Reclamation.

TFG’s memo calls out several important “things SJWD should consider” relative to this particular program:

- The minimum award amount under this program is $100,000. The maximum award is $400,000.

- It is expected that applicants will have already performed some general planning work and preliminary studies that led to the identification of a specific location for project design. [Emphases added.]

- Project design projects should result in a final design package at approximately a 60% design level with the anticipation that the package will lead to applying for construction funding.

- Acceptance of planning funds under this program will not require SJWD to move in to construction on the project.

The next round of applications for this program will not be open until next summer. It then takes approximately 6 months for the selection of recipients, and an additional 4 or 5 months for the awards to be made. As a result of this timeline, funding from this program, were it to be made available to the District, would not be received until the spring of 2026.

As described in the TFG memo, there are a few other grant programs that the District could pursue in support of developing a well, but those funding sources are focused on support of actual project construction. Should the District ultimately decide to pursue development of a groundwater well, staff will work with TFG to seek funding support from those sources.

![STAFF REPORT Potential San Juan Retail Groundwater Well – Part 2 Greg Zlotnick](attachment://image.png)

## Conclusion

Based on the foregoing, and the information provided in the Staff Report last month, staff’s recommendation remains the same with regard to whether the District should consider pursuing the development of its own groundwater well: (1) direct staff to continue to pursue potential partnerships with neighboring agencies (including Wholesale Customer Agencies) who already operate groundwater facilities, and only if such partnerships do not bear fruit should San Juan Retail consider development of its own groundwater facilities; and (2) defer any further consideration of the District developing its own groundwater well until a decision is made regarding the potential combination with SSWD.

# Funding Opportunities for Groundwater Well Development Activities

## Overview

The San Juan Water District (SJWD) is interested in pursuing funding for the development of a groundwater well, specifically for costs associated with planning, initial property search, assessment, and land acquisition. While many grant funding programs are available for the funding of full ground water well projects, very few opportunities exist for the sole purpose of planning. Most programs that allow for planning activities to be included in the project scope also require those activities to be accompanied with construction or implementation activities. Funding opportunities included in this memo are grouped by those ideal for planning only and those ideal for planning and/or construction.

In addition to competitive grant funding, SJWD could also consider pursuing congressionally directed spending (earmarks) in the FY 2026 appropriations cycle for a ground water well project through programs and accounts administered by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. However, given the political and competitive nature of earmarking, TFG recommends SJWD explore this method of funding when the project is further developed and is ready to move into implementation and/or construction. Information on potential earmark funding accounts is included at the end of this memo.

## Program Summary Information

TFG has provided a summary for each of the programs identified as a potential funding opportunity. Each summary includes a brief synopsis of the program, eligibility requirements, funding amounts, award ranges, match commitment requirements, and most recent solicitation dates, or periods of time for which the program is open and accepting applications. Additional information can be found in the linked TFG Profile and Summary for the program as well as in the Things to Consider box.

Program information is based on the most recent solicitation available. Generally, grant programs change little from year-to-year, making previous solicitations reliable and accurate in predicting future solicitations. TFG has noted where any large-scale changes to programs are anticipated. Previous solicitation dates indicate when the program was last run and act as a good indicator of when a program might be re-run as the majority are released on an annual basis. TFG has checked that all existing programs included in this memo are

### Congressionally Directed Spending (Earmarks)
In addition to the competitive funding opportunities presented above, opportunities exist in the congressionally directed spending and the federal appropriations process to potentially fund construction of a ground water well.

### Corps of Engineers – Section 219 Environmental Infrastructure Program
Section 219 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-580) authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to assist non-federal interests in carrying out water-related environmental infrastructure and resource protection and development projects. Such assistance may be in the form of technical, planning, and/or design assistance for water supply and storage, treatment and distribution systems; and wastewater treatment systems including treatment plants. Projects must specifically be authorized by Congress to be eligible for funds under this program. To be eligible to compete for assistance, a project must be within a state, county, city, or region specifically authorized by Congress to be eligible for funds under this program. A 25% non-federal match is required under this account.
<!-- Page 129 -->
![Funding Opportunities for Groundwater Well Development](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Funding+Opportunities+for+Groundwater+Well+Development)

NOTE: SJWD is an eligible participant on the Sacramento Area, CA Section 219 authorization and has already partners with the Corps on projects within the SJWD service area under the program.

### EPA – State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG)

The EPA STAG account funds local wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. This includes construction of and modifications to municipal sewage treatment plants and drinking water treatment plants. Dams and reservoirs are not eligible under this account. Projects must be publicly owned or owned by a nonprofit entity and eligible for the funding under the state’s Clean Water or Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRF) loan programs. Privately-owned projects are not eligible for infrastructure grants, even if they are otherwise eligible for assistance under a SRF program. A 20% match is required for any portion of a project funded through a STAG infrastructure grant.

NOTE: SJWD is an eligible participant on the Sacramento Area, CA Section 219 authorization and has already partners with the Corps on projects within the SJWD service area under the program.

### Next Steps

To best match a specific project with a program, TFG recommends consultation with funding agency staff, and congressional staff for congressionally directed spending, before the solicitation period opens. Funding agency staff are generally more willing to speak with prospective applicants and give tips and advice when the solicitation is not open. TFG is available to work with SJWD to meet with potential funding agencies, if desired, and to vet program eligibility as SJWD continues to explore ground water well development.
