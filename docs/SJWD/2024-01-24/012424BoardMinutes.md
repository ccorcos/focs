There were no public comments.

All items under the Consent Calendar are considered to be routine and are approved by one motion.

Consent Calendar item documents are available for review in the Board packet.

2. **Minutes of the Board of Directors Meeting, December 13, 2023 (W & R)**  
   **Recommendation:** Approve draft minutes

Director Costa moved to approve the Consent Calendar. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

IV. **NEW BUSINESS**

1. **2024 Board Committees (W & R)**  
   President Zamorano opened the floor for Board discussion. Director Costa informed the Board that he and Director Tobin discussed switching committees and Director Tobin would like to be on the Finance Committee and Director Costa would like to be on the Public Information Committee. Director Tobin requested that her assignments to the ACWA Foundation and the Sacramento LAFCO be added to the committee list. President Zamorano would like any changes to be submitted to him by February 20, 2024.

2. **ACWA DC2024 Conference Attendance (W & R)**  
   Director Tobin informed the Board that attending the ACWA DC2024 conference is one of her requirements as Immediate Past President of ACWA. She commented that she is registered for the conference unless the Board does not approve her attendance and she reviewed the conference agenda.

   Director Rich questioned the benefit to the District of Director Tobin attending the conference. Director Tobin commented that water rights is a big topic at the conference which benefits the District along with the District being represented at the conference. In response to President Zamorano’s question, the Board Secretary confirmed that approximately $3,200 was budgeted for the conference which would cover the registration, hotel, meals and transportation. Director Tobin confirmed that ACWA does not cover any of the ACWA DC2023 expenses but will cover the registration for the ACWA Spring and Fall conferences.

   President Zamorano requested that Director Tobin be more accommodating with regard to ACWA appointments and Director Tobin explained that she has no jurisdiction with regard to making appointments; however, she stated that she can make recommendations.

Director Costa moved to approve Director Tobin’s out of state attendance at the ACWA DC2024 Conference. Director Tobin seconded the motion and the motion failed with 2 Aye votes and 3 No votes (Miller, Rich and Zamorano).

Director Tobin voiced concern that the Board put forth a frivolous $100,000 rebate while denying the expenditure of $3,200 to represent the District in Washington, D.C., and she stated that the Board is headed in the wrong direction with very limited leadership.

3. American River Watershed Sanitary Survey Update (W)  
Mr. Barela informed the Board that the American River Watershed Sanitary Survey is completed every five years, which is an evaluation of the watershed. Mr. Greg Turner, Water Treatment Plant Manager, conducted a brief presentation which will be attached to the meeting minutes.

Mr. Turner informed the Board that the American River Watershed Sanitary Survey focused on Watershed and Water Supply Systems, American River Water Quality, Contaminating Sources, and Findings and Recommendations. He reported that the study showed that the American River continues to provide an excellent source of water, that SJWD water treatment continues to meet all drinking water standards, and that no constituents were found to require additional treatment.

4. CCTM1 Lease Agreement Approval (W & R)  
Mr. Barela provided the Board with a staff report which was included in the Board packet and conducted a brief presentation. He explained that the lease agreement with CCTM1 (T-Mobile) ends in 2026; however, they reached out to the District to negotiate a new contract which would extend the contract 30 years (which is structured as automatic 5-year renewals) and include terms to allow them to have DISH equipment installed on their existing tower which is known as co-location. He explained that the agreement was reviewed by legal counsel and includes an increasing rate structure along with terms for co-location. He explained that the District would receive 50% of the amount of the rental fee that T-Mobile would assess DISH.

Mr. Barela informed the Board that this item was taken to the last Finance Committee meeting for review and staff recommends that the Board approve staff to execute the contract with T-Mobile. Director Costa voiced concern that the Board was not aware that staff was negotiating with T-Mobile and that T-Mobile already signed the contract, so he suggested that the Board be notified in the future on items like this and that staff discuss the process with the General Manager. The Board discussed the lease agreement and Legal Counsel Jones confirmed that he worked closely with staff regarding the contract terms and recommends Board approval.

Director Tobin moved to approve the execution of a lease agreement with CCTM1, LLC related to the property containing CCTM1’s cell tower and instrumentation. Director Costa seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

## V. OLD BUSINESS

1. **FY 2023-24 Operations Plan Report Card (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker reviewed the 2nd quarter progress on the FY 2023-24 Operations Plan Report Card. He informed the Board that staff is on track to meet the goals, with some projects already completed or slightly delayed.

2. **Strategic Plan Update (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker informed the Board that staff revised the Strategic Plan as discussed at a previous Board meeting. He started to review the edited plan that was included in the Board packet; however, Director Tobin voiced concern that the Board was not included in the revision of the plan. GM Helliker suggested that a workshop be conducted with the Board. The Board discussed the suggestion and agreed that they would like to hold a separate workshop in the evening to discuss the Strategic Plan.

3. **San Juan and the Regional Water Authority (W & R)**  
   Mr. Zlotnick reminded the Board that there was a desire to discuss the District’s relationship with RWA and he reported that Jim Peifer, RWA Executive Director, will be at the March Board meeting. He informed the Board that it will be an opportunity for them to discuss any issues they have with RWA at that meeting. He suggested that the Board develop a list of topics to discuss which can be distributed to RWA in advance of the meeting, and that the meeting would not be limited to just those topics.  
   The Board discussed some topics that they would like to discuss in March which includes the benefit of the annual membership dues, grants received, development of the water bank, conjunctive use, governance, SG membership, RWA staff salaries, annual cost per connection paid to RWA by San Juan and other agencies, return on investment over the last 5-10 years, funding for wells in the region, and the cost to terminate membership since that was mentioned in a previous meeting with RWA. The Board was informed that if they have any other topics to address, then they can send an email to GM Helliker and Mr. Zlotnick.

4. **Ad Hoc Health Benefits Committee Update (W & R)**  
   Ms. Silva reviewed the staff report which was included in the Board packet. She provided the Board members with the consultant’s report and explained that even though ACWA-JPIA’s premiums were less than CalPERS, ACWA-JPIA does not manage retiree medical which would require an additional staff person to manage it in-house, which would negate the premium savings. She informed the Board that the committee and staff do not recommend switching health benefit providers. The Board thanked staff and the committee for their work on this item. Ms. Silva informed the Board that staff will continue to monitor the health benefits.

5. **Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker reported that he and Mr. Zlotnick met with Dan York, Sacramento Suburban Water District General Manager, to discuss the groundwater bank project with RWA, and potential water transfers this year. GM Helliker reported that SSWD is interested in buying water from SJWD this year, and possibly conducting a groundwater substitution transfer. GM Helliker reported that he is completing the

banking description for SSWD and will be meeting with SSWD to discuss a potential banking partnership and taking advantage of the funding in the retail budget.

GM Helliker reported that comments on the voluntary agreements were due last Friday and the District participated in two sets of comments – one with Northern California Water Association and the other with RWA. He explained that if the State Water Board were to implement their proposal on the American River, it would prevent Reclamation from meeting temperature requirements under the Endangered Species Act.

![Figure 5-33. San Juan Water District – Raw and Treated Water Turbidities, 2018 – 2022](https://via.placeholder.com/800x450.png?text=Figure+5-33.+San+Juan+Water+District+%E2%80%93+Raw+and+Treated+Water+Turbidities%2C+2018+%E2%80%93+2022)

The average of peak daily raw water turbidity at the Peterson WTP for the period of study was 3.0 NTU, and on average the treatment process decreased this to 0.02 NTU, which equates to an average solids removal of 99.2 percent. Figure 5-33 shows a time series plot of raw and treated turbidities. It should be noted that the raw water turbidities plotted are a monthly average of peak daily grab samples. The treated water turbidities are a monthly average of a daily average, based on all 4-hr samples in a 24 hour period. Peterson WTP meets all current treated water turbidity standards.
