### IV. NEW BUSINESS

1. **2024 Board Officers (W & R)**  
   President Rich announced that the Board needed to nominate a new President and Vice President.  
   President Rich moved to elect Manuel Zamorano as Board President and Ted Costa as Vice President. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.  
   Director Rich passed the gavel to President Zamorano right before Agenda Item VII.

2. **RWA and Groundwater Banking (W & R)**  
   Director Costa reported that he asked that this item be placed on the agenda so that the Board can evaluate the District’s membership in RWA, specifically the cost versus results. The Board directed the General Manager to invite RWA to a future Board meeting. President Rich requested that the staff report for this item include the membership costs. Mr. Tom Gray commented that Fair Oaks Water District received. Ms. Silva commented that the District has received grant funds as well and will provide that information for the staff report.

### V. OLD BUSINESS

1. **Wholesale Financial Plan and Water Rate Study (W)**  
   Ms. Silva reviewed a staff report which was included in the Board packet and conducted a brief presentation. A copy of the presentation slides will be attached to the meeting minutes. She commented that staff does not recommend further reductions to the fixed cost determination of 83%, and setting the fixed rate lower than fixed costs could jeopardize the financial stability of the District.  
   President Rich opened the floor for public comments.  
   Mr. Josh Nelson, CHWD General Counsel, addressed the Board and mentioned the submission of the comment letter and of a Public Records Act request for background information on the proposed Wholesale Financial Plan. He voiced concern regarding the proposed rates and requested that the Board delay adoption of the proposed rates.  
   Mr. Ray Riehle, CHWD Board President, addressed the Board and requested that the Board work with the Wholesale Customer Agencies to arrive at the wholesale rates and not approve the proposed rates tonight.  
   Mr. Tom Gray, FOWD General Manager, addressed the Board and voiced concern regarding the operational problem with the proposed rate structure, including the disincentive to pump groundwater. He referenced the 2007 Wholesale Master Plan regarding groundwater wells. He requested that the Board wait to approve the rate schedule and work together to revise the proposed rate schedule.

Mr. Mike McRae, FOWD Board President, addressed the Board and voiced concern that the wholesale fixed costs are too high, regardless of the methodology to arrive at the fixed cost. He requested that the Board delay the vote regarding this item and suggested that the three boards meet to discuss this topic.

Mr. Chris Peterson, FOWD Vice President, addressed the Board and stated that he was pleased with the 2x2 meetings between FOWD and SJWD regarding discussions on conjunctive use between the agencies. He requested that the Board not vote on this item at this time and instead work with the Wholesale Customer Agencies to arrive at a common understanding and a decision that will encourage the agencies to come together for conjunctive use. In addition, he would like to see groundwater transfers addressed.

Ms. Jodi Ash, resident of Citrus Heights, addressed the Board and voiced concern regarding rate increases and requested that the Board delay their vote on this item.

Mr. Mike Nishimura, resident of Citrus Heights, addressed the Board and voiced concern that the SJWD Board is not taking CHWD customers into consideration with the proposed rates and requested that the Board think over and take this into account.

Mr. Bill Van Duker, resident of Citrus Heights, addressed the Board, expressing concern regarding the cost allocation plan, the SJWD responses, and the overall fairness to all the agencies.

Mr. Al Johnson, CHWD consultant, addressed the Board and voiced concern regarding agencies being charged only their fair share and objects to the shifting of costs from one service provider to another. In addition, he voiced concern that the recent recommendation for revising the rate study does not demonstrate a reasonable cost of service. He stated that the major concerns with the study are 1) Use more standard splits of cost allocation of staff time, 2) Increasing the fixed cost to 83% is too high, 3) The Wholesale Rate Schedule should use the 5-year rolling average, and 4) CHWD needs a 30-day window to notify customers of any pass-through rate increase. He, therefore, requested that the Board delay the vote on this item and stated that FOWD and CHWD are available to meet at any time to work through these issues.

Mr. McRae addressed President Rich’s comment regarding FOWD’s fixed charge percentage and stated that those who use the water should pay for the water.

In response to President Rich’s question, GM Helliker stated that the cost of services analysis has not changed and in July the fixed charges were decreased to 83% and the Wholesale Financial Plan was updated to reflect that change. In addition, he stated that, after discussions with the Wholesale Customer Agencies, staff recommended changing from the 10-year Peak analysis to the 10-year Average analysis for determining the Wholesale Rate Schedule. Furthermore, he stated that switching to the 5-year Rolling Average resulted in the relative proportion of costs to FOWD and CHWD decreased while that skewed the cost to be paid more by San.

Juan Retail for the last four years, so now changing to the 10-year Average reverses that action.

In response to President Rich’s question, Ms. Silva explained that the amount paid per acre foot depends upon how much water is taken; therefore, under the proposed 10-year Average Schedule, San Juan Retail pays the highest per acre for fixed costs, then CHWD, then FOWD, then Orange Vale and lastly City of Folsom. She explained that when the variable cost is added, then that scenario could change.

Mr. McRae suggested that the three boards meet to discuss this topic. In response to President Rich’s question, Ms. Silva informed the Board that she does not recommend delaying approval of the rate schedule for too long since inflation has increased, and rates have not been adjusted for three years. She explained that it is necessary to implement rate adjustments to keep up with inflation and the longer it is postponed, the greater the rate increases will need to be. In addition, she explained that the rates would become effective January 1, 2024, and the fixed quarterly charges are assessed for the 3 months going forward (January-March), and the water usage is billed in arrears. She informed the Board that they could adopt the rate schedule tonight, then have discussions with the other boards and amend the rates at a later date, subject to a 150-day notification period.

Director Miller voiced concern that on December 7th an 8-page comment letter, with 500+ attachments, was received essentially three working days prior to the Board meeting, followed by a request to push out the Board’s decision after a six-month comment period was already in effect. He voiced his disappointment in the lack of communication and that two San Juan Board members were pointed out in reference to approval of the 2007 Master Plan regarding wells being constructed at FOWD.

Director Costa commented that he would be willing to have a joint board meeting to discuss this topic if the Wholesale Customer Agencies wanted to set one up. In addition, he mentioned that banking water should be discussed.

Director Tobin commented that a joint board meeting should be held in a workshop format to discuss this topic and come to an agreement.

Vice President Zamorano commented that the rate schedule should be voted on tonight then continue to be discussed with the Wholesale Customer Agencies. President Rich commented that the Wholesale Customer Agencies want to review the background information on the rate study which will take time, and he does not expect that to be completed within a month.

President Rich moved to approve the Five-Year Wholesale Water Rate Schedule based on a 10-year average. Director Costa seconded the motion and it carried with 5 Aye votes and 1 No vote (Director Tobin).

Mr. Hildebrand commented that FOWD paying more per acre foot amounts to them being in transition from using more surface water to pumping more water. He explained that they are fundamentally changing how they use water, and it will take five to ten years before the average reflects that change. Ms. Silva commented that

1. if CHWD and FOWD continue to use groundwater on a long-term basis, then there could be a significant long-term impact to San Juan Retail.

2. **Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker reported that the 2x2 Ad Hoc committee with CHWD met on September 5th and groundwater banking was not addressed, and there are no future meetings scheduled. In addition, he reported that the 2x2 Ad Hoc committee with FOWD met on October 24th and directed Mr. Gray and him to set up a meeting of the general managers – that meeting has not been scheduled yet.

3. **2023 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker reviewed data which included the current reservoir storage levels across the state, data on releases, temperature and precipitation outlooks, and storage levels and projections at Folsom Reservoir.  
   GM Helliker reviewed the drought forecast, which showed this region to be in normal conditions. He informed the Board that Folsom Reservoir is projected to be at 406,000 acre feet by the end of December.

4. **Fiscal Year 2022-2023 Results of Operations – Budget to Actual (W & R)**  
   Ms. Silva provided a staff report which was included in the Board packet. She informed the Board that the independent audit is complete and she expects the auditors to meet with the Finance Committee in January. She informed the Board reported the following information for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023:

# AGENDA ITEM IV-4  
## STAFF REPORT  

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tony Barela, PE  
**Director of Operations**  
**Date:** January 24, 2024  
**Subject:** CCTM1 Lease Agreement Approval  

### Recommended Action  
Staff requests a Board motion to authorize the execution of a lease agreement between CCTM1, LLC (CCTM1) and San Juan Water District related to the property containing CCTM1’s cell tower and instrumentation. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Finance Committee, which recommends review and approval by the Board of Directors.  

### Background  
San Juan Water District (District) entered into an agreement with Pacific Bell Mobile Services, now CCTM1, LLC, on January 11, 1996, for an approximate 470 square foot easement located at the south end of the District’s main site (See Figure 1). The easement site contains CCTM1’s cellular tower and instrumentation. This contract is scheduled to expire in January 2026. Upon request from CCTM1, Staff engaged in negotiations for renewing their agreement for the next 30 years.  

The renewed agreement will extend the use of the site for 30 years and will expire in 2054. Staff evaluated possible conflicts with the easement location for future uses of the site and no conflicts were identified. Conditions of the agreement were negotiated and reviewed by Staff and the District’s legal counsel.

### Status  
Staff has completed negotiations with CCTM1 and CCTM1 has signed the agreement. Staff believes the negotiated conditions of the agreement are beneficial to the District and recommends approval. With approval, staff will execute and record the agreement as appropriate.

![STAFF REPORT](https://www.sjwd.org/files/76222f181d/Strategic+Plan+Adopted+032818.pdf)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** January 24, 2024  
**Subject:** Strategic Plan – Update Process  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Discussion  

**BACKGROUND**  
In 2018, after six months of analysis, workshops, various iterations of a range of documents and support from a strategic planning consultant, the San Juan Board of Directors adopted a Strategic Plan (Plan) to guide the District's operations. The Plan was intended to serve the District for a period of three to five years. Every year, staff prepare for Board approval an Operations Plan (Ops Plan), to complement the Plan, and define in more detail the specific priority tasks need to be accomplished in that year. Every quarter, the progress in accomplishing the tasks in the Ops Plan is reported via the Report Card prepared by District staff.

At the October 25, 2023, Board meeting, the Board agreed to update the strategic plan. The Board directed staff to review the current plan and propose revisions for the Board to consider. Staff have reviewed the current plan and believe that the foundation of the Plan is solid – the District’s mission, vision, values and high-level goals are not proposed to be changed. Staff reviewed the strategic plan objectives and propose various revisions. Staff also recommend deleting the metrics in the plan, as they have been superseded by the annual targets in the operations plans.

The draft updated strategic plan is attached, for Board review and discussion.

![FOREWORD](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=FOREWORD)

Welcome to the San Juan Water District's Strategic Plan. With its 150+ year history and now more than 60 years of operation as San Juan Water District, the District continues to provide reliable water supply for communities in Sacramento and Placer Counties. Meeting the needs of our customers for reliable, high quality water supplies in an ever-changing regulatory and hydrologic environment can be challenging and requires thoughtful planning, as elucidated in this Strategic Plan.

Our mission, vision and values are the foundation for our operations and articulate our dedication to high quality service and environmental protection. The Strategic Plan encompasses these elements and outlines the goals and objectives that we will pursue to meet our mission and achieve our vision. The Plan incorporates the principles of fiscal responsibility, customer service and operational excellence.

This plan is our roadmap for the next two to five years, and will guide our decisions on annual budgets and operating plans. The Board of Directors and District management and staff will implement these plans to ensure efficient and effective operations that meet our commitment to our retail and wholesale customers, and our goal of protecting our water rights and supplies for years to come. The District adopts annual operating plans to implement this strategic plan, which include performance metrics and target dates.

![District Overview](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=District+Overview)

**DISTRICT OVERVIEW**  
The San Juan Water District (District) began as the North Fork Ditch Company, which started providing water to the area in 1854. The San Juan Water District, as it exists today, was formed as the result of petitions being presented to the Board of Supervisors of Sacramento and Placer Counties by Citrus Heights Water District, Fair Oaks Water District, Orange Vale Water Company, and a group of homeowners in South Placer County. An election was then held within the boundaries of the sponsoring petitioners on February 10, 1954. At this election, voters approved the formation of the San Juan Water District by nearly a two-thirds majority and elected five Directors. The District is a community services district formed under Section 60000 et seq., Title 5, Division 3 of the California Government Code.

The District provides both wholesale and retail water service. The wholesale area (which includes the District’s 17 square mile retail area) covers approximately 46 square miles in northeastern Sacramento and southeastern Placer Counties. The District wholesales water to San Juan Retail, Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks Water Districts, Orange Vale Water Company, and to the City of Folsom for its customers north of the American River. The District serves a population of approximately 150,000 within its wholesale service area.

The District’s existing water supply consists of three separate raw water contracts. The first source of water is a settlement contract with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) that provides, in perpetuity, for the delivery of 33,000 acre-feet of water from the American River based upon the District’s water rights, which date from 1853 and 1928. The second source is a permanent repayment term contract with Reclamation for 24,200 acre-feet of Central Valley Project water, that expires February 28, 2045, but which can be renewed. The third source is a contract with Placer County Water Agency for up to 25,000 acre-feet of water. All sources of surface water are either stored or flow through Folsom Lake and delivery is taken at Folsom Dam outlets, either by gravity or pumped by Reclamation’s Folsom Pumping Plant.

# SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT COLLABORATIONS

“Through Orange Vale Water Company's collaborative relationship with San Juan Water District, the Wholesale Metering Project was a huge success. The new meters provided greater accuracy in monitoring water supply and demand for our customers, enhancing overall customer confidence.” — Sharon Wilcox, Former General Manager, Orange Vale Water Company

“Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) has enjoyed a long and successful relationship with San Juan Water District (SJWD). The districts have worked together on multiple fronts for many decades. With the construction of the Cooperative Transmission Pipeline (CTP) in 1996, and its extension, the Antelope-Transmission Pipeline, the water transmission systems of both districts were connected. Since these transmission pipelines were built, SSWD has treated SJWD surface water and delivered it to SJWD as part of a successful SSWD-conjunctive use program. In 2014 and 2015, a pump station on the CTP was constructed allowing SSWD’s groundwater supplies to be pumped into SJWD in extraordinary drought and emergency situations.” — Dan Bills, Finance Director, Sacramento Suburban Water District

“San Juan Water District was a founding member of the Regional Water Authority in 2001 and remains a valued partner to this day.” — John Woodling, Executive Director, Regional Water Authority

“Through our yearlong efforts, San Juan Water District and South Placer Fire Protection District managed a successful multi-agency effort to redefine how residential fire sprinkler systems are designed and installed to provide greater confidence in their life safety operation while reducing possible cross-connection water quality concerns for all new developments.” — Chief Mike Ritter, South Placer Fire Protection District

![GOALS](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=GOALS)

The District has adopted the following goals to guide its operations. Each of these goals tells us what we want to achieve and where we are going. The objectives that relate to each goal define what we need to accomplish in the near term. Each year, District staff prepare a budget and operational plan for approval by the Board, which allocate the resources and specify the tasks necessary to achieve these objectives. Finally, performance metrics define the quantifiable indicators which we will use to measure our progress in meeting these goals.

- Ensure Water Supply Reliability
- Optimize Operations, Maintenance, and Delivery for High Quality and Reliable Water
- Ensure Customer Service through Consistent Access and Timely Responsiveness
- Operate the District Sustainably and in a Financially Sound Manner while Maintaining a Fair Rate Structure
- Provide a Capable High Quality Work Force and Ensure a Safe Work Environment

**Date:** January 24, 2024  
**Subject:** San Juan and the Regional Water Authority  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Discussion  

**BACKGROUND**  
This item is to offer the Board an opportunity to discuss San Juan’s participation in the Regional Water Authority, including discussion of topics relevant to the Sacramento Groundwater Authority.

San Juan was one of the founding members of RWA and has participated in various subscription programs since the inception of the organization. San Juan currently provides funding for and participates in the water efficiency program and the groundwater bank program. San Juan had previously been a participant in the state legislative subscription program, which is now a core program (and in which San Juan’s representatives participate). San Juan also participates in the non-disclosure agreement collaboration on the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan/Voluntary Agreement, which is supported by RWA. San Juan’s dues are currently $68,400 per year, and its contribution to the water efficiency program is $15,703 in FY 23-24. San Juan has contributed $85,000 to the RWA member agency costs of the groundwater bank, which total $1,703,000 in the Phase 1 and 2 Agreements.

Some topics the Board may want to discuss:

- Development of the groundwater bank, certain proposed operating rules, and their relationship to the current operations of San Juan, its Wholesale Customer Agencies and its other partners
- The role of RWA in representing its Member Agencies’ positions on various issues
- The structure of the SGA Board of Directors and the process for designating such members

**Back to Agenda**  
**AGENDA ITEM V-4**  

**STAFF REPORT**  

To: Board of Directors  
From: Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
Date: January 24, 2024  
Subject: Analysis of Options for the Provision of Active and Retiree Health Insurance  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Receive report.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The San Juan Water District Board of Directors created an Ad Hoc Committee during discussions pertaining to the Compensation Study and Fiscal Year 2022-23 Budget Adoption. The committee was comprised of Directors Tobin and Costa. Their mission was to explore options for providing health care benefits to the District's active and retired employees at a lower cost than currently provided through CalPERS.  

The first meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee was held November 10, 2022. Representatives from the Association of California Water Agencies – Joint Powers Insurance Authority (ACWA-JPIA) attended and gave a presentation on the health care plans offered through their program.  

Staff was asked to prepare and provide an analysis of the District’s current health care benefits including:  
- A listing of the current plans being offered through CalPERS, along with premiums for those plans.  
- A listing of who uses which plans.  
- A listing of the plans offered through ACWA-JPIA.  
- A 10-year analysis of premiums for those plans by CalPERS and by ACWA-JPIA.  

The committee met again on January 18, 2023 and reviewed the results of the analysis. The general observations were:  
- ACWA-JPIA offers fewer plans than CalPERS, but more plans than our employees are currently using.  
- Only one plan was the same, Kaiser, which means that if we switched providers 21 of our 49 active employees and 27 of our 43 retirees would have to switch health plans. 52% of the total would have to switch health plans.  
- ACWA’s current and historical premiums were slightly less than CalPERS.  
<!-- Page 50 -->
- We had a laundry list of unanswered questions, including why ACWA-JPIA plans were lower in cost…was it because the health care plans offered aren’t as good?

Staff advised that it did not possess the technical expertise to make an in-depth comparison of the plans offered by CalPERS and ACWA-JPIA and would need consultant assistance.

The committee directed staff to engage a consultant to examine the plans offered by CalPERS and ACWA, to determine if there are other viable providers of health care coverage that may be cheaper than CalPERS and to assist in answering staff’s outstanding questions.

The Ad Hoc Committee met again on November 7, 2023. The consultant’s report, attached to this staff report, was provided to the committee members for their review. Staff gave the committee a verbal report, referencing the consultant’s report. The Committee requested that the same presentation be made to the full Board of Directors, which is the purpose of this agenda item.

The following verbal report was given to the committee:

On page 2 of the report, the consultant presented options including ACWA-JPIA, Prism and direct contracting with Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield and Kaiser.

Prism, another risk sharing pool like CalPERS and ACWA, did not have favorable pricing.

We could contract directly with Anthem Blue Cross or Blue Shield and Kaiser. However, they all require age-based premiums. This means that the premiums for younger employees are significantly less than they are for older employees and retirees. Rates are smoothed in CalPERS and ACWA. It would be difficult to provide an equal benefit to our employees when the dollar value of their premiums varies significantly. It would likely increase the cost of retiree medical. Also, we are not likely to get favorable pricing since we wouldn’t be in a risk sharing pool. Additionally, they all provide plans through CalPERS, at lower rates than what they would offer us directly. CalPERS is the largest pool in the State of California and the 2nd largest in the nation. They have a lot of buying and negotiating power. Quoting rates directly to agencies looking to leave CalPERS would not be a good business move for the plans that offer health care through CalPERS.

The only alternative that was deemed potentially attractive was ACWA-JPIA.

One of the primary questions we had was if the ACWA plans were cheaper because the plans were of a lesser quality. Starting on page 3, the consultant examined plan design and cost, by the PPO plans, the HMO plans and Kaiser.

ACWA JPIA initially looks cheaper by $2,698 which equates to a savings of 2-3%. But, there are some hurdles and challenges.

In his report, the consultant provided answers to some of the questions staff had regarding a
<!-- Page 51 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Potential+move+away+from+CalPERS)

**What does moving from CalPERS to ACWA-JPIA look like, what needs to happen and how would it be different:**

- **Timing:** CalPERS requires notice to be given within 60 days of the announcement of rates for the subsequent year. This usually happens in July. If the District decides to move to ACWA, it would give notice to CalPERS sometime between July and September of 2024, and the move would be effective January 1, 2025. Once you leave CalPERS you cannot come back for 5 years. According to one representative I spoke with at the CalPERS Education Forum, 95% of the agencies that leave the CalPERS Health Care System return after the 5-year waiting period.

- **Between now and then several things would need to happen:**
  - **The maximum District contribution is currently tied to a plan that ACWA-JPIA does not offer.** The Board would have two options:
    1. set the maximum contribution at the current amount, and index it to a California Health Care cost index, or
    2. Pick a plan offered by ACWA-JPIA that is substantially similar and use that as the new maximum.

    This change would apply to all active employees and all Tier 1 Retirees. This would need to be communicated to them and they would need to change plans. We did discover that we have addresses for the retirees, so we would have to mail the information to them and then take their calls and assist them through the change.

  - **You would need to evaluate your Tier 2 Retiree Medical Benefit.** It is currently tied to the Government Code through CalPERS. The District utilizes a vesting schedule embedded in the Government Code. Employees need to be with the District for at least 5 years before retiring. If they have at least 10 years with a CalPERS covered agency, and 5 years with the District they vest in 50% of the average of the premiums of the 3 most popular healthcare plans offered by the State of California. It goes up by 10% each year so that at 20 years they vest in 100% of that average premium for themselves and 90% for their spouse. The amount shifts each year. CalPERS currently tracks it and determines the benefit level for all Tier 2 retirees. If the retiree is responsible for a share of the premium, then CalPERS deducts it from their pension payment. They bill the District for our share of their premiums, along with the bill for active employees. If we moved to ACWA and kept this structure, staff would need to track and determine this average each year and bill the retirees for their share. Retirees would have to start paying their share monthly, instead of having it deducted.
<!-- Page 52 -->
from the pension payment and District would assume risk of non-collection and have to follow up on delinquencies and potentially make the decision to terminate a retirees health care for non-payment, should that happen.

The District could choose to restructure the way the benefit is determined, but it has to be a substantially similar benefit for the current Tier 2 retirees and the active Tier 2 employees. If it is changed significantly, it would require the creation of a 3rd tier, which gets harder to administer.

- The District would need to transfer its funds from the CalPERS OPEB Pre-funding trust into some other trust. We have not done any research on this yet. But if we leave CalPERS, we can’t utilize their pre-funding trust.

- We would need to complete the application process with ACWA. Entry into ACWA is not automatic. They have an application process which the District started just to determine if we would be accepted. The District has been conditionally accepted. Completing the process would require some changes be made, as follows:

  1. Terminate the Cash In Lieu program, ACWA does not allow it. Anyone currently using it could be grandfathered in, but no new utilization.

  2. Change Retiree Medical…ACWA JPIA requires a minimum contribution of 25%-50% of the lowest cost plan for the retiree. This could potentially increase our retiree medical costs. For example, if we have an employee who retires from SJWD after working here for 5 years, and previously worked for another CalPERS agency for 4 years, they are not entitled to retiree medical from SJWD. However, ACWA JPIA would require that we provide a lifetime benefit of 25%-50% of their lowest cost plan for the retiree, depending on which rate plan we are on with them. This could drive up retiree medical costs.

  3. ACWA JPIA requires there be no lapse in coverage from active employee status to retiree status. This is more restrictive than CalPERS. CalPERS allows someone 120 days post separation to file for retirement and retiree medical benefits. This is not allowed at ACWA. A retiring employee must determine what plan they want in retirement and enroll in that plan during the open enrollment period prior to retirement.

  4. Some other minor modifications or language changes would be needed.

In conclusion, there would be a heavy lift to make the change, for a fairly small savings. The most concerning challenge that I see, in addition to the lift involved in making the change, which will be difficult, but temporary, is the ongoing administrative burden relative to retiree medical.
<!-- Page 53 -->
Currently CalPERS handles it all. The only thing we do with retirees is pay the District's share of their monthly premium. It is billed to us on the same bill as the premiums for the active employees so there really isn’t any additional work for us.

ACWA JPIA does not do any administrative work for retirees. This means that the District has to do it all. This work involves:
- the annual determination and communication of the benefit amount to all retirees
- communicating plan and benefit amounts and retiree premium shares to retirees during the open enrollment period and processing any changes through ACWA
- preparing and sending monthly bills for retiree premium share – retirees suddenly have another monthly bill to manage
- following up on any unpaid premium shares with the retirees
- making determinations on what to do in the case of non-payment
- tracking the location of retirees and passing along address changes to ACWA
- tracking marriages, dependents and deaths of retirees and their families and reporting it to ACWA and adjusting the monthly billing accordingly
- District takes on risk of non-payment.

This is a significant workload that staff cannot absorb without additional assistance. As noted in the consultant’s report, there are third party administrators that can assist with this. I located and called 4 different companies. Only one of them called me back. We had a good discussion about our needs and determined that while they are very affordable, they really wouldn’t be of much help. They would serve as a middleman – we provide them with all the information, and they send the monthly invoices. If there are any changes needed, they communicate them to us, we communicate them to ACWA. It really wouldn’t be very helpful, and we would still be left with an increased workload.

We have been teetering on the edge of needing an HR position for years. It has been asked for in the past. We are managing, we are getting along meeting the basic HR needs of the District. This additional workload would push us over the edge. If the Board decides to make the move, I will need to request the Board approve the creation of an HR position.

Rather than switching providers and creating an HR position, the Committee determined that the District should continue offering health care benefits through CalPERS, and periodically review options.

### Conclusion:
Monthly water deliveries in the first half of the fiscal year have surpassed what was anticipated in the budget. The largest variances in deliveries come from Citrus Heights Water District, who has taken 758 acre feet, or 14.4% more than anticipated and deliveries of treated PCWA water to Sacramento Suburban Water District, which have exceeded expectations by 3,441 acre feet, a 62% variance. The positive variance in deliveries is generating revenues 14% higher than anticipated for the first six months of the year.

    - SB 3 passed in 2023
  - Stacy Q: Holden bill - did he contact anyone at ACWA before he introduced a new bill - Cindy, no he did not. Enviroworking group did not contact ACWA, but assures us that ACWA has a great relationship with that office.

  - ACWA over 470 members
  - ACWA's members are responsible for over 90% of the states distributed water

- **Bill Packet**
  - Prop 218 Proposal
    - Staff recommendation: sponsor ___ Motion Passes
    - Staff presentation:
      - Proposal is very similar to 2022
        - Brought to state leg from legal affairs cmte - intent is to protect against surprise law suits on rates where they don’t participate in public process and then file suit after the rates are adopted.
        - Would establish an optional process for agencies - to adopt protections so that potential litigants would be required to participate in the hearing process.
        - Agreement could not be reached with Mesa Water

      - What are the impacts of SB 323 - how has it worked?
        - Kris: We don’t have information on cases due to status of limitations period.
<!-- Page 84 -->
- Stacy: form mesa's POV - two areas of concern - (1) optics and politics - there should be an umbrella of protection (2) area of concern is the record evidence, not in alignment with the ACWA amicus procedure - Mesa board is concerned about removing a constitutional right - would like offer --- happy to meet with people who have such concerns

- AB 828: managed wetlands
  - Staff recommended position - is oppose ___ Majority in favor of opposing AB 828
  - Kris: have ACWA members on both sides. On the ground impact should this pass is minimum but the concern is the precedent that it sets - two water uses above others and potentially tees up future legislation should be successful on water uses.
  - Helen, guest: really narrowly tailored - (1) very small DAC farm worker community might be cut off from water supply (2) basins that have less than 1% of wetland available are being assessed very high fees.
    - 4,000 acres of wetlands in San Joaquin valley expected to be lost
    - Doesn't think ACWA would look good if ACWA opposes this bill
    - Bill does not provide unlimited exemptions
    - 4 year sunset
  - Brian Paulsen - Motion to watch the bill and seconded
    - It is controversial among our agencies - we just need to wait and watch in as things develop further
  - Bob Reeb - groundwater pumpers are part of the problem - they should participate in part of the SGMA implementation as was negotiated when SGMA was put into law.
    - Urges committee to stay with opposed staff recommendations
  - Substitute motion to: Oppose from Deanna Jackson and seconded
  - Bring the bill back to cmte and also form a work group

### 1. Presentation of Independent Audit Results by DavisFarr, Certified Public Accountants - Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2023 (W & R)  
Ms. Silva introduced Jennifer Farr from DavisFarr, Certified Public Accountants, and explained that they conducted the independent audit of the District’s financials for fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. Ms. Farr reviewed the timeline of the audit and reported that they issued an unmodified audit opinion on the financial statements. She explained that included in their opinion there is an emphasis of a matter for implementation of a new accounting standard for subscription based information technology agreements.

Ms. Farr reviewed the areas of focus for the audit, the new subscription based information technology agreements accounting standard, the financial statement highlights, and internal controls. She informed the committee that there was one journal entry that they requested be made and that was to record that the old Hinkle Reservoir Cover and Lining was taken out of service and disposed of in FY 2022-23.

Ms. Farr informed the committee that there were no instances of noncompliance and that District staff were prepared for the audit and responsive to their inquiries – she commended staff for their high level of competency.

In response to Director Costa’s question regarding cyber security and the District’s risk of not having certain safe guards in the system for coverage, Ms. Silva explained that the District is covered by ACWA JPIA cyber insurance, which includes revenue coverage for six months in the event of a loss. She explained that the application for cyber insurance requested information regarding the District’s IT security and since the District was approved for coverage then that means the District meets their requirements for coverage.

In response to Director Miller’s question regarding the significant risks identified on page 2 of the management letter, Ms. Silva explained that there was a new accounting pronouncement to implement this year regarding the subscription based information technology agreements, and the auditors include this as a risk in case the District is unaware of the requirement to implement this standard. In addition, she explained that

**Finance Committee Meeting Minutes**  
**January 16, 2024**  
**Page 2**

1. **Review General Manager Reimbursements (W & R)**  
   The committee reviewed the November credit card charges for the General Manager and found them to be in order and there was no reimbursement request from the General Manager.

2. **Review Check Register from December 2023 (W & R)**  
   The committee reviewed the December 2023 check register and found them to be in order. Director Miller requested the total expenses per Board member be supplied to the committee.

3. **CCTM1 Lease Agreement Approval (W & R)**  
   Mr. Barela reviewed the staff report which was provided to the committee members. He reported that he compared the proposed future rates with Sacramento Suburban Water District, PCWA and City of Folsom, and found them to be in alignment with recent lease agreements completed by those agencies. The fee schedule is reflected in the staff report. Ms. Silva pointed out that, since this is a 30-year contract, the agreement was carefully defined so that future staff are clear on the terms of the agreement.

   Mr. Barela reviewed the contract, the site location, and the addition of subletting included in the agreement. He explained that the District will receive a portion of any subletting revenue. In response to Director Miller’s question, Mr. Barela explained that if there are any modifications made to the tower then the contract requires them to contact the District. In addition, their tower cannot interfere with District communications. In response to Director Costa’s comment on accessing the 2 MW of power, Mr. Barela explained that is a separate facility and is not related to the cell tower leases.

   In response to Director Miller’s comment on allocation of the revenue from the cell tower leases, Ms. Silva explained that she had not seen anything regarding this, as it was before she began at the District; however, when she consolidated the reserves, the allocation was probably removed and the revenue has been allocated to the Wholesale and Retail Operating funds. In addition, she explained that the only source of revenue that has an external restriction on it is a portion of the Retail Capital Facility Fee. GM Helliker mentioned that under Prop. 218, there are constraints that the District has to follow regarding the fact that water rates have to be used to cover the cost of running the District.

   The Finance Committee recommends consideration of a motion to approve the execution of a lease agreement with CCTM1, LLC related to the property containing CCTM1’s cell tower and instrumentation.

4. **Other Finance Matters (W & R)**  
   There were no other matters discussed.

5. **Public Comment**

The meeting was adjourned at 4:41 p.m.
