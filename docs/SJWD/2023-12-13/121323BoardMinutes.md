### IV. NEW BUSINESS

1. **2024 Board Officers (W & R)**  
   President Rich announced that the Board needed to nominate a new President and Vice President.  
   President Rich moved to elect Manuel Zamorano as Board President and Ted Costa as Vice President. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.  
   Director Rich passed the gavel to President Zamorano right before Agenda Item VII.

2. **RWA and Groundwater Banking (W & R)**  
   Director Costa reported that he asked that this item be placed on the agenda so that the Board can evaluate the District’s membership in RWA, specifically the cost versus results. The Board directed the General Manager to invite RWA to a future Board meeting. President Rich requested that the staff report for this item include the membership costs. Mr. Tom Gray commented that Fair Oaks Water District received. Ms. Silva commented that the District has received grant funds as well and will provide that information for the staff report.

### V. OLD BUSINESS

1. **Wholesale Financial Plan and Water Rate Study (W)**  
   Ms. Silva reviewed a staff report which was included in the Board packet and conducted a brief presentation. A copy of the presentation slides will be attached to the meeting minutes. She commented that staff does not recommend further reductions to the fixed cost determination of 83%, and setting the fixed rate lower than fixed costs could jeopardize the financial stability of the District.  
   President Rich opened the floor for public comments.  
   Mr. Josh Nelson, CHWD General Counsel, addressed the Board and mentioned the submission of the comment letter and of a Public Records Act request for background information on the proposed Wholesale Financial Plan. He voiced concern regarding the proposed rates and requested that the Board delay adoption of the proposed rates.  
   Mr. Ray Riehle, CHWD Board President, addressed the Board and requested that the Board work with the Wholesale Customer Agencies to arrive at the wholesale rates and not approve the proposed rates tonight.  
   Mr. Tom Gray, FOWD General Manager, addressed the Board and voiced concern regarding the operational problem with the proposed rate structure, including the disincentive to pump groundwater. He referenced the 2007 Wholesale Master Plan regarding groundwater wells. He requested that the Board wait to approve the rate schedule and work together to revise the proposed rate schedule.

Mr. Mike McRae, FOWD Board President, addressed the Board and voiced concern that the wholesale fixed costs are too high, regardless of the methodology to arrive at the fixed cost. He requested that the Board delay the vote regarding this item and suggested that the three boards meet to discuss this topic.

Mr. Chris Peterson, FOWD Vice President, addressed the Board and stated that he was pleased with the 2x2 meetings between FOWD and SJWD regarding discussions on conjunctive use between the agencies. He requested that the Board not vote on this item at this time and instead work with the Wholesale Customer Agencies to arrive at a common understanding and a decision that will encourage the agencies to come together for conjunctive use. In addition, he would like to see groundwater transfers addressed.

Ms. Jodi Ash, resident of Citrus Heights, addressed the Board and voiced concern regarding rate increases and requested that the Board delay their vote on this item.

Mr. Mike Nishimura, resident of Citrus Heights, addressed the Board and voiced concern that the SJWD Board is not taking CHWD customers into consideration with the proposed rates and requested that the Board think over and take this into account.

Mr. Bill Van Duker, resident of Citrus Heights, addressed the Board, expressing concern regarding the cost allocation plan, the SJWD responses, and the overall fairness to all the agencies.

Mr. Al Johnson, CHWD consultant, addressed the Board and voiced concern regarding agencies being charged only their fair share and objects to the shifting of costs from one service provider to another. In addition, he voiced concern that the recent recommendation for revising the rate study does not demonstrate a reasonable cost of service. He stated that the major concerns with the study are 1) Use more standard splits of cost allocation of staff time, 2) Increasing the fixed cost to 83% is too high, 3) The Wholesale Rate Schedule should use the 5-year rolling average, and 4) CHWD needs a 30-day window to notify customers of any pass-through rate increase. He, therefore, requested that the Board delay the vote on this item and stated that FOWD and CHWD are available to meet at any time to work through these issues.

Mr. McRae addressed President Rich’s comment regarding FOWD’s fixed charge percentage and stated that those who use the water should pay for the water.

In response to President Rich’s question, GM Helliker stated that the cost of services analysis has not changed and in July the fixed charges were decreased to 83% and the Wholesale Financial Plan was updated to reflect that change. In addition, he stated that, after discussions with the Wholesale Customer Agencies, staff recommended changing from the 10-year Peak analysis to the 10-year Average analysis for determining the Wholesale Rate Schedule. Furthermore, he stated that switching to the 5-year Rolling Average resulted in the relative proportion of costs to FOWD and CHWD decreased while that skewed the cost to be paid more by San.

Juan Retail for the last four years, so now changing to the 10-year Average reverses that action.

In response to President Rich’s question, Ms. Silva explained that the amount paid per acre foot depends upon how much water is taken; therefore, under the proposed 10-year Average Schedule, San Juan Retail pays the highest per acre for fixed costs, then CHWD, then FOWD, then Orange Vale and lastly City of Folsom. She explained that when the variable cost is added, then that scenario could change.

Mr. McRae suggested that the three boards meet to discuss this topic. In response to President Rich’s question, Ms. Silva informed the Board that she does not recommend delaying approval of the rate schedule for too long since inflation has increased, and rates have not been adjusted for three years. She explained that it is necessary to implement rate adjustments to keep up with inflation and the longer it is postponed, the greater the rate increases will need to be. In addition, she explained that the rates would become effective January 1, 2024, and the fixed quarterly charges are assessed for the 3 months going forward (January-March), and the water usage is billed in arrears. She informed the Board that they could adopt the rate schedule tonight, then have discussions with the other boards and amend the rates at a later date, subject to a 150-day notification period.

Director Miller voiced concern that on December 7th an 8-page comment letter, with 500+ attachments, was received essentially three working days prior to the Board meeting, followed by a request to push out the Board’s decision after a six-month comment period was already in effect. He voiced his disappointment in the lack of communication and that two San Juan Board members were pointed out in reference to approval of the 2007 Master Plan regarding wells being constructed at FOWD.

Director Costa commented that he would be willing to have a joint board meeting to discuss this topic if the Wholesale Customer Agencies wanted to set one up. In addition, he mentioned that banking water should be discussed.

Director Tobin commented that a joint board meeting should be held in a workshop format to discuss this topic and come to an agreement.

Vice President Zamorano commented that the rate schedule should be voted on tonight then continue to be discussed with the Wholesale Customer Agencies. President Rich commented that the Wholesale Customer Agencies want to review the background information on the rate study which will take time, and he does not expect that to be completed within a month.

President Rich moved to approve the Five-Year Wholesale Water Rate Schedule based on a 10-year average. Director Costa seconded the motion and it carried with 5 Aye votes and 1 No vote (Director Tobin).

Mr. Hildebrand commented that FOWD paying more per acre foot amounts to them being in transition from using more surface water to pumping more water. He explained that they are fundamentally changing how they use water, and it will take five to ten years before the average reflects that change. Ms. Silva commented that
<!-- Page 6 -->

if CHWD and FOWD continue to use groundwater on a long-term basis, then there could be a significant long-term impact to San Juan Retail.

2. Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker reported that the 2x2 Ad Hoc committee with CHWD met on September 5th and groundwater banking was not addressed, and there are no future meetings scheduled. In addition, he reported that the 2x2 Ad Hoc committee with FOWD met on October 24th and directed Mr. Gray and him to set up a meeting of the general managers – that meeting has not been scheduled yet.

3. 2023 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed data which included the current reservoir storage levels across the state, data on releases, temperature and precipitation outlooks, and storage levels and projections at Folsom Reservoir.

GM Helliker reviewed the drought forecast, which showed this region to be in normal conditions. He informed the Board that Folsom Reservoir is projected to be at 406,000 acre feet by the end of December.

4. Fiscal Year 2022-2023 Results of Operations – Budget to Actual (W & R)  
Ms. Silva provided a staff report which was included in the Board packet. She informed the Board that the independent audit is complete and she expects the auditors to meet with the Finance Committee in January. She informed the Board reported the following information for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023:

3. Unique charge to City of Folsom for debt that was formed after the 2012 bond.
