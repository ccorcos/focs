### IV. OLD BUSINESS
1. **Wholesale Financial Plan (W)**  
   Ms. Silva reported that a meeting was held last week to discuss the Wholesale Financial Plan, as part of the 150-day comment period. The attendees included representatives from Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks water districts, SJWD’s rate consultant (Mark Hildebrand), and the agencies’ rate consultant, along with GM Helliker and herself. They discussed the comments that were submitted and the issues that the agencies had regarding the Wholesale Financial Plan.

   Ms. Silva informed the Board that the District’s methodology and cost allocation were discussed and that staff indicated to the agencies that no potential ideas or recommendations for a different methodology were received. She noted that she told the agencies that the District would be open to reviewing alternative methods, provided that they did not include allocation of fixed costs based on projected future water use or continuing an allocation based on a rolling five-year average of water use. She commented that the District wants stability in the allocation of the fixed charge.

   Ms. Silva informed the Board that the idea of a “Take or Pay” contract was discussed, and staff informed the agencies to put together a proposal for such a contract. She explained that the Board will be reviewing the five-year rate schedule at the December Board meeting, so there is not much time to make substantial changes to contracts. She informed the Board that the agencies asked if there was any flexibility in the deadline and staff indicated that some flexibility into January might be considered; however, she pointed out that the District has not adjusted wholesale rates for almost three years. Therefore, staff recommends that the Board consider adopting the proposed five-year rate schedule either in December or January while continuing any further conversations with the wholesale customer agencies.

   GM Helliker informed the Board that he gave the agencies until November 17th to present any proposals. In response to President Rich’s question regarding adopting a one-year schedule then amending it later, Ms. Silva explained that there is no benefit in that and suggested that the Board consider the full five-year schedule then amend that schedule if needed.

![November 8, 2023, Board Minutes Page 3](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=November+8%2C+2023%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+3)

The Board discussed the timing of the 150-day notice and expressed concern that the agencies waited so long to provide any comments. GM Helliker explained that staff will review/analyze any proposals received, then have further discussion with the agencies to consider how to incorporate any of their requests before bringing the item to the Board for review at the December 13th Board meeting.

In response to Director Costa’s question, GM Helliker explained that the agencies challenged the use of the peak value and that Mr. Hildebrand explained at the meeting that his experience with rate structures has been that they more commonly use long term averages rather than peak demands during a certain period of time. However, Mr. Hildebrand informed the agencies that the District’s use of peak value is not unusual and is an industry-accepted methodology. GM Helliker explained that he informed the agencies that if they wanted to implement a “Take or Pay” contract, such a contract would have to be reviewed by Legal Counsel and would have to be approved by all of the wholesale customer agencies. GM Helliker informed the Board that he provided the agencies with some examples of other agencies’ methodologies.

GM Helliker informed the Board that a Public Records Act request was received after the meeting for records pertaining to the Wholesale Financial Plan, to which staff will respond. Director Miller voiced concern regarding the July notification which provided ample time for comments to be received and suggested that the Board move forward with reviewing and setting the rate schedule at the December Board meeting.

2. Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker reported that the 2x2 FOWD/SJWD Ad Hoc Committee met a few weeks ago and he was directed to set up a meeting with the general managers but has not received any responses yet. Director Costa would like to put on the December Board meeting agenda, for discussion and possible action, an item regarding groundwater banking and RWA to discuss if RWA is meeting the District’s needs. In addition, Director Costa suggested that GM Helliker invite RWA to the Board meeting.

GM Helliker reported that the RWA Program Committee met last week and the same information regarding the water accounting system that was presented at the 2x2 committee meeting with FOWD was presented at the RWA meeting. GM Helliker stated that it is important that the District and its sister agencies define the operating rules that would be acceptable and then compare them with any proposal from RWA. He informed the Board that RWA held two public meetings with little to no attendees, so they asked for input from responsible agencies, and received no input. Therefore, RWA is moving forward with an environmental impact report (EIR), which has raised questions, since there is no specific project that would merit an EIR. In response to Director Costa’s comments, GM Helliker informed the Board that SGA discussed the water bank and RWA’s concepts, as well as SGA’s responsibilities, at their meeting last month.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Andrew Pierson, Director of Engineering Services  
**Date:** December 13, 2023  
**Subject:** Bacon Pump Facility Generator Replacement Project, ICM Amendment No. 1  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests a recommendation from the Committee for a Board motion to authorize the Director of Engineering Services to approve Amendment No. 1 to the professional services contract with Inferra Construction Management Group, Inc. (ICM) for inspection services related to the construction of the Bacon Pump Facility Generator Replacement Project (Project) in the amount of $48,993 with a construction contingency of $9,812 (10%) for a total authorized budget of $107,935.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
The Project consists of the replacement of two existing emergency diesel generators located at the District's Bacon Pump Facility. Construction includes the removal and disposal of the existing generators, demolition of existing slabs, site grading, new concrete foundations, new diesel generators (400 kW and 600 kW), new electrical panels, new conduits and wires, and the relocation of an existing storm drain. The new generation system will follow all regulatory requirements and is sized to provide emergency system support during a power outage at the site. The construction contract was awarded on April 27, 2022, and the notice to proceed was given on May 13, 2023. Due to delays in acquiring the generators and electrical panels, project construction did not begin until May 2023.

Since starting construction, the Contractor has encountered the following unforeseen conditions which has resulted in additional inspection time for ICM:

- Unanticipated delays in generator deliveries resulting in inefficiency of construction or installation work.
- Encountered unknown utilities, rock, and groundwater during installation of new storm drain.
- Encountered conflict between existing abandoned storm drain and new generator foundation.
- Encountered rock and conflict with existing 42-in water main during construction of electrical conduit runs.
- Unanticipated time for installation of conduits and wires for ARC-N Pump Station.
- Unanticipated troubleshooting time during ARC-N Pump Station equipment integration and conduit installation.

---

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
The Project is included in the District's Retail CIP budget for Fiscal Year 2023-2024.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** December 13, 2023  
**Subject:** Wholesale Financial Plan and Water Rate Update Study  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Approve the revised and attached five-year Wholesale Rate Schedule. Direct staff to revise the Wholesale Financial Plan and Rate Study to incorporate the revised rate schedule.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The San Juan Water District’s (SJWD or the District) Wholesale Financial Plan was last updated in 2017, resulting in a five-year rate schedule, which implemented rate increases through January 2021. In that rate structure, 74% of the revenue requirements were to be recovered through fixed rates and 26% through the variable rate. The majority of the fixed service charge was allocated to each agency based upon their average water deliveries during calendar years 2012-2016. The Debt Service charge was based upon water use in the five years preceding the debt issuance and a small portion of fixed costs were allocated based upon the relative number of customer accounts. Commencing in January 2020 the fixed service charge was re-allocated each calendar year based upon the rolling 5-year average of water deliveries, at the request of the Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks Water Districts (CHWD and FOWD). Under this new methodology, the total amount of revenue to be collected via the service charge remained as set by the Financial Plan, but the allocation changed each January based upon the past five years of water deliveries per agency. Furthermore, the debt service charges were both reduced to reflect savings from debt refinancings and were consolidated into the fixed service charge, instead of being separately billed.  

Wholesale water rates were last increased, in aggregate, in January 2021. In May 2022, the District retained Hildebrand Consulting, LLC. to update the District’s ten-year wholesale financial plan and to develop recommendations for updating water rates for a five-year period from 2024 through 2028. The purpose of the study was to ensure that the District’s wholesale water system continues to meet financial obligations for ongoing operations and maintenance, debt service and capital improvements while maintaining prudent reserves. The project was delayed while the District worked to substantially complete its Wholesale Master Plan, which produces the 10-Year Capital Improvement Plan, a critical component to the financial plan and rate study.  

The Board has discussed The Wholesale Financial Plan and Water Rate Update four times as follows:  
- May 24, 2023: discussed assumptions to be used in the study.
<!-- Page 12 -->
- June 28, 2023: Draft Wholesale Financial Plan and Rate Study was presented to the Board.
- July 26, 2023: Staff reported back to the Board on issues raised at the previous Board meeting.
- November 8, 2023: Staff provided an update to the Board after the stakeholder meeting held on November 1st.

The required 150-Day notice of a proposed change in rates was sent to the customer agencies on July 14, 2023. Staff offered to meet and discuss the proposed financial plan and rate study. The following comments have been received:

- June 27, 2023: Letter from CHWD and FOWD to SJWD Board Members:
  - Requested SJWD consider delaying moving forward with the plan for at least 60 days so the plan could be revised.
  - Alleged that SJWD is proposing to subsidize its retail area at the expense of the remaining wholesale service area.
  - Alleged the proposed financial plan purposefully creates a disincentive for the customers that have invested in groundwater infrastructure to pump groundwater to meet customer demand.
  - Expressed dissatisfaction with the change in fixed vs. variable rates and the proposed allocation methodology.
  - Suggests that SJWD should provide an offset for groundwater pumped.
  - Alleges the approach taken in the financial plan and rate structure is neither reasonable nor legal.

- June 28, 2023: comment letter distributed at the SJWD Board meeting, reiterating the above points.

- Comments received at SJWD’s June 28, 2023 Board meeting:
  - Mike McRae, FOWD Board President, voiced concern over the rate structure change and the proposed rate increase. He stated there is a conflict of interest for the SJWD Board members who live in the retail service area, to service both the wholesale and retail customers. He requested the Board keep the rate structure the same and be as ethical as the Board possibly could be.
  - Ray Riehle, CHWD Director, voiced concern over using 2013 as a peak year since he doesn’t believe it is reflective of CHWD’s future water use. He advised that usage over the last five years, or even since 2014, is more reflective of what CHWD usage will be moving forward. Mr. Riehle suggested that the District smooth the curve by distributing the rate structure change over the course of several years.
  - Tom Gray, FOWD General Manager suggested revisiting take or pay contracts instead of the current contracts. He further suggested that the Wholesale Master Plan be completed with the comments being addressed before the financial plan is completed.

- August 17, 2023: received an email from Jeff Ott, Director of Finance and Administration, Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD). Mr. Ott commented that the draft Wholesale Financial Plan and rate study failed to remove the

- September 26, 2023: met with Joe Duran, General Manager of the Orange Vale Water Company (OVWC) to discuss the project specific, proposed Capital Facility Fee for the OVWC.
- November 1, 2023: meeting between SJWD staff and wholesale customer agencies.
- November 22, 2023: received an email from CHWD consultant requesting SJWD review a financial impact analysis spreadsheet prepared by their rate consultant.
- December 7, 2023: received an email from CHWD and FOWD with a link to their 8-page comment letter (which also included 536 pages of attachments). The letter can be viewed at this link: [https://www.imanageshare.com/pd/48ACRT6MSAE](https://www.imanageshare.com/pd/48ACRT6MSAE)

Based on feedback from the SJWD Board of Directors, the following changes have previously been made to the draft Wholesale Financial Plan and Rate Study and presented to the Board of Directors:

1. Replaced the 6% inflation assumption for FY 2023-24 with FY 2023-24 Adopted Budget.
2. Reduced fixed portion of expenses from 88% to 83%.

Based on feedback from SSWD the following change has been made to the proposed rate schedule:

3. Corrected SSWD Treat and Wheel rate. The amendment to the agreement with SSWD was done nine months after the Board accepted the 2017 Financial Plan and Rate Study and approved the five-year rate schedule. Staff forgot to provide Hildebrand Consulting with the amended agreement. He was not aware of the contractual obligation to burden the source of supply costs with administrative costs before subtracting it from the rate calculation. The correction has been made and a revised report has been provided to SSWD. No further comments have been received from SSWD.

Based on comments received from the customer agencies staff recommends the following changes be incorporated into the Financial Plan and Rate Study:

4. The capital facility fee for the OVWC was designed to cover the costs of replacing the 12-inch transmission pipeline on Hazel Avenue, from Eden Oaks to the OVWC. Since this pipeline only serves the OVWC it reasonably should bear the cost of replacement. This project was slated to begin in 2024. In the September 26, 2023 meeting with OVWC it was discussed that as an alternative, OVWC could assume ownership of the pipeline and replace it on their timeline. With the recent departure of Joe Duran from the OVWC, and no apparent pressing need to commence the project, staff recommends the Board approve the capital facility fee, but direct staff to first charge the fee in the year that design commences. Staff intends to delay the design until a new General Manager is on Board and ready to commence negotiations over the project and the pipeline.

5. In response to the concerns expressed by the CHWD and FOWD, staff recommends changing the fixed charge allocation methodology from a 10-year peak, to a 10-year average. This change accommodates SJWD’s desire to have the allocation based on long term water use, and to ease the administrative burden, but acknowledges the desire of CHWD and FOWD to have recent water use trends be incorporated into the allocation methodology.

As discussed in previous Board meetings, staff does not recommend further reductions to the fixed cost determination of 83%. Setting the fixed rate lower than fixed costs leads to financial instability. 83% is already an aggressive estimate of the District’s fixed wholesale costs.

In the November 1, 2023 stakeholder meeting, staff communicated to the customer agencies that they would be willing review proposed draft take or pay contracts. General Manager Paul Helliker advised those would need to be provided to the District by November 17, 2023, to allow staff time to evaluate them and prepare them for consideration by the Board at its December 13, 2023 meeting. As of the writing of this report, draft take or pay contracts have not been received. However, staff are still willing to evaluate such alternatives, even after the Board approves the recommended rate schedule.

The proposed change in allocation of the fixed service charge has the following impacts:

### 10-Year Peak vs. 10-Year Average Allocation %'s

| Member Agency | 10-Year Peak Methodology Alloc. % | 10-Year Average Methodology Alloc. % | Change in Allocation % |
|---------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| SJWD-R        | 14,743                             | 31.86%                               | 11,950                  | 33.76%                 | 1.90%                  |

| City of Folsom| 1,507                              | 3.26%                                | 1,180                   | 3.30%                  | 0.08%                  |

The change in “allocation percents” does not have an equal percentage change effect on the dollar amount of the quarterly service charge that would be assessed. The change in allocation methodology has the following dollar impacts per agency:

### Quarterly Fixed Charge

| Member Agency | 10-Year Peak Methodology | 10-Year Average Methodology | difference | % Difference |

## 2023 Wholesale Water Rate Study  
### Introduction  

## Section 1. INTRODUCTION  

The San Juan Water District (“SJWD” or “District”) retained Hildebrand Consulting, LLC. to update the District’s ten-year wholesale financial plan and develop recommendations for annually updating water rates for a five-year period from calendar year (CY) 2024 through 2028. The purpose of this Study was to ensure that the District’s wholesale water system continues to meet financial obligations for ongoing operation and maintenance, debt service, and capital improvements while maintaining prudent reserves. This report describes in detail the assumptions, procedures, and results of the Study, including conclusions and recommendations.  

### 1.1 UTILITY BACKGROUND  

The District is a community services district formed under Section 61000 et seq., Title 5, Division 3 of the California Government Code. The District provides both wholesale and retail water service. The wholesale area (which includes the District’s 17 square mile retail area) covers approximately forty-six square miles in northeastern Sacramento and southeastern Placer Counties. The District wholesales water to five “member agencies”: San Juan Water District Retail, Citrus Heights Water District, Fair Oaks Water District, Orangevale Water Company, and the City of Folsom (for its customers north of the American River).  

The District’s existing water supply consists of three separate raw water contracts. The first source of water is a settlement contract with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) that provides, in perpetuity, for the delivery of 33,000 acre-feet of water from the American River based upon the District’s water rights, which date from 1853 and 1928. The second source is a repayment contract with Reclamation for 24,200 acre-feet of Central Valley Project water. The third source is a contract with Placer County Water Agency for up to 25,000 acre-feet of water. All sources of surface water are either

## 1.2 PROJECT BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY

The District’s last Wholesale Water rate study was conducted by The Reed Group in 2017 and the last rate adjustment was made in January of 2021.

The scope of this Study is to prepare a multi-year financial plan, review the allocation of costs to member agencies, and propose a 5-year rate schedule. The primary objectives of this Study are to:

i. Develop a multi-year financial plan that integrates operational and capital project funding needs with a funding strategy.

ii. Identify future annual adjustments to water rates to help ensure adequate revenues to meet the District’s ongoing financial obligations.

iii. Update the cost of providing water service using industry-accepted methodologies.

iv. Recommend specific updates to the District’s existing rate structures in order to ensure that the District is equitably recovering the cost of service and comporting with industry standards¹ and California’s legal requirements.

One focus of this 2023 wholesale water financial plan is to help ensure adequate funding of the District’s wholesale capital improvement program (CIP). The CIP includes a $23 million project to replace the cover and liner of the Hinkle Reservoir. The financial plan presented herein indicates the funding of the debt that was issued in 2023 to fund this.

---

¹ As promulgated the American Water Work Association (AWWA) M1 Manual: Principles of Water Rates, Fees and Charges: Manual of Water Supply Practices M1, (7th edition), which documents many of the standards used by professionals in the utility rate-setting industry.

Introduction  

capital program. Based on financial plan analyses, all other planned capital improvement projects over the next 10 years can be funded on a pay-as-you-go basis.

In other respects, the wholesale financial plan provides a strategy for maintaining sufficient reserves to cash fund most capital projects in the future.

Wholesale water rate calculations were updated based on the revenue needs developed through the financial planning process. The cost allocation methodology used in the rate calculations is consistent with past studies, with the exception of the following modifications.

1) While the wholesale water rates will continue to include a uniform water usage charge and fixed service charge, this Study proposed to ensure that all of the District’s fixed costs are recovered through the fixed service charges. This completes a shift in this direction that was started in the 2017 Wholesale Rate Study. Fixed costs are considered to be any cost that does not increase or decrease in direct response to increases or decreases in water deliveries. This Study has found that about 83 percent of the District’s revenue requirements are fixed costs.

2) While the 2017 Wholesale Rate Study had a separate fixed charge for debt service obligations, this Study proposes to have all fixed costs paid by a single fixed charge (as has been the District’s practice over the past few years).

3) While variable rates are clearly charged based on actual water deliveries to each member agency, the allocation of fixed costs has been a source of debate. The 2017 Wholesale Rate Study proposed to allocate fixed costs based primarily on the average water usage by each member agency over the previous 5 years. Since that time, the District has agreed to allocate fixed costs based on each agency’s most recent five-year average water usage. This Study proposes to allocate fixed costs based on each agency’s peak annual water usage over the past 10 years. A more detailed explanation is provided in Section 3.2.

Continuing with current practices, fixed service charges as well as capital facilities charges (see Section 4), will be billed to each member agency on a quarterly basis in

advance, and water usage charges will be billed in arrears following the end of each quarter based on the actual water used during the quarter.

During the course of this Study, preliminary results and recommendations were presented to the District’s Board of Directors. In addition, member agencies were provided with a 150-day period during which to comment on this report. This report reflects consideration of comments received from member agencies, new information that became available since prior drafts, as well as direction provided by the District’s Board of Directors and staff.

1.3 STUDY METHODOLOGY  
This Study applied methodologies that are aligned with industry standard practices for rate setting as laid out in the AWWA M1 Manual and all applicable law. The study began with a review of the District’s current financial dynamics and latest available data for the District’s operations. A multi-year financial management plan then was developed to determine the level of annual rate revenue required to cover projected annual operating expenses, debt service (including coverage targets), and capital cost requirements while maintaining adequate reserves. This portion of the Study was conducted using an MS Excel®-based financial planning model which was customized to reflect financial dynamics and latest available data for the District’s operations in order to develop a long-term financial management plan, inclusive of projected annual revenue requirements and corresponding annual rate adjustments. The financial plan is a cash-flow model and differs from standard accounting income statements and balance sheets which include non-cash accounting such as depreciation expense.

Revenue requirements calculated for fiscal year ending June 2024 (FY 2023/24)2 were then used to perform a detailed cost-of-service analysis (COSA). The COSA and rate

# Section 2. WHOLESALE FUND FINANCIAL PLAN

This section presents the Wholesale System’s 10-year Financial Plan, including a description of the source data, assumptions, and the District’s financial policies. The District provided historical and budgeted financial information, including historical and budgeted operating costs, a multi-year capital improvement program (CIP), and outstanding debt service obligations. District staff also assisted in providing other assumptions and policies, such as reserve targets and escalation rates for operating costs (all of which are described in the following subsections).

The 10-year financial plan was developed through several interactive work sessions with District staff. As a result of this process, the Study has produced a robust financial plan that will enable the District to meet its future revenue requirements and achieve financial performance objectives throughout the projection period while striving to minimize rate increases.

The financial plan reflects assumptions and estimates believed reasonable at the present time. However, conditions change. It is recommended that the District review its financial condition and scheduled rate adjustments as part of the annual budget process, as well as perform a more comprehensive financial plan and rate update every 3 to 5 years, as conditions dictate.

## 2.1 FUND STRUCTURE

The financial plan is an annual cash flow model. As a cash flow model, it differs from standard accounting income statements and balance sheets. The financial plan models sources and uses of funds into, out of, and between the two Wholesale Water funds: Wholesale Operating Fund (Fund 10) and Wholesale Capital Fund (Fund 11). The financial plan model is based on the Wholesale fund structure and reserve policies currently used by the District. Similarly, the Board has designated certain revenue streams to be accounted for within this fund and dedicated to the Capital Program and

the financial plan for this study has attempted to replicate those policies as best as possible.  
The two funds serve the following purposes:

- **Wholesale Operating Fund (Fund 10)** – The Operating Fund is the primary fund within the Wholesale enterprise. Most Wholesale revenues, including rate revenues, flow into the Operating Fund and all operating and maintenance costs, including debt service payments, are paid out of this fund. In addition, the Operating Fund also supports part of the water enterprise’s capital improvement program. Funds are transferred from the Operating Fund to the Capital Fund (Fund 11), which processes the execution of all capital projects.

- **Wholesale Capital Fund (Fund 11)** – The Capital Fund is primarily supported by transfers from Fund 10, but also receives property tax revenue, connection fee revenue, and capital facility charge revenue (see Section 4). All capital projects are executed through this fund.

### 2.2 BEGINNING FUND BALANCES
The budgeted ending reserve balance for FY 2021/22 in the Wholesale Operating Fund was approximately $2,054,000 while the ending reserve balance in the Wholesale Capital Fund was approximately $18,784,000. These reserve balances were used to establish the “starting point” for the reserve levels for this 10-year financial plan. It should be noted that the amount of cash that the District keeps in reserves is a product of its reserve policies (see Section 2.9).

### 2.3 HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED WATER USAGE
Historical water usage by member agency by fiscal year is summarized in Table 1 and in Figure 1. This data provides some context into the District’s recent water usage trend as well as context when addressing peak annual water usage data (see Section 3.2).

**Figure 1: Historical and Projected Annual Water Deliveries**

The Sacramento region has predominantly been in drought conditions over the past 10 years, interspersed with record rainfall years such as the current rain season. As such, it is difficult to predict the collective future water demands by the member agencies.

Study relies on each member agencies’ respective 2020 Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) to provide the best available forecast of future water usage. The UWMPs’ projections of water usage include assumptions regarding growth and future conservation trends. The projected water demands for calendar years 2025, 2030 and 2035 provided in Table 2 considers both UWMP projections as well as (1) an assumption that Fair Oaks Water District will derive 30 percent of its water supply from local groundwater (based on a recent policy that was not considered in the UWMP) and (2) starting in CY 2025 Orangevale Water District will begin to derive 500 AF of water supply from a rehabilitated well.

In the most recent complete calendar year (CY 2022), the District provided 31,693 AF to its member agencies (see Table 2). The forecast numbers in Table 2 represent an overall increase in total water demand of 2.4 percent per year between 2022 and 2025, an overall increase of 0.3 percent per year between 2025 and 2030 and an overall increase of water usage of just over 0.1 percent between 2030 and 2035. This Study uses these water usage trend projections in applicable analysis.

# San Juan Water District  
## 2023 Wholesale Water Rate Study  
### Financial Plan  

## 2.4 RATE REVENUE  
Rate revenue is the revenue collected from member agencies for wholesale water service. The District collects rate revenue on a quarterly basis from member agencies in the form of Water Usage Rates and a Quarterly Service Charge. The financial plan starts with rate revenue levels that were budgeted for FY 2023/24. Budgeted and projected rate revenues (including proposed rate adjustments) are listed in Schedule 1.

## 2.5 NON-RATE REVENUES  
In addition to rate revenue, the District receives “non-rate revenue” from sources such as miscellaneous operating revenue, property taxes, connection fees, treat-and-wheel rates (see Section 5), miscellaneous water sales to other entities (namely Granite Bay Golf Course), capital facility fees (see Section 4), and Hinkle pumping surcharges (see Section 6), and interest revenue on investments. Projections for miscellaneous operating revenue, property taxes, and connection fees were based on FY 2023/24 budgeted revenues. The least predictable source of revenue is the treat-and-wheel rates paid by SSWD, due to the highly variable amount of water purchased by SSWD from one year to the next. Over the past 10 years, SSWD has purchased as much as 13,600 AF and as little zero AF. Due to this variability, and no minimum purchase requirement for SSWD, it is very difficult to predict how much water SSWD will purchase going forward. Given the uncertainty of this source of revenue, the financial plan assumes no revenue from SSWD after FY 2023/34. Prior wholesale financial plans have excluded this revenue source for the same reason.

Future annual interest income was calculated based upon projected fund balances and assumed interest rate of 1.0 percent, which is consistent with the District’s historical interest earnings relative to its total reserve levels. Property tax revenue is forecasted to increase by 2 percent per year. Budgeted non-rate revenues are depicted in Figure 2 below and listed in detail in Schedule 1.

## 2.6 CURRENT AND PROJECTED OPERATING EXPENSES

The District’s expenses include operating and maintenance expenses, debt service, and capital spending. Debt service expenses are addressed in Section 2.10 and capital spending is addressed in Section 2.8.

Future operating and maintenance expenses were projected based upon the budgeted expenditures for FY 2023/24 and adjusted for inflation. There was one exception of the carry-over of the FY 2023/24 budget to FY 2024/25: the “one-time” $500 thousand cost for environmental review for the Warren Act contract renewal in the FY 2023/24 Source of Supply budget was not repeated in subsequent years.

Major budgeted expense categories are depicted in Figure 3. Projected operating and maintenance costs are listed in detail in Schedule 1. This schedule specifically breaks out the costs of energy, chemical and maintenance since these variable expenses are a key topic of discussion in the proposed rate structure modifications (see Section 3).

![San Juan Water District 2023 Wholesale Water Rate Study Financial Plan](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+2023+Wholesale+Water+Rate+Study+Financial+Plan)

**Figure 3: Operating Expense Categories (FY 2022/23 Mid-Year Estimates)**

Annual cost escalation factors for various types of expenses were developed based on a review of historical inflation trends, published inflation forecasts, industry experience, and discussions with District staff regarding recent trends. During the projection period, inflation is projected to increase by 4 percent in FY 2024/25, and 3 percent thereafter. Construction costs are projected to increase by 3 percent per year for the study period.

**2.7 EXISTING DEBT EXPENSES**

The Wholesale enterprise’s current debt obligations include a 2017 refunding revenue bond and a 2022 refunding private placement loan. A portion of these debt obligations is shared with the Retail enterprise (Wholesale is responsible for 60 percent of the 2017 debt and 64.81 percent of the 2022 debt). In FY 2022/23, the Wholesale portion of annual
<!-- Page 33 -->
![San Juan Water District 2023 Wholesale Water Rate Study Financial Plan](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+2023+Wholesale+Water+Rate+Study+Financial+Plan)

debt service on the 2017 bonds totals about $581,000 and about $937,200 for the 2022 loan. While the cost of the Wholesale debt is allocated among the member agencies as described in Section 3, the City of Folsom is also directly responsible for a portion of the 2022 refunding loan.

In addition to the above debt, the District has recently received a loan for the Hinkle Reservoir cover replacement project, as detailed in Section 2.9.

## 2.8 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM

The District has developed a 2022 Master Plan that describes the capital projects and spending that is necessary in order to pro-actively address water system rehabilitation needs associated with aging pipes, pump stations, water tanks, and other system deficiencies. Over the past seven years, the District has spent an average of approximately $3.1 million per year in capital improvement projects. The Wholesale 2022 Capital Plan calls for a slight increase in the average annual capital spending (to $3.4 million) with the exception of a single outlier project: the Hinkle Reservoir Cover & Liner Replacement project in 2024 for $23.1 million dollars. A detailed list of capital projects and associated costs is provided in Schedule 2. Notable projects include Filter Channel Lining/Underdrain Inspection ($3.3 million), Administration/FO/Engineering Building Improvement/Replacement (Wholesale portion $3.2 million), Reline 60" Pipe from Filters to Inlet Structure ($1.8 million), Hinkle Reservoir Temporary Tanks, Piping, & Electrical ($1.6 million), Powdered Activated Carbon System ($1.5 million), and Drying Bed Improvements ($1.2 million).

## 2.9 DEBT STRATEGY

While the District typically tries to cash-finance capital projects whenever possible, there are instances when debt financing is appropriate. Such instances are typified by abnormally large spikes in capital spending, such as the Hinkle Reservoir cover replacement project. Such spikes in capital spending can either be addressed by drawing down existing reserves or by issuing new debt.
<!-- Page 34 -->
![San Juan Water District 2023 Wholesale Water Rate Study Financial Plan](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+2023+Wholesale+Water+Rate+Study+Financial+Plan)

**Figure 4: Forecasted Capital Spending with Debt Strategy**

Dating back to the 2017 Wholesale Rate Study, the District has planned to debt-finance the Hinkle Reservoir cover replacement project. In fact, the District has already adopted a “Hinkle Reservoir debt service charge” which is designed to pay for the debt service associated with the project. This Study accounts for the fact that the District has received a loan through the State of California’s Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund (SRF) with a repayment period of 30 years, a fixed interest rate of 1.2 percent and no issuance costs. The total proposed debt principal amounts to $23.12 million.

3 The existing Hinkle Reservoir debt service charge, which has not actually been collected from member agencies, will be superseded by the recommendations of this Study.

4 These assumptions were provided by District staff. Hildebrand Consulting is not a financial advisor and cannot provide guidance to the District regarding topics such as future interest rates for bonds.

Table 3 summarizes some of the details of the proposed new debt issues, including the timing and the ensuing annual debt service.

| Approx. Annual Debt Payments     | $922,281             |

### 2.10 DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE

The District’s 2017 bond requires the District to maintain a debt service coverage ratio (DCR) of at least 1.15. The DCR is calculated based on the combined financial capacity of both San Juan Water District’s Retail enterprise and Wholesale enterprise. Based on published guidance from Fitch Ratings, utility systems with midrange financial profiles should maintain a DCR greater than 1.5 times annual debt service. The new Hinkle loan (see Section 2.7) requires that the District maintain a minimum DCR of 1.2. This financial plan estimates that a DCR of at least 2.14 will be maintained throughout the planning period.

### 2.11 RESERVE POLICIES

Reserve policies are cash balances targets that are retained for specific cash flow needs. The target for reserves is an important component when developing a multi-year financial plan and maintaining prudent reserves is an essential component of any sound financial management strategy. Utilities rely on reserves for financial stability; credit rating agencies evaluate utilities in part on their adherence to formally adopted reserve targets; and lending agencies require utilities to maintain specific debt reserves for outstanding loans. The target levels of the policies below are consistent with 1) the District’s established policies and practices; 2) the findings of reserve studies conducted by the AWWA; 3) a healthy level of reserves for a utility per the evaluation criteria.

published by rating agencies (e.g., Fitch, Moody’s, and Standard & Poor’s); and 4) Hildebrand Consulting and The Reed Group’s industry experience for similar systems.

The following recommended reserve policies are based on Board-approved policies (Policy FIN 5.9) which were last updated in 2018 (after the 2017 Wholesale Rate Study). The policy recommendations are intended to help the District mitigate and manage financial risk while meeting service and financial obligations.

**Wholesale Operating Reserve** - The purpose of the Operating Reserve is to provide sufficient funds (working capital) for operations of the District. The reserve will be maintained in an amount equal to at least 20 percent of the annual operating expenditures (excluding depreciation). This amounts to about $1.70 million in FY 2023/24.

**Wholesale Capital Reserve** - The purpose of the Capital Reserve is to accumulate funds necessary to pay for the replacement of the District’s aged assets and to fund new Wholesale assets as deemed necessary by the District’s Master Plan. As written, the District’s reserve policy has two components:

1) The sum of all annual revenue sources into this reserve should be at least equal to the amount of annual depreciation for Wholesale’s fixed assets.

2) The balance of the reserve should be equal to the accumulated depreciation for existing Wholesale assets, adjusted for inflation. If the reserve balance is below this threshold, the District will work towards increasing the reserve balance or designate certain large capital replacement projects to be funded by the issuance of debt.

The purpose of the second component is to avoid and/or minimize the future issuance of debt for capital asset replacement.

In addition to the reasons for the capital reserve cited by the District’s policy, the “cushion” provided by working capital reserves allows the District to draw down on reserves during above-average capital spending years and build the reserve back up during subsequent years. In reviewing the District’s 2021/22 Comprehensive Annual

2023 Wholesale Water Rate Study  
Financial Plan  

Financial Report (CAFR), the Wholesale enterprise’s accumulated depreciation is approximately $43 million. While the District’s long-term goal of creating such healthy reserves is commendable, it is not reasonable to achieve such reserve levels within the next ten years. As such, this Report recommends a Capital Reserve target equal to 10-year average annual capital spending levels (excluding the Hinkle Reservoir cover replacement project as an outlier) as an interim goal. This equates to a reserve target of $3.6 million.

Hinkle Debt Reserve – The terms of the Hinkle Reservoir SRF loan (see Section 2.9) requires the District to set aside a cash reserve equal to one year of debt service for the loan ($922 thousand).

Target Reserves vs. Minimum Reserves – When discussing the three reserve policies above, it is important to discern between two types of reserve policies. A minimum reserve policy refers to a reserve level that the District should never plan to draw down. Such reserves (such as the Operating Reserve and the Hinkle Debt Reserve) should only be drawn down in the event of an unforeseen circumstance. On the other hand, target reserves (such as the Capital reserve) are designed to be drawn down and built up over the course of a planning period. The purpose of such a reserve is to give the District financial flexibility, not to create restrictions on minimum levels.

It should be noted that a series of reserves that existed during the 2017 Wholesale Rate Study are no longer used by the District, including the Rate Stabilization Reserve, the Compensation Absence Reserve, the PERS Stabilization Reserve and the Delta / Water Rights Reserve.

2.12 PROPOSED RATE REVENUE INCREASES

All of the above information was entered into a financial planning model to produce a 10-year projection of the sufficiency of current rate revenues to meet projected financial requirements and determine the level of rate revenue increases necessary in each year of the projection period.
<!-- Page 38 -->
![San Juan Water District 2023 Wholesale Water Rate Study Financial Plan](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+2023+Wholesale+Water+Rate+Study+Financial+Plan)

Based upon the previously discussed financial data, assumptions, policies, and debt strategy, this Study proposes a 5-year schedule of annual rate adjustments as detailed in Table 4.

It is important to understand three important complexities with respect to the percentages shown in Table 4.

1) While Table 4 shows a 5 percent increase in rates in FY 2023/34, the actual change to the District’s adopted rates will be significantly lower because the Table 4 percentages are relative to the revenue that the District has actually collected from member agencies. While the Hinkle Reservoir Debt Service Charge was previously adopted by the District, the member agencies have not yet been asked to pay that charge. As is detailed in Section 3, the Hinkle Reservoir Debt Service Charge will be replaced by a revised rate schedule which will ultimately yield rates that are lower than a 5 percent increase to member agencies.

2) In addition to the above, the relative change in the rates paid by member agencies will also differ slightly among the member agencies due to the fact that any time there is an update to the cost allocation data, each rate payer will be affected differently.

3) The rate increases will happen at the midpoint of each fiscal year; therefore, the revenue increase will only be effective for half of the year. This means that the District’s revenue increase in Fiscal Year 2023/24 will only be 2.5 percent.

It is important to understand that the rate revenue increases that are being proposed are only slightly higher than assumed inflation rates (see Section 2.6). The projected rate increases after FY 2027/28 shown in Figure 5 are only estimates to demonstrate that, based on current forecasts, larger rate increases are not anticipated for that time period.

This financial plan has been developed based on a number of assumptions. It is understood that actual results (such as water usage or inflation) may deviate materially from the projections shown in this report. While it is recommended that the Board adopt the 5-year rate schedule (as shown in Schedule 3), it is also recommended that the District actively monitor the state of reserves over the course of the next 5 years. In the event that reserve levels fall short of projections, it may be necessary to consider higher rate increases than recommended by this report. Conversely, if reserve levels...

begin to build materially higher than projected by this report, the Board may decide to modify some of the rate increases that had previously been adopted.

# Section 3. COST OF SERVICE & RATE STRUCTURE

The Cost-of-Service analysis (COSA) evaluates the cost of providing water and allocates those costs to rate structure components to ensure the proposed rates are aligned with the costs to provide service. The COSA is performed in order to comply with applicable law, which requires the wholesale water rates to not exceed the reasonable costs of providing the service.

Upon completion of the COSA, a rate structure analysis was performed to evaluate rate structure modifications and calculate specific rate schedules for implementation starting in CY 2024. The complete schedule of proposed rates for CY 2024 through CY 2028 as detailed in Schedule 3.

The rate structure proposed by this Study is designed to:

- Fairly and equitably recover costs through rates
- Conform to accepted industry practice and legal requirements
- Provide fiscal stability and recovery of system fixed costs

The wholesale water rates proposed herein were calculated using the same general rate methodology originally developed by the District in 1998 and updated several times since then. The wholesale water rates include a uniform water usage rate applicable to each acre-foot (AF) of water deliveries, a fixed quarterly service charge (which now included debt service costs), and quarterly capital facilities charges (applicable to only some wholesale member agencies and related to specific limited-benefit capital improvement projects, see Section 4).

5 The City of Folsom pays an additional usage rate for the Hinkle Pumping Surcharge (see Section 6).

### Cost of Service and Rate Structure  

### 3.2 ALLOCATION OF COSTS AND PROPOSED RATES  

The process for calculating water rates involves (a) determining the annual water rate revenue requirements (as detailed in Section 2) then (b) allocating those costs to each member agency based on the cost of providing service (also known as the cost-of-service analysis, or COSA). This study allocated costs using the District’s broad (departmental) cost classifications, including source of supply, water treatment and operations, executive and board of directors, administration and information technology, finance and purchasing, human resources, engineering, water conservation and outreach, debt service, and cash-funded capital expenses (see Table 7). Non-rate revenues and changes in the operating fund balance were also factors in determining the annual revenue requirement.  

While this Study proposes a methodology for allocating costs that is consistent with the methodology employed in the 2017 Wholesale Water Rate Study, this Study proposes to further increase the amount of revenue that is collected through fixed charges. The 2017 study began a shift towards recovering more fixed costs through fixed charges, and this current Study proposes to complete the shift by recovering all fixed costs through fixed charges. There are a number of reasons why fixed costs are best recovered with a fixed revenue source, particularly for a wholesale agency with only five member agencies. Fixed costs are (by definition) a certainty for the wholesaler and therefore it stands to reason that those same costs should also be a certainty for the member agencies. Furthermore, recovering fixed costs through a fixed charge provides financial certainty to both parties. Consistent with legal requirements, it is “reasonable” that a wholesale agency require its member agencies to support the wholesaler’s fixed financial obligations through fixed charges. While it is common for retail water agencies to recover a certain portion of their fixed revenue through variable charges, it is not appropriate to apply the same rate setting approach to wholesale agencies. There is a material difference in the dynamics of recovering revenue from thousands of end users (with a wide range of water needs) versus recovering revenue from five utilities that are in the same business of providing water service to others.  

The following describes the allocation of costs shown in Table 7.  

![Table 7](#)  
<!-- Page 44 -->
![San Juan Water District 2023 Wholesale Water Rate Study](https://example.com/image-url)

1) Variable costs are allocated based on actual water deliveries to the member agencies. For the purpose of this Study, variable costs are defined as those costs that change as a direct result of increased or decreased water deliveries. These costs include energy (electricity & fuel), chemicals, water purchase costs and some variable maintenance expenses. These costs will ultimately be paid by member agencies based on actual water usage during a given payment period. For the purpose of this Study, it was assumed that the projected water delivery totals for FY 2024 represent an average year for the next five years (note that the relative amount used by each respective member agency during that fiscal year does not affect the calculations).

2) Most fixed costs (hereafter “District fixed costs”) are proposed to be allocated to the respective member agencies based on their respective peak annual water deliveries over the past 10 years. These fixed costs include most labor, benefits, administration, maintenance, Board expenses, and debt service. The 2017 Wholesale Rate Study allocated such costs based on average annual water usage over the 5-year period that immediately preceded the study, while current District practice is to allocate such costs based on the most recent five-year average water usage (otherwise known as a rolling five-year average). It is recommended that the District allocate these fixed costs based on their peak water deliveries from a relatively long time period because peak water usage is an accepted industry standard for measuring the amount of infrastructure that is needed to serve customers. The size (and therefore costs) of the District’s water infrastructure, and operations as a whole, is predominantly driven by the District’s peak water demands. This concept is identical to the commonly used and standard approach for retail water rate setting, which allocates fixed costs to retail customers based on the (peak) capacity of their meter (regardless of how often that full capacity is actually used by the customer). Consistent with the previous discussion regarding fixed versus variable revenue, it is important to understand that the use of a variable metric to allocate fixed costs (such as using the most recent five years of actual water usage, as has been the District’s recent practice) is both inequitable (because recent actual water usage does not affect the District’s fixed costs) and it creates financial uncertainty and rate volatility for the member agencies. To further underline this last point, the exercise of allocating fixed costs to member agencies is a “zero sum game,” meaning that if one member agency pays less than the other must pay more because the fixed costs need to come from somewhere. Under

Cost of Service and Rate Structure  

the current practice, when one member agency uses relatively less water, more fixed costs are allocated to the other agencies even if their water usage did not change. This creates both financial uncertainty for the member agencies and an arguable inequity (since recent water usage does not actually affect the District’s fixed costs). It is worth noting that the peak demands for all five member agencies occurred in the same year (2013, see Table 1).

A final point in support of the use of the (static) peak water usage metric to allocate fixed costs is eliminating the need to recalculate rates every year (as is the current practice), which currently creates additional administrative effort for the District and creates financial uncertainty for the member agencies.

3) Some specific customer-related fixed costs are allocated to the respective member agencies based on their respective number of retail customers. This is limited to costs that are driven by the number of individual retail customers that are served. These costs are limited to conservation and outreach costs.

Table 6 presents the metrics that are used for allocating costs to the member agencies. These include projected water demands (from FY 2024 as previously explained), peak water usage over the past 10 years, and number of retail accounts.

**Table 6: Cost Allocation Metrics**  
| Annual Water Use | Variable Costs | Fixed Costs | Number of Customers |  
|------------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|  
|                  | Projection for FY 2024 (AF) | 10-Year Peak (AF) | (Accounts) |  
| San Juan WD - RSA | 11,229 | 14,743 | 10,967 |  
| Citrus Heights WD | 8,713 | 14,327 | 19,845 |

Table 7 shows the departmental costs being allocated to one of the three types of costs described above (Variable, District fixed, or Customer-related fixed). Miscellaneous revenues

and the use of reserves is credited entirely to the District-fixed costs category. Note that costs and revenues in Table 7 are taken from FY 2024, which is intended to be a representative year of costs and revenues. For this reason, the Miscellaneous Revenue in Table 7 excludes the budgeted revenue from SSWD for FY 2024, which results in a larger Use of Cash Reserves than indicated in the financial plan (Section 2). This deviation from the financial plan assumptions does not change the calculated rate for Member Agencies since the Miscellaneous Revenues and Use of Cash Reserves affect the rates identically.

The lower portion of Table 7 shows how the costs in each category are summed and then expressed as unit costs by dividing the sum total by the applicable metric. For example, the total variable costs are $1,603,700 and the unit cost is $52.96 per AF after dividing those costs by 30,279 AF.

Table 8 summarizes the proposed rate for the member agencies based on the unit rates shown at the bottom of Table 9 and the peaking values assigned to each respective member agency. The Quarterly O, M, R, & D Service Charge (operation, maintenance, replacement, and debt) includes both the District fixed costs and the Customer-base fixed costs. Note that Table 8 separates the 2019 Hinkle Debt Service Charge from the O, M, R, & D Service Charge for demonstration purposes only. Going forward the District will combine the two charges (as shown in Schedule 3).

**Notes:**  
2023 Hinkle Debt Service Charge is shown separately for transparency only; the adopted rate schedule will include all debt in the O, M, R, & D Service Charge. Capital facilities charges are not shown. City of Folsom is also subject to a pumping surcharge and an additional debt service charge.

Table 9 has been provided as an estimate of the total costs to each member agency in CY 2024. Only an estimate can be provided since the actual Usage charge will depend on actual usage by each respective member agency. As with Table 8, the 2019 Hinkle Debt Service Charge has been broken out from the O, M, R, & D Service Charge for demonstration purposes only.

¹ The costs in this table are only estimated because the variable costs assume the water usage as projected for CY 2025. Actual variable costs for each member agency will depend on actual water usage. The fixed costs are accurate for CY 2024. Some bottom-line totals do not match Table 8 totals due to rounding.

# San Juan Water District  
## 2023 Wholesale Water Rate Study  
### Capital Facility Charges  

## Section 4. CAPITAL FACILITY CHARGES  

In 2015, the District adopted a system of capital facilities charges related to a small number of planned wholesale capital improvement projects that benefit some, but not all, of the wholesale customers. The charges help to ensure equitable and timely cost recovery for these projects and recover the costs for projects with unique cost sharing attributes. The capital facilities charges recover costs through fixed quarterly charges over a five-year period, beginning 18 months prior to the year of construction of affected projects.  

The capital facility charges adopted in 2017 have all been paid off. Going forward, the only new project that is a candidate for a capital facility charge is the Hazel Ave 12-inch transmission main replacement project, of which this Study assumes that Orangevale Water Company will be responsible for $330,000. Table 10 presents an updated capital facilities charges schedule reflecting the timing of the above charges.  

### Table 10: Capital Facility Charge Schedule for Orangevale Water Company  

| Year  | Charge   |
|-------|----------|
| CY 2024 | $66,000 |
| CY 2025 | $66,000 |
| CY 2026 | $66,000 |
| CY 2027 | $66,000 |
| CY 2028 | $66,000 |

![San Juan Water District 2023 Wholesale Water Rate Study - Treat-and-Wheel Rates](https://example.com/image.png)

# Section 5. TREAT-AND-WHEEL RATES

In October 1994, the District amended an agreement with the Northridge Water District (now Sacramento Suburban Water District, or SSWD) concerning the diversion, treatment, and conveyance of water. Under this agreement, the District agreed to use available surplus capacity to treat and wheel surface water through the wholesale water system to SSWD, upon SSWD’s request. The agreement contemplates the delivery of SSWD’s own water (or water obtained by SSWD), herein referred to as “SSWD water,” or surplus District water, as conditions and circumstances may dictate. Such conditions may include (but are not limited to) Water Forum Agreement conditions. At present, it is generally SSWD water that is moved through the District’s wholesale water facilities for delivery to SSWD at the westerly terminus of the cooperative transmission pipeline at C-Bar-C Park.

The relevant section of the 1994 agreement provides the following language for charging SSWD for water deliveries:

4. Payment for Use of Surplus Capacity or Surplus Water. San Juan’s charge to Northridge for use of Surplus Capacity in San Juan’s Facilities to deliver Surplus Water or Northridge Water shall be at the same average wholesale water rate it charges to San Juan’s Member Districts, plus a charge to cover the pro rata cost of treating water to be delivered to Northridge to the extent treatment costs are not included in the wholesale water rate. The charge for using Surplus Capacity to divert, treat, and deliver Northridge Water shall not include the cost-of-water component of San Juan’s wholesale water rate, but may include the cost to San Juan to obtain Surplus Water specifically for the purpose of making it available for delivery to Northridge.
<!-- Page 51 -->
![San Juan Water District 2023 Wholesale Water Rate Study Treat-and-Wheel Rates](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+2023+Wholesale+Water+Rate+Study+Treat-and-Wheel+Rates)

In 2017 the District and SSWD signed an updated agreement which included the following language in Section 4, Paragraph 2:

“Effective January 1, 2017, utilizing the current structure of SJWD's Wholesale Financial Plan and Water Rate Study, SSWD's per acre foot cost of water shall be the total average cost of service for the Wholesale entity, less the burdened Cost of Supply, with the sum divided by the estimated annual water use of the wholesale customer entities.”

The following calculation methodology for determining an appropriate treat-and-wheel water rate for SSWD is proposed based on guidance provided by the 2017 agreement:

**SSWD Rate:**  
\[
\text{SSWD Rate} = \frac{\text{SJWD Wholesale Revenue Requirement - Burdened Source of Supply Costs}}{\text{Estimated Annual SJWD Water Deliveries}}
\]

Below the rate has been updated with cost data and water usage assumptions found in Section 3.2.

\[
\text{SSWD Rate} = \frac{9,593,200 - 1,546,758}{30,279 \text{ AF}} = 265.74 \text{ / AF}
\]

The Revenue Requirement value comes from Row 16 of Table 7 and the water delivery value comes from Table 6. The Burdened Source of Supply Cost comes from the following Table 11, which also uses values from Table 7. In the top half of the table the operating costs are categorized as either Supply Costs or Non-Supply costs and then the totals are compared and expressed as percentages (see Row 6). These percentages are then applied to the Administrative Costs and Miscellaneous Revenues in the lower half of the table to calculate the Net Administrative Costs, which are added to the supply operating costs to calculate the total Burdened Source of Supply Cost (Row 13). This method of calculating the burdened costs is called the “indirect allocation method” and uses the relative value of dollars on the operating side to determine how to allocate administrative costs.

* Allocated to Supply vs. Non-Supply Category based on percentages from Row 6

The proposed rate is lower than the effective per-acre-foot rates paid by Member Agencies in part because the District is simply treating water that is owned by SSWD and therefore all costs of water supply have been removed from the rate.

Based on the proposed overall wholesale water rate increases for 2024 through 2028 from the financial plan model, future SSWD treat-and-wheel water rates would increase as shown in Table 12.

**Table 12: Recommended Water Rate Revenue Increase**

| Calendar Year | Rate per AF |
|---------------|-------------|
| 2024          | $265.74     |
| 2025          | $279.03     |
| 2026          | $292.98     |
| 2027          | $304.70     |
| 2028          | $316.89     |

Occasionally the District delivers District-owned water to SSWD, rather than SSWD water. In such situations, there is a separate negotiated rate that may or may not incorporate this treat-and-wheel rate. Calculating that particular rate is done by the District on an annual basis and is outside of the scope of this study.

![San Juan Water District 2023 Wholesale Water Rate Study Hinkle Pumping Surcharge](https://example.com/image-url)

# Section 6. HINKLE PUMPING SURCHARGE

The Hinkle Booster Pump Station is used to deliver water to the City of Folsom, as well as to distribute water within the San Juan Water District Retail service area. Because this pumping, and related costs, does not affect other member agencies, the District accounts for the pumping costs to ensure that those costs are recovered from San Juan Water District Retail water system as well as an equitable amount from the City of Folsom. The City of Folsom pays these costs through a surcharge on its delivered water. The current surcharge is $102.00 per AF.

The costs associated with the pump station include labor, electricity, materials, and depreciation expenses. As part of the current update, an annual depreciation expense of $175,600 was calculated based on an original construction cost of $3.55 million and an estimated useful life of 40 years. About half of the water through the Hinkle Pump Station is delivered to the City of Folsom, while the other half goes to the SJWD Retail service area. As such, the costs are split evenly between Folsom and SJWD. The surcharge is calculated by dividing Folsom’s share of the costs by the typical volume of water delivered to the City of Folsom, as summarized in Table 13.

## Table 13: Hinkle Pumping Surcharge Calculations

| Annual Costs         | Retail Share | Folsom Share |
|----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Employee Costs:      | $41,100      | $20,550      |

Given that the costs of the Hinkle Booster Pump Station are borne by the SJWD Retail water system, the pumping surcharge revenue collected from the City of Folsom goes to the benefit of Fund 50 (Retail Operating Fund).

The Hinkle Pumping Surcharge should be adjusted annually based on inflation, and periodically reviewed and/or updated to ensure that the surcharge continues to reasonably reflect costs associated with this service to the City.

# Section 7. CONCLUSION

This Study used methodologies that are aligned with industry standard practices for rate setting as promulgated by AWWA and all applicable laws. The proposed annual adjustments to the water rates are expected to enable the District to continue to provide reliable service to member agencies.

The District is required to give its member agencies a 150-day noticing period prior to implementing new rates.

As with past practice, the District should monitor financial conditions and needs on an ongoing (annual) basis and update the financial plan model if conditions or plans change sufficiently to warrant an update. Actual future conditions, such as water demand, water sales revenue, operating and maintenance expenses, capital project costs/timing, project financing, etc., may differ from the financial plan assumptions reflected herein. Material differences affecting the overall financial condition of the wholesale water system may warrant closer review and/or an earlier update. The need for and magnitude of annual water rate increases may also be affected by differences between assumed and actual conditions.

### Notes:
1. The existing charge associated with the debt service for the Hinkle Reservoir Rehabilitation Project has not yet been assessed to Member Agencies. For illustrative purposes, the revised debt charge has been shown separately for CY 2024. Starting in CY 2025, the Hinkle Reservoir Debt Charge is combined with the Quarterly Fixed Charge.
2. This charge only applies to Orange Vale Water Company for the Hazel Ave. 12 inch transmission main replacement.
3. Unique charge to City of Folsom for debt that was formerly the 2012 bond.
4. Per negotiated agreements.
5. The District may elect to increase the Hinkle Pump Station Surcharge based on inflation indices.

# Financial Plan Assumptions

**Inflation will be:**
- 4% in FY 2024/25
- 3% thereafter

- Property tax revenue will increase by 2% per year

**SSWD Treat and Wheel deliveries**
- Given the historic volatility of SSWD water sales (some years see no revenue), this financial plan does not rely on this as a source of revenue (consistent past Wholesale financial plans)

# Fixed and Variable Revenue

Over **83%** of the District’s rate revenue requirements (costs) are fixed.

The 2017 study moved the District towards recovering more of its revenue through fixed charges.

Currently, Wholesale rate revenue is **74%** fixed (up from 63% prior to the 2017 study).

This Study proposed to complete the alignment of the District’s costs with its rates by increasing the fixed rate revenue to **83%**.

## Reasons
- Given the financial relationship between San Juan Wholesale and its member agencies, it makes sense that any fixed cost for San Juan should be a fixed cost for the member agencies.
  
- Any disparity between the District’s fixed costs and its fixed revenues creates financial uncertainty that can be harmful to both SJWD and the member agencies.
<!-- Page 67 -->
# Cost of Service

**Variable Costs** – Allocated to each member agency based on actual water usage
- All costs that vary in proportion to water delivery volumes (energy, chemical, water purchases, etc.) as well as some maintenance costs that are correlated with higher water production.

**Customer-related Fixed Costs** – Allocated to each member agency based on number of retail accounts
- Conservation and outreach costs (less than 1.5 percent of costs)

**“District” Fixed Costs** – Allocated to each member agency based on peak historic water usage (see next slide)
- All remaining costs (salaries, benefits, capital, debt, administration, maintenance, etc.)
<!-- Page 68 -->
# Using Peak Water Usage to Allocate Fixed Costs

- 2017 Rate Study allocated fixed costs based on **average annual water usage** (over a 5-year period)
- Current District practice policy is to allocate fixed costs based on the **most recent annual water usage**
- It is recommended to allocate fixed costs based on **relative peak annual water deliveries** over the past 10 years
- Alternatively, fixed costs could be allocated based on **relative average annual water deliveries** over the past 10 years.

## Discussion:
- Peak water usage is an accepted industry standard for allocating infrastructure costs to customers. This is because the size (and therefore costs) of the District’s water infrastructure, and operations as a whole, is predominantly driven by the District’s peak water demands.
- The concept is comparable to using meter size to determine retail customer fixed rates.
- Using a variable metric to allocate fixed costs (such as last year’s water usage) is both inequitable and creates finance uncertainty for all agencies.
- Keep in mind that allocating fixed costs to member agencies is a “zero sum game,” meaning that if one member agency pays less than the other must pay more. This accentuates the revenue uncertainty for member agencies.

# AGENDA ITEM V-4

## DRAFT STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** December 13, 2023  
**Subject:** Fiscal Year 2022-2023 Results of Operations – Budget to Actual  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Receive report.

### BACKGROUND
The Board of Directors adopted the Fiscal Year 2022-2023 Operating and Capital Budget on August 3, 2022. The Board of Directors received monthly budget to actual reports at each Board meeting during the fiscal year and a mid-year budget review was provided to the Board on March 23, 2023. The audit is complete and staff is working with the auditors to produce the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, which will be presented to the Finance Committee in January, along with their reports on the District’s internal controls.

The purpose of this report is to provide an analysis to the Board of Directors on the actual activity of the District’s four funds (Wholesale Operations, Wholesale Capital, Retail Operations and Retail Capital), on the budgetary basis of accounting, for Fiscal Year 2022-2023, as compared to the budget.

### Wholesale Operations:
As illustrated in the graph below, wholesale operating revenues came in 12.1% greater than anticipated in the original budget, and 4% greater than anticipated at mid-year.

The additional $1.3 million of revenues is the combined result of selling more water than anticipated to the Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) (variance $1,196,974), more water transferred in the Groundwater Substitution Transfer (variance $271,944) and selling less water than anticipated to the Fair Oaks Water District (variance -$205,543).

Expenses came in at $491,420 or 4.8% below the original budget but 7.8% above the amount estimated during the mid-year budget review. The largest variance came from Source of Supply where the District had budgeted $1 million for the Environmental Review needed for the Warren Act contract renewal. The District was able to secure a contract with ECORP Consulting to perform the work for $180,000, $11,769.65 of which was incurred by the end of the year.

This savings was partially offset by the extra debt principal expense incurred as a result of the adjustment to the allocation of debt between wholesale and retail for the change in use of the solar field. Retail took on a larger share of the debt by paying wholesale capital a capital facility fee, which wholesale operations used to reduce its share of the debt.
<!-- Page 74 -->
# STAFF REPORT  
## FY 2022-23 Financial Results  
### Donna Silva  

This was not anticipated in the budget but was a necessary adjustment to reflect the changes in how the District is utilizing the solar field.

### Wholesale Operating  
**Budget to Actual**  
**Fiscal Year 2022-23**  

|                | Revenues       | Expenses       |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Budget**     | $11,117,000    | $10,269,800    |
| **Mid-Year Estimate** | $11,983,200    | $9,074,000     |
| **Actual**     | $12,466,084    | $9,778,380     |

As a result of the increased revenues and lower than anticipated expenses staff was able to transfer $2,674,436 into the capital reserve, $2.1 million more than expected.

At the end of the fiscal year, Wholesale Operating fund had an available reserve balance of $2,067,230, which is in conformance with the Board’s Reserve Policy.

### Wholesale Capital:  
Wholesale Capital revenues fell short of the budget by $20,983,377 or -84.9%. The budget included $23,120,600 in proceeds from the issuance of debt for the Hinkle Reservoir Replacement project. However, by the end of the year only $846,424 of loan proceeds had been received. They will be received in Fiscal Year 2023-24. Removing the effect of this loan from the analysis, revenues were $2,889,798.72 or 80.7% greater than anticipated. The primary driver here is the reallocation of debt from the solar field project. In an effort to maximize the benefit of the solar field, the District changed how the energy from the solar field is applied. This resulted in a greater benefit/use of the solar field by the Retail division. Since the solar field was partially debt financed, the allocation of debt between wholesale and retail needed to be adjusted and retail needed to reimburse wholesale for an increased share of the solar field asset. This generated $911,800 of capital contribution revenue to wholesale capital. Excluding both the loan

## FY 2022-23 Financial Results  
### Donna Silva  

proceeds and the capital contributions for the solar field, revenues exceeded the budget by $378,999 due to better than anticipated investment portfolio performance.

![Wholesale Capital Budget to Actual Fiscal Year 2022-23](attachment:image.png)

Wholesale Capital expenditures were budgeted at $25,431,900. At year end, the District had spent $22,348,362 which was 12.1% less than anticipated.

There were 18 projects budgeted for the fiscal year, 8 of which were completed by the end of the year and 7 were in progress. The following projects had no financial activity in FY 2022-23:
- Land Acquisition (property boundary adjustment south of Hinkle Reservoir) – no activity.
- Flagpole replacement – postponed until completion of Hinkle Reservoir project.
- Tyler Content Manager – postponed until department staff is fully trained and has capacity for system change.
- SCADA Cyber Security Study & Improvements

Favorable wholesale operating results led to a transfer into the capital fund of $2,674,436, instead of the $573,200 anticipated in the budget. The wholesale capital reserve ended the year at $2,729,455 significantly less (-$14,980,575) than anticipated due to the delayed receipt of loan proceeds for the Hinkle Reservoir project. These funds will be received in FY 2023-24 restoring the available reserves in the Wholesale Capital Fund.

### Donna Silva  

## Retail Operations:

The graph below depicts Retail Operating revenues and expenses as compared to the original budget and the mid-year review.

![Retail Operating Budget to Actual Fiscal Year 2022-23](graph_image_placeholder)

### Revenues and Expenses

| Category         | Budget       | Mid-Year Estimate | Actual       |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Revenues**     | $15,894,700  | $16,078,300       | $16,775,984  |
| **Expenses**     | $13,588,800  | $13,406,300       | $13,468,164  |

Retail Operating revenues were 5.5% greater than the original budget and were greater than the mid-year estimate by 4.34%. The excess revenues of $878,755 were due almost exclusively to the reallocation of debt due to the change in use of the solar facility. Since retail is using more of the solar facility than originally planned, it needed to take on a proportionate increase in the related debt. In order to accomplish this, retail received proceeds from the debt issuance from wholesale, which it then used to pay wholesale for a larger share of the wholesale solar asset. This resulted in both a revenue (proceeds from issuance of debt) and a capital contribution expense. But for this unbudgeted transaction, retail revenues would have been only $30,516 off from the budget, a variance of just .20%.

Retail Operating expenses were $120,636 less than the original budget, a variance of -0.89% and were .46% below the mid-year estimate. But for the reallocation of debt, expenses would have been under budget by 7.60%. Actual service area maintenance expenses were less than anticipated in the budget as they ended up being accounted for in the capital fund as bundled service lateral assets.

The budget anticipated a transfer out to capital reserves of $2,111,800. As a result of favorable operations, the transfer was actually $3,102,550.

**December 13, 2023**
<!-- Page 77 -->
# STAFF REPORT  
## FY 2022-23 Financial Results  
### Donna Silva  

At $2,923,210 the Retail Operating Reserve is in conformance with the District’s Reserve Policy.  

## Retail Capital:  

Retail Capital Fund revenues came in at $5,126,681, which was $795,139 or 13% less than budget.  

The budget included $3.995 million from the issuance of debt for the Eureka Pipeline Replacement Program. Due to delays at the State, the District was not able to apply for loan proceeds during the fiscal year, so these revenues will not be received until Fiscal Year 2023-24.  

But for the loan proceeds, revenues would have exceeded the budget by $2.9 million due to an extraordinary amount of capital facility fees received during the year. The budget anticipated capital facility fees of $500,000. At mid-year the estimate was revised to $2.6 million, but by the end of the year, the District had received almost $3.4 million. This revenue stream is very difficult to predict, as it is driven by developer decisions and market conditions.  

![Retail Capital Budget to Actual Fiscal Year 2022-23](attachment:image.png)  

Retail Capital expenditures came in at $5,695,910, which was 41% below the budget of $13,682,100. This was partially anticipated after the mid-year budget review where it was communicated to the Board that staff expected to complete $8 million worth of projects.  

December 13, 2023  
<!-- Page 78 -->
# STAFF REPORT  
## FY 2022-23 Financial Results  
### Donna Silva  

Actual expenses were 29% below the mid-year estimate. There were 37 projects funded in the budget. There were 36 projects worked on during the year. The negative variance is caused primarily from the following:

- **Pump Station Improvements** – under budget by $4.8 million  
  - Bacon Pump Station Generator Replacement project – under budget by $1.9 million due to vendor delays in procuring the generators.  
  - Retail Groundwater Production Facility – budgeted $2.575 million, no financial activity occurred during the year.  

- **Pipelines** – under budget by $2.8 million

## AGENDA ITEM VII-3

# DWR RELEASES FINAL EIR FOR DELTA CONVEYANCE PROJECT
### BY DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES DEC 8, 2023 WATER NEWS

The Department of Water Resources today released the Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the proposed Delta Conveyance Project, advancing an essential piece of the state’s strategy to protect water access for millions of Californians. It was redesigned following public input and Governor Newsom's pledge of rightsizing the project to one tunnel to better support both environmental and water supply needs.

By 2040, California is expected to lose 10% of its water supply due to hotter temperatures. During January’s atmospheric rivers, the Delta Conveyance Project could’ve captured enough water for 2.3 million peoples’ yearly usage. Until this year, the state faced its three driest years on record. Extreme weather whiplash will result in more intense swings between droughts and floods. California’s 60-year-old State Water Project infrastructure is not built for these climate effects.

The Delta Conveyance Project would modernize the state’s water infrastructure to:

- Capture and move more water during wet seasons to better endure dry seasons;
- Minimize future losses from climate-driven weather extremes;
- Protect against earthquakes disrupting water supplies;
- Continue meeting regulatory water quality and fishery requirements, and add new operating rules for further fishery protections;
- Includes a Community Benefits Program to ensure local communities get the means and resources to achieve tangible and lasting benefits.

“Climate change is threatening our access to clean drinking water, diminishing future supplies for millions of Californians – doing nothing is not an option. After the three driest years on record, we didn’t have the infrastructure to fully take advantage of an exceptionally wet year, which will become more and more critical as our weather whiplashes between extremes,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “This project is essential to updating our water system for millions of Californians. This new approach, redesigned following community and environmental input, is how we can build a California of the future.”

This project is key to California’s Water Resilience Portfolio and Governor Newsom’s Water Supply Strategy.

![DWR Releases Final EIR for Delta Conveyance Project - Association of California Water Agencies](https://www.acwa.com/news/dwr-releases-final-eir-for-delta-conveyance-project/)

Throughout development of the proposed project, DWR heard from local communities and used feedback to address concerns, with some of these recommendations including: avoiding the central Delta, avoiding forebays and barge landings, reducing pile driving, undergrounding power near sandhill crane habitat, minimizing acreage needed to store tunnel material, and minimizing the project footprint.

The proposed project also includes a Community Benefits Program, with the goal to identify and implement local projects that can provide tangible and lasting local benefits.

“Modernized infrastructure in the Delta is a missing link to the state’s most affordable and reliable source of water,” said Karla Nemeth, Director of the California Department of Water Resources. “Improving water use efficiency and increasing local water supplies is an important compliment to the State Water Project to ensure that a climate proof water supply remains affordable now and into the future.”

The environmental review included a 142-day public comment period in which DWR received more than 700 letters and 7,000 individual comments. Outreach began in 2020 and has included a multitude of webinars, workshops, briefings, multi-language informational materials, email updates, videos, animations, tabling at local events, and a comprehensive Delta survey. The Final EIR responds to all substantive comments.

“We worked hard to address local concerns and make considerable improvements to minimize terrestrial species effects, wetland impacts, noise, air quality impacts, traffic, power needs, boating and waterway effects, land disturbance, and overall project footprint,” said Carrie Buckman, the project’s Environmental Program Manager.

An Environmental Impact Report evaluates and discloses to public agency decision makers and the public the potential environmental impacts, and identifies feasible mitigation measures to avoid, minimize, or otherwise offset potentially significant impacts.

Proposed responses to comments, as well as the Final EIR and accompanying informational resources, can be accessed at www.deltaconveyanceproject.com. This action signifies the last step DWR is required to take under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) prior to deciding whether to certify the EIR and approve the proposed project.

The Final EIR was prepared by DWR as the lead agency to comply with the requirements of CEQA. The Final EIR is presented in two volumes: 1) the contents of the entire Draft EIR, as revised, and 2) all comments received on the Draft EIR and responses to substantive comments.

At the conclusion of the CEQA process, DWR will determine if the Final EIR has been completed in compliance with CEQA and whether to certify that the Final EIR reflects DWR’s independent judgment and analysis. Following certification of the Final EIR, DWR will then use the information in it to assist in
<!-- Page 110 -->
determining whether to approve the proposed project, an alternative or no project. Learn more about the CEQA process here. Find a full list of informational materials here. A video and infographic materials are available in a DWR news release.
