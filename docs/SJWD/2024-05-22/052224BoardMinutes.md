**V. OLD BUSINESS**

1. **Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker reported that after he and Mr. Zlotnick met with Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD), SSWD asked for the financial consultant to develop recommendations on the three alternatives – to buy into a well(s), buy capacity in the system and pay for water as needed, or buy water directly. He explained that once the financial information is received, Greg Zlotnick and he will have further discussions with SSWD. In addition, he reported that Orange Vale Water Company is still in the process of getting their project completed of adding the treatment system to their well, and may be interested in a partnership with a future well.

GM Helliker reported that the water bank program committee meeting was held last week where they decided to keep the water transfer language in the CEQA documents. He informed the Board that the District’s attorney is following up with RWA’s attorney to inform them of the language that the District would need in the document to protect the District from any adverse consequences for future water transfers that the District may conduct. In addition, the committee approved a leave-behind requirement and agreed that this would only apply to water that is banked and used for transfers out of the basin or to another subbasin within the Sacramento region. The committee still needs to decide when the accounting should be conducted.

GM Helliker informed the Board that Jim Peifer, RWA Executive Director, stated at that meeting that San Juan caused an extra $200,000 in expenses due to the District’s comments and participation. GM Helliker reported that the District and others provide comments as needed and Mr. Peifer’s attack on the District was

**2. 2024 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)**  
GM Helliker reviewed data which included the current reservoir storage levels across the state, data on releases, temperature and precipitation outlooks, and storage levels and projections at Folsom Reservoir. In response to Director Rich’s question, Mr. Greg Turner informed the Board that staff is not too concerned about algae this year since there is a lot of water and flow in the reservoir.

**VI. NEW BUSINESS**

1. **Calling for General District Election on November 5, 2024 (W & R)**  
President Zamorano informed the Board that a resolution is needed for the 2024 election. The Board Secretary informed the Board that the resolution contains a limit of 200 words in the Candidate Statement with the candidate paying for the Candidate Statement. The candidate filing opens July 15, 2024, and closes August 9, 2024, for Divisions 2 and 4.

President Zamorano moved to approve Resolution No. 24-02 Calling for General District Election (Sacramento County) and Resolution No. 24-03 Notice of Governing Board Member Election (Placer County). Director Tobin seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

2. **Potential Combination with SSWD (W & R)**  
GM Helliker reviewed a written staff report which was included in the Board packet. He reported that Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) sent a letter to San Juan, inquiring about the District’s interest in conducting further discussions with them about potential combination of SSWD and San Juan. He stated that staff recommends that the Board agree to such further discussions and request that a joint meeting of the two Boards of Directors be convened in the near future to define the scope and schedule of such discussions. He explained that should the Board decide to move forward after the joint board meeting, then the next step would be to conduct a business case analysis, which would serve as the basis for a resolution to LAFCo to initiate the formal combination process.

Vice President Costa would like to answer the letter and provide three dates that work for the Board to meet with SSWD and accomplish this in a timely manner. Director Miller inquired what the goal of the meeting would be, projected costs of a study, length of time needed to complete, financial implications, impact to ratepayers, and why another agency bowed out of consolidating with SSWD a couple of months ago. Director Tobin agreed and pointed out that the consultant should address all those concerns. GM Helliker explained that the Board voted to move to this next phase in 2015 and proceeded with the analysis that Director Tobin just mentioned. GM Helliker pointed out that the next step is not to merge but to analyze the pros and cons of a merger via a business case analysis.

The Board discussed the topic and provided the following dates to hold a joint board meeting at SSWD at 6:00 pm: June 4, June 5 or June 25.

3. Reduction in Take or Pay with Placer County Water Agency (W & R)  
GM Helliker reviewed a written staff report which was included in the Board packet. He explained the history of the contract with Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) and the fact that the District does not use the full amount of water that the District is paying for in the take or pay element of the contract. Therefore, staff is proposing that the take or pay amount be reduced to 10,000 acre-feet, which would save the District up to $75,000 per year.

The Board discussed the proposal and voiced concern with reducing the District’s water supply. They requested to postpone discussion of this topic until the June Board meeting.

4. Change in Board Meeting Day of the Month (W & R)  
GM Helliker reported that Legal Counsel’s schedule has changed and requires him to attend a city council meeting on the 4th Wednesday of each month starting in July.

Director Rich moved to adopt Resolution No. 24-04 Changing the Date for its Regular Meetings and Approving a Conforming Amendment to the Board Rules. Director Miller seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

VII. BUDGET WORKSHOP  
1. Review FY 2024-25 Proposed Wholesale and Retail Budget (W & R)  
Ms. Silva conducted a presentation on the FY 2024-25 Proposed Wholesale and Retail Budget. A copy of the presentation will be attached to the meeting minutes.

Ms. Silva reviewed the budgets for the four District funds – Wholesale Operations, Wholesale Capital, Retail Operations, and Retail Capital. She explained that the District, as a whole, has $53.1 million budgeted in revenue and $55.2 million in expenses, and should be ending the year with $44.4 million in available reserves.

Ms. Silva reviewed the projected wholesale and retail water deliveries and water sales revenue. She explained that the revenue from water sales to SSWD puts downward pressure on wholesale rates and had it not been for the sale of water to SSWD since 2017, the wholesale rates would be 16% higher today. In addition, she reviewed the projected property tax revenue, the projected debt issuance, and the budgeted expenditures for Salaries and Benefits, Wholesale Water Supply Costs, and Capital Spending.

Ms. Silva reviewed the District’s Labor Allocation Schedule and informed the Board that there is no significant change in staffing levels and there is no change in the allocation between wholesale and retail. She explained that the Salaries budget is based on the Board policy to utilize the CalPERS matrix for each employee.

Ms. Silva reviewed the Water Supply Costs and explained that the cost has increased due to the purchase of CVP water to create historical use, thus preserving our access to this water in drought years, and due to a contract for environmental documentation for the new long term Warrant Act contract.

Ms. Silva explained that the draft Operations Plan is included in the budget and is updated each year based on the Strategic Plan. In addition, she mentioned that the Quarterly Report Card, which shows the District’s performance measures, is driven by the Operations Plan and will be included in the annual budget.

Ms. Silva reviewed the Wholesale Operating Fund budget which shows revenues of $11.7 million and expenses of $11.5 million. She explained some of the increased costs for certain items. In addition, she explained that the Wholesale Operating fund is getting a transfer in from its capital fund which is needed to establish a debt service reserve and to bring the operating reserve to 20% of operating expenses per the reserve policy, and that this was anticipated in the wholesale financial plan.

Ms. Silva reviewed the Retail Operating Fund budget which shows revenues of $18.2 million and expenses of $15.5 million. She explained some of the increased costs for certain items. In addition, she explained that the Retail Operating fund is doing a transfer out to its capital fund.

Ms. Silva reviewed the budget for the wholesale and retail capital outlay funds. She pointed out that there are several pages in the budget document which contain the wholesale and retail projects in detail that are in the budget for FY 2024-25.

Ms. Silva informed the Board that she will modify the budget based on any feedback that she receives from this workshop. She informed the Board that the public hearing on the budget is scheduled for June 26th and she will highlight the changes that were made, then the Board will consider adoption of the budget at that time.

## Water Treatment Plant (WTP) Improvements

### Backwash Hood Rehabilitation and Rail Track Improvements
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2022-23  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $295,400  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $900,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $1,195,400  

The final filtration of water occurs in the North and South basins which each have a series of filter cells along the bottom of the basin. Each basin has two backwash hoods that move across the basins to backwash (clean) the various filters. The backwash hoods suck water up through the filters and send the water back into the first treatment stage of the plant. Each basin currently has one new and old backwash hood. This project assessed the structural integrity of the two old hoods and determined that they could be rehabilitated instead of being replaced (including the rail track upon which they move). Both hoods and the rail track will be rehabilitated this year. This project will not materially affect ongoing operating costs.

### Lime Tower Coating and Improvements
- **Project Status:** In Progress  
- **Start Date:** FY 2019-20  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $153,000  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $373,100  
- **Total Project Cost:** $526,100  

The lime tower stores and distributes lime into the treated water as it leaves the treatment plant. Lime is used in the treatment process to manage pH levels in the distribution system. The small amount of lime in the treated drinking water protects the District's entire distribution system from untimely corrosion. The lime tower is aged. The District commissioned a study in FY 2019-20 to determine its rehabilitation needs. The study recommends re-doing the interior and exterior coating and installing additional anchor bolts. Design work started in FY 2022-23 and will finish in early FY 2023-24 and construction will commence in FY 2024-25.

### FY 2024-25 Planned Service Lateral Replacements (Hidden Lakes)
- **Project Status:** Planned  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ -  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 1,600,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 1,600,000  

A service lateral is the pipeline that runs from the main line, in or next to the road, to individual water meters. In 2020, it was determined that the District’s service lateral failure rate is 35% worse than the national average. The District plans to replace 85 identified service laterals per year. The FY 2024-25 Service Lateral Replacement Program is focusing on the Hidden Lakes neighborhood. Replacing the service laterals will save the District money as less time will be spent responding to leaks and less water will be lost.

### FY 2024-25 Failed Service Lateral Replacements
- **Project Status:** Anticipated  
- **Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
- **Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ -  
- **Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 435,000  
- **Total Project Cost:** $ 435,000  

A service lateral is the pipeline that runs from the main line, in or next to the road, to individual water meters. In 2020, it was determined that the District’s service lateral failure rate is 35% worse than the national average. The District plans to replace 85 identified service laterals per year. In addition to those planned replacements, the District replaces service laterals when they are determined to be leaking. Based on prior year experience, the District anticipates this level of spending to replace failed service laterals.

## FY 2024-25 Air/Vacuum Relief Valve Replacements
**Project Status:** Planned  
**Start Date:** FY 2024-25  
**Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
**Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ -  
**Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 1,100,000  
**Total Project Cost:** $ 1,100,000  

An air release valve allows air to enter or leave pipelines as needed. Removing air pockets in a pipeline allows water to flow more freely. Allowing air to enter, if there is a leak or break, prevents the creation of a vacuum, which can cause a pipeline to collapse. California law requires the vent opening to be above grade, to minimize opportunities for water contamination. Most of the District’s valves are in boxes in the street, below grade. The District plans to replace 45 per year, over a 20-year period, commencing with FY 2022-23. The program got off to a late start. The FY 2022-23 planned replacements were completed in the fall of 2023. The District anticipated completing design for the FY 2024-25 replacements this summer and hopes to have them completed in Spring of 2025.

## FY 2023-24 Air/Vacuum Relief Valve Replacements
**Project Status:** In Progress  
**Start Date:** FY 2023-24  
**Estimated Completion:** FY 2024-25  
**Estimated Spending FY 2023-24 & Prior:** $ 375,000  
**Budgeted Spending FY 2024-25:** $ 800,000  
**Total Project Cost:** $ 1,175,000  

An air release valve allows air to enter or leave pipelines as needed. Removing air pockets in a pipeline allows water to flow more freely. Allowing air to enter if there is a leak or break prevents the creation of a vacuum, which can cause a pipeline to collapse. California law requires the vent opening to be above grade, to minimize opportunities for water contamination. Most of the District’s valves are in boxes in the street, below grade. Approximately 75 valves need to be relocated to the side of the road and vented above ground. The District plans to replace 45 per year, over a 20-year period, commencing with FY 2022-23. The program got off to a late start. The FY 2022-23 planned replacements were completed in the fall of 2023. Design for the FY 2023-24 replacements will be completed by the end of the fiscal year and construction will be completed over the summer/fall.
