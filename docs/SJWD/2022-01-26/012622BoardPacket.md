## IV. NEW BUSINESS

1. **2022 Board Officers**  
   President Tobin announced that the Board needed to nominate a new President and Vice President. GM Helliker explained that the Board Rules specify that the President and Vice President would be elected at the first meeting in December each year.

   Director Rich moved to elect Ken Miller as Board President and Marty Hanneman as Board Vice President. Director Costa seconded the motion and it carried with the following roll call vote:

   Ayes: Directors Costa, Hanneman, Miller and Rich  
   Noes: Tobin  
   Absent: None  

   Director Tobin passed the gavel to President Miller.

   President Miller thanked Director Tobin for her year as Board President and congratulated her for being voted as the new President of the Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA). In addition, he thanked staff for their presentation at the rate workshop on the December 6th. President Miller asked the directors to contact GM Helliker regarding their interest in the 2022 committee assignments.

   At the request of Director Tobin, President Miller requested that staff submit a press release regarding her ACWA presidency. GM Helliker informed the Board that he received the request from Director Tobin today and already started to work on it, he will work with Director Tobin for any edits and plans to have it out on December 9th.

## V. OLD BUSINESS

1. **2021 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker informed the Board that the Sacramento Valley is at 15.9 inches of precipitation for the start of this water year which is 153% of normal. He reviewed data on Folsom Reservoir, which included the current storage level at 37% of capacity and 93% of historical average, data on releases, temperature information and storage projections.

   GM Helliker informed the Board that the State Water Board released a proposal for emergency regulations to reinstate the prohibitions that were in place in 2014-15, which the District used as the basis for the water shortage contingency plan prohibitions.

   GM Helliker reviewed the State Water Board’s data on the progress towards the Governor’s 15% voluntary conservation request, which showed a statewide reduction of 13% in October. In addition, he reviewed a chart that showed conservation targets in the region from agencies taking water from the American.

2. District COVID Plan (W & R)  
GM Helliker reported that this item was requested to be placed on the agenda at the last Board meeting. He explained that two motions were requested to be placed on the agenda – the first would be a motion to require a new employee to be vaccinated against Covid-19, and the second would be to require by January 1, 2022, that existing employees either demonstrate proof of vaccination or begin weekly testing.

GM Helliker explained that the testing program would range from $27,000 per year, using the BinaxNow rapid tests, to approximately $93,000 per year if we were to use a mobile test unit and that’s based upon the current number of employees who have indicated that they're not vaccinated, which is 23. There are other options that would fall within these cost boundaries, such as employees getting tested themselves with their own health care provider or pharmacy, and the costs associated with the time that they would be out of the office while doing the testing. In addition, depending on what option would be used, the District would also need to hire additional contract support to manage the testing logistics and the information that would be generated because California Department of Industrial Relations regulations require that the District maintain the data and that all those costs be borne by the employer.

Legal Counsel Jones commented that his legal analysis remains the same from last meeting, which was if the District wants to do this they certainly can from a legal perspective, just a policy decision whether you want to engage in it or not.

Vice President Hanneman voiced his concern regarding Covid-19 and the variants and his concern regarding the safety of staff not being vaccinated during this pandemic.

Director Costa moved to table this item, then withdrew his motion.

The Board discussed staff safety and staff rights regarding mandatory vaccinations.

Vice President Hanneman moved to require any new employee to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Director Tobin seconded the motion.

In response to Director Rich’s question, GM Helliker informed the Board that the only local agency in this area that is requiring vaccinations is the City of Sacramento, they require it of new employees, and they did plan to proceed with a program to require their employees to be vaccinated or weekly testing, but they have not initiated that because they're still going through negotiations with their union. Legal Counsel Jones stated that the agencies that they represent do not have a vaccine policy, just more precautionary policies, encouragement, and

**December 8, 2021, Board Minutes**  
**Page 5**

policies related to mask wearing and social distancing, but not a vaccine mandate.

Director Tobin supports the motion stating that the science is evidence that without the vaccines, this is going to continue to go on and on.

Ms. Silva commented that adding one more restriction in the hiring process could pose a hurdle for recruitment of new employees, in an already tight labor market. Vice President Hanneman disagreed with her comment.

President Miller called for the question.

The motion failed with the following roll call vote:

Ayes: Directors Hanneman and Tobin  
Noes: Directors Costa, Miller and Rich  
Absent: None

Vice President Hanneman moved to require by January 1, 2022, that existing employees either (1) demonstrate proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or (2) submit to weekly testing for COVID-19. Director Tobin seconded the motion.

In response to President Miller’s question, Ms. Silva informed the Board that the District currently does random drug testing for its Class C drivers. She explained that those employees who are part of the Department of Transportation Program get routinely, random drug tested, and then the District has the ability to test anybody if they have reasonable suspicion.

At the request of President Miller, GM Helliker reviewed the costs associated with a testing program.

In response to Director Tobin’s question, GM Helliker explained that the Binax test is the antigen test (a rapid test, which is not as accurate) and is quicker and cheaper. While the PCR test is the most accurate but takes a few days to get the results. He explained that the Department of Industrial Relations regulations require the employer to pay for the costs.

Mr. Adam Larsen addressed the Board and requested that the Board not entertain this and to please vote it down. He voiced concern that some of the tests could take 3 to 5 days for results, which could allow for the virus to spread in the interim. He stated that the District’s Covid Plan has been effective and that there has not been an actual transfer within the District of the virus. He stated that staff has been very diligent, very careful, and the District’s plan has been highly effective.

Director Rich inquired if the District can conduct a survey to gather employee opinions towards mandatory vaccinations and if they’re comfortable with the current protocols and the current procedures the District has towards Covid. GM
<!-- Page 12 -->
![December 8, 2021, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+not+available)

Helliker responded that he has the ability to conduct anonymous surveys via Survey Monkey and could conduct that survey by the January 26th Board meeting. GM Helliker provided a brief summary of the District's Covid Prevention Plan.

Vice President Hanneman commented that the comments by staff members Silva and Larsen were inappropriate. Director Costa disagreed and stated that this is a public meeting and they have a right to speak.

President Miller called for the question.

The motion failed with the following roll call vote:

Ayes: Directors Hanneman and Tobin  
Noes: Directors Costa, Miller and Rich  
Absent: None  

3. Second Water Supply Agreement with Carmichael Water District (W)  
GM Helliker reviewed a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained that this is an extension of an agreement with Carmichael Water District (CWD) in case their water supplies are curtailed. He explained that they are not currently curtailed but they were curtailed shortly during the summer.

Mr. Zlotnick explained that the extension goes through July 2022 and the 3,000 acre-feet of water is a cumulative amount based on a maximum of 375 acre-feet per month. He informed the Board that when CWD was curtailed, they did request water deliveries, and in June/July/August just under 400 acre-feet of water was delivered.

GM Helliker informed the Board that the comments received stated that Fair Oaks and Citrus Heights water districts are concerned about the potential impacts of the water delivery on their water supplies. He explained that there is a provision in the agreement that would ease deliveries to CWD should the District not have adequate water supplies to deliver to our wholesale customer agencies. In addition, there was a comment regarding the price charged for the water delivery as compared to the price charged to the wholesale customer agencies. GM Helliker explained that the water would not be treated at the District's water treatment plant so there is no cost associated with delivering the water unless the District has to use PCWA water to replace in Folsom, then the charge would cover that cost.

Director Tobin commented that she would like to table this topic until the Spring since CWD does not need the water now. Mr. Zlotnick commented that he would request that the Board approve the items since there are time constraints with filing the Notice of Exemption and obtaining Reclamation’s approval; however, he suggested that if CWD gets curtailed and needs water, then staff would come back to the Board to obtain authorization to deliver the water in March. Mr.
<!-- Page 13 -->
![December 8, 2021, Board Minutes Page 7](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Zlotnick recommended that the Board approve the resolution with the caveat that the topic be reviewed in March.

Director Tobin moved (1) to make a finding that the up to 3,000 acre-feet of pre-14 water rights water contemplated to be potentially sold to Carmichael Water District is surplus to the supplies available to the District and necessary to meet Wholesale Customer Agency demands, (2) to approve the Notice of Exemption pertaining to the proposed Second Water Delivery Agreement between San Juan Water District and Carmichael Water District for the Purchase and Sale of Water Rights Water based upon both categorical and common sense exemptions, and (3) to approve the proposed Second Water Delivery Agreement between San Juan Water District and Carmichael Water District for the Purchase and Sale of Water Rights Water, and if Carmichael Water District gets curtailed then staff will bring back an agenda item in March to the Board to discuss the situation. Director Costa seconded the motion and it carried with the following roll call vote:

Ayes: Directors Costa, Hanneman, Miller, Rich and Tobin  
Noes: None  
Absent: None  

4. Fiscal Year 2020-2021 Results of Operations – Budget to Actual  
Ms. Silva provided a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. She informed the Board that all funds had revenues in excess of the budget and expenses lower than the budget.

VI. INFORMATION ITEMS  
1. GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT  
1.1 General Manager’s Monthly Report (W & R)  
GM Helliker provided the Board with a written report for October and November which will be attached to the meeting minutes.

1.2 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence  
GM Helliker informed the Board that the Water Forum has been discussing a modeling study that was conducted which shows the impact of climate change on regional water resources. For the Water Forum, the issues are reliable water supply and healthy ecosystem in the lower American River. He reviewed a graph on storage at various exceedances. One conclusion of the study was that, with additional sea level rise in the Delta, unless operations are modified in the Delta, it will take more water from upstream reservoirs to keep salt water out of the Delta. In addition, he reported that the work groups will start to meet again with plans to negotiate an update to the Water Forum agreement.

GM Helliker reviewed modeling data that was performed for the Bay-Delta Conservation Plan which shows that under different scenarios with the

![December 8, 2021, Board Minutes Page 8](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=December+8%2C+2021%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+8)

tunnels project in place, the tunnels could actually provide a benefit for storage in Folsom.

GM Helliker reported that there was a State Water Board meeting yesterday and today there was a session on the San Joaquin Water Quality Control Plan. He reported that the State Water Board will start to develop their environmental documentation to support an update of the Plan, based on the unimpaired flows approach. In addition, he reported that a proposed voluntary agreement is expected in early 2022, which has been worked on for the last three years. He reported that the American River basin proposal remains the same and doesn’t seem to be affected much by the State’s response.

Director Tobin inquired how much RWA grant money was received for the intertie connection with PCWA. Mr. Pierson informed the Board that the District’s share was $200,000, which should be received once the documentation is submitted.

## 2. DIRECTOR OF FINANCE’S REPORT
### 2.1 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence
No report.

## 3. OPERATIONS MANAGER’S REPORT
### 3.1 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence
Mr. Barela informed the Board that staff will be starting the annual flushing program, which will result in water being released at various locations. He explained that there are 444 dead ends that will require flushing, which might result in increased customer calls. Director Tobin inquired if the water could be used instead of just released. Mr. Larsen explained that there are instances where the water is released into a field or vineyard; however, since the water is treated, using it in ponds might pose an issue.

## 4. ENGINEERING SERVICES MANAGER’S REPORT
### 4.1 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence
No report.

## 5. LEGAL COUNSEL’S REPORT

The Board Secretary provided information on how the public could address the Board.

## II. PROPOSITION 218 HEARING
1. Proposed Retail Water Rate Increase

President Miller opened the Proposition 218 Hearing at 6:07 p.m.

Ms. Grant, SJWD Board Secretary, confirmed that the Proposition 218 Hearing was properly noticed to all retail property owners as required by law. Mr. Helliker reported that there were 24 written protest letters received. Copies of the letters and any received during the meeting will be attached to the original meeting minutes.

President Miller informed the public that a presentation would be conducted by Donna Silva, Director of Finance. A copy of the presentation will be attached to the meeting minutes. Director Miller asked for public comment prior to the presentation.

Mr. Joe Buckwalter addressed the Board and voiced concern regarding the District's fixed and variable costs not being in compliance with a study completed by American Water Works Association (AWWA).

Ms. Silva reviewed the timeline showing the previous workshops, tonight's public hearing and the January 26th Board meeting to vote on the rate increases, which potentially set the new rates on February 1, 2022. She reviewed the Retail division service area and highlights of the Retail Master Plan, the Total 10 Year Capital Needs, Retail Revenue Sources and some cost savings that the District has accomplished over the last five years.

Mr. Mark Hildebrand reviewed the Legal Requirements for Setting Water Rates in California, the Projected Capital Spending, and the Financial Forecast for the District. The Financial Forecast includes the proposed rate increases of 8% over the next three years. He explained that the rate increases from the fourth year out are only estimates based on the financial plan and are not included in this proposed rate increase.

Mr. Hildebrand reviewed the water bill comparisons for the District and other agencies in the region, which shows the District in line with the lower water rates in the region. In addition, he reviewed the Proposed Rate Schedule and a sampling of bimonthly bill impacts for customers.

GM Helliker responded to Mr. Buckwalter’s earlier comment and explained that the District structures the rates so that they match the costs, so the fixed daily base charges generate revenue that pays for the fixed costs that don’t vary as water production goes up and down. Mr. Buckwalter took exception to the analysis regarding the District’s split and does not agree with the District using
<!-- Page 23 -->
![January 12, 2022, Board Minutes Page 3](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=January+12%2C+2022%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+3)

this rate structure and believes that those using less water should pay substantially less than those using more water. Mr. Hildebrand commented that many would like to see the variable rates higher but unfortunately Prop. 218 does not give districts the ability to charge more to high water users simply because they want to encourage conservation or charge them more for higher use.

GM Helliker informed the Board that Manuela Szabo provided a question in the Chatroom which asked, “what is the water rate increase, for example the last 10 years? I see the projected 3 years rate increase plan, but would like to see a spreadsheet with the past 10 years plus the next 3 years.” He responded that the information is available and he would be happy to email it to her.

Mr. Sam DeSarno addressed the Board stated that he is a resident of Orangevale, however, receives his water from San Juan Water District. He formally protested the rate increase stating that his rates subsidize Granite Bay, all of the new projects for other water customers other than Orangevale, and the water that is delivered to Citrus Heights, Fair Oaks, Carmichael, and all the water districts around him. He would like his service moved to Orange Vale Water Company since they provide a lower rate and would like to know why San Juan water is more expensive than Orange Vale. GM Helliker assured Mr. DeSarno that the District’s retail customers are not subsidizing the wholesale customer agencies or the rest of the retail service area. GM Helliker stated that the wholesale division is separate from the retail division and San Juan Retail pays the same amount as the other wholesale customer agencies for the delivery of water. Director Costa offered to meet with Mr. DeSarno, and the Board Secretary provided email information for him to contact her at his convenience to set up the meeting.

Mr. Francis Petkovich addressed the Board and voiced concern that the 3-year rate increase from February 1, 2022 to January 1, 2024 is only 23 months. GM Helliker explained that the first year increase is effective February 1, 2022, the second year rate increase would be effective January 1, 2023, and the third year rate increase would be effective January 1, 2024. Mr. Petkovich opposed the rate increase.

Mr. Buckwalter addressed the Board again and compared the District to Fairfield, Davis and Woodland stating that their operating expenses are similar to the District’s and their rates are about half of the District’s. He reiterated the AWWA’s study regarding a 50/50 split between fixed and variable costs and questioned the District’s rate structure. GM Helliker explained that AWWA’s 50/50 fixed and variable rate does not align with the District’s expenditure portfolio. In response to Mr. Buckwalter’s question, Mr. Hildebrand explained that AWWA’s guidelines are high level guidelines, which are certainly not instructions to be taken too literally, since those guidelines have been litigated and proved not court worthy. In addition, Mr. Hildebrand stated that California has set itself apart with the implementation of Prop. 218, and the court interpretations. Ms. Silva explained that the daily base rate is designed to
<!-- Page 24 -->
![January 12, 2022, Board Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=January+12%2C+2022%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+4)

recover the District’s fixed costs, which do not change depending upon how much water flows through the pipes – the fixed cost covers the right to be connected and have access to a clean water drinking distribution system. She explained that the volumetric portion (variable rate) is directly related to the cost of providing the specific amount of water used by a customer. In addition, she explained that by aligning the rates with the costs, the District creates equity amongst the customers, so that everyone is paying for the actual water that they use and paying an equitable share of the fixed costs regardless of the amount of water that they use. Furthermore, this rate structure provides financial stability for the District and prevents the District from implementing drought surcharge rates.

Director Costa inquired if any of the 24 written protests opposed pay-as-you-go financing. GM Helliker informed the Board that none addressed that issue, with the majority making statements protesting the rate increase, some mentioned that the District should use other cost control measures, and some thought salaries and benefits were too high.

President Miller closed the Proposition 218 Hearing at 7:16 p.m.

Director Rich thanked everyone for attending and emphasized that the proposed rate increases are a result of $3-4 million in extra rehabilitation projects annually that the District needs to complete to keep the system reliable, in spite of the cost saving measures accomplished by the District. He explained that the District is investing more into the system than ever before which is the driver for the rate increases.

**AGENDA ITEM III-8**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Greg Turner, WTP Manager  
**Date:** January 26, 2022  
**Subject:** Renaming and Modification of Job Description for Facilities Maintenance Helper to Utilities Maintenance Worker I/II  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff is requesting the Board of Directors approve a name change of the Facilities Maintenance Helper to Utilities Maintenance Worker I/II and make it a promotable position with the addition of a salary range for Level II. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Personnel Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors.

**BACKGROUND**  
In 2012, the District created the Facilities Maintenance Helper (FMH) position to better address the District’s growing maintenance needs. The purpose of the position was to perform custodial work and provide support for plant and building maintenance. Since 2012, the department has completed several projects, and this position has participated in conducting many items on the maintenance task list, including assistance in performing conduit installation, chlorine and mechanical maintenance. Since 2012, the FMH position has evolved to help meet those needs. The FMH is a valued member of the treatment team, and the position’s role has expanded to include many maintenance activities, including actively participating in more demanding work, such as the department’s chlorine and confined space programs.

To date, the position has been a single salary range position with no ability to promote until positions open either within or outside the District. This position has turned over six (6) times since 2012 with the average length of stay in the position being 483 days (1.32 years). Recruiting and training for the position takes considerable staff time. Since the creation of the position, District Staff have spent 571 days (and counting) recruiting for the position, and it has been vacant in excess of 16% of the time. Whenever the position is vacant, higher paid staff must perform the duties in the interim as we recruit and train a new employee.

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends retitling the Facilities Maintenance Helper to Utilities Maintenance Worker I and providing a second step in the career ladder of Utilities Maintenance Worker II. Changing the job title will help target and recruit candidates interested in utilities maintenance and should benefit the District in future recruitments. Providing a second step will provide additional incentive for those interested in maintenance and skill development to stay with the Department and provide greater lengths of service and consistency. Additionally, with the extended duration in the position, their skills will further develop, providing a greater benefit to the District in the much needed technical trades. The addition of the Utilities Maintenance Worker II salary range creates the opportunity to bridge the gap and provides the opportunity for continued growth to the Utilities Mechanic position.

To be clear, this is salary range change only and not a new staffing position request.
<!-- Page 50 -->
![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)  
**Renaming and Modification of Job Description for Utilities Maintenance Worker I/II**  

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
The salary range for the newly named Utilities Maintenance Worker I position does not change and remains at $23.31 to $27.94/hour; therefore, the change in title to Utilities Maintenance Worker I has no cost impact. The addition of the Utilities Maintenance Worker II career ladder step will create a new salary range of $25.76 - $30.92/hour. Thus for this single existing position, the additional upper level of the salary range would allow an incumbent to earn an additional $2.94/hour or $6,115.20/year, should they meet the criteria to serve as the Utilities Maintenance Worker II.

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tony Barela, Operations Manager  
Paul Helliker, General Manager  
Adam Larsen, Field Services Manager  
**Date:** January 26, 2022  
**Subject:** Retail Meter Replacement Program Implementation  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff is requesting that the Board approve the establishment of a new Meter Technician position in the Field Services Department for the implementation of the Meter Replacement Program, and to achieve goals identified in the Retail Master Plan related to maintenance of the Distribution System. This staff recommendation was reviewed by the Engineering Committee on November 30, 2021, and by the Personnel Committee on January 18, 2022, both of which recommend approval by the Board of Directors.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
In June 2019, the District entered into an agreement with CHWD and multiple other agencies to complete a detailed evaluation of meter programs. The focus of the study is to examine numerous parts of the program, including the implementation of the meter replacement program. The results of the study and the replacement strategy were presented to the Engineering Committee on March 16, 2021 and to the entire Board of Directors on August 25, 2021.

Table 1 displays the proposed annual strategy for small, intermediate, and large meter replacements and testing.

**Table 1: Meter Replacement and Testing Strategy**

| Meter Components         | Small               | Intermediate      | Large            |
|-------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
|                         | 1-inch & smaller    | 1.5 & 2-Inch      | 3-inch & Larger  |
| **Total Deployed**      | 10,290              | 269               | 27               |
| **Annual Tests**        | 371                 | 27                | 15               |
| **Annual Replacements/Rebuilds*** | 515       | 27                | TBD              |
| **End Point Replacements** ** | 2,058         | 54                | 27               |

* Assumes a 20-Year replacement strategy  
** Assumes a 5-Year replacement strategy  

Staff has reviewed options for implementing the meter replacement and testing program. Understanding that this program is new and will require significant time and costs to complete on an annual basis, Staff has evaluated the differing options related to existing and future work tasks for the participating departments. Three implementation strategies were evaluated:
<!-- Page 52 -->
# STAFF REPORT
## Regional Water Meter Replacement Program Implementation

- **Option 1** – Contractor Installation Contract
- **Option 2** – Field Services Meter Team
- **Option 3** – Hybrid Contractor and Staffing Option

### Option 1 – Contractor Installation Contract:
Under this option, all tasks that can be most efficiently assigned to an outside contractor are identified and will be contracted out for completion. Table 2 lists the work tasks to be completed by the contractor and those to be completed by staff.

#### Table 2: Option 1 Meter Task Distribution

| Contractor Tasks                                   | Staff Tasks                          |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Troubleshoot Meter Read Issues (~66 Meters Per Month) | Contractor Management                |
| Meter Replacement Plan                             | Small/Intermediate/Large Meter Testing |
| Meter Replacement Broken                           | Large Meter Rebuild                  |
| Endpoint Replacement Plan                          | Meter Reading, Move In/Out Checks    |
| Endpoint Replacement Broken                         |                                      |
| Register Failure Replacement                       |                                      |
| Intermediate Meter Replacement                     |                                      |

The contract for the first five years would include replacing meters and end-points as defined in Table 1. Additionally, the contractor would be on-call to address meters and end-points that are identified as broken or in need of troubleshooting. The contractor would receive a list of meters/end-points identified by Customer Service for investigation and replacement as needed. This would require the contractor to be trained to complete these services and address problems at the meter location in the field. This option of using contractor services would require ongoing management from both the Field Services Department and Customer Service.

Staff time continuing under this option ranges between 2,100 hours for the first 5 years and then reducing to 1,000 hours/year for the last five years upon completion of the endpoint installations.

The contractor cost for the first five years would be approximately $207K/year, declining to approximately $145K in year six after the completion of the end-point replacements. Funding to cover these costs is included in the five-year financial plan.

### Option 2 – Two Person Meter Team:
Under this option, a single Meter Technician position would be added to the Field Services Department to be one of two operators assigned to the meter replacement program. For the first three to four years, the current meter reader employed in Customer Service would continue existing meter reading operations. As increasing numbers of endpoints are replaced with Automated Meter Reading technology, the time required to read meters will decline, allowing the meter reader to dedicate more time to the meter replacement program. During the five-year phase-in of the new endpoints, this position would be moved to the Field Services Department, as the two-member Meter Team comes to full fruition. Table 3 displays the duties assigned to this team.

![STAFF REPORT](https://example.com/image.png)

# Regional Water Meter Replacement Program Implementation

## Table 3: Option 2 Meter Task Distribution

### Staff Tasks:
- Troubleshoot Meter Read Issues (~66 Meters Per Month) (WE)
- Meter Replacement Plan (FS)
- Meter Replacement Broken (FS)
- Endpoint Replacement Plan (FS)
- Endpoint Replacement Broken (WE)
- Register Failure Replacement (WE)
- Intermediate Meter Replacement (FS)
- Residential, Intermediate, Large Meter Testing (FS)
- Rebuilding Large Meters (Contract Management) (FS)
- Meter Re-Reads/Move in/Out (WE)
- Meter Reader

*(FS) Field Services, (WE) Water Efficiency*

This option provides the most control by Staff to complete the work and does not rely on contractor assistance, monitoring, or additional training. Similar to Option 1, the Meter Reader position will be transferred to the Field Services Department at year three or four. Prior to the transfer of the Meter Reader, assistance from existing Field Services and Water Efficiency Operators will be necessary to complete these tasks. During this time, some system and site maintenance and training goals will be impacted to complete the meter program. This impact is discussed in detail below.

Staff time continuing under this option ranges between 4,290 hours for the first 5 years and then reducing to 2,160 hours/year for the last five years upon completion of the endpoint installations. Funding to cover the costs of this option is included in the five-year financial plan. Staff is proposing that the new position be limited to the Distribution Operator 2 salary range and that the operator hold a D2 Operator License. Annual cost for the new position will range from approximately $130K to $198K over a ten-year period.

### Option 3 – Hybrid Contractor and Staffing Option:
Under this option, a single Meter Technician position would be added to the Field Services Department, ultimately to be one of two operators assigned to the meter replacement program. Additionally, for the first three to four years, contractor assistance would be used for the replacing meters and end-points only. Once the Meter Reader is available to move from Customer Service to Field Services, the contractor would be released and the remaining meter and end-point replacements would be completed by the two-person meter team. See Table 4 for assigned duties.

## Table 4: Option 3 Meter Task Distribution

### Contractor Tasks:
- Meter Replacement Plan
- Endpoint Replacement Plan
- Intermediate Meter Replacement

### Staff Tasks:
- Troubleshoot Meter Read Issues (~66 Meters Per Month)
- Contractor Management
- Register Failure Replacement
- Endpoint Replacement Broken
- Meter Replacement Broken
- Small/Intermediate/Large Meter Testing
- Large Meter Rebuild
- Meter Reading, Move In/Out Checks

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**Regional Water Meter Replacement Program Implementation**

Similar to Option 2, this option limits contractor management, monitoring, and training. Since the contractor is not responsible for troubleshooting meters and end-points, oversight from Customer Service is not necessary. Additionally, under this scenario, Water Efficiency would be released and all tasks aside from meter reading, would be transferred to Field Services immediately. The Meter Reader would be transferred to Field Services at year three or four.

Staff time continuing under this option ranges between 3,380 hours for the first 5 years and then reducing to 2,160 hours/year for the last five years upon completion of the endpoint installations.

Option 3 is not fully funded in the current five-year financial plan. The additional contractor assistance would add approximately $100K to $120K per year for the first three years in addition to the new Distribution Operator identified in Option 2 above.

**Other Department Tasks**

The Retail Master Plan was completed and presented to the Engineering Committee on February 10, 2021 and the Board of Directors on August 25, 2021. ARV and Service Lateral Replacements as defined in the Master Plan require additional Field Services staff time to complete. Although this work will be completed by contractors, staff time is required to manage these replacements. The Field Services team has tracked this additional effort over the last couple of years to fully understand the impact on the department.

Over the last three to four years, the department has developed a maintenance program to be more in alignment with AWVA standards for system operation. This focus extends the distribution system’s life for the benefit of our customers. This change in focus resulted in the Field Services team revising its previous workload priorities, which has meant that some tasks not directly associated with these repair and maintenance projects have not been conducted. These include, but are not limited to staff training, site maintenance, some elements of basic system maintenance and maintaining the Baldwin Reservoir site. These are all items that are necessary on a day-to-day basis for District operations and for team succession planning.

The occurrence of service lateral leaks have steadily increased over the last 6 years. At the conclusion of calendar year 2021, there were more leaks than the total number of leaks for the last six years. In alignment with prior Board discussions, the Field Services team is relying on the on-call contractor to complete the majority of the repairs. However, the Field team is the first to respond to leaks when they occur. This commonly requires excavating and either temporarily or permanently fixing the leak. If the leak can wait for the on-call contractor, then the team addresses the immediate need and then prepares the site for the contractor. The number of leaks over the last year has had a significant impact on time to complete other maintenance items.

The proposed staffing option also offers increased coverage for emergency call-outs that occur after hours and on weekends. In the last two months, the Field team has had to call out staff from other departments to complete work afterhours and on weekends. The additional staff member and ultimately the meter team would provide additional resources for the Field team during emergency response.

**Page 4 of 5**
<!-- Page 55 -->
![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT+Regional+Water+Meter+Replacement+Program+Implementation)

**RECOMMENDATION**  
Staff recommends moving forward with Option 2 – Field Services Meter Team. This option includes approving an additional position at Field Services and then transitioning the Meter Reader position to Field Services over a three to four year timeframe. Over a ten-year period, this is the most cost effective option with the largest impact on the meter program, Retail Master Plan items, and department workload needs.

This option, however, does rely on Water Efficiency to assist over the first three to four years for register and end-point replacements and troubleshooting operations. These tasks will be transferred to Field Services once the existing Meter Reader position is transferred to the department. Additionally, existing field operators will be required to assist in the program. The new Meter Tech position will have a salary range limited to the Distribution Operator 2 position.

**Table 5: Option Cost Comparison**

| Option                               | 10-Year Cost  |
|--------------------------------------|---------------|
| Option 1 – Contractor Installation Contract | $ 1,754,000   |
| Option 2 – Two Person Meter Team     | $ 1,600,000   |
| Option 3 – Hybrid Contractor – Staffing | $ 1,930,000   |

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
Sufficient funds for Options 2 as defined above are included in recently adopted the five-year financial plan.

# AGENDA ITEM III-10

**STAFF REPORT**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Andrew Pierson, Engineering Services Manager  
**Date:** January 26, 2022  
**Subject:** On-Call Construction Management and Inspection Services Agreement – Amendment No. 1  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests consideration of a motion to approve Amendment No. 1 to the Professional Services Agreement with Inferrera Construction Management Group, Inc. (ICM) for on-call construction management and inspection services in the amount of $15,000, bringing the total approved project budget to $65,000.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
The purpose of the on-call contract is to provide construction management and inspection services to the District to supplement in-house inspectors when they are busy with other critical work. The original contract with ICM was signed in October 2020, and on July 1, 2021, a balance of $48,912.40 remained on the contract which was carried into FY 21/22. The increase in development construction during the summer and fall of 2021 limited the availability of the District’s inspector to provide full-time inspections for the 19/20 Water Mains and Services Replacement project construction work. Therefore, ICM was tasked to provide full-time inspection for the project, which started in early September 2021 and was completed by January 4, 2022.

The original on-call contract amount will be exceeded by approximately $10,000; however, an additional $5,000 is being requested for this amendment for additional on-call inspections that may be required for the remainder of FY 21/22.

---

**BUDGET IMPACT**  
The additional amount requested is included within the Engineering Department’s budget for FY 21/22; therefore, there will be no impact to the budget.

**AGENDA ITEM III-11**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** January 26, 2022  
**Subject:** Wholesale Water Rate Fee Schedule Revision  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Approve revisions to the Wholesale Water Rate Fee Schedule, effective January 1, 2022, to change the allocation of the fixed service charge. This item will be reviewed by the Finance Committee on January 25, 2022.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
On December 11, 2019, at the request of the wholesale customer agencies, the Board approved a change in the methodology of allocating the fixed quarterly service charge. The approved changes were as follows:

- Combined the quarterly service charge with the debt services charges;
- Allocate the quarterly service charge annual to reflect a rolling five-year average of water deliveries to the wholesale agency customers;
  - Groundwater pumped in lieu of purchasing surface water is counted as surface water when the pumping agency is compensated for the incremental cost of pumping by SJWD.
  - 2019 Debt Charge remains a separate, but unassessed charge so that the District can delay assessment of the charge until the amount and terms of the debt are known. Once known, it will roll into the quarterly service charge and be subject to the rolling five-year adjustment.
- District to provide 150-day notice of proposed change in rates annually once rolling average five-year water deliveries can be calculated;
- Board to approve allocation of quarterly service charge annually based on the updated rolling average.

---

**CURRENT STATUS**  
The San Juan Water District (the District) implemented the final rate increase in year five of a five-year rate plan last January 1, 2021. There is no net rate increase scheduled at this time. This action simply updates the allocation of the fixed quarterly charge based on the rolling five-year average of water use for the five years ending June 30, 2021. This recommended action does not change the total fees, just the allocation of the quarterly service charges amongst the wholesale customers.
<!-- Page 58 -->
![STAFF REPORT](attachment://STAFF_REPORT.png)

**Wholesale Water Rate Fee Schedule Revision**  
**Donna Silva, Director of Finance**

The 150-day Notice of Proposed Changes in Rates was sent to the wholesale customer agencies on August 25, 2021. The calculation of the updated rolling five-year average and the impact per agency, as provided in the 150-day notice is attached, as is the resulting proposed wholesale rate schedule for calendar year 2022.

The District has not received any communication from the Wholesale Customer Agencies in direct response to the 150-Day notice.

The District did receive one letter, back in November 2020, from the Citrus Heights Water District and the Fair Oaks Water District. The letter, which has previously been provided to the Board, requested a significant amount of detailed financial information, which was provided on January 22, 2021. On November 18, 2021 (almost a year later), the two agencies submitted an email requesting a substantial amount of follow-up information, most of which has been provided. That correspondence did not mention the upcoming adjustment the quarterly service charge.

Marcus Yasutake, Environmental and Water Resources Director  
City of Folsom  

**Subject:** 150-Day Advance Written Notice of Proposed Changes in Water Rates and Charges  

Gentlemen:

This letter is sent in accordance with Section 11 of the Wholesale Water Supply Agreements between the San Juan Water District and your agencies, to advise of a proposed change in the allocation of the fixed quarterly charge for calendar year 2022.

In December 2019, at the request of the Wholesale Customer Agencies, the San Juan Water District’s Board of Directors approved a change in the allocation of the fixed service charge. Prior to the change, the fixed service charge was allocated to each agency based upon a blend of their average water deliveries during calendar years 2012-2016 and the relative number of customer accounts. In December 2019, the Board approved a new methodology wherein the service charge is allocated each calendar year based upon the rolling 5-year average of water deliveries. Under this new methodology, the total amount of revenue to be collected via the service charge remains as set by the Financial Plan, but the allocation changes each January based upon the past five years of water deliveries per agency.

The Financial Plan set rates for a five year period, with the final rate increase applied January 1, 2021. The District intends to conduct the next Wholesale Financial Plan and Rate Study after the completion of the Wholesale Master Plan is underway. As such, the total quarterly service charge for calendar year 2022 will remain the same as the current year.

# AGENDA ITEM IV-2

**STAFF REPORT**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** January 26, 2022  
**Subject:** Refunding of San Juan Water District’s Share of Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series 2012A (San Juan and Citrus Heights Projects) — A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT APPROVING THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF A LOAN AGREEMENT TO REFINANCE OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS OF THE DISTRICT AND AUTHORIZING RELATED ACTIONS

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Approve and adopt Resolution 22-02 approving the execution and delivery of a loan agreement to refinance outstanding obligations of the District and authorizing related actions.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
In 2012, the District issued $15,195,000 Refunding Revenue Bonds (San Juan and Citrus Heights Project), Series 2012A (“Prior Bonds”), to refund 2003 Certificates of Participation. The Prior Bonds are currently outstanding in the amount of $10,125,000, have a final maturity of February 1, 2033, and are callable beginning February 1, 2022. The Prior Bonds are payable from installment payments by the District and Citrus Heights under their respective Installment Purchase Agreements. The District’s share of the outstanding Prior Bonds is $8,605,000 and have an average interest rate (or coupon) of 5.11%. After the upcoming February 1, 2022 debt service payment, the District’s share of the outstanding Prior Bonds is $8,050,000.

Approving and adopting the attached Resolution will allow the District’s share of the outstanding Prior Bonds to be refunded through a Loan Agreement with Sterling National Bank at an interest rate of 1.63%. The reduction in interest rate will reduce debt service payments by approximately $1.75 million through Fiscal Year 2033.

Upon refunding of the District’s share of the outstanding Prior Bonds, a portion of the Prior Bonds will continue to be outstanding. However, the District’s obligations to contribute to the bond payments will be extinguished, and the remaining Prior Bonds will be secured by Citrus Height’s Installment Purchase Agreement and solely payable by Citrus Heights.

---

**DISCUSSION**  
With the assistance of the District’s Municipal Advisor (Urban Futures, Inc.), special legal counsel (Jones Hall), and placement agent (Piper Sandler), staff determined to move forward with a private placement to refinance the District’s share of the Prior Bonds rather than a public sale, taking into consideration staff time, the lower costs of issuance, and the ability to facilitate a more efficient and timely closing in an anticipated rising interest rate environment.
<!-- Page 64 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

On December 14, 2021, Piper Sandler distributed a request for proposals (“RFP”) to over 50 banks and financial institutions; and on January 5, 2022, the District received 13 bids—indicating a very strong interest in the District's credit. The top 3 bids received included: 1) Sterling National Bank at 1.63%; 2) Pinnacle Public Finance (Bank United) at 1.65%; and 3) Capital One at 1.73%. The financing team compared these bids against each other as well as a public offering, and it was determined that it would be in the District's best interest to move forward with Sterling National Bank as the purchaser.

Sterling National Bank has agreed to the substantive business terms and covenants reflected in the attached Loan Agreement. If the Resolution is approved by the Board today, the financing team is ready to proceed to close the transaction on January 31, 2022.

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
The proposed Loan Agreement will generate an estimated total debt service savings (net of all Costs of Issuance) of approximately $1.75 million through Fiscal Year 2033. Annual savings is approximately $78,000 except for the 2033 maturity which has approximately $974,000 in savings. The Loan Agreement is shortening the final maturity to Fiscal Year 2032, and therefore there is more savings in Fiscal Year 2033. Additionally, in order to avoid accruing interest across different fiscal years, the Loan Agreement changes the principal and interest payment from 2/1 and 8/1 to 6/30 and 12/30.

The net present value savings of the refinancing is approximately $1.6 million which represents about 19.7% of the amount of debt being refinanced. This compares favorably to the District’s Debt Management Policy and the Government Financing Officers Association (GFOA) target of net present value savings of 3% on municipal refinancings.

The Loan Agreement is payable on parity with the District’s 2017 Bonds from District Revenues net of Operations & Maintenance Costs. Similar to the 2017 Bonds, the Loan Agreement requires the District to generate enough revenues (after O&M Costs) to pay 115% of debt service.

In accordance with California Government Code Section 5852.1, good faith estimates with respect to the Loan Agreement are attached to this staff report.

**SUMMARY OF DOCUMENTS TO BE APPROVED**  
The Resolution approves all documents and actions needed to authorize the execution and delivery of the Loan Agreement, including the engagement of the District’s municipal advisor, special legal counsel, and placement agent.

**Loan Agreement** – This document outlines the specific terms and interest rate of the loan and describes how the loan proceeds will be used, how payments are to be made, the repayment sources of the loan, the ability for additional borrowings on a parity basis with the loan, the ability to prepay the loan, ongoing reporting obligations, covenants, and other terms of the loan.

**Purchaser’s Term Sheet** – This document was provided by Sterling National Bank summarizing the terms of its bid, including interest rate, repayment terms, prepayment options, rate lock, and rate covenant.

# GOOD FAITH ESTIMATES

The good faith estimates set forth herein are provided with respect to the Loan Agreement in accordance with California Government Code Section 5852.1. Such good faith estimates have been provided to the District by Urban Futures, Inc. as municipal advisor to the District (the “Municipal Advisor”), each with respect to the Loan Agreement.

## Principal Amount
The Municipal Advisor has informed the District that, based on the District’s refinancing plan, its good faith estimate of the aggregate principal amount of the Loan Agreement is $8,152,536.62 (the “Estimated Principal Amount”).

## True Interest Cost of the Loan Agreement
The Municipal Advisor has informed the District that, assuming the Estimated Principal Amount, and based on the interest rate bid provided by Sterling National Bank at the time of preparation of such estimate, its good faith estimate of the true interest cost of the Loan Agreement, which means the rate necessary to discount the amounts payable on the respective principal and interest payment dates to the proceeds received from the Loan Agreement, is 1.63%.

## Finance Charge of the Loan Agreement
The Municipal Advisor has informed the District that, assuming the Estimated Principal Amount, and based on the interest rate bid provided by Sterling National Bank at the time of preparation of such estimate, its good faith estimate of the finance charge associated with the Loan Agreement, is $102,538.13.

## Amount of Proceeds to be Received
The Municipal Advisor has informed the District that, assuming the Estimated Principal Amount, and based on the interest rate bid provided by Sterling National Bank at the time of preparation of such estimate, its good faith estimate of the amount of proceeds expected to be received by the District, less the finance charge of the Loan Agreement, as estimated above, and any reserve fund funded with proceeds of the Loan Agreement, is $8,049,998.49.

## Total Payment Amount
The Municipal Advisor has informed the District that, assuming the Estimated Principal Amount, and based on the interest rate bid provided by Sterling National Bank at the time of preparation of such estimate, its good faith estimate of the total payment amount, which means the sum total of all payments the District will make to pay debt service on the Loan Agreement, plus the finance charge for the Loan Agreement, as described above, not paid with the proceeds of the Loan Agreement, calculated to the final maturity of the Loan Agreement, is $8,960,400.37.

The foregoing estimates constitute good faith estimates only. The actual principal amount of the Loan Agreement, the true interest cost thereof, the finance charges thereof, the amount of proceeds received therefrom and total payment amount with respect thereto may differ from such good faith estimates due to (a) the actual closing date being different than the date assumed for purposes of such estimates, (b) the actual original principal amount being different from the Estimated Principal Amount, (c) the actual debt service payments on the Loan Agreement being different than the debt service payments assumed for purposes of such estimates, (d) the actual interest rate being different than the interest rates estimated for purposes of such estimates, (e) other market conditions, or (f) alterations in the District’s refinancing plan, or a combination of such factors. The actual closing date of the Loan Agreement and the actual principal amount will be determined by the District based on the timing of the need for proceeds and other factors. Market interest rates are affected by economic and other factors beyond the control of the District.

The District may make adjustments from time to time in such rates and charges and may make such classifications thereof as it deems necessary, but shall not reduce the rates and charges then in effect unless the Net Revenues from such reduced rates and charges are reasonably expected to be sufficient to meet the requirements of this section.

(3) The estimated Net Revenues for the then current Fiscal Year and for each Fiscal Year thereafter to and including the first complete Fiscal Year after the latest Date of Operation of any uncompleted Project to be financed from proceeds of such Parity Debt, as evidenced by a certificate of an officer of the District on file with the District, including (after giving effect to the completion of all such uncompleted Projects) an allowance for estimated Net Revenues for each of such Fiscal Years arising from any increase in the income, rents, fees, rates and charges estimated to be fixed, prescribed or received for Water Service and which are economically feasible and reasonably considered necessary based on projected operations for such period, as evidenced by a certificate of an officer of the District on file with the District, shall produce a sum equal to at least one hundred fifteen per cent (115%) of the estimated Debt Service for each of such Fiscal Years, after giving effect to the execution of all Parity Debt estimated to be required to be executed or issued to pay the costs of completing all uncompleted Projects within such Fiscal Years, assuming that all such Parity Debt have maturities, interest rates and proportionate principal repayment provisions similar to the Parity Debt last executed or then being executed or then being issued for the purpose of acquiring and constructing any of such uncompleted Projects.

(d) No Arbitrage. The District shall not take, or permit or suffer to be taken, any action with respect to the proceeds of the Loan Repayments which, if such action had been reasonably expected to have been taken, or had been deliberately and intentionally taken, on the Closing Date would have caused the Loan Repayments to be “arbitrage bonds” within the meaning of Section 148(a) of the Tax Code.

(e) [Reserved].

(f) Arbitrage Rebate. The District shall take any and all actions necessary to assure compliance with section 148(f) of the Tax Code, relating to the rebate of excess investment earnings, if any, to the federal government, to the extent that such section is applicable to the Loan.

(g) Acquisition, Disposition and Valuation of Investments. Except as otherwise provided in the following sentence, the District covenants that all investments of amounts deposited in any fund or account created by or pursuant to this Loan Agreement, or otherwise containing gross proceeds of the Loan (within the meaning of Section 148 of the Tax Code) shall be acquired, disposed of, and valued (as of the date that valuation is required by this Agreement or the Tax Code) at Fair Market Value.

## EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

### SECTION 5.1. Events of Default Defined. 
The following are Events of Default under this Loan Agreement:

(a) Failure by the District to pay any Loan Repayment or other payment required hereunder after the date on which such Loan Repayment or other payment becomes due.

(b) Failure by the District to observe and perform any covenant, condition or agreement on its part to be observed or performed hereunder, other than as referred to in the preceding clause (a) of this Section, for a period of 30 days after written notice specifying such failure and requesting that it be remedied has been given to the District by the Lender; provided, however, that the Lender may, upon written request of the District prior to the expiration of such 30-day period, consent to an extension of such time in order to cure such failure if corrective action has been instituted by the District and is being diligently pursued and will, in the judgment of the Lender, be diligently pursued until the default is corrected.

(c) The filing by the District of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or failure by the District promptly to lift any execution, garnishment or attachment, or adjudication of the District as a bankrupt, or assignment by the District for the benefit of creditors, or the entry by the District into an agreement of composition with creditors, or the approval by a court of competent jurisdiction of a petition applicable to the District in any proceedings instituted under the provisions of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, as amended, or under any similar acts which may hereafter be enacted.

(d) The occurrence of any event of default under and as defined in any documents authorizing the issuance of any Parity Debt that are issued and outstanding during the Term, and such event of default has not been cured within the timeframes provided in such documents.

(e) Any representation or certification of the District made hereunder or in connection with this Loan Agreement shall have been incorrect or misleading when made.

### SECTION 5.2. Remedies on Default. 
Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Lender may, at its option and without any further demand or notice:

(a) declare all principal components of the unpaid Loan Repayments, together with accrued interest thereon from the immediately preceding Loan Repayment Date on which payment was made, to

- 19 -
<!-- Page 89 -->
![Loan Agreement Section](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Loan+Agreement+Section)

be immediately due and payable, whereupon the same will immediately become due and payable; and

(b) take whatever action at law or in equity may appear necessary or desirable to collect the Loan Repayments then due or thereafter to become due during the Term, or enforce performance and observance of any obligation, agreement or covenant of the District under this Loan Agreement.

The provisions of the preceding clause (a) are subject to the condition that, if, at any time after the principal components of the unpaid Loan Repayments have been so declared due and payable under the preceding clause (a), and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due have been obtained or entered, the District deposits with the Lender a sum sufficient to pay all principal components of the Loan Repayments coming due prior to such declaration and all matured interest components (if any) of the Loan Repayments, with interest on such overdue principal and interest components calculated at the rate of 8% per annum, and a sum sufficient to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Lender in the exercise of its rights and remedies hereunder, and any and all other defaults known to the Lender (other than in the payment of the principal and interest components of the Loan Repayments due and payable solely by reason of such declaration) have been made good, then, and in every such case, the Lender may, by written notice to the District, rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences. However, no such rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default, or shall impair or exhaust any right or power consequent thereon.

SECTION 5.3. No Remedy Exclusive. No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Lender is exclusive, and every such remedy is cumulative and in addition to every other remedy given under this Loan Agreement or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity. No delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default impairs any such right or power or operates as a waiver thereof, but any such right and power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. In order to entitle the Lender to exercise any remedy provided in this Article V it is not necessary to give any notice, other than such notice as may be required in this Article V or by law.

SECTION 5.4. Agreement to Pay Attorneys’ Fees and Expenses. If either party to this Loan Agreement defaults under any of the provisions hereof and the non-defaulting party employs attorneys (including in-house counsel) or incurs other expenses for the collection of moneys or the enforcement or performance or observance of any obligation or agreement on the part of the defaulting party herein contained, the defaulting party will on demand therefor pay to the non-defaulting party the reasonable fees of such attorneys (including those of in-house counsel) and such other expenses so incurred by the non-defaulting party.

SECTION 5.5. No Additional Waiver Implied by One Waiver. If any agreement contained in this Loan Agreement is breached by either party and thereafter waived by the other party, such waiver shall be limited to the particular breach so waived and shall not be deemed to waive any other breach hereunder.

# AGENDA ITEM IV-3
## STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** January 26, 2022  
**Subject:** Folsom Reservoir Raw Water Delivery Reliability Project  

---

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Authorize the General Manager to Execute a Memorandum of Agreement Regarding Sharing of Costs for the Project  

### BACKGROUND
Presently, San Juan Water District (SJWD), the City of Roseville (Roseville), and the City of Folsom (Folsom), through an existing 84-inch intake pipeline and associated pumping plant, can take raw water from Folsom Lake near the main concrete dam at Folsom Reservoir. This intake also provides raw water to Folsom State Prison. The existing raw water system has been operated without major interruption or outages. Since there is not a current backup system in place for raw water supply, the three water agencies, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), and the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) completed a Project Alternatives Solutions Study (PASS) in 2006 to identify potential redundant systems that could bring raw water to the agencies if unplanned outages were to occur again. The Folsom Pumping Plant and existing 84-inch raw water pipeline are auxiliary features of the Folsom Dam Project and are operated and maintained by Reclamation.

The PASS Team developed 14 alternatives and narrowed the list to four conceptual projects to further evaluate. Each of the four alternatives were further evaluated on cost, reliability, and benefit. One of the four alternatives, the River Pump Station, could be built downstream of Folsom Dam and not rely on a fixed water surface elevation in Folsom Reservoir for raw water deliveries and could be operated in any water year type. A second of the four alternatives, the South Side Pump Station with New Intake in New Auxiliary Spillway, could be built near the Auxiliary Spillway built by USACE. This facility would be built upstream of the Auxiliary Spillway and would be limited by the surface water elevation in Folsom Reservoir and could only be operated in certain water year types.

### ANALYSIS
In order to accomplish the goals described above and determine the best course of action, the Cities of Folsom and Roseville and the San Juan Water District wish to conduct a planning and feasibility study to perform the following tasks:

1. Working with each agency to determine the relative demands for sizing the facility
<!-- Page 100 -->
![Staff Report: Raw Water Reliability Project](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Staff+Report:+Raw+Water+Reliability+Project)

**Staff Report: Raw Water Reliability Project**  
January 26, 2022  

1. Review of historic storage and hydrologic conditions to evaluate how often each facility under the different alternatives can be used  
2. Identify pros and cons of each alternative, including operations and maintenance requirements if the facility is Reclamation owned and operated or agency owned and operated  
3. Identify power supply options for each alternative  
4. Identify the environmental requirements for each option (CEQA and/or NEPA)  
5. Develop a schedule for any environmental requirements for each option  
6. Include drawings (profile not needed) of the layout, alignment and probable construction costs for each alternative  
7. Include probable engineering design and specification development costs for each alternative  
8. Work with each agency and Reclamation to determine if the agencies need to include a new point of diversion in their contracts with Reclamation for the use of new diversion facilities  
9. Identify any regulatory requirements and include a description of what the requirements might be for each alternative  
10. Discussions with Reclamation and the agencies about operations and maintenance/ownership of the facility  
11. Include an overall project schedule for each alternative that includes design, environmental and construction  
12. Identify other potential alternatives to be further discussed  

On September 7, 2021, the City of Folsom Environmental and Water Resources Department issued a Request for Proposals for engineering consulting services for the Folsom Reservoir Raw Water Delivery Reliability Project with proposals due to the City of Folsom on November 5, 2021. The Cities of Folsom and Roseville, San Juan Water District, and the Reclamation staff, together the Technical Committee, evaluated the consultant submittal based on relevant project experience, the consultant's understanding of the background and requirements of the project, qualifications and experience of the consultant's design team, previous work with public water agencies and Reclamation, and proposal costs.  

Stantec Consulting Services, Inc. was the only team to submit a proposal. Five other consulting firms contacted the City and indicated that they would not be submitting a proposal due to current workload or not having specific experience in one of the areas outlined above. Stantec's proposal meets all of the necessary qualifications and experience requested by the three agencies and the three agencies agree the proposal is responsive. Stantec Consulting Services, Inc. also has several projects and studies completed with the Bureau of Reclamation and the three agencies. The estimated cost of the study was $250,000. The City of Folsom will have responsibility for establishing and managing the agreement with Stantec Consulting Services, Inc. for Engineering Consulting Services for the Folsom Reservoir Raw Water Reliability.

**AGENDA ITEM IV-4**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Adam Larsen, Field Services Manager  
**Date:** January 26, 2022  
**Subject:** Designation of Critically-Important Positions  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Adopt Resolution No. 22-03 approving an agreement to appoint Chris Mayer and Randy Potter in critically-needed Field Services positions as retired annuitants.

**BACKGROUND**  
After serving as the District’s Pump Station Lead Worker for 17 years, Chris Mayer announced on September 29, 2021, his plan to retire from the District on October 28, 2021. Daniel Griego was promoted to Pump Station Lead Worker on November 22, 2021. Darren Van Dusen was promoted to Pump Station Operator (Mr. Griego’s prior position) on December 18, 2021. Additionally, after serving as the District’s Pump Station Technician for 19 years, Randy Potter announced on November 17, 2021, his plan to retire from the District on December 24, 2021. Cody Sinnock was promoted to Pump Station Technician on December 18, 2021. With the recent retirements in the Pump Team, the District has transitioned two-thirds of its pump station operations staff losing extensive knowledge of distribution operations.

Mr. Van Dusen and Sinnock continue to make good progress in learning the pump station, reservoir, and distribution pressure management operations, as well as carrying out their new duties, but they still need to take advantage of Mr. Mayer and Potter’s knowledge and expertise on a temporary basis. This is specifically needed for after hour on-call response. Currently only Mr. Griego is trained for emergency response for after hour call outs. With the assistance of Mr. Mayer and Potter, we will utilize their extensive knowledge to assist Mr. Van Dusen and Sinnock when responding to after hour emergency call outs. This provides relief for Mr. Griego and provides a critical resource for the Pump Team until they are sufficiently trained to perform On-Call Duty on their own.

Additionally, the District has a number of mission-critical, time-sensitive projects that need to continue apace during this transition. Specifically, the Hinkle Reservoir Cover and Lining Replacement Project and the Kokila Tank Project. Both projects include altering distribution system operations utilizing alternative means to serve our customers. Mr. Mayer and Potter have significant knowledge and expertise of the distribution system operations that will be invaluable during the implementation of the projects.
<!-- Page 109 -->
Mr. Mayer and Potter have agreed to serve as retired annuitants during the next 17 months to fill these critical positions and provide their knowledge and expertise as needed to help the transition of this department. As a retired annuitant, they would be paid an hourly rate of $53.43 (equivalent to Chris’s current rate) and $48.37 (equivalent to Randy’s current rate) with no benefits, for the hours worked for the District. They would be able to work up to 960 hours per year.

Staff recommends that the Board designate these positions as critically-important and approve an agreement with Mr. Mayer and Potter to serve in these positions as retired annuitants.

# RESOLUTION NO. 22-03

## A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS  
OF THE SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT  
APPOINTING CHRIS MAYER AND RANDY POTTER TO RETIRED ANNUITANT EXTRA HELP POSITIONS

BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors of the San Juan Water District as follows:

1. **Recitals.** This resolution is made with reference to the following background recitals:

   (a) Chris Mayer has retired from the San Juan Water District in the position of Pump Station Lead Worker effective October 28, 2021. Randy Potter has retired from the District in the position of Pump Station Technician effective December 24, 2021.

   (b) Daniel Griego was promoted to Pump Station lead worker on November 22, 2021. Darren Van Dusen was promoted to Pump Station Operator (Mr. Griego's prior position) on December 18, 2021. Cody Sinnock was promoted to Pump Station Technician on December 18, 2021. With the recent retirements in the Pump Team, the District has transitioned two-thirds of its pump station operations staff losing extensive knowledge of distribution operations.

   (c) Messrs. Mayer and Potter were principal responders during off hours for emergencies and other critical needs for pump station, reservoir, and distribution pressure management operations. Mr. Griego is currently the only employee trained for these after-hour responses, and the District needs at least one additional trained responder available to support Mr. Griego.

   (d) The District has a number of mission-critical, time-sensitive projects that need to continue apace during this transition. Specifically the Hinkle Reservoir Cover and Lining Replacement Project and the Kokila Tank Project. Both projects include altering distribution system operations utilizing alternative means to serve our customers. Messrs. Mayer and Potter have significant knowledge and expertise of the distribution system operations that will be invaluable during the implementation of the projects.

   (e) The District Board of Directors desires to employ and appoint Messrs. Mayer and Potter in retired annuitant extra help positions under Government Code sections 7522.56 and 21224, and determines that, in light of their significant prior experience, skills and knowledge, their appointments are necessary to perform this specialized work of limited duration before he has been retired for more than 180 days.

   (f) The District Board has reviewed the employment agreements with Messrs. Mayer and Potter, which provides that each of their employments shall be limited to 960 hours in each fiscal year to perform the Project tasks requiring specialized skills not possessed by any other District employee.

   (g) As stated in the employment agreement and as further required by Government Code sections 7522.56 and 21224, the compensation proposed to be paid to Messrs. Mayer and Potter
<!-- Page 111 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
shall not be less than the minimum, nor exceed the maximum, paid by the District to other employees performing comparable duties, divided by 173.333 to equal an hourly rate. The maximum monthly base salary for the Pump Station Lead Worker position with the District is $9,261.18 and the hourly equivalent is $53.43. Mr. Mayer will receive an hourly rate of $53.43 (equivalent to $9,261.18/month) and will not receive any other benefit, incentive, compensation in lieu of benefit, or any other form of compensation in addition to this hourly rate. The maximum monthly base salary for the Pump Station Technician position with the District is $8,384.18 and the hourly equivalent is $48.37. Mr. Potter will receive an hourly rate of $48.37 (equivalent to $8,384.18/month) and will not receive any other benefit, incentive, compensation in lieu of benefit, or any other form of compensation in addition to this hourly rate.

(h) The District Board finds that no matters relating to the appointment or employment of Mssrs. Mayer and Potter with the District have or will be placed on the consent calendar.

2. Approval of Employment Agreement. The District Board of Directors hereby certifies that the nature of the appointment and employment of Mssrs. Mayer and Potter as retired annuitants is necessary to fill a critically needed position with the District requiring specialized skills possessed by Mssrs. Mayer and Potter that are necessary in performing project work of limited duration and, on that basis, hereby approves the employment agreements attached to this resolution and incorporated herein as Exhibits A and B.

Employee warrants that he is not currently employed as a retired annuitant by another CalPERS employer. Employee shall notify District if Employee proposes to accept employment with another CalPERS public agency employer and, if District objects to such proposed employment, Employee shall not accept it.

2. **Term.** The term of this Agreement shall commence on February 1, 2022 and will remain in effect until June 30, 2023, or whenever the Projects are completed, whichever is sooner, unless sooner terminated as provided in the termination provision in Section 5 below.

3. **Duties.** The District, through the Field Services Manager, shall assign Employee his duties and hours of work; such duties shall include maintenance and operation of the booster pump stations and water storage facilities, and distribution system pressure zone management, which requires specialized skills and training and which is critically necessary to the ongoing duties and functions of the District. Employee represents that he is properly trained and certified to perform the duties required under this Agreement. Employee further represents that Employee will maintain, at Employee’s sole expense and on Employee’s own time, all required licenses and certifications as a condition of this extra help retired annuitant employment.

4. **Hours.** Employee shall be available to work as necessary to fully and competently perform the duties of the position, regardless of the number of hours or time of day or week involved. Employee shall be compensated only for hours actually worked and generally shall not work more than 40 hours in a week unless authorized or requested by the General Manager. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee, as a retired annuitant, may not work more than 960 hours each in District’s fiscal year 2022 or 2023, and District shall retain the right to track Employee’s hours and to summarily suspend Employee duties in order to ensure that Employee does not exceed the 960 hour limitation in each fiscal year.

<!-- Page 114 -->
6. Compensation. For all services to be rendered by Employee under this Agreement, District will provide to Employee the following compensation:

a. Salary in the amount of $53.43 per hour, which falls within the allowable range of $44.52 to $53.43 per hour based on the District’s published monthly salary range for the Pump Station Lead Worker position divided by 173.33 to determine the hourly range as required by Government Code sections 7522.56(d) and 21224.

b. No additional benefits of any kind shall be provided, except that Employee may be reimbursed for his ordinary and reasonable business expenses incurred in the course of his work in accordance with applicable District personnel and expense reimbursement policies.

7. Other Terms and Conditions of Employment.

If any term or condition of this Agreement is inconsistent or in conflict with a term or condition of the Personnel Manual, this Agreement shall govern. If any term or condition of this Agreement is inconsistent or in conflict with a federal or state law, the law will govern.

8. Ownership of Documents.

District will have the right to use, modify, reproduce, publish, display, broadcast and distribute the Work and prepare derivative and additional documents or works based on the Work without further compensation to or permission from Employee.

Any amendment by District must be approved by the District Board of Directors at a noticed public meeting.

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** January 26, 2022  
**Subject:** Retail Financial Plan and Rate Proposal  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Consider adoption of Resolution No. 22-01 adopting a three-year schedule of retail water rates.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The District completed the Retail Master Plan in FY 2020-21, which identified the capital improvements needed to the retail distribution system over the next 10 years. With the last of the rate increases from the previous financial plan in effect as of January 2021, and the completion of the Retail Master Plan, it was time to commence the next Retail Financial Plan and Rate Study.  

Hildebrand Consulting worked with staff to update the Retail Financial Plan based on the retail master plan, and propose a rate schedule that would fund both ongoing operations, existing debt service and the capital improvements identified by the master plan. The information about the infrastructure program projects and funding needs (the Capital Improvement Program) was presented to the Board at the September 22, 2021 meeting.  

Based on the discussion about funding and rate alternatives at that meeting, the consultant prepared four capital financing scenarios for the Board’s consideration at the October 27, 2021 meeting:  

1. Issue debt for near term projects only, WITH the groundwater production facility included; (Staff's recommendation)  
2. Issue debt for near term projects only, WITHOUT groundwater production facility included;  
3. Expanded use of debt to finance both near and medium term projects, WITH the groundwater production facility included;  
4. Expanded use of debt to finance both near and medium term projects, WITHOUT the groundwater production facility included.  

At that meeting, the Board selected the first of these options, as recommended by staff. The Board directed staff to prepare a rate increase notice based on this option, to distribute to property owners and account holders in the retail service area. That notice, which is Attachment 1, includes the proposed rate increases in the following table.

Also included in the notice was information about three workshops that staff would organize, to allow customers the opportunity to hear more details about the financial plan and the rationale for the proposed rates. Those workshops were held on December 6 and 15, and were noticed as Board meetings, to allow any of the Board members to attend. Approximately 20 customers attended the workshops, which included good dialogue on the District's infrastructure investment plans, revenues and expenses and long-term financial picture.

The Board held the hearing on the rate plan on January 12, 2022, as required by Proposition 218. As of the end of the protest period, 24 protest letters had been received. Three customers provided comments and questions at the hearing verbally, and one submitted questions in the videoconference chat. Staff responded to all questions raised in comments.

Staff recommends that the Board approve the Retail Financial Plan and adopt the three-year rate schedule.

## 2021 Retail Water Rate Study  
### Executive Summary  

Hildebrand Consulting, LLC has been retained by San Juan Water District (District) to conduct a water rate study (Study) for the District’s retail water system. The full report describes in detail the assumptions, procedures, and results of the Study, including conclusions and recommendations. The scope of this Study is to prepare a multi-year financial plan, review the water rate structure, propose a 3-year rate schedule, and update the District’s Water Shortage Charges. This Study applied methodologies that are aligned with industry standard practices for rate setting as laid out in the AWWA M1 Manual, and all applicable law, including California Constitution Article XIII D, Section 6(b), commonly known as Proposition 218.  

### Financial Plan  

A 10-year Financial Plan was developed through several interactive work sessions with District staff. The analysis identifies a revenue shortfall in upcoming years which leads to a conclusion that revenue adjustments are required for the District. The District collects rate revenue bimonthly from water customers in the form of a fixed “Base Charge” assessed based on meter size and a water “Usage Rate” applied to actual water use. In addition to rate revenue, the District receives additional “non-rate revenue” from sources such as miscellaneous service fees, property taxes, leases, Capital Facilities Charges revenue, and interest revenue on investments. The District’s expenses include operating and maintenance expenses, debt service, and capital spending.  

The District plans to increase its average annual spending from $2.8 million to $8.3 million in order to pro-actively address water system rehabilitation needs associated with aging pipes, pump stations, water tanks, and other system deficiencies. This level of spending is aligned with the District’s 2020 Retail Master Plan. While the District typically follows a policy of cash financing capital projects whenever possible, there are instances when debt financing is appropriate. Such instances are typified by abnormally large spikes in capital spending. Given the District’s current reserves it is recommended that the District issue new debt for about $22 million to fund a
<!-- Page 126 -->
![San Juan Water District 2021 Retail Water Rate Study Executive Summary](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+2021+Retail+Water+Rate+Study+Executive+Summary)

portion of FY2022, FY2023, and FY2024 projects (namely the Kokila Reservoir, Eureka Rd Transmission Line and the proposed Retail Groundwater Production Facility). Issuing this debt will allow the District to simultaneously cash finance the rest of the capital projects over the next 10 years and establish larger reserve targets (which promotes pay-as-you-go capital funding) while minimizing water rate increases.

All of the above information was entered into a financial planning model to produce a 10-year projection of the sufficiency of current rate revenues to meet projected financial requirements and determine the level of rate revenue increases necessary in each year of the projection period. This Study proposes 3 years of 8% annual rate adjustments.

**Cost of Service and Rate Design**

The Cost-of-Service (COS) analysis evaluates the cost of providing water and allocates those costs to rate structure components to ensure the proposed rates are aligned with the costs to provide service. The COS analysis is performed in order to comply with Proposition 218, which requires water rates to be equitably apportioned and proportional to the cost of providing water service. This Study employed a COS methodology that is consistent with the “commodity-demand” COSA methodology promulgated in AWWA’s Manual M1: Principles of Water Rates, Fees, and Charges (M1). This is a well-established methodology as recognized by the AWWA and other accepted industry standards.

The cost allocation methodology begins by assigning all costs to one of three revenue recovery categories, including the account charge, the meter charge and the usage charge. The District’s Base Charge was then calculated based on a combination of the account charge and meter charge identified through the cost of service analysis. Base Charges apply to all customer water bills, regardless of the amount of water actually used. In calculating Base Charges, the account charge is allocated equally to all customers and the meter charge is allocated to customers based on their meter size. Under the proposed water rates for CY 2022, the uniform water rate would be $0.92.

**Proposed Implementation Dates**

| Current | Feb 1, 2022 | Jan 1, 2023 | Jan 1, 2024 |
|---------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Overall Rate Revenue Increase --> | 8% | 8% | 8% |

**Daily Base Charges**

| Meter Size | Current | Feb 1, 2022 | Jan 1, 2023 | Jan 1, 2024 |
|------------|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Up to 1" meter | $2.23 | $2.50 | $2.70 | $2.92 |
| 1 1/2" meter | $5.78 | $6.30 | $6.80 | $7.34 |
| 2" meter | $9.20 | $9.95 | $10.75 | $11.61 |
| 3" meter | $17.13 | $18.46 | $19.94 | $21.54 |
| 4" meter | $28.48 | $30.62 | $33.07 | $35.72 |
| 6" meter | $56.88 | $61.03 | $65.91 | $71.18 |
| 8" meter | $90.94 | $97.51 | $105.31 | $113.73 |

**Water Usage Charge ($/CCF)**

| All water usage | $0.92 | $0.92 | $0.99 | $1.07 |

**Water Shortage Charges**

The Study calculated an update to the District's existing Water Shortage Charges, which are designed to be overlaid on then-current water usage rates during water shortage events, as declared by the District. Water Shortage Charges are temporary and affect only the Usage Charge and not the fixed Base Charge. The Water Shortage Charge is a tool the District would use to reduce the financial impacts associated with reduced water sales and increases in operating costs during a drought event.

**Water Shortage Contingency Plan Stages:**

| Corresponding State Mandated Shortage Levels: | Normal Supply Conditions | Stage 1 - Alert | Stage 2 - Warning | Stage 3 - Crisis | Stage 4 - Emergency |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Use Reduction Goal --> | n/a | 0% to 10% | 10% to 25% | 25% to 50% | Greater than 50% |
| Assumed Water Use Reduction --> | 5% | 17.5% | 37.5% | 50% | 50% |
| Drought Rate Surcharge --> | n/a | 0% | 5% | 10% | 20% |
<!-- Page 128 -->
# San Juan Water District  
## 2021 Retail Water Rate Study  
### Executive Summary  

### Private Fire Line Rates  
The District assesses a charge for separate private service connections that provide fire suppression capabilities to structures and property (e.g., serving automatic internal sprinkler systems). The District provides maintenance and replacement services up to the backflow device for private fire service lines, which is a service that is not provided to other customers. The monthly Private Fire Line Rates are summarized in the table below and are calculated based on the cost of regular maintenance and the cost of replacing the line.

| Service Line Size | 4"   | 6"   | 8"   | 10"  | 12"  |
|-------------------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Daily Charge      | $1.03| $1.20| $1.34| $1.46| $1.60|

It is recommended that the District increase the above rates by 3% per year, which is equal to forecasted annual cost inflation over the next 2 years.

### Conclusion  
This Study used methodologies that are aligned with industry standard practices for rate setting as promulgated by AWWA and all applicable laws, including California’s Proposition 218. The proposed annual adjustments to the water rates are expected to enable the District to continue to provide reliable service to customers while meeting the state’s mandates.

The water rates, including the Water Shortage Charges, will need to be adopted in accordance with Proposition 218, which will require a detailed notice describing the proposed charges to be mailed to each affected property owner or customer at least 45 days prior to conducting a public hearing to adopt the rates.

# Section 1. INTRODUCTION

Hildebrand Consulting, LLC has been retained by San Juan Water District (District) to conduct a water rate study (Study) for the District’s retail water system. Hildebrand Consulting retained The Reed Group, Inc. as a subconsultant. This report describes in detail the assumptions, procedures, and results of the Study, including conclusions and recommendations.

## 1.1 UTILITY BACKGROUND

The District is a community services district formed under Section 61000 et seq., Title 5, Division 3 of the California Government Code. The District provides both wholesale and retail water service. The wholesale area (which includes the District’s 17 square mile retail area) covers approximately 46 square miles in northeastern Sacramento and southeastern Placer Counties. The District wholesales water to San Juan Retail, Citrus Heights and Fair Oaks Water Districts, Orange Vale Water Company, and to the City of Folsom for its customers north of the American River. The retail system serves over 10,000 residential accounts and nearly 500 commercial accounts.

The District’s existing water supply consists of three separate raw water contracts. The first source of water is a settlement contract with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) that provides, in perpetuity, for the delivery of 33,000 acre-feet of water from the American River based upon the District’s water rights, which date from 1853 and 1928. The second source is a repayment contract with Reclamation for 24,200 acre-feet of Central Valley Project water. The third source is a contract with Placer County Water Agency for up to 25,000 acre-feet of water. All sources of surface water are either stored or flow through Folsom Lake and delivery is taken at Folsom Dam outlets, either by gravity or pumped by Reclamation’s Folsom Pumping Plant.

This current rate study directly addresses District’s Strategic Plan goal to “Operate the District Sustainably and in a Financially Sound Manner while Maintaining a Fair Rate Structure.”

# San Juan Water District  
## 2021 Retail Water Rate Study  
### Introduction  

The District's retail water rate study was conducted by The Reed Group in 2017 and the last rate adjustment was made in January of 2021.

## 1.2 SCOPE & OBJECTIVES OF STUDY  
The scope of this Study is to prepare a multi-year financial plan, review the water rate structure, propose a 3-year rate schedule, and update the District’s Water Shortage Charges.

The primary objectives of this Study are to:

i. Develop a multi-year financial plan that integrates operational and capital project funding needs with a funding strategy.

ii. Identify future annual adjustments to water rates to help ensure adequate revenues to meet the District’s ongoing financial obligations.

iii. Update the cost of providing water service using industry-accepted methodologies.

iv. Recommend specific updates to the District’s existing rate structures in order to ensure that the District is equitably recovering the cost of service and comporting with industry standards¹ and California’s legal requirements.

## 1.3 STUDY METHODOLOGY  
This Study applied methodologies that are aligned with industry standard practices for rate setting as laid out in the AWWA M1 Manual, and all applicable law, including California Constitution Article XIII D, Section 6(b), commonly known as Proposition 218.

The Study began with a review of the District’s current financial dynamics and latest available data for the District’s operations. A multi-year financial management plan  

¹ As promulgated the American Water Work Association (AWWA) M1 Manual: Principles of Water Rates, Fees and Charges: Manual of Water Supply Practices M1, (7th edition), which documents many of the standards used by professionals in the utility rate-setting industry.

![San Juan Water District 2021 Retail Water Rate Study Introduction](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+2021+Retail+Water+Rate+Study+Introduction)

was then developed to determine the level of annual rate revenue required to cover projected annual operating expenses, debt service (including coverage targets), and capital cost requirements while maintaining adequate reserves. This portion of the Study was conducted using an MS Excel©-based financial planning model which was customized to reflect financial dynamics and latest available data for the District’s operations in order to develop a long-term financial management plan, inclusive of projected annual revenue requirements and corresponding annual rate adjustments.

Revenue requirements calculated for fiscal year ending June 2022 (FY 2021/22)² were then used to perform a detailed cost-of-service (COS) analysis. The COS analysis and rate structure design were conducted based upon principles outlined by the AWWA, legal requirements (Proposition 218) and other generally accepted industry practices to develop rates that reflect the cost of providing service.

² Fiscal years are sometimes indicated by their ending years. For example, FY 2021/22, starts on July 1, 2021, and ends on June 30, 2022, can also be expressed as FY 2022.

![San Juan Water District 2021 Retail Water Rate Study Financial Plan](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+2021+Retail+Water+Rate+Study+Financial+Plan)

## Section 2. FINANCIAL PLAN

This section presents the Retail System’s 10-year Financial Plan, including a description of the source data, assumptions, and the District’s financial policies. The District provided historical and budgeted financial information, including historical and budgeted operating costs, a multi-year capital improvement program (CIP), and outstanding debt service obligations. District staff also assisted in providing other assumptions and policies, such as reserve targets and escalation rates for operating costs (all of which are described in the following subsections).

The 10-year Financial Plan was developed through several interactive work sessions with District staff. As a result of this process, the Study has produced a robust financial plan that will enable the District to meet its future revenue requirements and achieve financial performance objectives throughout the projection period while striving to minimize rate increases.

The analysis identifies a revenue shortfall in upcoming years which leads to a conclusion that revenue adjustments are required for the District. The schedules attached to this report include detailed data supporting the Financial Plan discussed herein.

The Financial Plan reflects assumptions and estimates believed reasonable at the present time. However, conditions change. It is recommended that the District review its financial condition and scheduled rate adjustments as part of the annual budget process, as well as perform a more comprehensive financial plan and water rate update every 3 to 5 years, as conditions dictate.

### 2.1 FUND STRUCTURE

The Financial Plan is an annual cash flow model. As a cash flow model, it differs from standard accounting income statements and balance sheets. The Financial Plan models sources and uses of funds into, out of, and between the Retail Water funds.
<!-- Page 136 -->
![San Juan Water District 2021 Retail Water Rate Study Financial Plan](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+2021+Retail+Water+Rate+Study+Financial+Plan)

The Financial Plan model is based on the Retail Water fund structure and incorporates reserve policies for specified purposes. The reserve structure includes an Operating Reserve within the Operating Fund (Fund 50) and a Capital Reserve within the Capital Fund (Fund 55). Figure 1 includes a schematic diagram of the funds/reserves and major cash flows associated with the financial plan model.

An understanding of the fund/reserve structure is helpful in understanding the financial plan worksheets that model estimated annual cash flows through Retail Water utility from one year to the next.

![Figure 1: Schematic of Retail Water Funds and Cash Flows](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Figure+1:+Schematic+of+Retail+Water+Funds+and+Cash+Flows)

2.2 BEGINNING FUND BALANCES  
The budgeted ending cash balance for FY 2020/21 in the Retail Operating Fund was $2,737,00 while in the Retail Capital Fund the ending cash balance was $8,039,000. These cash balances were used to establish the “starting point” for the reserve levels for this 10-year financial plan. It should be noted that the amount of cash that the District keeps in reserves is a product of its reserve policies (see Section 2.5.4).

## 2.3 CUSTOMER GROWTH AND WATER USAGE
Over the period of 2016 to 2020 the District has collected an average of about $315 thousand per year in Capital Facilities Charge revenue from new customers connecting to the system, which equates to a growth rate of approximately 0.23% per year. This rate of growth is consistent with a utility that is largely "built-out". This Study assumes that this trend will continue for the duration of the next 10 years.

In the Spring of 2021, the governor declared a drought emergency in 41 counties, including Sacramento County. For purposes of this Financial Plan, it is assumed that water demand will decrease by 5% in FY 2021/22 and rebound the next year. If the decrease in water usage persists or intensifies the District will need to consider enacting its existing or updated Water Shortage Charge policy (see Section 4). It is impossible to reliably forecast future water use since so much depends on future weather conditions.

## 2.4 RATE REVENUE
Rate revenue is the revenue generated from customers for water service. The District collects rate revenue bimonthly from water customers in the form of a fixed "Base Charge" assessed based on meter size and a water "Usage Rate" applied to actual water use (measured in hundreds of cubic feet or "CCF", which is equal to 748 gallons). The Financial Plan starts with rate revenue levels that were estimated based on mid-year projections during FY 2020/21. Estimated future water demand and rate revenues include the small amount of customer growth (see Section 2.3), changes in water usage (see Section 2.3), as well as the annual rate revenue adjustments proposed by this Study. Budgeted and projected rate revenues (including proposed rate adjustments) are listed in Schedule 3.

## 2.5 NON-RATE REVENUES
In addition to rate revenue, the District receives additional "non-rate revenue" from sources such as miscellaneous service fees, property taxes, leases, Capital Facilities
<!-- Page 138 -->
![San Juan Water District 2021 Retail Water Rate Study Financial Plan](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+2021+Retail+Water+Rate+Study+Financial+Plan)

Charges³ revenue, and interest revenue on investments. Projections of all non-rate revenues were based on FY 2019/20 actual revenues with the exception of interest income which was calculated annually based upon projected fund balances and assumed interest rate of 1.5%, which is consistent with the District’s historical interest earnings relative to its total reserve levels. Capital facility fees were also updated based on year-to-date actuals. Property tax revenue is forecasted to increase by 2%. Budgeted non-rate revenues are depicted in Figure 2 below and listed in detail in Schedule 3.

**Figure 2: Budgeted Revenue Categories (FY 2020/21 Projections)**

- Property Tax 7.2%
- Capital Facility Fees 6.2%
- Operating Revenue 2.1%
- Interest Earnings 1.0%
- COP Payments 0.5%
- Rate Revenue 83.0%

2.5.1 Operating and Existing Debt Expenses  
The District’s expenses include operating and maintenance expenses, debt service, and capital spending. Capital spending is addressed separately in Section 2.5.3.

³ The District’s “Capital Facilities Charges” are known as “Capacity Charges” per Government Code Section 66013.
<!-- Page 139 -->
![San Juan Water District 2021 Retail Water Rate Study Financial Plan](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+2021+Retail+Water+Rate+Study+Financial+Plan)

Future operating and maintenance expenses were projected based upon the actual expenditures from FY 2019/20, calibrated by certain FY 2020-21 expense trends and adjusted for inflation (see Section 2.5.2).

Major budgeted expense categories for FY 2020/21 are depicted in Figure 3. Projected operating and maintenance costs are listed in detail in Schedule 1. This schedule specifically breaks out salary and benefit costs since these expenses are forecasted to escalate at a different rate than other operating expenses (see Section 2.5.2).

- **Debt**: 7.5%
- **Management & Admin**: 15.4%
- **Source of Supply**: 26.4%
- **Operations**: 32.9%
- **Customer Service & Water Efficiency**: 10.7%
- **Utilities**: 3.3%
- **Engineering**: 3.7%

Figure 3: Operating & Existing Debt Expense Categories (Projected FY 2021)

The Retail enterprise’s current debt obligations include repayment of 2012 refunding revenue bonds and 2017 refunding revenue bonds. The retail portion of annual debt service on the 2012 bonds totals about $300,000 and is about $560,000 on the 2017 refunding revenue bonds. The 2012 bond is scheduled to be paid off in 2033 while the 2017 bond is scheduled to be paid off in 2039.

## 2.5.2 Cost Escalation
Annual cost escalation factors for the various types of expenses were developed based upon a review of historical inflation trends, published inflation forecasts, industry experience, and discussions with District staff. During the projection period, expenses related to salaries and benefits are projected to increase at a rate of 5% per year while all other expenses (including Wholesale Rates) are projected to increase by 3% per year.

## 2.5.3 Capital Improvement Program
Figure 4 shows that from FY 2015/16 to FY 2020/21 the District averaged $2.8 million in cash financed (“pay-go”) capital spending. Going forward, the District is planning to increase its annual spending to an average of $8.3 million per year. The District is increasing its capital spending in order to pro-actively address water system rehabilitation needs associated with aging pipes, pump stations, water tanks, and other system deficiencies. This level of spending is aligned with the District’s 2020 Retail Master Plan. A detailed list of capital projects and associated costs is provided in Schedule 2. Notable projects include the replacement of the Kokila Reservoir ($9.5 million), multiple distribution mainline replacement projects on Cavitt Stallman ($9.8 million), a transmission pipeline project on Eureka Rd ($4.0 million), a new Field Services / Administration Building ($4.4 million) needed to address ADA non-compliance, and a proposed Retail Groundwater Production Facility ($5.2 million).

It is worth noting that the capital spending plan in Schedule 2 show that a number of projects are scheduled to complete the design phase well in advance (sometime multiple years) of the planned construction. This strategy will allow the District to plan more effectively and potentially position the District to qualify for grant-funding that favors “shovel-ready” projects.

## Figure 4: Historic and projected capital spending

### 2.5.4 Debt Strategy
As part of this study, we worked with District staff to evaluate alternative financing approaches for the above-mentioned capital expenses. While the District typically follows a policy of cash financing capital projects whenever possible, there are instances when debt financing is appropriate. Such instances are typified by abnormally large spikes in capital spending, as can be seen in FY2022/23 and FY2027/28 (see Figure 4). Such spikes in capital spending can either be addressed by drawing down on existing cash reserves or by issuing new debt. Given that the District’s current reserves are insufficient to fund both spikes in capital spending, it is recommended that the District issue a new bond to fund some of the FY2022, FY2023, and FY 2024 projects (namely the Kokila Reservoir, Cavitt-Stallman #1, Eureka Rd. Transmission Line, general replacement (at Bacon), and Retail Groundwater Production Facilities). Issuing this debt will allow the District to simultaneously cash finance the rest of the capital projects over the next 10 years and establish larger reserve targets (which promotes pay-as-you-go capital funding) while minimizing water rate increases. The total new debt would amount to about
<!-- Page 142 -->

2021 Retail Water Rate Study  
Financial Plan  

$21.7 million. Figure 5 shows how this debt strategy effectively “shaves” the need for cash in the immediate future.

![Figure 5: Forecasted Capital Spending with Debt Strategy](attachment)

This Study assumes the debt will likely be in the form of low interest rate financing through the State of California’s Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund (SRF) with a repayment period of 30-years and a fixed interest rate of 2.0%⁴. Interest rates in this program are approximately half of the interest rate on a traditional bond issuance. If the District is unable to secure financing from the SRF it would seek traditional bond financing, which would be at a higher interest rate.

4 These assumptions were provided by District staff. Hildebrand Consulting is not a financial advisor and cannot provide guidance to the District regarding topics such as future interest rates for bonds.

Table 1 summarizes some of the details of the proposed new debt issues, including the timing and the ensuing annual debt service.

| Approx. Annual Debt Payments           | $573,000   | $451,000   |

### 2.5.5 Debt Service Coverage
The District’s 2017 bond requires the District to maintain a debt service coverage ratio (DCR) of at least 1.15. The DCR is calculated based on the combined financial capacity of both the retail enterprise and the wholesale enterprise. Based on recently published guidance from Fitch Ratings, utility systems with midrange financial profiles should maintain a DCR greater than 1.5 times annual debt service. This Financial Plan demonstrates that a DCR of at least 2.9 will be maintained throughout the planning period.

### 2.5.6 Cash Reserve Policies

Financial Plan  

are consistent with 1) the District’s established policies and practices; 2) the findings of reserve studies conducted by the AWWA; 3) a healthy level of reserves for a utility per the evaluation criteria published by rating agencies (e.g., Fitch, Moody’s, and Standard & Poor’s); and 4) Hildebrand Consulting and The Reed Group’s industry experience for similar systems.

The following recommended reserve policies are based on Board-approved policies (Policy FIN 5.9). The policy recommendations are intended to help the District mitigate and manage financial risk while meeting service and financial obligations.

**Retail Operating Reserve** - The purpose of the Retail Operating Reserve is to provide sufficient funds (working capital) for operations of the District. The reserve will be maintained in an amount equal to at least 20% of the annual operating expenditures (excluding depreciation). This amounts to about $2.2 million in FY 2021/22.

**Retail Capital Reserve** - The purpose of the reserve is to accumulate funds necessary to pay for the replacement of Retail’s aged assets and to fund new Retail assets deemed necessary by the District’s Master Plan and Capital Improvement Plan. As written, this reserve policy has two components:

1) The sum of all annual revenue sources into this reserve should be at least equal to the amount of annual depreciation for Retail’s fixed assets.

2) The balance of the reserve should be equal to the accumulated depreciation for existing Retail assets, adjusted for inflation. If the Reserve balance is below this threshold, the District will work towards increasing the reserve balance or designate certain large capital replacement projects to be funded by the issuance of debt.

The purpose of the second component is to avoid and/or minimize the future issuance of debt for capital asset replacement. The “cushion” provided by cash reserves allows the District to draw down on reserves during above-average capital spending years and build the reserve back up during subsequent years. In reviewing the District’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) and discussing with District Staff, the Retail enterprise’s accumulated depreciation is approximately $29 million. While the District’s long term goal of creating such healthy reserves is
<!-- Page 145 -->
San Juan Water District  
2021 Retail Water Rate Study  
Financial Plan  

commendable, it is not reasonable to achieve such reserve levels within the next ten years. As such, this Report recommends a Capital Reserve target equal to 10-year average annual capital spending levels as an interim goal. This equates to a reserve target of $8.4 million.

**Target Reserves vs. Minimum Reserves** – When discussing the two reserve policies above, it is important to discern between two types of reserve policies. A minimum reserve policy refers to a reserve level that the District should never plan to draw down. Such reserves (such as the Operating Reserve policy) should only be drawn down in the event of an unforeseen circumstance. On the other hand, target reserves (such as the Capital reserve) are designed to be drawn down and built up over the course of a planning period. The purpose of such a reserve is to give the District financial flexibility, not to create restrictions on minimum levels.

**2.5.7 Proposed Rate Revenue Increases**

All of the above information was entered into a financial planning model to produce a 10-year projection of the sufficiency of current rate revenues to meet projected financial requirements and determine the level of rate revenue increases necessary in each year of the projection period.

Based upon the previously discussed financial data, assumptions, policies, and debt strategy, this Study proposes a 3-year schedule of annual rate adjustments as detailed in Table 2.

**Table 2: Recommended Water Rate Revenue Increase**

| Date               | Proposed Rate Revenue Adjustment |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| February 1, 2022   | 8.0%                            |
| January 1, 2023    | 8.0%                            |
| January 1, 2024    | 8.0%                            |

The numbers provided in Schedule 3 (cash flow proformas) are summarized graphically in Figure 6, which shows that the reserves are maintained over the course of the planning period and the DCR remains above 2.9 at all times.

* For Retail Enterprise only

It is important to understand that the rate increases that are being proposed are necessary in order to recalibrate the District’s revenue to be able to support a more proactive capital spending program, which is increasing from $2.8 million per year to over $8.3 million per year as outlined by the 2020 Retail Master Plan. The projected rate increases after FY 2024/25 shown in Figure 6 are only estimates to demonstrate that, based on current forecasts, larger rate increases are not anticipated for that time period.

This Study proposes a 3-year rate schedule rather than a 5-year schedule in part because of anticipated state mandates regarding water usage allocations. The financial impacts of those pending water limitations are not yet understood. Once the impacts are better understood, the District will need to consider potential adjustments.

modifications to its rate structure and the possibility of penalty rates in order to respond to the State’s decision.

### Cost of Service & Rate Structure  

## Section 3. COST OF SERVICE & RATE STRUCTURE  

The Cost-of-Service (COS) analysis evaluates the cost of providing water and allocates those costs to rate structure components to ensure the proposed rates are aligned with the costs to provide service. The COS analysis is performed in order to comply with Proposition 218, which requires water rates to be equitably apportioned and proportional to the cost of providing water service.  

Upon completion of the COS analysis, a rate structure analysis was performed to evaluate rate structure modifications and calculate specific rate schedules for implementation in FY 2020/21. The complete schedule of proposed rates for FY 2021/22 through FY 2023/24 is detailed in Schedule 4.  

The rate structure proposed by this Study is designed to:  
- Fairly and equitably recover costs through rates  
- Conform to accepted industry practice and legal requirements  
- Provide fiscal stability and recovery of system fixed costs  
- Meet other rate setting objectives, as described in Section 1.4  

This Study employed a COS methodology that is consistent with the “commodity-demand” COSA methodology promulgated in AWWA’s Manual M1: Principles of Water Rates, Fees, and Charges (M1). This is a well-established methodology as recognized by the AWWA and other accepted industry standards.  

### 3.1 CURRENT RATES  

The structure for the District’s current water rates follow a common industry practice with a two-part structure that is comprised of a fixed Base Charge and a consumption-based Usage Charge. The Base Charge is scaled based on the individual account’s meter size and currently recovers approximately 68% of rate revenue. The current Base Charge schedule is summarized in Table 3. Bills are sent to customers every two months.  

---

<!-- Page 149 -->
![San Juan Water District 2021 Retail Water Rate Study](https://example.com/image.png)

**Table 3: Current Daily Base Charge**

| Meter Size        | Daily Base Charges |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Up to 1" meter    | $2.23              |
| 1 1/2" meter      | $5.78              |
| 2" meter          | $9.20              |
| 3" meter          | $17.13             |
| 4" meter          | $28.48             |
| 6" meter          | $56.88             |
| 8" meter          | $90.94             |

The Usage Charge is assessed based on actual water usage (measured in CCF). The Usage Charge is a flat (or “uniform”) rate of $0.92 per CCF.

**Section 5.**

### 3.2 CUSTOMER STATISTICS

Water rate calculations are based on a number of factors related to the District’s customer base. Factors include the number of customers, customer classes, meter size, and actual water usage. The District provides water service through 10,675 water service connections (customer accounts). Single family, duplex and triplex customers comprise about 95.6 percent of the customer accounts and about 87.0 percent of annual water usage. Multi-family (4 or more units) and commercial customer accounts make up the remaining 4.6 percent of the customer accounts and 13.0 percent of annual water usage.

While there are extremes on both the low and high ends, average bimonthly single-family water usage is about 68.8 CCF (about 857 gallons per day). Water usage for condominium units and multi-family dwellings is lower than for single family residences for a variety of reasons including fewer people per household and limited landscape irrigation (or irrigation that is separately metered). Non-residential water usage can vary dramatically, and non-residential customers are served by meters of varying sizes to accommodate the differences in water demands.

Service connections with different meter sizes can place different demands on the water system. For example, 8 times more water can be delivered through a 3” water.
<!-- Page 150 -->

Cost of Service & Rate Structure  

meter than through a 1” meter. The current rate structure is based on hydraulic capacity factors which relate the potential demands on the water system from customers with different sized water meters. These factors are used to determine the number of equivalent meters represented by the total customer base with variable meter sizes.

Typically, the smallest meter size is assigned a hydraulic capacity factor of 1.0 and the ratios of rated flow capacities of the various meter sizes compared to the capacity of that smallest meter are used to determine the capacity factors for other meter sizes. This capacity relationship across meter sizes is used to allocate capacity-related fixed costs to various customers. This is also a common rate-setting practice used in the water industry. In this particular case the District has a mix of 5/8”, 3/4”, and 1” meter sizes for single family homes since the standard size has changed over the years. Previous cost of service studies took the weighted average of those capacity factors to establish a factor of 0.75 for the average single family home. 

Table 4 presents the rated flow capacity of various meter sizes and how these are used to develop hydraulic capacity factors.

**Table 4: Rated Flow Capacity by Meter Size**

| Meter Size | Rated Flow Capacity (gpm)¹ | Hydraulic Capacity Factor |
|------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|

There were two primary steps in calculating the proposed water rates. These are:

- Determine annual water rate revenue requirements
- Analyze the cost of providing service and proportionately allocate costs to be recovered from customers either through the Base Charge or the Usage Charge.

### 3.3.1 Water Rate Revenue Requirements
The 10-year Financial Plan was used to identify the water rate revenue required to meet financial obligations for each fiscal year of the planning period. The water rate calculations presented herein are based on the revenue to be generated in CY 2022, and reflects the proposed 8 percent overall rate increase to be incorporated in the District’s Financial Plan. The annual water rate revenue requirement with this rate adjustment is $14,673,600.

### 3.3.2 Cost-of-Service Analysis
Once the annual water rate revenue requirement was determined using the financial planning model, the next step in the rate-setting process was to allocate costs to be recovered through the various rate elements. Water rate calculations contained herein are intended to generate water rate revenue equal to the revenue requirement from the District’s water service customers. The manner in which each customer is...

responsible for the water utility's costs is the determining factor in the cost-of-service analysis.

The cost allocation approach presented by this Study is consistent with the methodology that was used in the 2017 rate study. Used herein the methodology is commensurate with the available data and the requirement to fairly and reasonably reflect the cost difference to provide services to different types of customers.

The cost allocation methodology begins by assigning all costs to one of three revenue recovery categories. The cost allocation process is performed with data available in the District’s detailed budget and other documents. The three categories include:

- **The Account Charge** recovers customer costs such as meter reading and billing that are fixed costs that tend to vary as a function of the number of customers being served. Customer costs are allocated to customers based on the number of accounts. That is, every customer will pay an equal share of customer-related costs.

- **The Meter Charge** recovers capacity costs that are also fixed costs; however, these tend to vary in relation to the capacity of the water system and the ability to serve the demands of active customers. Customers that place greater or lesser burdens on the capacity of the water system should bear greater or lesser shares of these costs. The sizing of the water system is based on the potential demand that each customer could place on the water system. Capacity costs are allocated to customers based on the hydraulic capacity of the water meter. The hydraulic capacity reflects the potential demand that a customer could place on the water system at any given time and is a general indicator of each customer’s capacity requirement. A customer with a large meter size will be assigned a large share of fixed capacity-related costs than one with a smaller meter. Capacity costs include costs associated with the water system’s capacity including contributions to the capital program, debt service, maintenance, and certain fixed operating costs.

- **The Usage Charge** recovers commodity costs that include costs that vary entirely or substantially in response to the amount of actual water use or are reasonably allocated on the basis of water use. Water purchase costs and energy costs are
<!-- Page 153 -->
![San Juan Water District 2021 Retail Water Rate Study Cost of Service & Rate Structure](https://example.com/image-url)

two typical examples. Even though some commodity costs are fixed, rather than variable, it is reasonable to recover a portion of fixed costs from customers through usage rates.

Table 6 summarizes how the FY 2021/22 revenue requirement is comprised of various functional categories of operating and maintenance costs, debt service obligations, and capital spending with offsetting revenues and the application of available reserves. It also illustrates how these functional cost categories are each assigned to one or more of the three revenue recovery components, previously described.

The costs within each of the functional categories were derived from the line-item detailed actuals for FY 2019/20, which were then forecasted into a FY 2021/22 budget. In reviewing Table 6, we see that half of Customer Service Costs are recovered through the account charge. All source of supply costs and 17 percent of field services (which is mostly made up of variable costs such as electricity) are recovered through the usage charge. The Use of Reserves (bottom row) is allocated based on the indirect method (based on the weighted average allocation of all previous costs).

The final allocations result in 6.0 percent of costs are recovered through the account charge, 65.6 percent are recovered through the meter charge, and 28.4 percent through usage charge. These percentages are similar but not identical to those developed in the 2017 water rate study. Changes to these allocation percentages is a natural by-product of shifts in the District’s cost profile (such as the increase in capital spending).

Once functional cost categories are allocated to the components, the total for each component is divided by the number of units to arrive at total unit costs for each component. The units of demand include the number of customer accounts (service connections), number of 1” equivalent meters, and annual water sales for the customer, capacity, and commodity components, respectively.

### 3.3.2.1 BASE CHARGES
Base charges are a combination of the account charge and meter charge identified through the cost of service analysis. Base Charges apply to all customer water bills, regardless of the amount of water actually used. Customers that use no water during

Cost of Service & Rate Structure  

a billing period should still be required to pay the Base Charge, as service is immediately available to them. In calculating Base Charges, the account charge is allocated equally to all customers and the meter charge is allocated to customers based on their meter size.

The proposed daily Base Charge in CY 2022 for a 1” meter is $2.50, as shown in Table 7. This value was calculated by adding the daily account charge of $0.22 plus 75% of $3.04, which is the daily meter charge per equivalent meter (both at the bottom of Table 6).

### Table 7: Calculation of Proposed Daily Base Charges

| Meter Size     | Customer Charge | Hydraulic Capacity Factor | Meter Charge | Daily Base Charge |
|----------------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Up to 1" meter | $0.22           | 0.75                     | $2.28        | $2.50             |
| 1 1/2" meter   | $0.22           | 2.00                     | $6.08        | $6.30             |
| 2" meter       | $0.22           | 3.20                     | $9.73        | $9.95             |
| 3" meter       | $0.22           | 6.00                     | $18.24       | $18.46            |

### 3.3.2.2 WATER USAGE RATES

Current water rates include a uniform usage rate for all customer classes of $0.92 per CCF. Under the proposed water rates for CY 2022, the uniform water rate would remain at $0.92 per CCF (as calculated at the bottom of Table 6).
<!-- Page 156 -->
## 3.3.3 Bill Impacts of Proposed Water Rates

Table 8 summarizes how the proposed water rates for CY 2022, with the proposed rate structure changes, would affect a sampling of customers. In most cases, water bills will increase by slightly more or less than the average 8% rate revenue increase for Year 1. These variations are a natural occurrence in the first year after a cost of service update.

## 3.4 ADOPTION OF PROPOSED RATES

The 3-year schedule of proposed water rates are presented in Schedule 4. The first rate increase is proposed to be effective as of February 1, 2022 while subsequent increases are proposed to occur each January 1 (halfway through their respective fiscal year).

### Drought Surcharge  

## Section 4. WATER SHORTAGE CHARGE  

This section presents recommended updates to the District’s existing Water Shortage Charge, which are to be overlaid on then-current water usage rates during the time that a water shortage is declared by the District. Water Shortage Charges would be temporary and affect only the Usage Charge and not the fixed Base Charge.  

The Water Shortage Charge is a tool the District would use to reduce the (potentially severe) financial impacts associated with reduced water sales and increases in operating costs during a drought event. The multi-pronged approach includes implementing the temporary surcharge, reducing capital spending, and relying (modestly) on reserves to help bridge the financial deficit.  

The proposed updates to the District’s Water Shortage Charges addresses the requirements of (recently passed) Senate Bill (SB) 606, which has directed water utilities to establish water shortage contingency plans (WSCP). The District’s current WSCP defines 4 stages of water shortage and how those water shortage stages correspond to the 6 stages of water shortage defined by the State.  

Table 9 presents:  
1) The water usage reduction goals (by District stage and corresponding State stage)  
2) The assumed actual water use reduction during each respective stage  
3) The proposed Water Shortage Charge expressed as a percent increase to the Usage Charge  
4) The changes in revenue for each respective stage  
5) The changes in expenditures for each respective stage including the proposed reduction in capital spending  
6) The financial deficit that will occur even with the mitigating measures.  

The Water Shortage Charges and reduction in capital spending have been calibrated to yield an overall deficit of approximately $100 thousand to $200 thousand per year.  

29
<!-- Page 158 -->
![San Juan Water District 2021 Retail Water Rate Study Drought Surcharge](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+2021+Retail+Water+Rate+Study+Drought+Surcharge)

This means that the surcharge and the reduction in capital spending will not totally offset the financial impact of the water shortage event. Given the District’s reserve policies, this size of a deficit was deemed sustainable for the duration of an extended drought (up to 6 – 8 years).

It should be noted that the capital program will need to be modestly curtailed during the various stages. Based on its recent experience during the historical drought from 2012 to 2016, the District assumes that the cost of its conservation will increase by $10 thousand per stage.

It should be further noted that the temporary Water Shortage Charges would only partially assist in covering the costs of providing water service during shortage conditions. Revenue from the surcharges would help bridge the financial deficit and would not exceed the cost of providing service.

### Private Fire Line Rates  

## Section 5. PRIVATE FIRE LINE RATES  

The District assesses a charge for separate private service connections that provide fire suppression capabilities to structures and property (e.g., serving automatic internal sprinkler systems). In effect, these connections extend the public fire suppression capabilities of the water distribution systems (i.e., provided through public fire hydrants) to private property. Fire flow capacity is built into the water distribution system (in pipelines, distribution storage, and pumping capabilities) as an essential public health and safety benefit to the entire community. The costs of maintaining the fire flow capacity within the general system are inextricably embedded in the costs of maintaining the water system and incorporated in the capacity cost component of water rates generally.

The District provides maintenance and replacement services up to the backflow device for private fire service lines, which is a service that is not provided to other customers. Maintenance primarily requires periodic exercising of valves but may also include visual inspection of the surface ancillaries such as valve boxes and covers, corrosion inspection and vault pumping. Replacement of standby fire services, up to the line of responsibility (typically the backflow device), is done by the District or an on-call contractor.

The proposed monthly Private Fire Line Rate is summarized in Table 10 and are calculated based on the cost of regular maintenance and the cost of replacing the line. Based on District staff estimates the maintenance costs for each service are approximately $95 every 5 years (therefore $19.00 per year). The replacement costs depend on the size of the service line as summarized in Table 10. The expected useful life of ductile iron pipe is 100 years, and the average length of the service line was assumed to be 40 linear feet.  

7 Customers who have private fire service connections also have general water service connections for ongoing water use.

**Section 6. CONCLUSION**

This Study used methodologies that are aligned with industry standard practices for rate setting as promulgated by AWWA and all applicable laws, including California’s Proposition 218. The proposed annual adjustments to the water rates are expected to enable the District to continue to provide reliable service to customers while meeting the state’s mandates.

The water rates, including the Water Shortage Charges, will need to be adopted in accordance with Proposition 218, which will require a detailed notice describing the proposed charges to be mailed to each affected property owner or customer at least 45 days prior to conducting a public hearing to adopt the rates. The District should consult with its legal counsel on the appropriate procedures for these fees.

As with past practice, the District should monitor financial conditions and needs on an ongoing (annual) basis and update the financial plan model if conditions or plans change sufficiently to warrant an update. Actual future conditions, such as water demand, water sales revenue, operating and maintenance expenses, capital project costs/timing, project financing, etc., may differ from the financial plan assumptions reflected herein. Material differences affecting the overall financial condition of the retail water system may warrant closer review and/or an earlier update. The need for and magnitude of annual retail water rate increases may also be affected by differences between assumed and actual conditions.

![Public Hearing and Workshops on Proposed Increases to Retail Water Rates](https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/173400029)

# NOTICE TO PROPERTY OWNERS

## PUBLIC HEARING AND WORKSHOPS
### ON PROPOSED INCREASES TO RETAIL WATER RATES

### WHY AM I RECEIVING THIS NOTICE?
Our records indicate you are an account holder and/or the owner of a parcel receiving water service in San Juan Water District's retail service area. This notice gives you information about proposed retail water rate increases that the District's Board of Directors will consider adopting at its January board meeting. It also outlines how you can participate in the rate-setting process.

### NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING AND COMMUNITY WORKSHOPS
On January 12, 2022, at 6 p.m., the San Juan Water District Board of Directors will hold a public hearing to consider proposed increases in rates for retail water service as further described in this notice. The hearing will be conducted both in person at the District’s Boardroom at 9935 Auburn Folsom Road, Granite Bay, CA, 95746 and via video conference. Due to state guidelines on physical distancing in public gatherings, the Boardroom can only accommodate a maximum of 10 members of the public at one time. All in-person attendees must wear masks. The District recommends that members of the public participate in the hearing via videoconference per the instructions below:

**Please join the meeting from your computer, tablet or smartphone.**  
[global.gotomeeting.com/join/173400029](https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/173400029)  
**You can also dial in using your phone.**  
United States: +1 (224) 501-3412  
Access Code: 173-400-029

Prior to the required public hearing, the District will hold two workshops. The first workshop will be held December 6, 2021 in the Eureka School Gymnasium located at 5455 Eureka Road, Granite Bay, CA 95746. Presentations will begin at both 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. Because of the small size of the District’s staff and the essential nature of our services, wearing of face masks by all attendees, regardless of vaccination status, will be required. A second workshop will be held, via videoconference only, at 6 p.m. on Wednesday December 15, 2021. See the District’s website at [www.sjwd.org](http://www.sjwd.org) for log-in instructions.

### WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE NEW PROPOSED WATER RATES?
Water rate revenues are the primary revenue source for the District’s retail division, making up 70 percent of its total revenues.

These revenues fund both operations and capital improvements. In the current year budget, capital improvements make up approximately 39 percent of total expenses.

Our recently completed update to the Retail Master Plan identified the need for significant and specific improvements to the District's water distribution system, as well as the maintenance thereof, necessary for ongoing system reliability. An increase in capital spending is necessary in order to replace equipment that is failing or past its lifespan.

The improvements identified in the Retail Master Plan will significantly increase annual expenses to repair and replace aging infrastructure. The Master Plan is available on our publications page at: [sjwd.org/publications](http://sjwd.org/publications)

The proposed retail water rate increase is necessary to generate sufficient revenue to ensure San Juan can continue to meet all of its retail operation’s service and financial obligations and make the infrastructure investments identified in the Master Plan. The increase in retail water rates will:

- Fund necessary infrastructure repairs and replacements
- Maintain and improve financial stability
- Meet required debt service obligations
- Generate funds to support preferable pay-as-you-go future capital funding (avoiding debt financing reduces costs to ratepayers in the long run)

### All Retail Revenues – $19,817,900
*(source: FY 2021-22 Adopted Budget)*

- Property Taxes
- Other Revenues
- Proceeds from Issuance of Debt
- Water Sales - 70% of total

### All Retail Expenses – $22,039,800
*(source: FY 2021-22 Adopted Budget)*

- Debt Service
- Water Supply
- Other Operating Expenses
- Capital Improvement Projects – 39% of total
- Salaries & Benefits

**CAN YOU EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT THE FACTORS AND/OR COSTS THAT ARE DRIVING THE PROPOSED RATE INCREASE?**

**2020 Retail Master Plan (Capital Improvement Plan):** San Juan Retail’s 10-year capital improvement plan (CIP), developed as part of the 2020 Retail Master Plan, includes over $83 million of improvements to ensure the current and future reliability of water deliveries. The average of $8.35 million per year in capital spending to meet the CIP need is a significant increase over the average of $2.8 million that has been spent annually during the past six years. The graph below shows historical actual capital spending compared to the future annual capital spending projected by the master plan to be.

**Historical and Projected Capital Improvement Spending**

**Increased System Maintenance Programs:** San Juan must maintain the distribution system that provides high-quality water to customers. This system includes over 200 miles of pipeline, multiple pump stations, meters, storage tanks and other equipment. The annual maintenance program was significantly expanded in 2020 to ensure compliance with regulatory and system reliability requirements. Also, most of the District’s meters were installed in the early 2000s after the State of California made the use of water meters mandatory. Those initial meters are beginning to fail and need to be replaced. The District is initiating its meter replacement program in FY 2021-22, which will result in replacing approximately 5 percent of the meters annually.

**Adopting a PayGo Financial Strategy:** In addition to increasing its reinvestment in critical infrastructure, San Juan strives to achieve a level of financial stability that allows the District to fund all of its capital spending with cash and not debt (also known as pay as you go or PayGo). Minimizing new debt will help the District avoid millions of dollars in future interest expenses.

**Rising Operating Costs:** The cost of operations increases annually due to inflation. During the years covered by the proposed rate increases, expenses related to salaries and benefits are projected to increase at a rate of 5 percent per year while all other expenses (including wholesale rates) are projected to increase by 3 percent per year.

For further information about San Juan’s projected rate increases, please refer to the “2021 Retail Financial Plan” which details the District’s current and estimated future revenue needs to provide ongoing, safe and reliable retail water service, including the rationale for the proposed rate increases. The financial plan is a part of the 2021 Retail Water Rate Study, which you can find at sjwd.org/retail-financial-plans, or you can receive/review a copy of the report at the District’s offices.

**WHAT HAS THE DISTRICT DONE TO CONTROL COSTS TO AVOID/REDUCE RATE INCREASES?**

By law, San Juan cannot change its customers more than the cost of providing water service, which includes the associated costs of ensuring the reliability of the service and the safeguarding of public health and safety. San Juan continually strives to keep costs low, improve efficiencies and optimize the use of its assets.

The proposed rate increases are lower than they otherwise would have been due to the many actions the District has taken over the past five years to control costs. Those actions include reducing the District’s salary schedule down to market median, refinancing existing debt to lower interest rates, significantly reducing the District’s unfunded pension liability, renegotiating water contracts to dramatically reduce costs and revising fees for new development to achieve full cost recovery, ensuring that ratepayers are not subsidizing those activities. Those and other actions will save ratepayers in excess of $1.2 million per year over the next 20 years and beyond.

---

**CURRENT AND PROPOSED RETAIL WATER RATES AND PRIVATE FIRE LINE RATES**

The Board of Directors is considering adopting the following three-year retail rate schedule, which will generate necessary revenues by spreading increases over multiple years.

**Proposed Implementation Dates**

| Overall Rate Revenue Increase | 8% | 8% | 8% |
|-------------------------------|----|----|----|
| **Daily Base Charges**        |    |    |    |
| Up to 1” meter                | $2.23 | $2.50 | $2.70 | $2.92 |
| 1-1/2” meter                  | $5.78 | $6.30 | $6.80 | $7.34 |
| 2” meter                      | $9.20 | $9.95 | $10.75 | $11.61 |
| 3” meter                      | $17.13 | $18.46 | $19.94 | $21.54 |
| 4” meter                      | $28.48 | $30.62 | $33.07 | $35.72 |
| 6” meter                      | $56.88 | $61.03 | $65.91 | $71.18 |
| 8” meter                      | $90.94 | $97.51 | $105.31 | $113.73 |

**Water Usage Charge ($/CCF)**

| All water usage | $0.92 | $0.92 | $0.99 | $1.07 |

**Daily Private Fire Line Rates**

| 4” line | $0.78 | $1.03 | $1.06 | $1.09 |
| 6” line | $1.16 | $1.20 | $1.24 | $1.28 |

**HOW DO THESE PROPOSED RATES COMPARE TO OTHER WATER AGENCIES RATES?**  
The graph above shows that San Juan Water District’s current and proposed rates remain highly competitive with those both in the region and across the state.

**HOW THIS INCREASE MAY IMPACT YOU**  
Under the proposed 2022 rate increase, a typical homeowner’s fixed or base charge for a 1” meter will increase by $16.20 per 60-day billing cycle, or 27¢ per day. The current water usage charge of 92¢ per 100 cubic feet of water will remain the same in Year One.

If the Board of Directors adopts this proposed rate structure and increases the base charge component, it is estimated that San Juan’s total retail revenue will increase by 8 percent in 2022. A customer’s actual increase will vary depending upon the size of their meter. If you would like additional information about how the proposed rate changes would affect your specific water bill, please call the District’s Customer Service Department at (916) 791-0115 and a staff member will be happy to assist you.

The proposed retail water rates shown above are expected to generate the necessary revenues to cover projected cost increases in the District’s retail operations over each of the next three years. San Juan is proposing a change to the composition of the rates in 2022 and a series of increases through December 2024.

The proposed rates have been calibrated to increase the portion of revenue derived from the fixed (i.e., Base Charge) component while still holding the per unit water usage charge constant in 2022. This adjustment will improve alignment between the District’s cost structure and rate structure, reducing the need to raise rates during periods of drought, when the variable cost of producing and delivering water supplies will drop commensurate with the decline in usage revenues. This approach provides financial stability to the District and rate certainty to our ratepayers. A corollary benefit of this approach is that it helps maintain the District’s strong credit rating, thereby reducing the cost of current and future debt obligations. This plan will save ratepayers money by reducing future upward rate pressure.

## HOW TO PROTEST THE PROPOSED WATER RATES

Any property owner of record of a parcel that would be subject to the proposed rates or any tenant directly liable for payment of water service fees (i.e., a customer of record), may protest the proposed water rate changes. To be counted, all protests must:

1. Be in writing with an original signature from the property owner of record or tenant directly liable for the payment of the water bill.
2. Identify the parcel for which the protest is filed by street address or Assessor’s Parcel Number (APN).
3. State that the signer opposes the proposed water rates.

4. Be received by San Juan Water District at any time prior to the close of the public hearing that will begin at 6:00 p.m. on Wednesday, January 12, 2022. A protest may be mailed to the San Juan Water District, or deposited in our utility bill drop off box located at 9935 Auburn-Folsom Rd, Granite Bay, California 95746, or delivered to the same address during regular business hours. Please include the following notation on the front of the envelope for any written protest: “ATTN: General Manager, Protest of Proposed Water Rates.”

If the District receives written protests in excess of 50 percent of the parcels receiving water service from the District the Board will not adopt the proposed rates. Only one protest will be counted for each parcel. By law, email, fax, telephone, or oral protests of any kind will not be counted. Mailed protests received after the close of the public hearing will not be counted, even if they were postmarked earlier.

Over the course of the next three years, the Board of Directors may increase retail water rates up to the maximum amount for each year identified in this notice without providing subsequent hearings or a formal opportunity for protests. Should the Board of Directors decide to increase rates in any given year in an amount greater than that described in this notice, a similar Proposition 218 notice will be provided to customers along with an opportunity for parcel owners and tenants to formally protest such an increase at that time.

# RESOLUTION NO. 22-01

## A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS  
## OF THE SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT  
## ADOPTING A THREE YEAR SCHEDULE OF RETAIL WATER RATES

WHEREAS, the Board has received and considered the Retail Financial Plan and Water Rate Update Study prepared by Hildebrand Consulting, Inc., dated October 29, 2021 (the “Rate Study”);

WHEREAS, the Rate Study presents the District’s revenue needs to fund retail water service, a financial plan for funding those revenue needs, and a rate structure for ensuring that the District’s retail water rates and charges are sufficient to meet revenue needs for the next three fiscal years, as further discussed in that study;

WHEREAS, as discussed in the Rate Study, the District’s existing retail water service rates, consisting of a daily base charge, water usage charges, and, if applicable, a daily private fire line charge (“Retail Rates”), are insufficient to pay the operating expenses of the District's retail water utility operations, to provide for repairs and replacement of water system works, to pay the principal and interest (including meeting the contractual debt coverage ratio requirements) on water system indebtedness, and to provide additional revenues for continuing capital improvements to the retail water supply system at a sustainable pace;

WHEREAS, the Rate Study identified the need for, and benefits of, implementing increases to the District’s Retail Rates so that its property owners and water users (“Customers”) will pay their full proportionate share of all costs necessary to provide water service to their parcels;

WHEREAS, the Rate Study demonstrates that the revenues derived from the proposed increases in the Retail Rates will not exceed the funds required to provide water service to the affected parcels;

WHEREAS, the proposed adjustments to the District’s Retail Rates will help ensure that the District's financial and water service obligations can be met with reduced risk and uncertainty, and as a result of the proposed adjustments to the Retail Rate structure, Customers will benefit from improved District financial stability and certainty, thereby providing for more reliable water service;

WHEREAS, the proposed increases in the Retail Rates described in the Rate Study are subject to Proposition 218's notice and hearing requirements provided in Article XIII D, section 6 of the California Constitution;

WHEREAS, as set forth in the Rate Study, the amount of the proposed Retail Rates imposed on any one affected parcel will not exceed the proportional cost of the
<!-- Page 176 -->
![Document](https://example.com/document-image)  
water service attributable to the parcel in compliance with California law, including section 6(b)(3) of Article XIII D of the California Constitution and Griffith v. Pajaro Valley Water Management Agency ((2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 586, 601) and other relevant law;

WHEREAS, the District has complied with Proposition 218's requirements by: (1) providing timely mailed notice of the public hearing to Customers; (2) holding several public meetings at which staff and Hildebrand Consulting explained the District’s finances and the need to possibly increase the Retail Rates in an amount up to 24 percent above existing rates over the upcoming three year period; (3) receiving protests and comments on the proposed increases; (4) making the Rate Study and supporting materials available for public inspection and review for at least 45 days prior to the Board’s public hearing on this matter; and (5) providing Customers with assistance in determining the impact on their parcel of the proposed increases;

WHEREAS, the District held the noticed public hearing required by Proposition 218 on January 12, 2021, at which the Board received protests and written and oral comments from Customers concerning the proposed adjustment of Retail Rates;

WHEREAS, Article XIII D, section 6 of the California Constitution states, “If written protests against the proposed fee or charge are presented by a majority of owners of the identified parcels, the agency shall not impose the fee or charge”, and, based on the District’s 10,696 retail connections, 5,349 written protests were received to prohibit the fee proposed Retail Rate increase but the District received only a total of 24 protests.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors of San Juan Water District as follows:

1. The above recitals are hereby made findings of the District Board of Directors and are incorporated herein.

2. The Board of Directors has reviewed and considered the Rate Study and hereby approves and accepts it.

3. The Board of Directors has considered the public comments received and the number of valid written protests submitted by Customers, and finds that there was not a majority protest to the District’s proposed adjustment of Retail Rates.

4. The Board also finds that the increase in Retail Rates identified in the schedule entitled “San Juan Water District Retail Water Rates is a fair and equitable retail rate plan for the 2022 through 2024 period and will ensure that Customers receiving District water service pay the District’s full costs of providing that service during that period.
<!-- Page 177 -->
5. On the basis of the foregoing findings, the Board of Directors hereby approves, adopts, and imposes the following Retail Rates:

The increase for 2022 shall become effective on February 1, 2022.

6. The Board also approves and adopts the increases in the Retail Rates for calendar years 2023 and 2024 as provided in the rate schedule above.

7. The General Manager and staff are directed to take all actions necessary to impose and collect the Retail Rates shown above as the same are adopted herein, provided, however, that the Board may either: (1) permit the adopted rate increase for each subsequent year to automatically take effect on January 1 of each year for 2023 and 2024; or (2) review each subsequent year’s proposed increase at least 60 days before its January 1 effective date and consider whether it is necessary to enact the increase as adopted or to adjust the increase consistent.

with applicable law and District financial covenants and revenue requirements. In no event shall any increase result in rates that exceed the cost of providing retail water service, including ensuring compliance with all applicable debt coverage covenants and accrual of prudent reserves.

8. The adjustments to the District’s Retail Rates are, among other things, for the purpose of continuing to provide funds to meet the costs of operating, maintaining and replacing water system facilities and to provide funding for capital projects necessary or required to maintain service within the District’s retail service area. The adoption of this Resolution is exempt the California Environmental Quality Act pursuant to section 21080(b)(8) of the California Public Resources Code.

PASSED AND ADOPTED by the Board of Directors of the San Juan Water District on the 26th day of January 2022, by the following vote:

**Conclusion**:  
November water deliveries were approximately 46% less than budgeted bringing the combined water deliveries for July - November to 13.5% less than budget. As shown in the numbers above, the main drivers of the variance are the Citrus Heights Water District and the Fair Oaks Water District, both taking less than anticipated in the budget. Because the majority of revenues come from the quarterly service charge, this equates to only a -4.1% variance in revenues.

Excluding SSWD, deliveries were 4,740 acre feet less than the same time period last year, a 22.5% decline. The budget anticipated year over year decline of 7.25%.

1. **Presentation of Independent Audit Results by Richardson & Company, LLP, Certified Public Accountants - Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2021 (W & R)**  
   Ms. Silva introduced Ingrid Sheipline from Richardson & Company, LLP, and explained that they conducted the independent audit of the District’s financials for fiscal year ending June 30, 2021. Ms. Sheipline provided the committee with their agenda, the Governance Letter, and the Management Letter. A copy of each document will be attached to the meeting minutes. In addition, staff provided the committee with the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR). The ACFR is available online under the District’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Reports webpage.  

   Ms. Sheipline reviewed the Audit Presentation Agenda and informed the committee that they have issued an unmodified opinion on the financial statements (clean), there were no material weaknesses to report regarding internal controls, and that the District has complied with laws and contracts that are material to the financials.  

   Ms. Sheipline reviewed the Governance Letter and informed the committee that there were no audit adjustments, and that there were no difficulties in performing the audit and no unusual accounting practices. She commended staff for their accounting skills stating that under Corrected and Uncorrected Misstatements there were no adjustments noted during the course of their audit which is very rare.  

   Ms. Sheipline reviewed the Management Letter and informed the committee that there were no internal control weaknesses. She mentioned that the last audit noted that there was one recommendation for improvement, which was to reevaluate whether retail capital facility fees currently collected are for future expansion. She explained that the District conducted a retail capital facility fee study and completed the Retail Water Master Plan, but the fee study will not be adopted until the Proposition 218 rate process is complete in January 2022.

2. Wholesale Water Rate Fee Schedule Revision (W)  
Ms. Silva reviewed a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. She reported that the wholesale customer agencies were sent the required 150-day Notice of Proposed Changes in Rates in August 2021, and no direct comments were received from them. She explained that the recommended action does not change the total fees, just the allocation of the quarterly service charges amongst the wholesale customers. This action simply updates the allocation of the fixed quarterly charge based on the rolling five-year average of water use for the five years ending June 30, 2021.  

The Finance Committee recommends approval of the revisions to the Wholesale Water Rate Fee Schedule, effective January 1, 2022, to adjust the allocation of the fixed quarterly service charge.

# GOVERNANCE LETTER

To the Board of Directors  
San Juan Water District  
Granite Bay, California  

We have audited the financial statements of the San Juan Water District (the District) for the year ended June 30, 2021, and have issued our report thereon dated December 15, 2021. Professional standards require that we provide you with the information about our responsibilities under generally accepted auditing standards, as well as certain information related to the planned scope and timing of our audit. Professional standards also require that we communicate to you the following information related to our audit.

## Our Responsibility under U.S. Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS) and Government Auditing Standards

As stated in our engagement letter dated April 28, 2017, our responsibility, as described by professional standards, is to express an opinion about whether the financial statements prepared by management with your oversight are fairly presented, in all material respects, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our audit of the financial statements does not relieve you or management of your responsibilities.

As part of our audit, we considered the internal control of the District. Such considerations were solely for the purpose of determining our audit procedures and not to provide any assurance concerning such internal control.

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, we will also perform tests of the District’s compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions is not an objective of our audit.

## Planned Scope and Timing of the Audit

An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; therefore, our audit involves judgment about the number of transactions to be examined and the areas to be tested.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of the entity and its environment, including internal control, sufficient to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements and to design the nature, timing, and extent of further audit procedures. Material misstatements may result from (1) errors, (2) fraudulent financial reporting, (3) misappropriation of assets, or (4) violations of laws or governmental regulations that are attributable to the entity or to acts by management or employees acting on behalf of the entity. No internal control weaknesses were noted as a result of our audit.

Board of Directors  
San Juan Water District  
Page 2  

We performed the audit according to the planned scope previously communicated to you in our engagement letter dated April 28, 2017.  

**Qualitative Aspects of Accounting Practices**  
Management is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies. The significant accounting policies used by the District are described in Note A to the financial statements. No new accounting policies were adopted and the application of existing policies was not changed during the year.  

We noted no transaction entered into by the District during the year for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus. All significant transactions have been recognized in the financial statements in the proper period.  

Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based on management’s knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ significantly from those expected. The most sensitive estimates affecting the financial statements were: depreciable lives and method used to depreciate capital assets and the accruals for postemployment and pension benefits. We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates in determining that they are reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole. The accrual for postemployment and pension benefits was determined by actuarial valuations, which are required to be performed by a District-contracted actuary every two years for postemployment benefits and by CalPERS every year for pension benefits.  

Certain financial statement disclosures are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statement users. The most sensitive disclosure affecting the financial statements was the following:  

- Information on the District’s pension plan, including the District’s share of the unfunded pension liability, is shown in Note I. The District’s share of the unfunded pension liability at June 30, 2020, the most recent measurement date, was $3,322,197, which is reflected as a liability in the District’s financial statements as of June 30, 2021. As a result of the changes in the net pension liability and related deferred inflows and outflows, the District’s pension expense is $984,060, not including contributions to the plan.  

- The postemployment benefit (OPEB) disclosure in Note J shows that the District’s share of the unfunded OPEB liability at June 30, 2020, the most recent measurement date, was $2,985,927 which is reflected as a liability in the District’s financial statements as of June 30, 2021. As a result of the recording of the net OPEB liability and related deferred inflows and outflows, the District’s OPEB expense is $344,026, not including contributions to the trust and retiree premium payments, primarily to record changes in the net OPEB liability and deferred outflows and inflows. In calculating the District’s OPEB liability, the District’s actuary applied Section 3.7.7(c) of the Actuarial Standard of Practice No. 6, as revised, and determined age-adjusted healthcare premiums were not necessary in the computation of the net OPEB liability. Many other actuaries consider it necessary under actuarial standards to use age-adjusted premiums in the computation of the OPEB liability. Had age-adjusted premiums been used, the District’s OPEB liability would have been significantly larger. This is an apparent lack of consensus in the industry that was disclosed in Note J to the financial statements.  

The financial statement disclosures are neutral, consistent, and clear.

### Difficulties Encountered in Performing the Audit
We encountered no difficulties in dealing with management in performing and completing our audit.

### Corrected and Uncorrected Misstatements
Professional standards require us to accumulate all known and likely misstatements identified during the audit, other than those that are trivial, and communicate them to the appropriate level of management. No adjustments were noted during the course of our audit.

### Disagreements With Management
For purposes of this letter, professional standards define a disagreement with management as a matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction, concerning a financial accounting, reporting, or auditing matter that could be significant to the financial statements or the auditor’s report. We are pleased to report that no such disagreements arose during the course of our audit.

### Management Representations
We have requested certain representations from management that are included in the management representation letter dated December 15, 2021.

### Management Consultations With Other Independent Accountants
In some cases, management may decide to consult with other accountants about auditing and accounting matters, similar to obtaining a “second opinion” on certain situations. If a consultation involves application of an accounting principle to the District’s financial statements or a determination of the type of auditor’s opinion that may be expressed on those statements, our professional standards require the consulting accountant to check with us to determine that the consultant has all the relevant facts. To our knowledge, there were no such consultations with other accountants, other than consultation with another firm regarding the accounting for various agreements and contracts.

### Issues Discussed Prior to Retention of Independent Auditors
We generally discuss a variety of matters, including the application of accounting principles and auditing standards, with management each year prior to retention as the District’s auditors. However, these discussions occurred in the normal course of our professional relationship and our responses were not a condition to our retention.

### Other Matters
We applied certain limited procedures to required supplementary information (RSI) as reported in the table of contents of the financial statements that supplements the basic financial statements. Our procedures consisted of inquiries of management regarding the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We did not audit the RSI and do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the RSI.

We were not engaged to report on separate wholesale and retail financial statements listed in the table of contents, which accompany the financial statements but are not RSI. Such information has not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide assurance on it.

We were engaged to report on the introductory and statistical sections, which accompany the financial statements but are not Required Supplementary Information. With respect to this supplementary information, we made certain inquiries of management and evaluated the form, content, and methods of preparing the information to determine that the information complies with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the method of preparing it has not changed from the prior period, and the information is appropriate and complete in relation to our audit of the financial statements. We compared and reconciled the supplementary information to the underlying accounting records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves.

This information is intended solely for the use of the Board of Directors and management of the District and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

**MANAGEMENT LETTER**

To the Board of Directors and Management  
San Juan Water District  
Granite Bay, California  

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of the San Juan Water District (the District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, we considered the District's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses. Given those limitations, during our audit, we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

However, during our prior year audit, we became aware of the following matters that have been included in this letter for your consideration:

**Capacity Fees**

Currently the capacity fees collected under Government Code Section 66013(d) and (e) are assumed to be applied against capital costs incurred in prior years. In the prior year, it was determined that the Retail Capital Facility Fees should not be updated until the District’s completion of the next Retail Water Master Plan. We recommend that the District implement the recommendations of the consultant to update the capital facilities fee calculation at least once every three to five years and complete the Retail Capital Facility Fees Study. In the current year, the District conducted a retail capital facility fee study and completed the Retail Water Master Plan, but the fee study will not be adopted until a Proposition 218 rate process is complete.
