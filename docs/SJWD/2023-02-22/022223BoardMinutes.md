outlooks, storage levels and projections, and current reservoir conditions across the state.

GM Helliker reported that precipitation levels are still above normal and the snow levels are at 186% of the April 1st average for the American River watershed (Central). He reviewed the forecast for total run-off and the incoming atmospheric rivers. He reviewed the Drought Monitor Main Map and the Drought Monitor Better Maps and informed the Board that he has been advocating for the media to use the latter since it is a better indicator of the actual drought situation related to urban water supplies.

GM Helliker reviewed the Folsom Reservoir Flood Control Curve chart and anticipates Folsom Reservoir filling over the next few months. He reviewed the water temperature at the dam. In addition, he informed the Board that the CVP water allocation was released today and indicated that the settlement contractors who received 18% last year are expected to receive 100% this year. San Juan’s allocation is 75% of historic use (which is 0).

4. Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker informed the Board that Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD) indicates that they are unable to meet regarding conjunctive use and groundwater banking for a few months. Director Costa informed the Board that Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) is drafting a response to Director Miller’s October, 2022 letter and it should be received in the next couple of days, and that FOWD appointed two directors to meet with two SJWD directors to discuss this topic. GM Helliker informed the Board that President Rich appointed Director Costa and himself to represent the District on the FOWD 2x2 committee. In addition, GM Helliker will provide the Board with the options document that is being discussed with SSWD and Orangevale.

In response to Director Miller’s comment, GM Helliker informed the Board that there are other options available to the District for groundwater banking and the District is not limited to partnering with FOWD or CHWD only. Director Miller urged the committee to recommend a sunset date for FOWD and CHWD to decide if they would like to pursue a partnership regarding this topic. In addition, the Board discussed the District constructing its own groundwater well and GM Helliker commented that since the District is not in the business of operating and maintaining wells, it might be best if a partnership with an agency that does operate wells were established.

V. NEW BUSINESS

1. ACWA JPIA Executive Committee Nomination (W & R)  
Director Tobin informed the Board that there are four seats open for election on the ACWA JPIA Executive Committee, and she would like to be nominated.

Director Miller moved to adopt Resolution 23-03 nominating Pam Tobin to the Executive Committee of the Association of California Water Agencies Joint Powers Insurance Authority. Director Costa seconded the motion and it carried with 4 Ayes and 1 Absent (Rich).
<!-- Page 4 -->
2. Legislation (W & R)  
GM Helliker requested that the Board delay any action on Initiative 21-0042A1 until a future meeting. He informed the Board that SB 366 is the bill that the Solve the Water Crisis group is working on; however, he asked that a position on this bill be delayed as well, since the bill as introduced is only a spot bill. Director Tobin stated that ACWA is also working on these items and she suggested that the Board wait to take a position. Vice President Zamorano agreed that the Board should wait to take a position, especially since SB 366 is a spot bill.  

Director Miller moved to adopt an oppose position on Initiative 21-0042A1. Director Tobin seconded the motion. The vote began with a No vote from Director Costa and an Aye vote from Director Miller; however, Director Tobin questioned the motion, then with clarification from Legal Counsel Jones, Director Miller withdrew his motion and Director Tobin withdrew her second to the motion.  

Vice President Zamorano asked under New Business to make a motion for a one-time rebate of $5 for residential customers - the $5 rebate is to be deducted from a designated monthly bill - refer this motion to the Finance Committee and back to the Board for consideration. In response to Director Miller, Vice President Zamorano explained that since the Board is willing to give COLAs of 5-6% totaling $70-80,000 in perpetuity then a small rebate to residential customers is a way to show respect to the customers and that the Board is looking out for their best interest.  

VI. INFORMATION ITEMS  

1. GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT  
1.1 General Manager’s Monthly Report (W & R)  
GM Helliker provided the Board with a written report for January which will be attached to the meeting minutes.  

1.2 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence  
GM Helliker reported that the Water Forum is developing its budget for next fiscal year starting in July which includes two elements – the Habitat Management and the Water Forum Successor Effort. He explained that, for the last three years, the group has been working on updating the Water Forum agreement, which terminates in 2030. The Water Forum staff is estimating that it will take until 2026 to finalize the agreement at a cost of approximately $1.5 million. In addition, the County of Sacramento wants to reduce their commitment, which is about half of the amount that is charged to the whole region.

# AGENDA ITEM III-2

## STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** February 22, 2023  
**Subject:** Treasurer’s Report – Quarter Ending December 31, 2022  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
This report is for information only and will be filed with the meeting minutes.

### BACKGROUND
The purpose of the treasurer’s report is to update the Board and the public on the status of the District’s cash balances and investments, and highlight material changes from one period to another. The scope of this report covers the second quarter of fiscal year 2022-2023, ending December 31, 2022.

The District’s investment objectives are established by the Board approved Investment Policy. The Investment Policy is guided and constrained by the California Government Code. The Board periodically reviews and adjusts the Investment Policy to ensure ongoing compliance with the government code and to maximize investment flexibility as permitted. The current Investment Policy has the following objectives for the portfolio:

1. Safety
2. Liquidity
3. Yield

Attached is the quarterly Treasurer’s Report for the three months ended December 31, 2022.

At September 30, 2022, the end of the previous quarter, the value of the District’s total portfolio was $37.64 million. Since that time, the value of the District’s portfolio increased by $4.6 million for an ending balance of $42.2 million as of December 31, 2022. Cash and short-term investments increased by $5,005,811. Medium term investments decreased by $2.1 million and long-term investments increased by $1.7 million.

The funds are currently held as follows:

- Cash at Banking Institutions: $5,790,226  
- Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF): $26,997,538  
- PFM Managed Investment Portfolio: $9,459,596  
- **Total:** $42,247,360  
<!-- Page 8 -->
![Distribution of Investments](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Distribution+of+Investments)

The overall portfolio is diversified with 22% invested in marketable securities (PFM Portfolio), 64% invested in short-term investments that are considered liquid (LAIF) and 14% on deposit with US Bank. Staff, in conjunction with your financial advisors, periodically review the mix of liquid and long-term investments and adjusts the portfolio according to the market conditions and the District's short term cash needs. Absent the need to keep cash readily available for the Hinkle Reservoir project, staff would be transferring excess funds out to LAIF and/or the managed portfolio.

All securities held are in conformance with those permitted by the District’s Investment Policy. There are sufficient funds to meet the District’s expenditure requirements for the next six months.

The mix and duration of investments are displayed in the following charts:
<!-- Page 9 -->
![Mix of Investments - PFM Portfolio](https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png?text=Mix+of+Investments+-+PFM+Portfolio)

- **U.S. Treasury Bonds/Notes**
- **Federal Agency Bonds/Notes**
- **Corporate Notes**
- **Municipal Bond/Note**
- **Supra-National Agency Bond/Note**
- **Asset-Backed Security/Collateralized Mortgage Obligation**
- **Federal Agency Commercial Mortgage Backed Security**

---

### Duration of PFM Portfolio

- **Cash**: $810,368
- **Short-Term (less than 1 year)**: $2,165,354
- **Medium-Term (1-3 years)**: $4,187,397
- **Long-Term (greater than 3 years)**: $2,296,476
<!-- Page 10 -->
In spite of continued rate hikes, inflation remains an economic challenge. The Fed continued its rate hikes this quarter. In response to those rate hikes, interest rates on investments have continued to increase, creating an opportunity for the District to add higher yielding investments to the portfolio.

The portfolio is still performing well relative to the benchmark (Bank of America Merrill Lynch “BAML” 0-5 Year Treasury Index) on an historical basis.

### Total Returns – period ending December 31, 2022

| Duration (years) | Quarter Ending 12/31/2022 | Past Year | Since Inception |
|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------|------------------|
| San Juan Water District | 2.01 | .93% | -3.59% | 1.11% |
| BAML 0-5 Year Treasury Index | 1.97 | .93% | -3.71% | .84% |

![STAFF REPORT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=STAFF+REPORT)

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** February 22, 2023  
**Subject:** Finance Committee Meeting Dates (W & R)  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff is recommending a revision to the Finance Committee Charter to reflect a change in the monthly meeting date to the Tuesday of the week prior to the Board meeting at 4:00 pm instead of the day before the Board meeting. This item will be reviewed by the Finance Committee on February 21, 2023.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The Finance Committee has been meeting the Tuesday prior to the Board meeting on a monthly basis as reflected in the Finance Committee Charter. The Finance Committee was meeting on this schedule in order to capture all bills and claims for payment at the latest date possible prior to the Board’s approval of those bills and claims. However, on August 23, 2017, the Board amended Ordinance 4000 – Purchasing and Payments, which eliminated the need for Board approval prior to payment of bills, and required the General Manager to provide the Board with a listing of all payments made on a monthly basis.  

**CURRENT STATUS**  
Currently, the Finance Committee meeting minutes are completed by the day of the Board meeting and the online Board Packet is updated and an email is sent out notifying the Board and the Board mailing distribution list that the packet was updated. By moving the committee meeting to the Tuesday the week prior to the Board meeting, the committee minutes can be completed and included in the Board packet which is usually distributed on the Thursday prior to the Board meeting.

**AGENDA ITEM III-4**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Andrew Pierson, P.E.  
**Director of Engineering Services**  
**Date:** February 22, 2023  
**Subject:** Placer Retirement Residence Pipeline Easement Grant to SJWD  

**RECOMMENDATION ACTION**  
Staff recommends a motion to adopt resolution 23-01 and approve and accept a waterline easement in accordance with District Ordinances for a new water distribution pipeline to serve the planned Placer Retirement Residence development project.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The Placer Retirement Residence project is a residential care facility for seniors consisting of a single, three-story building containing 145 residential suites located on a 8.7-acre (gross area) parcel on the north-west corner of Old Auburn Road and Sierra College Blvd (APN: 468-060-052-000). The following figure provides an aerial representation of the project location.  

![Project Location](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Project+Location)  
*Project Location: Placer Retirement Residence*  
*Old Auburn Rd*  
*Sierra College Blvd*  

The Owner of the project has requested water service from the District to supply domestic, landscape, and fire response demands. The fire department required multiple fire hydrants to be installed within the project site, therefore the District determined the Owner would be required to provide two 8-inch waterline connections to supply the fire service, one to the existing 12-inch pipeline located on Sierra College.
<!-- Page 17 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**Blvd.**  
Because all onsite piping within the property boundary will be privately owned, the District's responsibility for operation and maintenance of the new water facilities will terminate at the new meter boxes for both the domestic and landscape services, and at the two new backflow devices that will serve the fire service line per District Ordinances and Standards.

The new domestic and landscape meter boxes, and one backflow device will be installed off the new 8-inch waterline connection on Sierra College Blvd, and the second backflow device will be installed off the new 8-inch waterline connection on Old Auburn Road. The backflow device on Old Auburn Road will be installed within a proposed 12.5-ft multi-purpose easement; however, the domestic and landscape meter boxes and the backflow device on Sierra College Blvd will be installed outside the proposed 12.5-ft multi-purpose easement. Therefore, a dedicated waterline easement encompassing all District owned facilities is required per District Ordinances and Standards. The following figure shows the location of the domestic and landscape meter boxes, the backflow device, the 12.5-ft multi-purpose easement, and the dedicated waterline easement on Sierra College Blvd.

**Proposed dedicated waterline easement**  
**Domestic and landscape meter boxes, and backflow device**  

**STATUS**  
The improvement plans for the Placer Retirement Residence development project have already been approved by both the City of Roseville and the District, and construction of this project has already commenced. As a condition of District approval and acceptance of the Placer Retirement Residence project, the acceptance of the requested water pipeline easement is now needed. The attached Exhibits provide the description of the planned easement to be conveyed to the District.
<!-- Page 18 -->
District staff have reviewed the easement documents and the design plans and have determined that the proposed easement is designed in accordance with the District's development and engineering Standards.

**BUDGET IMPACT**  
Other than a potential for minor costs associated with recordation of the easement documents (typically there is no charge), there is no anticipated budget impact associated with a Board decision to accept this easement.

# AGENDA ITEM IV-1

## STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** February 22, 2023  
**Subject:** Eureka Road Transmission Pipeline Replacement – Installment Sale Agreement  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Approve Resolution 23-02 authorizing the District execute an Installment Sale Agreement with the California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to provide funding for the Eureka Road Transmission Pipeline Replacement Project.

### BACKGROUND
This project includes replacing approximately 850 linear feet of 18 inch and 3,070 linear feet of 16 inch, existing, old and leaking steel water pipeline with new 18-inch ductile iron pipeline on Eureka Road between Barton Road and Providence Lane in Granite Bay. The project also includes the replacement of water services and installation of valves, fittings, hydrants, concrete blocking, and appurtenances along the new water pipeline. The existing pipeline is aged steel pipe that has reached the end of its service life.

While the majority of the District’s capital projects are funded from accumulated reserves (pay-go), the Retail Financial Plan recommended financing this project. The District has been working for the past two years to secure a lower interest rate loan from the State Drinking Water Revolving Fund administered by the State Water Resources Control Board. Utilizing this funding source secures a lower interest rate than can be obtained through the traditional bond market, saving rate payers approximately $2.5 million over the life of the debt.

On May 26, 2021 the Board of Directors approved Resolution 21-03 stating the Districts’ intent and reasonable expectation to be reimbursed for expenditures paid prior to the issuance of funds from the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund or the approval by the State Water Board of the project. This preserved the District’s ability to be reimbursed form these loan proceeds for expenses incurred prior to the execution of the loan agreement. Resolution 21-04, also approved on May 26, 2021 named the Director of Finance as the authorized representative for signing applications, certifications and agreement related to the financing.

![Eureka Road Transmission Pipeline Replacement – Installment Sale Agreement](attachment://Eureka_Road_Transmission_Pipeline_Replacement_Installment_Sale_Agreement.png)

**CURRENT STATUS**  
The final action needed to secure this low interest rate financing is adoption of Resolution 23-02 approving the form of the Installment Sale Agreement (the loan document) and the terms of the financing, which are as follows.

**Term:** 30 years  
**Interest Rate:** 1.1%  
**Maximum Loan Amount:** $3,995,000  
**Restricted Reserve Fund:** equal to one year of debt service, if required  
**Required Debt Coverage Ratio:** net revenues must be equal to the sum of at least 120% of the maximum annual debt service with respect to all outstanding obligations.

**Attachments:**  
- Good Faith Estimate  
- Resolution 23-02 Closing Resolution  
- Draft Form of Installment Sale Agreement

### GOOD FAITH ESTIMATES

The good faith estimates set forth herein are provided with respect to the Installment Sale Agreement with California State Water Resources Control Board in accordance with California Government Code Section 5852.1. Such good faith estimates have been provided to the District by Urban Futures, Inc., as municipal advisor to the District (the “Municipal Advisor”), each with respect to the Installment Sale Agreement.

**Principal Amount.** The Municipal Advisor has informed the District that, based on the District’s Project Cost, its good faith estimate of the principal amount of the Installment Sale Agreement is $3,995,000 (the “Estimated Principal Amount”).

**True Interest Cost of the Installment Sale Agreement.** The Municipal Advisor has informed the District that, based on the interest rate provided by the California State Water Resources Control Board at the time of preparation of such estimate, its good faith estimate of the true interest cost of the Installment Sale Agreement, which means the rate necessary to discount the amounts payable on the respective principal and interest payment dates to the proceeds received from the Installment Sale Agreement, is 1.1%.

**Finance Charge of the Installment Sale Agreement.** The Municipal Advisor has informed the District that its good faith estimate of the finance charge for the Installment Sale Agreement, which means the sum of all fees and charges paid to third parties (or costs associated with the Installment Sale Agreement), is $25,000.

**Amount of Proceeds to be Received.** The Municipal Advisor has informed the District that, assuming the Estimated Principal Amount, its good faith estimate of the amount of proceeds expected to be received by the District is $3,995,000.

**Total Payment Amount.** The Municipal Advisor has informed the District that, assuming the Estimated Principal Amount, and based on the interest rate provided by the California State Water Resources Control Board at the time of preparation of such estimate, its good faith estimate of the total payment amount, which means the sum total of all payments the District will make to pay debt service on the Installment Sale Agreement, plus the finance charge for the Installment Sale Agreement, as described above, not paid with the proceeds of the Installment Sale Agreement, calculated to the final maturity of the Installment Sale Agreement, is $4,749,934.

The foregoing estimates constitute good faith estimates only. The actual principal amount of the Installment Sale Agreement, the true interest cost thereof, the finance charges thereof, the amount of proceeds received therefrom and total payment amount with respect thereto may differ from such good faith estimates due to (a) the actual closing date being different than the date assumed for purposes of such estimates, (b) the actual original principal amount being different from the Estimated Principal Amount, (c) the actual debt service payments on the Installment Sale Agreement being different than the debt service payments assumed for purposes of such estimates, (d) the actual interest rate being different than the interest rate estimated for purposes of such estimates, (e) other market conditions, or a combination of such factors. The actual closing date of the Installment Sale Agreement and the actual principal amount will be determined by the District based on the timing of the need for proceeds and other factors.

**B.1.6 Contingent Disbursement.**

(a) The State Water Board’s disbursement of funds hereunder is contingent on the Recipient’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

(b) The State Water Board's obligation to disburse Project Funds is contingent upon the availability of sufficient funds to permit the disbursements provided for herein. If sufficient funds are not available for any reason, including but not limited to failure of the federal or State government to appropriate funds necessary for disbursement of Project Funds, the State Water Board shall not be obligated to make any disbursements to the Recipient under this Agreement. This provision shall be construed as a condition precedent to the obligation of the State Water Board to make any disbursements under this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to provide the Recipient with a right of priority for disbursement over any other entity. If any disbursements due the Recipient under this Agreement are deferred because sufficient funds are unavailable, it is the intention of the State Water Board that such disbursement will be made to the Recipient when sufficient funds do become available, but this intention is not binding.

(c) Construction costs and disbursements are not available until after the Division has approved the final budget form submitted by the Recipient.

(d) No costs incurred prior to the Eligible Construction Start Date are eligible for reimbursement.

(e) Construction costs incurred prior to the Eligible Construction Start Date are not eligible for reimbursement.

(f) Failure to proceed according to the timelines set forth in this Agreement may require the Recipient to repay to the State Water Board all disbursed Project Funds.

(g) The Recipient agrees to ensure that its final reimbursement request is received by the Division no later than the Final Reimbursement Request Date. If the final reimbursement request is not received timely, the undisbursed balance of this Agreement will be deobligated.

(h) The Recipient is not entitled to interest earned on undisbursed funds.

**B.1.7 Reimbursement Procedure.**

Except as may be otherwise provided in this Agreement, disbursement of Project Funds will be made as follows:

(a) Upon execution and delivery of this Agreement by both parties, the Recipient may request immediate reimbursement of any eligible incurred planning and design allowance costs through submission to the State Water Board of the Reimbursement Request Form 260 and Form 261, or any amendment thereto, duly completed and executed.

(b) The Recipient must submit a reimbursement request for costs incurred prior to the date this Agreement is executed by the State Water Board no later than ninety (90) days after this Agreement is executed by the State Water Board. Late reimbursement requests may not be honored.

**Exhibit B**
<!-- Page 57 -->
![San Juan Water District Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+Agreement)

(c) The Recipient may request reimbursement of eligible construction and equipment costs consistent with budget amounts approved by the Division in the Final Budget Approval.

(d) Additional Project Funds will be promptly disbursed to the Recipient upon receipt of reimbursement request Form 260 and Form 261, or any amendment thereto, duly completed and executed by the Recipient for incurred costs consistent with this Agreement, along with receipt of progress reports due under Exhibit A.

(e) The Recipient must not request reimbursement for any Project Cost until such cost has been incurred and is currently due and payable by the Recipient, although the actual payment of such cost by the Recipient is not required as a condition of reimbursement request. Supporting documentation (e.g., receipts) must be submitted with each reimbursement request. The amount requested for administration costs must include a calculation formula (i.e., hours or days worked times the hourly or daily rate = total amount claimed). Disbursement of Project Funds will be made only after receipt of a complete, adequately supported, properly documented, and accurately addressed reimbursement request. Reimbursement requests submitted without supporting documents may be wholly or partially withheld at the discretion of the Division.

(f) The Recipient must spend Project Funds within 30 days of receipt. If the Recipient earns interest earned on Project Funds, it must report that interest immediately to the State Water Board. The State Water Board may deduct earned interest from future disbursements.

(g) The Recipient shall not request a reimbursement unless that Project Cost is allowable, reasonable, and allocable.

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no disbursement shall be required at any time or in any manner which is in violation of or in conflict with federal or state laws, policies, or regulations.

(i) No work or travel outside the State of California is permitted under this Agreement unless the Division provides prior written authorization. Failure to comply with this restriction may result in termination this Agreement, pursuant to Exhibit C. Any reimbursement for necessary travel and per diem shall be at rates not to exceed those set by the California Department of Human Resources at http://www.calhr.ca.gov/employees/Pages/travel-reimbursements.aspx, as of the date costs are incurred by the Recipient.

B.1.8 Withholding of Disbursements.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the State Water Board may withhold all or any portion of the Project Funds upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

(a) The Recipient’s failure to maintain reasonable progress on the Project as determined by the Division;

(b) Placement on the ballot or passage of an initiative or referendum to repeal or reduce the Recipient’s taxes, assessments, fees, or charges levied for operation of the System or payment of debt service on System Obligations;

(c) Commencement of litigation or a judicial or administrative proceeding related to the Project, System, or Revenues that the State Water Board determines may impair the timely satisfaction of Recipient’s obligations under this Agreement;

(d) Any investigation by the State Water Board, District Attorney, California State Auditor, Bureau of State Audits, United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, Securities and Exchange Commission, a grand jury, or any other state or federal agency, relating to the Recipient’s financial management, accounting procedures, or internal fiscal controls;

Project No.: 34-10021-004C  
Page 17 of 49  

(e) A material adverse change in the condition of the Recipient, the Revenues, or the System, that the Division reasonably determines would materially impair the Recipient’s ability to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement, or any other event that the Division reasonably determines would materially impair the Recipient’s ability to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement;  
(f) The Recipient’s material violation of, or threat to materially violate, any term of this Agreement;

B.1.9 Fraud and Misuse of Public Funds; Enforcement.  

All requests for reimbursement submitted must be accurate and signed by the Recipient’s Authorized Representative under penalty of perjury. All costs submitted pursuant to this Agreement must only be for the work or tasks set forth in this Agreement. The Recipient must not submit any invoice containing costs that are ineligible or have been reimbursed from other funding sources unless required and specifically noted as such (i.e., match costs). Any eligible costs for which the Recipient is seeking reimbursement shall not be reimbursed from any other source. Double or multiple billing for time, services, or any other eligible cost is improper and will not be compensated. Any suspected occurrences of fraud, forgery, embezzlement, theft, or any other misuse of public funds may result in suspension of disbursements and, notwithstanding any other section in this Agreement, the termination of this Agreement requiring the repayment of all Project Funds disbursed hereunder. Additionally, the Deputy Director of the Division may request an audit; refer the matter for appropriate administrative action, including but not limited to the recovery of financial assistance provided and the imposition of civil penalties; and/or refer the matter to the Attorney General’s Office or the appropriate district attorney’s office for criminal prosecution or the imposition of civil liability. A person who knowingly makes or causes to be made any false statement, material misrepresentation, or false certification in any submittal may be subject to a civil penalty, criminal fine, or imprisonment.

B.2.4 [Reserved]

B.2.5 Obligation Absolute.

The obligation of the Recipient to make the Payments and other payments required to be made by it under this Agreement, from the Net Revenues and/or other amounts legally available to the Recipient therefor, is absolute and unconditional, and until such time as the Payments and Additional Payments have been paid in full, the Recipient must not discontinue or suspend any Payments or other payments required to be made by it hereunder when due, whether or not the Project, or any related part thereof is operating or operable or has been completed, or its use is suspended, interfered with, reduced or curtailed or terminated in whole or in part, and such Payments and other payments shall not be subject to reduction whether by offset or otherwise and shall not be conditional upon the performance or nonperformance by any party of any agreement for any cause whatsoever.

B.2.6 Payment Timing.

(a) The Recipient must pay interest annually, by December 31 of each year, until one year after Completion of Construction. Beginning no later than one year after Completion of Construction, the Recipient must make annual Payment of the principal of the Project Funds, together with all interest accruing thereon by December 31. The Recipient must make Payments fully amortizing the total principal of the Project by the Final Payment Date. Payments are based on a standard fully amortized assistance amount with equal annual payments.

(b) The remaining balance is the previous balance, plus the disbursements, plus the accrued interest on both, plus any Charge In Lieu of Interest, less the Payment. Payment calculations will be made beginning one (1) year after Completion of Construction. Exhibit E is a payment schedule based on the provisions of this Exhibit and an estimated disbursement schedule. Actual payments will be based on actual disbursements.

(c) Upon Completion of Construction and submission of necessary reports by the Recipient, the Division will prepare an appropriate payment schedule and supply the same to the Recipient. The Division may amend this schedule as necessary to accurately reflect amounts due under this Agreement. The Division will prepare any necessary amendments to the payment schedule and send them to the Recipient. The Recipient must make each Payment on or before the due date therefor. A ten (10) day grace period will be allowed, after which a penalty in the amount of costs incurred by the State Water Board will be assessed for late payment. These costs may include, but are not limited to, lost interest earnings, staff time, bond debt service default penalties, if any, and other related costs. For purposes of penalty assessment, payment will be deemed to have been made if payment is deposited in the U.S. Mail within the grace period with postage prepaid and properly addressed. Any penalties assessed will not be added to the assistance amount balance, but will be treated as a separate account and obligation of the Recipient. The interest penalty will be assessed from the payment due date.

(d) The Recipient is obligated to make all payments required by this Agreement to the State Water Board, notwithstanding any individual default by its constituents or others in the payment to the Recipient of fees, charges, taxes, assessments, tolls or other charges ("Charges") levied or imposed by the Recipient. The Recipient must provide for the punctual payment to the State Water Board of all amounts which become due.

C.4.3  Federal Requirements and Cross-Cutters for SRF Funding.

The Recipient acknowledges, warrants compliance with, and covenants to continuing compliance with the following federal terms and conditions for the Useful Life of the Project:

i. Unless the Recipient has obtained a waiver from USEPA on file with the State Water Board or unless this Project is not a project for the construction, alteration, maintenance or repair of a public water system or treatment work, the Recipient shall not purchase “iron and steel products” produced outside of the United States on this Project. Unless the Recipient has obtained a waiver from USEPA on file with the State Water Board pertaining to the construction, alteration, maintenance or repair of a public water system or treatment work, the Recipient hereby certifies that all “iron and steel products” used in the Project were or will be produced in the United States. For purposes of this section, the term “iron and steel products” means the following products made primarily of iron or steel: lined or unlined pipes and fittings, manhole covers and other municipal castings, hydrants, tanks, flanges, pipe clamps and restraints, valves, structural steel, reinforced precast concrete, and construction materials. “Steel” means an alloy that includes at least 50 percent iron, between .02 and 2 percent carbon, and may include other elements.

ii. The Recipient acknowledges that funds received under this Agreement are subject to the Build America Buy America (BABA) requirements of Public Law 117-58 (the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), signed into law on November 15, 2021), which are in addition to “iron and steel products” requirements described in section C.4.3 (i) above. Specifically, unless (1) the Recipient has requested and obtained a waiver from USEPA on file with the State Water Board pertaining to the Project or the Project is otherwise covered by a general applicability waiver, as confirmed in writing by the State Water Board; or (2) the State Water Board, and to the extent the Project is co-funded by any other agency using federal funds subject to BABA requirements, each such agency, has advised the Recipient in writing that the BABA requirements are not applicable to the Project, the Recipient shall ensure and certifies that, as the terms are defined within and made applicable by Public Law 117-58:
   a. all iron and steel used in the Project are produced in the United States;
   b. the manufactured products used in the Project are produced in the United States; and
   c. the construction materials used in the Project are produced in the United States.

The Recipient must comply and require its contractors and subcontractors to comply with all applicable BABA requirements and reporting and must inform the State Water Board immediately of any information regarding a violation of the foregoing.

Based on representations made by the Recipient and corresponding evidence on file with the State Water Board, the Project qualifies for the “Adjustment Period Waiver of Section 70914(a) of P.L. 117-58, Build America, Buy America Act, 2021 for SRF Projects that have Initiated Design Planning”, found at EPA - SRF - Final Waiver - Adjustment Period September 2022 - Signed.pdf. This waiver applies to projects that have initiated project design planning prior to May 14, 2022, the statutory effective date of the BABA requirements, and permits the use of non-domestic manufactured products and construction materials that would otherwise be prohibited under the BABA requirements. This program waiver does not waive the iron and steel requirements under BABA. Sections 70917(a) and (b) of BIL provide a savings provision for existing statutory requirements that meet or exceed BABA requirements, such as the “iron and steel products” requirements applicable to SRF funded projects referenced in section C.4.3 (i) above, which will continue to apply as part of BABA requirements.

On March 4, 2022, Governor Gavin Newsom issued Executive Order N-6-22 (the EO) regarding Economic Sanctions against Russia and Russian entities and individuals. “Economic Sanctions” refers to sanctions imposed by the U.S. government in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine, as well as any sanctions imposed under state law. The EO directs state agencies to terminate contracts with, and to refrain from entering any new contracts with, individuals or entities that are determined to be a target of Economic Sanctions. Accordingly, should the State Water Board determine Recipient is a target of Economic Sanctions or is conducting prohibited transactions with sanctioned individuals or entities, that shall be grounds for termination of this Agreement. The State Water Board shall provide Recipient advance written notice of such termination, allowing Recipient at least 30 calendar days to provide a written response.

**EXHIBIT E – PAYMENT SCHEDULE**  

See the attached preliminary Payment Schedule. The final Payment Schedule will be forwarded to the Recipient after all disbursements have been paid and construction of the Project has been completed.  

Exhibit E
<!-- Page 86 -->
# EXHIBIT F – TAX CERTIFICATE

## F.1 Purpose.

The purpose of this Exhibit F is to establish the reasonable expectations of the Recipient regarding the Project and the Project Funds, and is intended to be and may be relied upon for purposes of Sections 103, 141 and 148 of the Code and as a certification described in Section 1.148-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations. This Exhibit F sets forth certain facts, estimates and circumstances which form the basis for the Recipient’s expectation that neither the Project nor the Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds is to be used in a manner that would cause the Obligation to be classified as “arbitrage bonds” under Section 148 of the Code or “private activity bonds” under Section 141 of the Code.

## F.2 Tax Covenant.

The Recipient agrees that it will not take or authorize any action or permit any action within its reasonable control to be taken, or fail to take any action within its reasonable control, with respect to the Project which would result in the loss of the exclusion of interest on the Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Code.

## F.3 Governmental Unit.

The Recipient is a state or local governmental unit as defined in Section 1.103-1 of the Treasury Regulations or an instrumentality thereof (a "Governmental Unit") and is not the federal government or any agency or instrumentality thereof.

## F.4 Financing of a Capital Project.

The Recipient will use the Project Funds to finance capital expenditures it has incurred or will incur for the construction, reconstruction, installation or acquisition of the Project in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Such expenditures shall not have previously been financed with the proceeds of any other issue of indebtedness except for interim financing by the Recipient, the date of maturity, prepayment or redemption of which is within thirty (30) days of the date of disbursement of Project Funds under this Agreement. All Project Funds shall be allocated to expenditures by the Recipient within thirty (30) days of the date of disbursement, including all (if any) Project Funds allocated to repay interim financing of the Recipient. For purposes of this Section F.4, “interim financing” means notes, commercial paper, loans, lines of credit and other forms of short-term borrowing.

## F.5 Ownership and Operation of Project.

The Recipient exclusively owns and, except as provided in Section F.12 hereof, operates the Project.

## F.6 Temporary Period.

The Recipient reasonably expects that at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds will be allocated to expenditures for the Project within three (3) years of the earlier of the effective date of this Agreement or the date the Bonds are issued (“Applicable Date”). The Recipient has incurred, or reasonably expects that it will incur within six (6) months of the Applicable Date, a substantial binding obligation (i.e., not subject to contingencies within the control of the Recipient or a related party) to a third party to expend at least five percent (5%) of the Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds on Project Costs. The completion of acquisition, construction, improvement and equipping of the Project and the allocation of the Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds to Project Costs will proceed with due diligence.

## F.7 Working Capital.

No operational expenditures of the Recipient or any related entity are being, have been or will be financed or refinanced with Project Funds.
<!-- Page 87 -->
![San Juan Water District Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+Agreement)

F.8 Expenditure of Proceeds.

The Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds shall be used exclusively for the following purposes: (i) Reimbursement Expenditures (as defined in Section F.20 below), (ii) Preliminary Expenditures (as defined in Section F.20 below) in an aggregate amount not exceeding twenty percent (20%) of the Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds, (iii) capital expenditures relating to the Project originally paid by the Recipient on or after the date hereof, (iv) interest on the Obligation through the later of three (3) years after the Applicable Date or one (1) year after the Project is placed in service, and (v) initial operating expenses directly associated with the Project in the aggregate amount not more than five percent (5%) of the Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds.

F.9 Private Use and Private Payments.

No portion of the Project Funds or the Project is being, has been or will be used in the aggregate for any activities that constitute a Private Use (as defined below). No portion of the principal of or interest with respect to the Payments will be secured by any interest in property (whether or not the Project) used for a Private Use or in payments in respect of property used for a Private Use, or will be derived from payments in respect of property used for a Private Use. "Private Use" means any activity that constitutes a trade or business that is carried on by persons or entities, other than a Governmental Unit. The leasing of the Project or the access by or the use of the Project by a person or entity other than a Governmental Unit on a basis other than as a member of the general public shall constitute a Private Use. Use by or on behalf of the State of California or any of its agencies, instrumentalities or subdivisions or by any local Governmental Unit and use as a member of the general public will be disregarded in determining whether a Private Use exists. Use under an arrangement that conveys priority rights or other preferential benefits is generally not use on the same basis as the general public. Arrangements providing for use that is available to the general public at no charge or on the basis of rates that are generally applicable and uniformly applied do not convey priority rights or other preferential benefits. For this purpose, rates may be regarded as generally applicable and uniformly applied if (i) different parties pay different classes of users, such as volume purchasers, if the differences in rates are customary and reasonable; or (ii) a specially negotiated rate arrangement is entered into, but only if the user is prohibited by federal law from paying the generally applicable rates, and the rates established are as comparable as reasonably possible to the generally applicable rates. An arrangement that does not otherwise convey priority rights or other preferential benefits is not treated, nevertheless, as general public use if the term of the use under the arrangement, including all renewal options, is greater than 200 days. For this purpose, a right of first refusal to renew use under the arrangement is not treated as a renewal option if (i) the compensation for the use under the arrangement is redetermined at generally applicable, fair market value rates that are in effect at the time of renewal; and (ii) the use of the financed property under the same or similar arrangements is predominantly by natural persons who are not engaged in a trade or business.

F.10 No Sale, Lease or Private Operation of the Project.

The Project (or any portion thereof) will not be sold or otherwise disposed of, in whole or in part, to any person who is not a Governmental Unit prior to the final maturity date of the Obligation. The Project will not be leased to any person or entity that is not a Governmental Unit prior to the final maturity date of the Obligation. Except as permitted under Section F.12 hereof, the Recipient will not enter any contract or arrangement or cause or permit any contract or arrangement to be entered with persons or entities that are not Governmental Units if that contract or arrangement would confer on such persons or entities any right to use the Project on a basis different from the right of members of the general public. The contracts or arrangements contemplated by the preceding sentence include but are not limited to management contracts, take or pay contracts or put or pay contracts, and capacity guarantee contracts.

F.11 No Disproportionate or Unrelated Use.

No portion of the Project Funds or the Project is being, has been, or will be used for a Private Use that is unrelated or disproportionate to the governmental use of the Project Funds.

Exhibit F
<!-- Page 88 -->
![San Juan Water District Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=San+Juan+Water+District+Agreement)

F.12 Management and Service Contracts.

The Recipient represents that, as of the date hereof, it is not a party to any contract, agreement or other arrangement with any persons or entities engaged in a trade or business (other than Government Units) that involve the management or operation of property or the provision of services at or with respect to the Project that does not comply with the standards of the Treasury Regulations, or Revenue Procedure 2017-13, as applicable. The Recipient represents that it will not be party to any such contract, agreement or arrangement with any person or entity that is not a Governmental Unit for the management of property or the provision of services at or with respect to the Project, while the Obligation (including any obligation or series thereof issued to refund the Obligation, as the case may be) is outstanding, except: (a) with respect to any contract, agreement or arrangement that does not constitute “private business use” of the Project under Code §141(b), or (b) with respect to any contract, agreement or arrangement that complies with (i) Revenue Procedure 97-13, 1997-1 C.B. 632, as amended by Revenue Procedure 2001-39, 2001-2 C.B. 38, and as amplified by Notice 2014-67, or (ii) Revenue Procedure 2017-13, with respect to contracts entered into or materially modified or extended after August 18, 2017, or (c) with respect to any contract, agreement or arrangement that does not give rise to use of the Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds or the Project by a non-Governmental Unit of more than the amount of such non-qualified use permitted by the Code, or (d) in the event that the Recipient receives an opinion of counsel, satisfactory to the State Water Board and the Bank and expert in the issuance of state and local government bonds the interest on which is excluded from gross income under Section 103 of the Code (“Nationally-Recognized Bond Counsel”), that such contract, agreement or arrangement will not adversely affect the exclusion of the interest on the Obligation from gross income for federal income taxation purposes.

F.13 No Disposition of Financed Property.

As of the date hereof, the Recipient does not expect to sell or otherwise dispose of any portion of the Project, in whole or in part, prior to the maturity date of the Obligation.

F.14 Useful Life of Project.

As of the date hereof, the Recipient reasonably expects that the economic useful life of the Project, commencing at Project Completion, will be at least equal to the term of this Agreement, as set forth in Exhibit A hereto.

F.15 Payments.

Payments generally are expected to be derived from assessments, taxes, fees, charges or other current Revenues of the Recipient in each year, and such current Revenues are expected to equal or exceed the Payments during each payment period. Any amounts accumulated in a sinking fund or bona fide debt service fund to pay Payments (whether or not deposited to a fund or account established by the Recipient) will be disbursed to pay Payments within thirteen months of the initial date of accumulation or deposit. Any such fund used for the payment of Payments will be depleted once a year except for a reasonable carryover amount not exceeding the greater of earnings on such fund or one-twelfth of the Payments in either case for the immediately preceding year.

F.16 No Other Replacement Proceeds.

The Recipient will not use any of the Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds to replace or substitute other funds of the Recipient that were otherwise to be used to finance the Project or which are or will be used to acquire securities, obligations or other investment property reasonably expected to produce a yield that is materially higher than the yield on the Bonds.

F.17 No Sinking or Pledged Fund.

Except as set forth in Section F.18 below, the Recipient will not create or establish any sinking fund or pledged fund which will be used to pay Payments on the Obligation within the meaning of Section 1.148-1(c) of the Treasury Regulations. If any sinking fund or pledged fund comes into being with respect to the Obligation before

Agreement No.: D2202010  
Project No.: 3401021-004C  
Page 48 of 49  

F.18 Reserve Amount.  
The State Water Board requires that the Recipient maintain and fund a separate account in an amount equal to one (1) year of debt service with respect to the Obligation (the “Reserve Amount”) as set forth in Exhibit B. The Recipient represents that the Reserve Amount is and will be available to pay debt service with respect to the Obligation, if and when needed. The Reserve Amount consists solely of revenues of the Recipient and does not include any proceeds of any obligations the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes or investment earnings thereon. The aggregate of the Reserve Amount, up to an amount not exceeding the lesser of (i) ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of the Obligation, (ii) the maximum annual debt service with respect to the Obligation, or (iii) 125 percent of the average annual debt service with respect to the Obligation, will be treated as a reasonably required reserve fund.

F.19 Reimbursement Resolution.  
The “reimbursement resolution” adopted by the Recipient is incorporated herein by reference.

F.20 Reimbursement Expenditures.  
Reimbursements are disallowed, except as specifically authorized in Exhibit B or Exhibit D of this Agreement. To the extent so authorized, a portion of the Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds may be applied to reimburse the Recipient for Project Costs paid before the date hereof, so long as the Project Cost was (i) not paid prior to sixty (60) days before the Recipient’s adoption of a declaration of official intent to finance the Project, (ii) not paid more than eighteen (18) months prior to the date hereof or the date the Project was placed-in-service, whichever is later, and (iii) not paid for the three (3) years prior to the date hereof (collectively, “Reimbursement Expenditures”), unless such cost is attributable to a “preliminary expenditure.” Preliminary expenditure for this purpose means architectural, engineering, surveying, soil testing and similar costs incurred prior to the commencement of construction or rehabilitation of the Project, but does not include land acquisition, site preparation and similar costs incident to the commencement of acquisition, construction or rehabilitation of the Project. Preliminary expenditures may not exceed 20% of the Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds.

F.21 Change in Use of the Project.  
The Recipient reasonably expects to use all of the Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds and the Project for the entire stated term to maturity of the Obligation. Absent an opinion of Nationally-Recognized Bond Counsel to the effect that such use of the Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds will not adversely affect the exclusion from federal gross income of interest on the Bonds pursuant to Section 103 of the Code, the Recipient will use the Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds and the Project solely as set forth in this Agreement.

F.22 Rebate Obligations.  
If the Recipient satisfies the requirements of one of the spending exceptions to rebate specified in Section 1.148-7 of the Treasury Regulations, amounts earned from investments, if any, acquired with the Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds will not be subject to the rebate requirements imposed under Section 148(f) of the Code. If the Recipient fails to satisfy such requirements for any period, it will notify the State Water Board and the Bank immediately and will comply with the provisions of the Code and the Treasury Regulations at such time, including the payment of any rebate amount calculated by the State Water Board or the Bank.

F.23 No Federal Guarantee.  
The Recipient will not directly or indirectly use any of the Bond Funded Portion of the Project Funds in any manner that would cause the Bonds to be "federally guaranteed" within the meaning of Section 149(b) of the Code, taking into account various exceptions including any guarantee related to investments during an initial temporary period until needed for the governmental purpose of the Bonds, investments as part of a bona fide debt.

**Exhibit F**

F.24 Amendments.  
The provisions in this Exhibit may be amended, modified or supplemented at any time to reflect changes in the Code upon obtaining written approval of the State Water Board and the Bank and an opinion of Nationally-Recognized Bond Counsel to the effect that such amendment, modification or supplement will not adversely affect the exclusion from federal gross income of interest on the Bonds pursuant to Section 103 of the Code.

F.25 Reasonable Expectations.  
The Recipient warrants that, to the best of its knowledge, information and belief, and based on the facts and estimates as set forth in the tax covenants in this Exhibit, the expectations of the Recipient as set forth in this Exhibit are reasonable. The Recipient is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause it to question the accuracy or reasonableness of any representation made in the provisions in this Exhibit.

F.26 Assignment.  
The Recipient consents to any pledge, sale, or assignment to the Bank or a trustee for the benefit of the owners of the Bonds, if any, at any time of any portion of the State Water Board's estate, right, title, and interest and claim in, to and under this Agreement and the right to make all related waivers and agreements in the name and on behalf of the State Water Board, as agent and attorney-in-fact, and to perform all other acts which are necessary and appropriate under this Agreement, if any, and the State Water Board's estate, right, title, and interest and claim in, to and under this Agreement, to Payments (but excluding the State Water Board's rights to Additional Payments and to notices, opinions and indemnification under each Obligation).

Re: [Insert Name of Applicant ](“City/County/District”) – [Name of Project] – Project No.[xxxxxxxxxxxx] (“Project”) – Agreement No. [XXXXXXXXXXXXXX] (“Agreement”)

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This firm serves as General Counsel to the [City/County/District] in connection with the Project. This opinion is delivered to the State Water Resources Control Board (“State Water Board”) at the request of the [City/County/District]. In connection therewith, I have examined the laws pertaining to the [City/County/District], originals of the Agreement, between the [City/County/District] and the State Water Board (“Agreement”), the [City/County/District]’s authorized representative resolution [number] adopted on [DATE], the [City/County/District]’s authorizing resolution [xxx] adopted on [DATE], the [City/County/District]’s reimbursement resolution [number] adopted on [DATE], the [City/County/District]’s rate-setting resolution [number] adopted on [DATE], (collectively, “the Resolutions”), the [City/County/District]’s debt management policy, documents related to each of the Material Obligations as set forth in the Agreement, and such other documents, legal opinions, instruments and records, and have made such investigation of law, as I have considered necessary or appropriate for the purpose of this opinion.

Based on the foregoing, it is my opinion that:

a. The [City/County/District], a [general law city/charter city/county/special district/joint powers authority] of the State of California duly organized, validly existing under the laws of the State of California pursuant to [INSERT SPECIFIC LEGAL AUTHORITY], has the requisite legal right, power, and authority to execute and deliver the Agreement and carry out and consummate all transactions contemplated therein.

[and if charter city] The [City/County/District] is a charter city, the governing board of which is not prohibited, limited or constrained in any way from adopting, requiring, or utilizing a project labor agreement that includes all taxpayer protection provisions of Public Contract Code section 2500.]

[AND IF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY] None of the [City/County/District]’s member charter cities is prohibited, limited or
<!-- Page 93 -->
![DWRSF Appendix Q](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=DWRSF+Appendix+Q)

**DWRSF Appendix Q**

a. [The City/County/District] is not constrained in any way from adopting, requiring, or utilizing a project labor agreement that includes all taxpayer protection provisions of Public Contract Code section 2500.

b. The Resolutions have been duly adopted at meetings of the [City/County/District] which were called and held pursuant to law with all public notice required by law and at which a quorum was present and acting when the Resolutions were adopted. The Resolutions are in full force and effect and have not been amended, modified, supplemented, or rescinded, nor has the rate-setting resolution been challenged or threatens to become subject of a referendum or initiative or other similar process.

c. To the best of my knowledge and based upon a reasonable investigation, all proceedings required by law or under the ordinances or bylaws of the [City/County/District] in connection with the authorization of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated by and related thereto, and all such approvals, authorizations, consents or other orders of or filings or registrations with such public boards or bodies, if any, as may be legally required to be obtained by the [City/County/District] prior to the date hereof with respect to all or any of such matters have been taken or obtained and are in full force and effect, except that no opinion is expressed as to any approvals, obligations or proceedings which may be required under any federal securities laws or state blue sky or securities laws.

d. To the best of my knowledge and based upon a reasonable investigation, the execution and delivery of the Agreement and the consummation of the transactions therein will not conflict with or constitute a breach of default (with due notice or the passage of time or both) under (i) the statutes creating the [City/County/District] or any amendments thereto, (ii) the ordinances or by laws of the [City/County/District], (iii) any bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness, or any material contract, agreement or lease to which the [City/County/District] is a party or by which it or its properties are otherwise subject or bound or (iv) any applicable law or administrative regulation or any applicable court or administrative decree or order.

e. To the best of my knowledge and based upon a reasonable investigation, the [City/County/District] has sufficient property rights in the Project property for the purposes contemplated in the Agreement and has complied with the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4601) with respect to any property acquired for the purposes of the Project. Project property rights extend/s in perpetuity until [date].

f. To the best of my knowledge and based upon a reasonable investigation, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court of federal, state, municipal or
<!-- Page 94 -->
![DWSRF Appendix Q](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=DWSRF+Appendix+Q)

other governmental authority pending or threatened against or affecting the [City/County/District]’s System, as defined in the Agreement, or the assets, properties or operations of the [City/County/District] relating to its System which, if determined adversely to the [City/County/District] or its interests would result in any material change in the assets or financial condition of the [City/County/District], the [City/County/District]’s System or the financial condition thereof, and the [City/County/District] is not in default with respect to any order or decree of any court or any order, regulation, or demand of any federal, state, municipal, or other governmental agency which default might have consequences that would materially and adversely affect the financial condition of the [City/County/District] or its System.

g. No facts have come to my attention which lead me to believe that the [City/County/District]’s authorized representative has made any untrue statement of material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact or has made misleading statements in the Agreement.

h. The Agreement has been duly authorized, executed, and delivered, and assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of the Agreement by the State Water Board, constitutes legal, valid, and binding obligation of the [City/County/District] enforceable against the [City/County/District] in accordance with its terms, subject to the laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or creditors’ rights generally and to the application of equitable principles, if equitable remedies are sought.

Sincerely,

General Counsel  
[City/County/District]

**AGENDA ITEM V-2**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** February 22, 2023  
**Subject:** Legislation  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Consider a motion to adopt oppose position on Initiative 21-0042A1 and a support position for SB 366 (Water for All legislation)  

**BACKGROUND**  

**Initiative 21-0042A1**  
Initiative 21-0042A1, officially titled, “Limits the Ability of Voters and State and Local Governments to Raise Revenues for Government Services,” is sponsored by the California Business Roundtable, which is a consortium of major employers in California. It would raise the requirement for passage of local bond measures from a majority vote to a 2/3 approval threshold. It would also change the criterion for water rates and fees from being reasonably related to the cost of service to a scheme that restricts such fees to the “minimum amount necessary.” This term is undefined, but poses significant risk for water agencies and their ratemaking process, under which rates can be rejected by voters via the Proposition 218 protect process. Finally, the initiative would make it much more difficult to defend bond measures or rate increases in court, due to a more stringent burden of proof standard. For all of these reasons, the California Special Districts Association has already undertaken a campaign to oppose this initiative, and ACWA and the California Municipal Utilities Association are in the process of adopting positions, as well. CSDA’s blog post about this initiative is attached.

**SB 366**  
SB 366 is the vehicle that water agencies involved in Solve the Water Crisis have developed, in conjunction with Senator Caballero (the author), to establish a statewide goal for water supply and storage improvements, to address the impacts of climate change. The bill (see attachment) is currently a spot bill, but the concept will be to make the California Water Plan an actionable strategic plan, with the State Administration being required to report regularly to the Legislature on the status of achievement of the goal. It will also include a financial plan element, to ensure that the funding that is necessary to meet the goal is identified and secured (including federal and state funds to augment the investments that continue to be made by water agencies).

# Initiative Will Qualify to Limit Voters’ Local Control and Could Wipeout Funding for Flood, Drought, Wildfire, and other Essential Services

By Vanessa Gonzales posted 23 days ago

By February 1, an initiative sponsored by some of the world’s biggest corporations is expected to qualify for the November 2024 statewide ballot and levy the greatest threat to local control in our generation. Initiative 21-0042A1, officially titled, “Limits the Ability of Voters and State and Local Governments to Raise Revenues for Government Services,” would impose a debilitating race-to-the-bottom for communities seeking solutions to California’s flood, drought, wildfire, and other challenges.

The initiative is bankrolled by the California Business Roundtable, a collection of major corporations such as Aera Energy, Kilroy Realty, Pacific Ethanol, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, Sempra Energy, State Farm Insurance, and 7-Eleven. They dub their initiative the “Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act.” However, a more accurate label would be the “Sue Taxpayers, Give Corporations a Pass, and Lawyers Employment Act.” This flawed proposal is a veritable kitchen sink of amendments to the California Constitution that benefit the corporations but hurt our communities. It seeks to make it harder for voters and those they elect to invest in flood protection, drought solutions, wildfire mitigation, roads, parks, schools, and other essential services for our communities. For example, under current law, voters in a community could place a local initiative on their ballot to fund a new park in their neighborhood, and it could pass with a simple majority vote. The corporations’ voter limitation initiative would increase that threshold to a two-thirds majority, a notoriously difficult hurdle for even the most worthy of ideas. That is ironic since the corporations’ initiative itself only requires a simple majority to pass.
<!-- Page 104 -->

That isn’t even the worst of it, however. Under current law, water rates and other fees must be reasonably related to the cost of service. This is fair and appropriate. This corporate initiative would change this balanced approach to a scheme that restricts such fees to the “minimum amount necessary.” It is fair to ask what’s so bad about changing fees from “reasonable” to the “minimum amount necessary?” The simple answer is that tackling the existential challenges facing our state and our communities requires innovation and long-term investments like water recycling and storage, renewable energy, flood protection, and forest management. At this critical time in California’s history, our communities cannot afford to do even less than the status quo. When we think of the kind of communities we want to leave our children and grandchildren, are we content to settle for the “minimum amount necessary?”

As a final blow, the initiative also tips the scales for lawsuits against service providers by imposing the highest burden possible in civil court on the public agencies our communities own and govern. In short, the initiative invites those looking for a windfall to sue public agencies up and down the state, with the taxpayers holding the bag for all of the lawyers’ fees and payouts. Worse, the initiative is retroactive to January 1, 2022.

Effectively, Initiative 21-00421 would empower corporate lawyers to invalidate the prior actions of local voters throughout California, undermining local control and voter-approved decisions about investments needed in their communities. This could put billions of dollars currently dedicated to state and local services at risk, and force cuts to public schools, fire and emergency response, law enforcement, public health, parks, libraries, affordable housing, services to support homeless residents, mental healthcare, and more, all to create constitutional loopholes that allow corporations to pay less than their fair share.

Join CSDA, Cal Cities, California State Association of Counties, California Jobs Alliance, California Professional Firefighters, and more than 150 local agencies in taking an “oppose” position on the voter limitation initiative.

# SENATE BILL No. 366

**Introduced by Senator Caballero**

February 8, 2023

An act relating to water.

## LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL’S DIGEST

SB 366, as introduced, Caballero. The California Water Plan: long-term supply targets.

Existing law requires the Department of Water Resources to update every 5 years the plan for the orderly and coordinated control, protection, conservation, development, and use of the water resources of the state, which is known as the California Water Plan. Existing law requires the department to include a discussion of various strategies in the plan including, but not limited to, strategies relating to the development of new water storage facilities, water conservation, water recycling, desalination, conjunctive use, water transfers, and alternative pricing policies that may be pursued in order to meet the future needs of the state.

This bill would make legislative findings and declarations and state the intent of the Legislature to enact future legislation that modernizes the California Water Plan, including the establishment of long-term water supply targets.

Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: no. State-mandated local program: no.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:

1 SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
<!-- Page 106 -->
SB 366

1. (a) To thrive as a state, California needs a reliable supply of water for urban, agricultural, and environmental uses that is completely resilient to climate change.
2. (b) California's existing water level is highly reliant on capturing the snow melt on an annual basis. That captured water is stored in lakes, reservoirs, and groundwater basins, and is then transported around the state for environmental, residential, business, and agricultural use when needed.
3. (c) California has the most intricate and elaborate system of water conveyance in the world.
4. (d) The volume of water used by people in California for agriculture, urban, and environmental purposes ranges from 60,000,000 to 90,000,000 acre-feet per year.
5. (e) Per-capita water use has declined over time, thanks to water-saving indoor plumbing fixtures and appliances, better leak detection, development of potable and nonpotable water reuse projects, and efforts to reduce outdoor water use.
6. (f) Over the last two years, scientists and water managers have been alarmed by the accelerating impacts of the warming climate on our water supply.
7. (g) Hotter and drier weather is estimated to diminish our existing water supply by 10 percent to 20 percent.
8. (h) A loss of 10 percent of our existing water supply due to hotter and drier conditions could mean the disappearance of about 6,000,000 to 9,000,000 acre-feet of water.
9. (i) For comparison's sake, California's largest reservoir, the Shasta Reservoir, holds 4,500,000 acre-feet of water.
10. (j) Many rivers, lakes, and estuaries are being impacted by declining water quality, including increases in harmful algae blooms.
11. (k) The California central valley has a groundwater overdraft of 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 acre-feet of water.
12. (l) Following more than two decades of a "megadrought" in the Colorado River Basin, reservoir levels are so low that near-term supply cuts are likely.
13. (m) California's precipitation is changing from seasonal snow in the Sierra Nevada Mountains to periods of substantial rainfall, including atmospheric rivers.
14. (n) The shift to drier dry years and wetter wet years makes it imperative that the State of California develop comprehensive. 

99
<!-- Page 107 -->
1 wet-year strategies that take full advantage of times of abundance,  
2 while also ensuring public safety from floods.  
3 (o) It is imperative that California capture more water from  
4 atmospheric rivers and other storms that occur during dry years to  
5 help fill groundwater basins and surface storage.  
6 (p) California is the nation's agricultural powerhouse, accounting  
7 for 12 percent of the nation's agricultural production in 2021,  
8 including more than 70 percent of the nation's fruits and nuts.  
9 (q) The agriculture sector produces annual revenues of more  
10 than $50 billion, employs more than 420,000 people, and supports  
11 large food and beverage processing industries.  
12 (r) According to the Department of Water Resources, there is  
13 the potential for more than 13,000,000 acre-feet of groundwater  
14 recharge annually, with more than 2,500,000 acre-feet being  
15 possible using existing infrastructure.  
16 (s) The Department of Water Resources describes a statewide  
17 capacity in groundwater basins in the range of 1,000,000,000  
18 acre-feet or approximately 20 times the total surface water storage  
19 capacity statewide.  
20 (t) California is home to cutting-edge, job-creating industries  
21 such as those in Silicon Valley and southern California's  
22 biotechnology industry.  
23 (u) It is essential for our economy, environment, and well-being  
24 that California increase the resilience of the state's water supplies.  
25 (v) California must make a historic change in how water is  
26 provided for environmental, residential, business, and agricultural  
27 uses.  
28 SEC. 2. It is the intent of the Legislature to enact future  
29 legislation that modernizes the California Water Plan, including  
30 the establishment of long-term water supply targets.

### Budgeted Deliveries
- Budgeted Deliveries: 23,901
- Actual Deliveries: 24,373
- Difference: 472
- Percentage Difference: 2.0%

### Budgeted Water Sale Revenue
- Budgeted Water Sale Revenue: $ 8,252,686
- Actual Water Sale Revenue: $ 9,162,273
- Difference: $ 909,587
- Percentage Difference: 11.0%

### Conclusion:
While deliveries in January were less than anticipated for the month, year-to-date deliveries through January were 2% greater than budget. As shown in the table above, the main drivers of the variance are the Citrus Heights Water District and the Fair Oaks Water District, both taking less than anticipated in the budget. This was offset by the year-to-date sale of water to SSWD being much higher than anticipated. The budget did not anticipate the sale of water to SSWD to commence until November, but it actually has been happening all year. The positive variance in deliveries results in revenues being 11% greater than expected for this time of year. Excluding SSWD and the water transfer, deliveries were 727 acre feet less than the same time period last year, a 4% decline. The budget anticipated a year-over-year decline of 7.25%.
