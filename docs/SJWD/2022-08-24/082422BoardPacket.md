Director Costa requested that Consent Calendar item 5 be removed for discussion.  
Director Tobin requested that Consent Calendar item 1 be removed for discussion.  
Director Rich requested that Consent Calendar item 3 be removed for discussion.  
President Miller agreed and requested a motion for items 2 and 4.

<!-- Page 6 -->
![August 3, 2022, Special Board Minutes](https://example.com/image-url)

Director Tobin moved to approve the Consent Calendar item 1 with the amendment to reflect changing “close to $600,000” to “over $650,000”. Director Rich seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

Director Rich addressed Consent Calendar item 3 and requested clarification on the need for $150,000 of design work on the Air Release Valve Replacement Program. Mr. Pierson explained that there are approximately 850 ARVs that need to be relocated and the design work is to address each of these, which requires more design work than just a standard service replacement. In response to Director Rich’s question, Mr. Pierson informed the Board that the consultant will help put a bid package together for the actual contractor work.

Director Rich moved to approve the Consent Calendar item 3. Director Tobin seconded the motion and it carried unanimously.

Director Costa addressed Consent Calendar item 5 and expressed concern that the Public Outreach contract is the same every year and there are no changes made after completing customer surveys. He would like the Public Information Committee to review the District’s public outreach.

Director Costa moved to approve the Consent Calendar item 5. Director Tobin seconded the motion.

Director Tobin informed the Board that ACWA has created some new public outreach material which includes a new website – www.quenchca.com. The information is directed towards increasing public awareness on water.

The motion carried unanimously.

IV. PUBLIC HEARING

1. FY 2022-23 Wholesale and Retail Budget (W & R)

President Miller opened the Public Hearing at 6:15 p.m.

The Public Hearing was duly posted and published. There were no formal written comments received.

Ms. Silva reviewed the summary of the four District funds and reported that the wholesale and retail operations funds are able to make transfers out to their respective capital reserves. She reviewed the changes made to the proposed FY 2022-23 wholesale and retail budget since the Board last reviewed it at the June 22nd workshop. These changes were provided in a staff report and will be attached to the meeting minutes.

Ms. Silva reviewed the COLA information and informed the Board that, subsequent to the Board’s last meeting, the Elk Grove Water District approved the 7.2% COLA. She explained that this would make the average COLA of the comparator agencies,
<!-- Page 7 -->
![August 3, 2022, Special Board Minutes Page 4](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=August+3%2C+2022%2C+Special+Board+Minutes+Page+4)

that have posted COLAs, 4.3% as mentioned at the last Board meeting. In addition, she explained that awarding a COLA of 4.3% would maintain the District market position based on information known at this time. She explained that there are eight agencies that have not publicized their upcoming COLAs and the Board did agree to revisit the COLA within six months.

Director Tobin presented several comments/questions which included revisiting the budget to tie it in when the Strategic Plan is updated, reviewing the liability insurance increase of 55%, inquiring about the need to have rate increases when revenue has increased over projections, looking into healthcare through JPIA, and explaining what professional services are covered under that title in the budget. Ms. Silva addressed her questions and explained that rate increases are driven by the financial plan which is in turn driven by the master plan. Ms. Silva explained that the Board has expressed a desire to do as many projects as possible on a pay as you go basis. Therefore, rate increases are needed to pay for the Capital Improvement Program over time so that the District can build up reserves, and in turn it will cost rate payers less in the long run by paying for capital projects without incurring interest on debt.

In response to Director Costa’s question, Legal Counsel Jones confirmed that the budget can be revisited should the SRF funding fall through and the District has to proceed with a bond at a higher interest rate.

Mr. Mitch Dion addressed the Board and commented that the sound is not very good and suggested that the District invest to improve the quality for remote attendees instead of improving the District’s image with an outside consultant.

President Miller closed the Public Hearing at 6:40 p.m.

Director Rich moved to adopt Resolution No. 22-14 adopting the FY 2022-2023 Budget with a 3.8% COLA. Director Costa seconded the motion.

Director Tobin made a substitute motion to adopt Resolution No. 22-14 adopting the FY 2022-2023 Budget with a 4.3% COLA. There was no second so the motion failed.

The Board discussed the COLA data.

The initial motion carried with 4 Ayes and 1 No vote (Tobin)

President Miller reminded the Board that the minutes of the last Board meeting stated that “The Board discussed the COLA options and the consensus was to incorporate a 3.8% COLA in the budget then revisit the COLA within six months.” Director Zamorano commented that when he suggested that the COLA be revisited that the

   Director Tobin inquired if the Legal Fees were going to be discussed in Closed Session since the General Manager emailed the Excel spreadsheet and at the last meeting it was supposed to be added to this meeting’s agenda. Since it is not a Closed Session item, Director Tobin stated that she reviewed the spreadsheet and it showed that the BKS invoices totaled roughly $240,000 and to date the District has spent close to $347,652 for General Counsel and close to $638,000 for Water Counsel. A copy of the spreadsheet that was emailed to the Board will be attached to the meeting minutes.  
   
   Director Costa commented that he reviewed the spreadsheet too and he did not come close to the $600,000 figure that Director Tobin came up with. GM Helliker shared the spreadsheet on the monitor that he emailed to the Board and reviewed the data. He commented that the Water Counsel (Stoel Rives) total invoices for FY 2021-22 was $284,000. Director Tobin stated that the spreadsheet that GM Helliker was showing on the screen was not the same one that she was emailed.. GM Helliker informed the Board that General Counsel invoiced totaled $63,469; therefore, the total for FY21-22 for all legal bills was $347,652, as compared to FY20-21 with BKS invoices totaling $245,000. GM Helliker informed the Board that additional work was completed by Stoel Rives on the different litigation that the District is involved in, which increased the cost to the District.

# AGENDA ITEM III-2

## STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Tony Barela, Director of Operations  
**Date:** August 24, 2022  
**Subject:** Cityworks Computer Maintenance Management System  

---

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Staff requests approval by the Board of the 3-Year Cityworks Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) Licensing Agreement for a total authorized budget of $56,000. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Engineering Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors under the Consent Calendar.

### BACKGROUND
The District utilizes a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) to manage work orders to facilitate projects, manage assets in the system, track leak repairs, track equipment improvements in the system and, amongst other items, track staff time related to these tasks.

The Cityworks platform was implemented at the District in 2019 and has since expanded Staff’s ability to manage maintenance and daily work tasks as well as advancing accessibility to planning and design documents in the field. Staff has negotiated a deal to expand our access to the Cityworks platform to include additional modules to further expand our ability develop application programming interfaces (APIs), key performance indicators (KPIs) and system analytics.

The licensing agreement will be good through 8/31/25 as noted below.

| Cost   | Date Range                |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Year 1 | $17,000 09/01/2022 - 08/31/2023 |
| Year 2 | $19,000 09/01/2023 - 08/31/2024 |
| Year 3 | $20,000 09/01/2024 - 08/31/2025 |

### FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
This cost is included in the FY22/23 Budget. Project costs are allocated 25/75 Wholesale/Retail.

**AGENDA ITEM III-3**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Adam Larsen, Field Services Manager  
**Date:** August 24, 2022  
**Subject:** Authorization of Purchase for Vehicle #6 Replacement  

---

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Staff requests approval by the Board to replace Vehicle #6 with a Ford F750, with a dump bed from Ron DuPratt Ford, in the amount of $124,373 plus a 10% contingency of $12,500, for a total authorized amount of $136,873. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Engineering Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors under the Consent Calendar.

---

**BACKGROUND**  
The District’s existing Vehicle #6 is a 2008 Ford F650 with a dump bed. The vehicle is 14 years old and was scheduled to be replaced in Fiscal Year 23/24. Due to an extensive amount of repairs, we moved this replacement forward one year. We have been informed that the engine will need to be replaced or rebuilt in the near future. Staff’s recommendation is to replace the vehicle rather than invest more money in an expensive repair. The vehicle has reached the point where repair and maintenance costs to the District are no longer cost effective and vehicle reliability and safety are a concern.

The District will utilize the State of California vehicle contract. Staff selected the diesel replacement; based upon vehicle mileage, maintenance costs, and towing capability.

---

**FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS**  
This vehicle replacement was budgeted for $125,000. The quote came in at $124,372.82. Staff is requesting a 10% contingency to cover any extra costs like logos, safety lights, etc.

After vehicle #6 is replaced, it will go to public auction and then the amount that it is sold for will go back into the District’s General CIP Fund.

# AGENDA ITEM III-4  
## STAFF REPORT  

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Andrew Pierson, Director of Engineering Services  
**Date:** August 24, 2022  
**Subject:** Eureka Road Pipeline Replacement Project – Construction Contract Amendment  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION  
Staff requests approval by the Board of a construction contract budget increase of $280,136 to the construction contract with Flowline Contractors, Inc. (Contractor) for the Eureka Road Pipeline Replacement Project (Project) to include the abandonment of the existing 12-inch steel pipeline in Eureka Road between Providence Lane and Auburn Folsom Road. The staff recommendation was reviewed by the Engineering Committee, which recommends approval by the Board of Directors under the Consent Calendar.  

### BACKGROUND  
The current Project consists of replacing approximately 250-ft of 18-in and 3,750-ft of 16-in steel pipeline with 18-in ductile-iron pipeline in Eureka Road between Barton Road and Providence Lane. It also includes tie-ins to the existing lateral water mains and replacing services and fire hydrants. The Contractor was awarded the construction contract on March 23, 2022 and issued the Notice to Proceed on April 19, 2022. The Contractor began potholing the existing utilities in late June, but construction is currently on hold because the Contractor has not procured all the materials.  

In June and July of 2022, an existing 12-inch steel pipeline on Eureka Road between Providence Lane and Auburn Folsom Road developed several leaks that required repairs. The existing 12-inch steel pipeline parallels an existing 16-inch AC pipeline, and was not identified to be replaced or abandoned during the planning phase for the Project because there were no identified issues with it at that time. However, due to the high number of leaks in a relatively short time period and considering the current condition of the pipe observed by Staff during the repairs, Staff recommends including the abandonment of the pipeline with the Project.  

The abandonment of the existing 12-inch steel pipeline would include swapping over all water services and lateral water mains from the existing 12-inch steel pipeline to the existing 16-inch AC pipeline, and then abandoning the 12-inch steel pipeline in-place by filling the pipeline with low strength grout.  

### FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The original construction contract approved by the Board was for $2,710,202 with a construction contingency of $271,020 (10%) for a total authorized construction budget of $2,981,222. Staff is recommending increasing the total authorized construction budget to $3,261,358 which includes a 10% contingency. The additional costs to abandon the existing 12-inch steel pipeline would be funded by retail capital reserves and would not be included with the DWSRF loan.

## RESOLUTION NO. 22-17

### A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS  
### OF THE SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT  
### APPOINTING ROB WATSON TO A RETIRED ANNUITANT EXTRA HELP POSITION

BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors of the San Juan Water District as follows:

1. **Recitals.** This resolution is made with reference to the following background recitals:

   (a) Rob Watson retired from the San Juan Water District in the position of Engineering Services Manager (now titled Director of Engineering Services) effective December 31, 2019 (December 30, 2019 last day of service).

   (b) The District is undertaking the Hinkle Reservoir Cover and Lining Project and the preparation of a Wholesale Master Plan, which are pending projects necessary for effectively maintaining and improving the District’s water system (the “Projects”).

   (c) Mr. Watson is a registered engineer and was leading the work on the Projects.

   (d) The Projects require that a registered engineer participate in ensuring their successful completion. There is no one on District staff with the requisite skills and experience to perform this mission-critical and time-sensitive work, and therefore Mr. Watson’s knowledge and expertise are critically necessary for the District to be able to complete the Projects in a timely and cost-effective manner.

   (e) The District Board of Directors desires to employ and appoint Mr. Watson in a retired annuitant extra help position under Government Code sections 7522.56 and 21224, and determines that, in light of Mr. Watson’s significant prior experience, skills and knowledge, his appointment is necessary to perform this specialized work of limited duration.

   (f) The District Board has reviewed the employment agreement with Mr. Watson, which provides that his employment shall be limited to 960 hours in each fiscal year to perform the Project tasks requiring specialized skills not possessed by any other District employee.

   (g) As stated in the employment agreement and as further required by Government Code sections 7522.56 and 21224, the compensation proposed to be paid to Mr. Watson shall not be less than the minimum, nor exceed the maximum, paid by the District to other employees performing comparable duties, divided by 173.333 to equal an hourly rate. The maximum monthly base salary for the Director of Engineering Services position with the District is $15,684.93 and the hourly equivalent is $90.49. The minimum monthly base salary for the position is $13,071.10 and the hourly equivalent is $75.41. Mr. Watson will receive an hourly rate of $87.78 (equivalent to $15,215.20/month) and will not receive any other benefit, incentive, compensation in lieu of benefit, or any other form of compensation in addition to this hourly rate.
<!-- Page 17 -->
(h) The District Board finds that no matters relating to Mr. Watson’s appointment or employment with the District have or will be placed on the consent calendar.

2. Approval of Employment Agreement. The District Board of Directors hereby certifies that the nature of Mr. Watson’s appointment and employment as a retired annuitant is necessary to fill a critically needed position with the District requiring specialized skills possessed by Mr. Watson that are necessary in performing project work of limited duration and, on that basis, hereby approves the employment agreement attached to this resolution and incorporated herein as Exhibit A.

Employee warrants that he is not currently employed as a retired annuitant by another CalPERS employer. Employee shall notify District if Employee proposes to accept employment with another CalPERS public agency employer and, if District objects to such proposed employment, Employee shall not accept it. If such additional employment is approved, Employee shall be solely responsible for tracking his total number of hours worked for all CalPERS employers to ensure that he does not exceed the 960 hour annual limit.

2. **Term.** The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date of this Agreement and will remain in effect until June 30, 2023, or whenever the Projects are completed, whichever is sooner, unless sooner terminated as provided in the termination provision in Section 9 below.

3. **Duties.** The District, through the General Manager, shall assign Employee his duties and hours of work, but such duties shall include engineering and project assistance work on the Hinkle Reservoir Liner and Cover Replacement Project and assisting with developer funded projects, which work requires specialized skills and training and which is critically necessary to the ongoing duties and functions of the District. Employee represents that he is properly trained and certified to perform the duties required under this Agreement. Employee further represents that Employee will maintain, at Employee’s sole expense and on Employee’s own time, all required licenses and certifications as a condition of this extra help retired annuitant employment.

4. **Hours.** Employee shall be available to work as necessary to fully and competently perform the duties of the position, regardless of the number of hours or time of day or week involved. Employee shall be compensated only for hours actually worked and generally shall not work more than 40 hours in a week unless authorized or requested by the General Manager. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Employee, as a retired annuitant, may not work more than 960 hours in District’s fiscal year 2022/2023, and District shall retain the right to track Employee’s hours and to summarily suspend Employee duties in order to ensure that Employee does not exceed the 960 hour limitation in each fiscal year.

5. **Outside Employment and Activities.** Employee shall not engage in any conduct, other employment or business, commercial or professional pursuits, whether for compensation or otherwise, that would interfere with his responsibilities and duties to District or that would reflect unfavorably upon the interests of District.

### Budgeted Deliveries
- Budgeted Deliveries: 5,238.83
- Actual Deliveries: 5,751.06
- Difference: 512.23
- 10%

### Budgeted Water Sale Revenue
- Budgeted Water Sale Revenue: $1,546,281

# RWA Executive Committee meeting notes  
**8-24-22**  

## Closed session  
**ED performance review**  

### ED Employment Agreement  
Continue this to next RWA Exec Comm meeting  

### Compensation Survey  
Split the compensation study into two paths – one for staff and one for ED (the deadline for the latter is Dec. 2023)  
RGS recommended 17 agencies – Monterey, Fairfield and Vallejo are out of the area  
EC agreed to split the process into separate paths, and remove the out of area agencies  

### RWA Policy 400.4 ED Performance Review  
Deleted a few references to dates for the process of developing annual priorities  

### Water Efficiency Reserve Policy  
There were concerns about an annual inflator. The committee removed it.  

### Major Projects Program Update  
Peifer notes that the program has been successful and well-received. Some changes have occurred – Major Projects and Resilience Programs at the start, now an additional subscription program for the Biological Opinions. Peifer proposes that part of Michelle Banonis’ time be paid by all RWA members. Peifer mentions higher BKS legal costs, due to “growing pains”. Michelle Banonis described the work to date on the Voluntary Agreements (all of which is MPMS work), and she mentioned the Common Interest Agreement. She discussed the Biological Opinions work, and the upcoming deliberations on Delta Conveyance.  

Pam Tobin asked how SJWD could be a better participant in RWA. Kerry Schmitz – better coordination and commitment to maintaining confidential information. Sean Bigley – need one voice, and needs a focus on having collaboration. Pam Tobin – apologizes for bad judgement and inappropriate behavior by San Juan personnel, and any legal expenses that may be attributed to San Juan. Schmitz – message to Executive Committee – wants to make changes to the program to get rid of some of the problems. Brett Ewart – Banonis is doing good work.  

### Legislation  
Ojakian – legislative session ends next Thursday.  
SB 1157 – Hertzberg may amend the bill to go back to the introduced version. RWA still OUA.  
SB 222 – bill is silent on how the low income rate assistance program would be funded. RWA still OUA.  
Budget – will need to be resolved by August 31, unless there is a special session convened afterwards (which is not likely). The Governor has proposed many late requests for energy and climate funding, but there could be some water issues that get deliberated – e.g., the $1.5 Billion to purchase water. That funding has moved over to watershed resilience. Need to watch trailer bills.
<!-- Page 59 -->
# Ad Hoc Committee Updates
- **3x3 Committee** – SGA voted to rescind the MOU. Peifer recommends that RWA do the same.
- **Policy 400.4** – can take that off the list.
- **Policy 200.2** – just starting, has not yet met (August 29 is first meeting).
- **Policy 200.3** – committee developed a proposal, but that does not work well with the RWA JPA – may need to go back and reconsider proposal.

![ACWA Update on Priority Issues](https://acwa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ACWA-Update-on-Priority-Issues-August-2022.png)

# ACWA UPDATE ON PRIORITY ISSUES
A high-level look at recent ACWA activity and initiatives.

## AUGUST 2022

### SB 222 (Dodd) - Low-Income Water Rate Assistance Program
SB 222 would require the State Water Resources Control Board to create a Water Rate Assistance Program (WRAP) to provide financial assistance for both drinking water and wastewater services to low-income residential ratepayers. ACWA believes that a WRAP - if designed in a reasonable, efficient and effective manner - is an appropriate approach. However, the June 23 amendments raised significant concerns. ACWA’s State Legislative Committee at its July 6 meeting moved from a watch position, that was based on extensive amendments obtained in 2021, to an oppose-unless-amended position on the June 23, 2022 version. ACWA then reestablished the ACWA-led SB 222 OUA coalition.

In July, ACWA submitted a coalition letter to the author expressing concerns, together with a mockup with ACWA's suggested amendments. The letter and mockup are available in a recently distributed ACWA Alert available at acwa.com/notifications. The author’s office shared draft amendments with ACWA and other organizations on July 28. The proposed amendments would improve the bill but did not adequately address all of the critical issues. On Aug. 5, the State Legislative Committee reaffirmed the oppose-unless-amended position for the bill as proposed to be amended by the author. The bill is at the Assembly floor, and ACWA expects that it will be amended any day. Senator Dodd will likely take the bill up for an Assembly vote soon after the bill. Meanwhile, the coalition is continuing to support the bill with the goal of obtaining amendments to make the program workable and efficient.

### State Budget for 2022-’23 Fiscal Year
ACWA continues to advocate for additional funding from the $308 billion state budget, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed on June 30. The budget includes an additional $2.8 billion one-time general fund money over multiple years to support drought resilience and response and includes several funding priorities of interest to ACWA members, including immediate drought support, climate change, forest management and more. While the budget defers some details to future legislation, the new Budget Act does contain some specific funding for water and wastewater issues, including $100 million for dam safety for FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-25, $180 million for water conservation projects, and $100 million for recycled water and groundwater cleanup. ACWA and other associations and agencies have been advocating extensively for significant funding for water infrastructure projects including dam safety, recycled water, conveyance, desalination, groundwater, water conservation, and other areas. These issues will close by Aug. 31 - the date by which the Legislature will adjourn for the close of this two-year legislative session.

### SB 1157 (Hertzberg) - Proposed Indoor Water Use Efficiency Standards
Under existing state law, the standard for residential water use will be 52.5 gallons per capita daily (gpcd) starting Jan. 1, 2025 and 50 gpcd starting Jan. 1, 2030. SB 1157 proposes new, more stringent standards of 47 gpcd starting Jan. 1, 2025 and 42 gpcd starting Jan. 1, 2030. The bill was recently amended in the Assembly Water, Parks, and Wildlife Committee to propose to require the Department of Water Resources (DWR) to complete a new study to assess and quantify the economic benefits of the proposed 2030 standard, due to the Legislature by Jan. 1, 2027. Finally, the amendments to the bill would require DWR to report to the Legislature on the progress of water suppliers in achieving the urban water use objective by Jan. 1, 2028.

ACWA has an oppose-unless-amended position on SB 1157 and continues work on amendments with input from the working group. The bill was sent to the Suspense File in the Senate Appropriations Committee on Aug. 3, where it will likely be acted on by that committee on Aug. 11.

**Drought Updates**  
The Governor continues to encourage water suppliers to submit their monthly water use data to the State Water Board by the third business day of the following month or “as soon as possible.” The data will help the state accurately measure California’s water conservation goals and inform the state’s next steps in regards to drought response. ACWA distributed a Regulatory Advisory with this request on July 28 that is available at [acwa.com/notifications](https://acwa.com/notifications). Also, the State Water Board’s drought-related emergency conservation regulation went into effect in June. The regulation requires urban water suppliers to implement, at a minimum, all demand reduction actions identified in Level 2 of their locally adopted Water Shortage Contingency Plans. It also prohibits the irrigation of non-functional turf with potable water in the commercial, industrial, and institutional sector. More information on the emergency regulation and the adopted text is available at [waterboards.ca.gov](https://waterboards.ca.gov). A fact sheet explaining the regulation is available for agencies to use in educating customers at [acwa.com/resources](https://acwa.com/resources).

**ACWA-Sponsored AB 2142 (Gabriel) – California Income Tax Exclusion for Turf Replacement**  
ACWA is co-sponsoring AB 2142 with the California Water Efficiency Partnership and WaterNow Alliance. The bill would reinstate the California personal tax exemption for turf replacement rebates to help incentivize participation in water efficiency programs. The exemption would be for taxable years 2022 through 2026. The bill passed the Assembly floor in May and moved to the Senate. The Senate Governance and Finance Committee recently passed the bill with all members voting to support the measure. The bill was sent to the Suspense File in the Senate Appropriations Committee, where it will likely be acted on by that committee on Aug. 11. ACWA submitted a coalition letter in support of the bill to Senate Appropriations on June 21 and plans to submit another letter Aug. 15.

**Federal Climate and Wildfire Efforts**  
The House Committee on Energy and Major Leader Pelosi recently proposed a revised budget reconciliation package on July 27, now called the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The package focuses on tax breaks and incentives, prescription drug costs, and contains an energy and climate resilience section which does include $5 billion for wildfire actions. However, there is no meaningful drought language in the package as proposed. ACWA submitted two letters to various Senate offices urging inclusion of emergency drought funding. The full letters are available at [acwa.com/resources](https://acwa.com/resources).

On July 29, the House passed H.R. 5118, the Wildfire and Drought Resiliency Act. The package of bills would raise wildland fire fighters salaries, provide $500 million for forest management projects and provide funds to conserve water in drought-stricken Western states.

**Federal Investment and Infrastructure Updates**  
The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee advanced the bipartisan Water Resources Development of 2022 (WRDA 2022) which would authorize much-needed investments in the projects and programs of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers across the country. The House and Senate will now begin conferencing their versions of WRDA 2022; a finalized package is expected before the end of the year.

The week of July 11 both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Bureau of Reclamation released six month waiver plans from the Buy America Build America (BABA) provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure law. ACWA expects continued action on BABA waivers in the coming months. ACWA submitted a letter to the EPA on the proposed temporary waiver July 27. The full letter is available at [acwa.com/resources](https://acwa.com/resources).

**Quench California Public Education Campaign**  
ACWA’s statewide 2022-’23 public education campaign Quench California debuted in May 2022 at ACWA’s Spring Conference & Exhibition with the name, tagline, logo and website, QuenchCA.com. In July, the campaign launched publicly with a social media campaign and digital ads. In addition, a toolkit was sent out to members Aug. 4 with customizable items that members are encouraged to incorporate into their communication and outreach efforts. The toolkit is available at acwa.com/resources.

**ACWA 501(c)(3) Foundation**  
Work continues toward exploring the formation of a non-profit ACWA Foundation to promote diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) within the water industry through leadership and professional development. A task force has adopted a mission statement and vision statement and is working on a statement of purpose, goals and objectives, proposed governance structure, bylaws and financing, among other details.

Staff presented an update to the ACWA Board of Directors in July, including a preliminary look at operational and budget considerations, an assessment of other water industry DEI resources and a proposed timeline for next steps. Legal counsel provided an overview of legal considerations with forming a 501(c)(3).
