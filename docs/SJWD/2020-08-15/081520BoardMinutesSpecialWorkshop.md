### I. PUBLIC WORKSHOP
1. **Transition to Division-Based Elections (W & R)**  
   Legal Counsel Jennifer Buckman explained that this is a public workshop to answer questions about the process of transitioning to division-based elections. Representatives of the Granite Bay Community Association and members of the public raised concerns regarding mapping requirements, criteria and how to draw the boundaries on a map, fair and equitable representation for Granite Bay, and identifying SJWD Retail as a community of interest. In addition, the group inquired about reorganizing to form a separate retail water district, which Ms. Buckman explained was a separate issue related to long-term governance and would require undertaking a separate process wholly independent of the District's transition to by-division elections. Ms. Buckman suggested that discussion of the District's organization be deferred until after the District completes its transition to by-division elections through the California Voting Rights Act process. Ms. Buckman and Director Miller provided a brief overview of the wholesale and retail service areas.

Director Miller explained how the transition to division-based elections came about with the letter from the law firm and, in addition, he provided some information on a case in southern California which is fighting the same type of claim. Ms. Buckman explained the California Voting Rights Act and its requirements to avoid vote dilution. Ms. Buckman noted that the maps show that the District does have a series of contiguous census blocks with a high concentration of Latino voters, which the board will have to take into account when it is considering where to place the division lines. Ms. Buckman explained how the directors' terms will work while transitioning to division-based elections. After hearing discussions from the group, Director Miller stated that he will ask the Board to give direction to staff to determine the requirements for separating out the retail entity, by composing a staff report which would include action items to the proper agencies, determine costs, and list the number of employees and their wholesale/retail allocation.
