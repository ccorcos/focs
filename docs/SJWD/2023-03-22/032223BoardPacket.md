   GM Helliker reviewed the 2nd quarter progress on the FY 2022-23 Operations Plan Report Card. He reviewed a few items that have been delayed.

3. **2023 Hydrology and Operations Update (W & R)**  
   GM Helliker reviewed data on Folsom Reservoir, which included the current storage level at 110% of historical average, data on releases, temperature and precipitation.
<!-- Page 7 -->
![February 22, 2023, Board Minutes Page 3](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=February+22%2C+2023%2C+Board+Minutes+Page+3)

outlooks, storage levels and projections, and current reservoir conditions across the state.

GM Helliker reported that precipitation levels are still above normal and the snow levels are at 186% of the April 1st average for the American River watershed (Central). He reviewed the forecast for total run-off and the incoming atmospheric rivers. He reviewed the Drought Monitor Main Map and the Drought Monitor Better Maps and informed the Board that he has been advocating for the media to use the latter since it is a better indicator of the actual drought situation related to urban water supplies.

GM Helliker reviewed the Folsom Reservoir Flood Control Curve chart and anticipates Folsom Reservoir filling over the next few months. He reviewed the water temperature at the dam. In addition, he informed the Board that the CVP water allocation was released today and indicated that the settlement contractors who received 18% last year are expected to receive 100% this year. San Juan’s allocation is 75% of historic use (which is 0).

4. Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking Activities Update (W & R)  
GM Helliker informed the Board that Citrus Heights Water District (CHWD) indicates that they are unable to meet regarding conjunctive use and groundwater banking for a few months. Director Costa informed the Board that Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) is drafting a response to Director Miller’s October, 2022 letter and it should be received in the next couple of days, and that FOWD appointed two directors to meet with two SJWD directors to discuss this topic. GM Helliker informed the Board that President Rich appointed Director Costa and himself to represent the District on the FOWD 2x2 committee. In addition, GM Helliker will provide the Board with the options document that is being discussed with SSWD and Orangevale.

In response to Director Miller’s comment, GM Helliker informed the Board that there are other options available to the District for groundwater banking and the District is not limited to partnering with FOWD or CHWD only. Director Miller urged the committee to recommend a sunset date for FOWD and CHWD to decide if they would like to pursue a partnership regarding this topic. In addition, the Board discussed the District constructing its own groundwater well and GM Helliker commented that since the District is not in the business of operating and maintaining wells, it might be best if a partnership with an agency that does operate wells were established.

V. NEW BUSINESS

1. ACWA JPIA Executive Committee Nomination (W & R)  
Director Tobin informed the Board that there are four seats open for election on the ACWA JPIA Executive Committee, and she would like to be nominated.

Director Miller moved to adopt Resolution 23-03 nominating Pam Tobin to the Executive Committee of the Association of California Water Agencies Joint Powers Insurance Authority. Director Costa seconded the motion and it carried with 4 Ayes and 1 Absent (Rich).
<!-- Page 8 -->
2. Legislation (W & R)  
GM Helliker requested that the Board delay any action on Initiative 21-0042A1 until a future meeting. He informed the Board that SB 366 is the bill that the Solve the Water Crisis group is working on; however, he asked that a position on this bill be delayed as well, since the bill as introduced is only a spot bill. Director Tobin stated that ACWA is also working on these items and she suggested that the Board wait to take a position. Vice President Zamorano agreed that the Board should wait to take a position, especially since SB 366 is a spot bill.  

Director Miller moved to adopt an oppose position on Initiative 21-0042A1. Director Tobin seconded the motion. The vote began with a No vote from Director Costa and an Aye vote from Director Miller; however, Director Tobin questioned the motion, then with clarification from Legal Counsel Jones, Director Miller withdrew his motion and Director Tobin withdrew her second to the motion.  

Vice President Zamorano asked under New Business to make a motion for a one-time rebate of $5 for residential customers - the $5 rebate is to be deducted from a designated monthly bill - refer this motion to the Finance Committee and back to the Board for consideration. In response to Director Miller, Vice President Zamorano explained that since the Board is willing to give COLAs of 5-6% totaling $70-80,000 in perpetuity then a small rebate to residential customers is a way to show respect to the customers and that the Board is looking out for their best interest.  

VI. INFORMATION ITEMS  

1. GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT  
1.1 General Manager’s Monthly Report (W & R)  
GM Helliker provided the Board with a written report for January which will be attached to the meeting minutes.  

1.2 Miscellaneous District Issues and Correspondence  
GM Helliker reported that the Water Forum is developing its budget for next fiscal year starting in July which includes two elements – the Habitat Management and the Water Forum Successor Effort. He explained that, for the last three years, the group has been working on updating the Water Forum agreement, which terminates in 2030. The Water Forum staff is estimating that it will take until 2026 to finalize the agreement at a cost of approximately $1.5 million. In addition, the County of Sacramento wants to reduce their commitment, which is about half of the amount that is charged to the whole region. The Water Forum participants are discussing the budget and looking for areas to reduce costs and expect to have this resolved by July.

# AGENDA ITEM IV-1

## STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** March 22, 2023  
**Subject:** Groundwater Partnership Between SSWD and SJWD  

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Information Only. This item was also discussed by the Engineering Committee on March 13, 2023.

### BACKGROUND
Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) and San Juan Water District (SJWD) conduct a variety of business activities together, including those focused on ensuring reliable water supplies under various hydrologic conditions. SSWD and SJWD jointly operate the Cooperative Transmission Pipeline (CTP), which provides the capability of delivering surface water from Folsom Reservoir to SJWD’s wholesale service area and to SSWD’s service area, and they jointly operate the Antelope Pump Station, which can deliver groundwater from the SSWD service area into SJWD’s wholesale area. The two agencies are now exploring additional partnerships to increase their ability to conjunctively use surface and groundwater supplies, thereby increasing water supply reliability and their joint ability to transfer water supplies to other parties, to meet various needs.

SSWD and SJWD have collaborated for decades to manage their surface and groundwater supplies, to benefit their customers and to improve conditions in the Sacramento Groundwater Authority (SGA) region of the North American Subbasin. SSWD has been purchasing surface water supplies from the Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) in certain normal or wet years, which SJWD treats and wheels to SSWD, pursuant to a longstanding agreement. PCWA supplies are not available in drier years, so for the past four years, SSWD has purchased surface water supplies from SJWD, via transfers of SJWD’s water right water. This new collaboration has allowed SSWD to continue to increase its store of banked groundwater supplies, which can also benefit SJWD by those supplies serving as supplemental source of water via the Antelope Pump Station, when surface water supplies are limited.

Perhaps more importantly, this collaboration has established the foundation for a partnership between SSWD and SJWD to conduct groundwater substitution transfers, both at market rates, and as part of the regional Voluntary Agreement (VA) proposal. The VA is designed to provide better environmental results and far better water supply security than would the unimpaired flows proposal that has been developed by staff at the State Water Resources Control Board, for the purpose of updating the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan. As of the last update of the exchangeable water balance of SGA’s water accounting framework (which tallied supplies through 2020), SSWD had
<!-- Page 13 -->
Staff Report – Groundwater Partnership  
March 22, 2023  

banked more than 285,000 acre-feet of groundwater supplies within its service area. This banked water has provided and can continue to provide water supplies for use by SSJWD customers under normal conditions, as well as for their use and for delivery to SJWD during drought emergencies. The banked water can also provide the resources for groundwater substitution transfers.  

When the SJWD Board of Directors adopted its latest retail financial plan in June of 2022, $5 million was included in the plan, to fund groundwater partnerships. Since that time, SSWD and SJWD managers have been meeting to define the details of a potential partnership. As described in the attached document, three alternatives are being evaluated, ranging from joint ownership of groundwater facilities to an arrangement under which SJWD pays for supplies produced by SSWD.  

The purpose of this item for Board discussion is to provide a status report, and to share the alternatives document, for the Board’s review and input.

# Collaboration Scenarios
## Conjunctive Use and Groundwater Banking
### Sacramento Suburban Water District and San Juan Water District
### 11-22-2022 Draft

---

### 1.0 Summary

Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) and San Juan Water District (SJWD) conduct a variety of business activities together, including those focused on ensuring reliable water supplies under various hydrologic conditions. SSWD and SJWD jointly operate the Cooperative Transmission Pipeline (CTP), which provides the capability of delivering surface water from Folsom Reservoir to SJWD’s wholesale service area and to SSWD’s service area, and they jointly operate the Antelope Pump Station, which can deliver groundwater from the SSWD service area into SJWD’s wholesale area. The two agencies are now exploring additional partnerships to increase their ability to conjunctively use surface and groundwater supplies, thereby increasing water supply reliability and their joint ability to transfer water supplies to other parties, to meet various needs.

### 2.0 Partnership Opportunities

Currently, SJWD has adequate surface water diversion, treatment and transmission capacity to meet projected surface water supply needs for its Wholesale Customer Agencies, including its own retail service area. SJWD’s 120 MGD (150 maximum MGD) surface water treatment plant, its 62 MG Tinkle Reservoir for treated water storage, and the various transmission pipelines (CTP – 72”, Fair Oaks – 40” and Citrus Heights – 42”) have reliably delivered more than 73,000 acre-feet of treated surface water from Folsom Reservoir to both its wholesale service area and to SSWD and California American Water Company (Cal-Am), at rates of up to 139 MGD. SJWD has various water rights and entitlements totaling up to 82,200 AF/yr when hydrology permits, of which 58,000 AF/yr is available as a relatively firm supply.

When SJWD’s wholesale demands do not require the use of all of its available supplies, it can transfer unused water to SSWD for its use in lieu of groundwater, resulting in the banking of water in the aquifer underlying SSWD’s service area, pursuant to the banking protocol defined by the Sacramento Groundwater Authority. SJWD’s agreements to transfer water right water to SSWD since 2019 have contributed to the more than 285,000 AF of groundwater that SSWD has banked in the North American subbasin aquifer.

In the future, SJWD’s water right water could also be banked by SSWD via direct injection, if and when SSWD installs aquifer storage and recovery technology. Also, once the Bureau of Reclamation acknowledges that the North American subbasin aquifer is a groundwater bank, SJWD will be authorized to bank SJWD’s CVP water and the water of other CVP contractors in SSWD’s service area, either via in-lieu use or direct injection.
<!-- Page 15 -->
![Groundwater Banking Collaboration Scenarios](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Groundwater+Banking+Collaboration+Scenarios)

**SJWD and SSWD**  
Draft 11-20-2022  

While SJWD has never failed to have adequate surface water supplies to meet wholesale customer demands, its ability to receive deliveries from Folsom Reservoir could be reduced, should reservoir levels fall below 110,000 AF. Below that level, SJWD and the City of Roseville would be forced to rely on, and share, the maximum 60 cubic feet per second (cfs) capacity of an emergency pump operated by the Bureau of Reclamation. SJWD's water rights allow for diversion of up to 75 cfs during the peak summer months, and its diversions of supplies from the Placer County Water Agency and its CVP water add to this total amount, thus indicating the inadequacies of 60 cfs of shared capacity.

The threat of this reduced pumping capacity under low reservoir conditions - which almost occurred in 2015 - led SJWD and SSWD to build the Antelope Pump Station to be able to provide backup groundwater supplies to SJWD and its wholesale customer agencies if necessary. To ensure reliability and adequate production capacity for the Antelope Pump Station to deliver groundwater to SJWD, SJWD and SSWD are evaluating the alternatives described below.

These alternatives would also provide benefits to SSWD by increasing groundwater production capacity generally and for conducting groundwater substitution transfers, either as part of a market rate transfer, or for the purpose of contributing to flow augmentations pursuant to the Voluntary Agreement process. As noted above, once the Sacramento Regional Groundwater Bank receives federal acknowledgment from the Bureau of Reclamation, SJWD’s CVP water that is subsequently banked in collaboration with SSWD can be delivered later from SSWD’s wells to recipients downstream, either via substitution transfers or via direct delivery to the American River.

### 2.1 SSWD Wells and Facilities – Partial Ownership by SJWD

In this scenario, SSWD and SJWD would jointly own the groundwater wells and associated facilities. Operational responsibilities would need to be defined, but given SSWD’s expertise in owning and operating groundwater facilities, their taking on that responsibility for the jointly-owned wells would likely be the optimal approach. SJWD would contribute to the operational costs, as well as to the repair and replacement costs. Allocation of the proportional share of the pumping capacity of the well(s) to each agency would also need to be defined.

#### 2.1.1 Issues to Address via Agreements between SSWD and SJWD

- Analysis and Design of Facilities
- Capital Cost, Financing and Financial Participation
- Operations Responsibilities and Cost Sharing

**2.2 SSWD Wells and Facilities – SJWD Pays for Production Capacity**  
In this scenario, SSWD would own and operate the groundwater wells and associated facilities, and SJWD would purchase production capacity in those facilities by contributing funds toward installation or rehabilitation, etc. SJWD would also contribute to the operational costs, as well as to the repair and replacement costs. As part of the financial and operational agreements between SSWD and SJWD, SJWD would be provided a guaranteed quantity of water produced and transmitted into the CTP, for use by SJWD and its Wholesale Customer Agencies under defined conditions.

In this scenario, SSWD would own and operate the groundwater wells and associated facilities, and SJWD would purchase water supplies from those facilities. SJWD would be provided a guaranteed quantity of water produced and transmitted into the CTP, for use by SJWD and its Wholesale Customer Agencies. Under this option, would pay solely for the water produced, with no upfront financial contribution to SSWD for the cost of facilities or capacity in them.

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Donna Silva, Director of Finance  
**Date:** March 22, 2023  
**Subject:** Mid-Year Financial Report – Fiscal Year 2022-23  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
Receive report.  

**BACKGROUND**  
The Board of Directors adopted the Fiscal Year 2022-23 Operating and Capital Budget on August 3, 2022. The Board of Directors receives monthly budget to actual reports at each Board Meeting. Approximately halfway through a fiscal year, staff performs a deep analysis of the year to date revenues and expenses and projects the annual results, and compares those projections to the adopted budget. A mid-year analysis of this nature affords the District the opportunity to correct course, if necessary, and/or to be assured that the financial activities and position of the District are on course with the approved budget.  

The purpose of this report is to summarize that analysis for the Board of Directors.

**Mid-Year Financial Report**  
**Donna Silva**  

As illustrated in the graph above, both wholesale revenues and expenses are tracking favorably with the budget. Estimated revenues are 7.8% greater than budgeted and expenses are estimated to be 11.6% less than budgeted. Water sales to the regular wholesale customer agencies are lower than was anticipated in the budget, by $433,600 or 4.5%. Fair Oaks Water District is now estimated to be 32% less than they had projected during budget preparation and deliveries to Citrus Heights Water District are looking to come in 7% less than anticipated. However, the difference is more than made up by sales outside of the wholesale service area. The budget anticipated revenues of $572,400 from Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) and $729,300 from the water transfer. Actual sales to SSWD are now estimated to be $1,675,300 as they will be taking their PCWA water this year and revenues from the water transfer are expected to be $899,000 due to more water being transferred than assumed in the original budget.

Wholesale operating expenses are projected to come in almost $1.2 million less than budgeted. While savings against the budget are seen across the board, the significant difference comes from Source of Supply expenses where the District had budgeted almost $1.1 million for the environmental review necessary for the Warren Act contract renewal. Staff estimates that selection of a consultant for this work will occur in April, so most of the expenses will be incurred next year.

The budget anticipated a transfer to capital reserves of $573,200. Based on the mid-year budget analysis, the transfer is now expected to be around $3 million.

**Wholesale Capital:**  
The original budget for Wholesale Capital revenue was $24,983,000, including $23,120,600 in loan proceeds for the Hinkle Reservoir Project. Staff is pleased to report that revenues appear on track with the budget, with a 1.1% positive variance due to slightly higher investment income and property tax revenues.

**Wholesale Capital**  
**Mid-Year Budget Analysis**  
**Fiscal Year 2022-23**

|                | Revenues         | Expenses         |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Budget         | $24,719,600      | $25,431,900      |
| Actuals as of February | $1,099,220      | $4,339,985       |
| Mid-Year Estimate | $24,983,000      | $24,984,000      |

The wholesale capital expenditure budget funded 18 projects/equipment purchases totaling $25,431,900. Staff estimates that all but 6 will be completed by the end of the year. As a result, wholesale capital expenditures are expected to be within 2% of the budget.

The budget anticipated wholesale capital reserves of $17.71 million. Due to revenues being slightly more than anticipated and expenses being slightly less than anticipated, staff is expecting to end the year with $21.9 million in wholesale capital reserves. This level of reserves is well in excess of what was anticipated in the last financial plan. The next wholesale financial plan is underway and will be offering recommendations on how to best utilize these reserves.

**Retail Operations:**  
Retail operations are on track with the budget, with a small positive variance. Revenues were budgeted at $15,894,700. The mid-year estimate for revenues is $16,078,300, an overall increase of 1.2% mostly due to increased water sales. Retail water sales for the first part of the year exceeded expectations. We are holding our estimate constant for February – April while the Hinkle Reservoir Project is underway, but are increasing the estimated water use for May and June given the termination of drought messaging. This results in the mid-year estimate for water sales being 1.1% greater than projected in the budget.

**Operating Expenses** were budgeted for $13,588,800 and are now projected to be about $13,452,500, which is $136,300, or 1%, less than the budget. Lower than budgeted salaries and benefits, professional services and maintenance costs are mostly offset with higher than anticipated source of supply increases, due to increased water demand and higher power costs, which staff is currently investigating.

The budget anticipated a transfer out to capital reserves of $2,111,800. Given the favorable results from the prior year and the projected results of the mid-year analysis, the transfer out to capital could be as high as $2.6 million.

**Retail Capital:**
The Retail Capital Fund has budgeted revenues of $5,921,800. Staff’s mid-year analysis estimates actual revenues will be at least 40% greater than budgeted, generating extra revenues of over $2.3 million. This increase is due to the receipt of $2.6 million in capital facility fees. This is the third year of extraordinary development activity in the District. The category is extremely difficult to predict and budget as it is solely dependent upon developers and the progress of their projects, which then drive the payment stream of these fees. The majority of these revenues are held in reserve, to be spent on specific projects that have an expansionary component, and thus were part of the basis for the establishment of the fee.

![Retail Capital Mid-Year Budget Analysis](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Retail+Capital+Mid-Year+Budget+Analysis+Fiscal+Year+2022-23)

The retail capital expenditure budget anticipated expenses of $13.7 million to fund 37 projects: 6 are already complete, 17 more are expected to be completed by the end of the year, 6 have either already started, or are expected to start, but not finish by years’ end, and 8 will be pushed to next fiscal year. Based on this, staff estimates expenses will be $8,049,700.

The Retail Capital Fund started fiscal year 2021-22 with greater reserves than anticipated, due to projects being delayed from the prior year. That, combined with a higher than anticipated transfer of funds from the operating budget, higher than anticipated capital revenues, and the need to push some projects into next year, will result in an increase in the expected ending reserves from $9,169,197 to $18,792,435. These additional reserves will pay for projects that have been delayed and will assist in providing funding for future capital needs recently identified in the Retail Master Plan. A portion of the capital facility fees received will need to be reserved to pay for the projects that support the fee.

Year to date income statements by fund can be found in the General Manager's Monthly Report included in this meeting’s agenda packet.

![Groundwater Supply Wells, Potentially with ASR](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=Groundwater+Supply+Wells%2C+Potentially+with+ASR)

# RELIABLE OPTIONS FOR VARIOUS WELL LOCATIONS

## Groundwater Supply Wells, Potentially with ASR

1. **SJWD owned parcels adjacent to Wholesale Pipeline**
   - Increased operational needs for SJWD

2. **WCA owned wells with Wholesale agreements**
   - Citrus Heights Water District
   - Orangevale Water Company
   - Fair Oaks Water District
   - Use existing Infrastructure and WCA operations

3. **SSWD Partnership to install new wells and use CTP/Pump Back Station for supply and injection**
   - May be limited due to SSWD system need for new wells and scarce well sites

![SSWD Alternative](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=SSWD+Alternative)

- Develop Supply/ASR wells to be available for use in Wholesale system
  - 3-4 wells likely maximum that could be constructed for this purpose
- Limited land available in SSWD
- Utilize existing pump-back facility for supply
  - Designed for 10,000 gpm (14.4 MGD), expandable to 15,000 gpm
- SSWD indicates ASR only feasible with SJWD partnership

This memo provides a summary of the Board officers’ election process, including key dates and changes being implemented this year.

All candidates will also be listed on the ACWA website and invited to participate in a town hall style webinar in which members can ask the candidates questions.

Each member agency in good standing may vote in the election for President and Vice President. Member agencies must designate the agency’s one voting representative by submitting an Authorized Voting Representative Form to donnap@acwa.com by June 16. The form is available online.

ACWA will be using a web-based online voting system called Simply Voting, which will independently tabulate the votes and provide verified results in a timely manner while keeping individual votes confidential. Designating your agency’s voting representative is an important step to ensure the ballot is sent to the correct person.

**AGENDA ITEM V-4**

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Greg Zlotnick, Water Resources Manager  
**Date:** March 22, 2023  
**Subject:** Amendment to the 2023/2024 Water Transfer Agreement Between San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) and Authorization for the General Manager to enter into transfer agreements with SSWD for up to 6,000 AF/year  

**RECOMMENDED ACTION**  
(1) Approve proposed amendment to the 2023/2024 Water Transfer Agreement Between San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD) to Provide Surface Water Supplies to Enhance Groundwater Stabilization;  

(2) Authorize the General Manager to enter into water transfer agreements with SSWD for up to 6,000 AF/year when specified criteria are satisfied.  

**BACKGROUND**  
Item 1 --  
To optimize the utilization of San Juan Water District's (District) surface water supplies; generate revenue for the District’s wholesale enterprise; increase regional conjunctive use; enhance groundwater stabilization in Sacramento Suburban Water District's (SSWD) northern service area; and, contribute toward a favorable baseline for future District/SSWD groundwater substitution transfer opportunities, the Board previously approved an agreement, incorporating the same terms as prior agreements, adjusted to current rates, whereby the District will sell up to 4,000 acre-feet (AF) of surface water between March 1, 2023 and February 29, 2024.  

Subsequent to the Board’s action, and without prior indication of a need to do so, SSWD requested additional language be added to the agreement (a new Section 4 – see attached) explicitly stating that SSWD was under no obligation to purchase water. Staff is comfortable with this additional language as any sort of purchase obligation was never contemplated and the buyer/seller relationship was always considered to be based upon execution being mutually opportunistic and beneficial to both agencies. Moreover, the agreement has and continues to include language that allows the District to halt deliveries at any time should it deem any water being transferred to SSWD is no longer surplus to District needs.

**Amendment to 2023/2024 Water Transfer Agreement with SSWD and Authorization for General Manager to Enter Into Future Agreements**  
Greg Zlotnick  

There are no other requested changes to the agreement and in all other facets remains materially the same as prior year agreements, other than rates being updated.

**Item 2 --**  
Staff also requests that the Board authorize the General Manager to enter into such agreements with SSWD in the future, for up to 6,000 AF/year when the following criteria are satisfied:

(1) The General Manager informs the Board of the intent to enter into such an agreement as part of the General Manager’s report at a regular meeting of the Board prior to entering into the agreement;

(2) The transfer is determined by counsel to be categorically exempt from CEQA;

(3) Consistent with the Wholesale Contract, staff determines that the transfer water is surplus to the Wholesale Customer Agencies’ (WCA) demands, and informs the WCA’s of that determination at least one month before the transfer could begin. If any WCA protests, then the agreement will need to be brought to the Board for approval; and,

(4) After entering into such an agreement, staff will provide a copy of that Agreement to the Board as an information item in its next meeting packet.

![AGREEMENT BETWEEN SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT AND SACRAMENTO SUBURBAN WATER DISTRICT TO PROVIDE SURFACE WATER SUPPLIES TO ENHANCE GROUNDWATER STABILIZATION](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=AGREEMENT+BETWEEN+SAN+JUAN+WATER+DISTRICT+AND+SACRAMENTO+SUBURBAN+WATER+DISTRICT+TO+PROVIDE+SURFACE+WATER+SUPPLIES+TO+ENHANCE+GROUNDWATER+STABILIZATION)

This Agreement is entered into as of March 1, 2023, by and between San Juan Water District (“San Juan”), a public entity, and Sacramento Suburban Water District, a public entity (“SSWD”) (together, the “Parties”), to govern SSWD’s purchase of up to 4,000 acre-feet of San Juan surface water supplies, when surplus to the needs of San Juan’s Wholesale Customer Agencies (“WCAs”), from March, 2023 through February, 2024.

**RECITALS**

A. San Juan owns and operates facilities for (a) receiving water diverted from Folsom Reservoir, (b) treatment of water to meet health and safety standards for potable use, and (c) conveyance and delivery of treated water to its customers. San Juan's customers include: (a) its own retail water service customers in Placer and Sacramento Counties; and, (b) its WCAs, namely, the City of Folsom (Ashland area), Citrus Heights Water District, Fair Oaks Water District, and Orange Vale Water Company, in Sacramento County.

B. San Juan’s surface water supplies include Pre-1914 and Post-1914 water rights, a contract entitlement to water supplied by Placer County Water Agency (PCWA) for diversion from Folsom Reservoir, and a Central Valley Project Repayment Water Service Contract.

C. San Juan and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (“Reclamation”) entered into a Warren Act contract on February 26, 2021 providing for payment to Reclamation for delivery of San Juan’s PCWA water entitlement supplies to San Juan via Reclamation facilities at Folsom Reservoir.

D. SSWD is a public agency located in northern Sacramento County, authorized to acquire water entitlements to provide water service within its service area. SSWD currently provides water for potable use within its service area primarily from groundwater pumped from its South and North Service Areas, overlying separate groundwater sub-basins, which SSWD conjunctively manages to ensure water supply reliability and groundwater sustainability.

PAGE 1 OF 9  
2023 Agreement between San Juan Water District and Sacramento Suburban Water District to Provide Surface Water Supplies to Enhance Groundwater Stabilization
<!-- Page 52 -->
E. SSWD also has an entitlement contract for take-or-pay water supplies from PCWA, which are diverted from Folsom Reservoir by Reclamation to San Juan for water treatment and then delivered to SSWD. These supplies are only available to SSWD when the calculated unimpaired inflow to Folsom Reservoir is 1.6 million acre-feet or more in the delivery year.

F. On September 20, 2017, San Juan and SSWD entered into an AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT BETWEEN SAN JUAN WATER DISTRICT AND SACRAMENTO SUBURBAN WATER DISTRICT CONCERNING DIVERSION, TREATMENT AND CONVEYANCE OF WATER. That 2017 Agreement will govern the measurement, treatment and conveyance (via the Cooperative Transmission Pipeline (CTP) owned by San Juan and in which SSWD owns a portion of the capacity), and payment by SSWD to San Juan for treatment and conveyance, of the water San Juan will provide to SSWD pursuant to this Agreement.

G. All of SSWD’s payments for the water provided by San Juan to SSWD pursuant to this Agreement will be made by SSWD to San Juan under the same schedule as that paid for treatment and conveyance in accordance with the 2017 Agreement identified in Recital E above.

H. SSWD has installed a pipeline to convey treated surface water from the terminus of the CTP to its North Service Area to enable SSWD to better conjunctively manage, conserve and utilize its groundwater resources.

I. San Juan has determined, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, it will be able to deliver up to 4,000 acre-feet of its water right water, surplus to the needs of its WCAs, to SSWD for the purpose of enhancing conjunctive management of the groundwater basin underlying its North Service Area, during the period of March 1, 2023 through February 29, 2024, as provided for in this Agreement.

J. San Juan is willing to deliver to SSWD, and SSWD is willing to pay San Juan for, water treated and delivered by San Juan under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

3. **Limitation on Location of Use.** SSWD may only distribute the water purchased from San Juan pursuant to this Agreement to retail customers within its authorized service area, and under no circumstance may SSWD deliver or sell this water outside of its authorized service area.

4. **No Obligation to Purchase.** The parties do not intend this Agreement to be a take or pay contract or to otherwise obligate SSWD to purchase any water from SJWD. Any purchases of water up to the 4,000 acre-feet SJWD has offered to make available shall be at SSWD’s sole discretion.

5. **Water Shortage Provisions.**

   (a) Deliveries to SSWD shall be subject to reduction or elimination should San Juan notify SSWD that San Juan has determined that it must take such action to ensure the availability of sufficient water supplies to meet the needs of its WCAs or other commitments with priority over continued deliveries to SSWD. Such notification shall be provided at the earliest date feasible.

   (b) San Juan may temporarily discontinue or reduce the amount of water delivered to SSWD for the purpose of maintaining, repairing, replacing, investigating or inspecting any of the facilities necessary for the storage or furnishing of water to SSWD.

# AGENDA ITEM V-5

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** March 22, 2023  
**Subject:** Legislation  

## RECOMMENDED ACTION  
Discussion of various bills  

## BACKGROUND  

**AB 460 – Oppose**  
This bill would grant the State Water Resources Control Board new and sweeping authority to issue interim relief orders against water diverters and users. Additionally, these orders could be issued without holding a hearing in which water right holders could defend their actions. The bill would also authorize the State Water Board to enforce the orders by imposing onerous and costly requirements on water users. This could include curtailing diversions, imposing new minimum streamflow requirements, directing reservoir operations, requiring the diverter to conduct technical studies, and more. ACWA is taking an Oppose position and RWA plans to take an Oppose Unless Amended position.

**AB 1337 – Oppose**  
This bill would authorize the State Water Board to adopt wide-ranging regulations and enforce them through curtailing diversions or use of water under any claim of right. The bill would not require the State Water Board to hold a hearing before issuing curtailments. This bill would strip water right holders of their constitutional due process guarantees and create significant uncertainty for communities and industries that depend on a reliable supply of water that California’s existing water rights system ensures. ACWA and RWA oppose the bill.

**AB 1527 – Oppose Unless Amended**  
This bill would prohibit the use of potable water on non-functional turf, via a program to be enforced by the State Water Resources Control Board. It would mandate that water agencies adopt regulations to implement this prohibition and report information to the Water Board about the location of such turf and compliance by owners with the prohibition. ACWA proposes amendments to delete multi-family residences from the list of locations, and to delete the responsibility of local agencies to enforce and report on the program (leaving it to the Water Board, per their current regulatory program). RWA proposes taking a similar Oppose Unless Amended position.
<!-- Page 61 -->
Staff Report – Legislation  
March 22, 2023  

**SB 366 – Support**  
SB 366 is the vehicle that water agencies involved in Solve the Water Crisis have developed, in conjunction with Senator Caballero (the author), to establish a statewide goal of an additional 15 million acre-feet of water supply and storage improvements by 2050 (with an interim goal of 10 MAF by 2040), to address the impacts of climate change. The bill will make the California Water Plan an actionable strategic plan, with the State Administration being required to report regularly to the Legislature on the status of achievement of the goal. It also will include a financial plan element, to ensure that the funding that is necessary to meet the goal is identified and secured (including federal and state funds to augment the investments that continue to be made by water agencies.)

**SB 389 – Oppose**  
This bill would authorize the State Water Board to investigate and determine the scope and validity of any water right claim. In any proceeding to evaluate the basis of a water right, the water right holder would have the burden of proving the basis of the right. ACWA has serious concerns with authorizing the State Water Board to drag water right holders before the Board to prove their claims. ACWA opposes the bill and RWA proposes an Oppose Unless Amended position.

# AGENDA ITEM V-6

## STAFF REPORT

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Paul Helliker, General Manager  
**Date:** March 22, 2023  
**Subject:** Potential Rebate to Retail Customer Accounts  

---

### RECOMMENDED ACTION
Consider a rebate to retail customer accounts. This item was also discussed by the Finance Committee on March 14, 2023.

### BACKGROUND
At the February 22 Board of Directors meeting, Director Zamorano requested that an item be added to the March 22 agenda for the Board to consider providing a rebate to retail customer accounts. Director Zamorano suggested that such a rebate could use savings in operating costs as the source of funds.

One of the goals of the retail financial plan adopted in 2022 was to minimize the amount of debt issued to pay for capital projects. When revenues are greater than anticipated, and/or expenses lower than anticipated, the unused financial balance is deposited in the District’s reserve accounts, which can then be used to reduce future debt issuances. Providing a rebate to retail customers would impinge on this use of reserves to pay for capital projects. Providing rebates might also confuse customers, given the rate increases that have been implemented every year, the necessity for which was described in detail in the retail financial plan.

The mid-year budget analysis for retail operations indicates that revenues are expected to come in approximately $183,000 greater than anticipated and expenses are estimated to be $136,300 less than budgeted. A contributor to the additional revenues is the wholesale groundwater substitution transfer.

The protocol that the District established for managing the revenues from the transfer included modifying the normal procedure for the annual adjustment to the quarterly service charges that are assessed on each Wholesale Customer Agency, to allow for a reduction in the service charges for Fair Oaks Water District and Citrus Heights Water District. To avoid imposing those costs to Folsom, Orangevale and San Juan’s Retail division, the District agreed to use some of the revenues from the transfer to reimburse these agencies for the expected shift in quarterly charges. This reimbursement to San Juan Retail could be used as a source of funds for any rebate that the Board might decide to provide to make retail customer accounts. While this reimbursement to San Juan Retail has not yet been calculated, the projection is that it will be approximately $100,000. This revenue was not included in the original retail operating budget, and this is one of the reasons that revenues are expected to be greater than anticipated this year. Such a rebate has never been provided to retail accounts, and staff does not recommend that surplus revenues be used in such a manner, but as a one-time expense, it could be accommodated in the current fiscal year.

## Conclusion:
Monthly deliveries continued their trend of being less than anticipated, but the gains in the first part of the fiscal year continue to offset those declines, yielding deliveries that are .9% greater than anticipated to year to date. The main drivers of the negative variance continue to be Citrus Heights Water District and the Fair Oaks Water District, both taking less than anticipated in the budget. This was offset by the year to date sale of water to SSWD being much higher than anticipated and the water transfer being greater than projected in the budget. The budget did not anticipate the sale of water to SSWD to commence until November, but it actually has been happening all year. The positive variance in deliveries results in revenues being 10% greater than expected for this time of year. Excluding SSWD and the water transfer, deliveries were 1,261 acre feet less than the same time period last year, a 6.2% decline. The budget anticipated a year over year decline of 7.25%.

# ACWA UPDATE ON PRIORITY ISSUES
A high-level look at recent ACWA activity and initiatives.

## AGENDA ITEM VII-3

### MARCH 2023

#### SB 867 (Allen) – Drought and Water Resilience Bond
SB 867 would place a drought and water resilience bond on a future California statewide ballot to fund infrastructure investments in water and drought, wildfire and forest resilience, coastal resilience, and other natural resources issues. ACWA is urging members to support SB 867 (Allen) if it is appropriately amended to include ACWA’s infrastructure priorities. ACWA is advocating for a $7.85 billion bond investment in water infrastructure that focuses on a number of critical water issues including, recycled water, groundwater recharge and storage, flood protection, dam safety, conveyance, storage, safe drinking water, regional watershed resilience, State Water Project improvements, and water conservation. SB 867 will be heard by the Senate Natural Resources and Water Committee on March 28. ACWA is asking members to sign on to the ACWA-led SB 867 support-if-amended coalition letter and contact your local legislators before the bill is heard on March 28. More information is available in an Alert that was distributed to members March 9 at [acwa.com/notifications](http://acwa.com/notifications).

#### Water Rights
ACWA continues to work closely with its water rights work group and State Legislative Committee to advocate against water rights legislation that is seeking to fundamentally change the way California’s water rights system is implemented. Bills that have been introduced this year include AB 460 by Assembly Member Rebecca Bauer-Kahan (D-Orinda) which would grant the State Water Resources Control Board new and sweeping authority to issue interim relief orders against water diverters and users, AB 1337 by Assembly Member Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland) which would authorize the State Water Board to adopt wide-ranging regulations and enforce them through orders curtailing the diversion or use of water under any claim of right and SB 389 by Senator Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica) which would authorize the State Water Board to investigate and determine the scope and validity of any water right claim. ACWA’s State Legislative Committee voted to oppose these bills at a special meeting held March 9. ACWA distributed an Alert March 14 urging members to join a coalition to oppose all three bills. The Alert is available at [acwa.com/notifications](http://acwa.com/notifications).

#### SB 23 (Caballero) – Streamlining Permitting of Critical Water Projects
ACWA-sponsored SB 23 would improve and streamline the regulatory permitting process, while preserving established environmental protections, so that critical infrastructure projects are built at the pace and scale needed to prepare for climate change. ACWA distributed an Alert Feb. 13 asking members to join a coalition in support of the bill. The bill is expected to be heard April 11 in the Senate Natural Resources and Water Committee. More information on how SB 23 would streamline the regulatory permitting process of water supply and flood risk reduction projects can be found in a fact sheet available at [acwa.com/resources](http://acwa.com/resources). The ACWA Alert is available at [acwa.com/notifications](http://acwa.com/notifications).

#### AB 1572 (Friedman) – Potable Water: Nonfunctional Turf
AB 1572 by Assembly Member Laura Friedman (D-Glendale) would define nonfunctional turf, prohibit the use of potable water for the irrigation of nonfunctional turf, and create a program within the State Water Board for regulation of the prohibition. ACWA’s State Legislative Committee took an oppose-unless-amended position on the bill at its March 3 meeting and ACWA’s turf work group is currently working on proposed amendments.

![Water Supply Allocations](https://acwa.com/newsroom)

**Water Supply Allocations**  
The Department of Water Resources (DWR) on Feb. 22 announced that it now expects to deliver 35% of requested water supplies in 2023, up 5% since the January announcement. The allocation increases takes into account snowpack and reservoir storage from recent storms, current hydrology conditions, spring runoff forecasts, and an anticipation of dry times ahead. More information is available in a news article at [acwa.com/newsroom](https://acwa.com/newsroom).

The Bureau of Reclamation also announced initial 2023 water supply allocations on Feb. 22 for Central Valley Project water users. The allocations are based on an estimate of water available for delivery to CVP water users and reflect current reservoir storage, precipitation and snowpack in the Sierra Nevada. More information is available in a news article at [acwa.com/newsroom](https://acwa.com/newsroom).

**Drought and Conservation Reporting Order**  
The State Water Board this year issued a “Drought & Conservation Technical Reporting Order” that requires all water systems, including those operated by urban water suppliers, to report monthly information on sources, supply and demand, supply augmentation and demand reduction actions on a quarterly basis. The report covering January, February and March will be due April 30 and must be submitted using the new web-based reporting tool, SAFER Clearinghouse. The complete submission of monthly reports in 2023 will satisfy the Electronic Annual Report’s supply and demand reporting, which is collected in 2024. The State Water Board will be hosting a series of virtual question-and-answer sessions over the next few months with the next meeting being help March 27. More information and registration links to the sessions are available on the State Water Board's website at [waterboards.ca.gov](https://waterboards.ca.gov).

**Final WOTUS Rule**  
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers on Jan. 18 published a final rule revising the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS). The new rule will become effective this month on March 20. The final rule applies federal protections to wetlands and tributaries, territorial seas, interstate waters, as well as upstream resources that significantly affect those waters. Adjacent wetlands could receive protection if they meet either the “relatively permanent” or “significant nexus” tests set forth in the U.S. Supreme Court case Rapanos v. United States. More details on the final rule, including a fact sheet can be found on EPA’s at [epa.gov](https://epa.gov).

**Clean Fleets Rule**  
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) estimates that the final draft of the Advanced Clean Fleets (ACF) regulation will be released this month. CARB also intends to adopt the ACF this Spring 2023 at an upcoming CARB Board Meeting. The regulation would require California fleet owners and operators to start purchasing zero-emission vehicles in 2024, with the goal to move California’s medium- and heavy-duty trucks to zero emission, where feasible, by 2045.

**ACWA Elections**  
ACWA has launched two separate but concurrent election processes for the 2024-’25 term: the Board officers’ election for President and Vice President and the region board elections. As a result of bylaw changes approved by the membership in 2022, the way in which ACWA members elect the President and Vice President has changed. In addition, some of the region election deadlines have changed. The biggest change to the Board officers’ election process is that voting will no longer take place during conference. Instead, voting will take place electronically July 17 – Sept. 15 and ballots will include all qualified candidates. More information on the changes, how to vote and how to become a candidate is available at [acwa.com/elections](https://acwa.com/elections).

# AGENDA ITEM VIII-1  
**DRAFT**  
**Engineering Committee Meeting Minutes**  
**San Juan Water District**  
**March 13, 2023**  
**10:00 a.m.**  

**Committee Members:**  
Dan Rich, Chair  
Ken Miller, Member  

**District Staff:**  
Paul Helliker, General Manager  
Tony Barela, Operations Manager  
Andrew Pierson, Engineering Services Manager  
Greg Zlotnick, Water Resources Manager  
Teri Grant, Board Secretary/Administrative Assistant  

**Members of the Public:**  
Jeff Lawrence, Water Systems Consulting  
Robert Mowat, HDR  
Dan York, Sacramento Suburban Water District  
BH  

**Topics:**  
- CARB – Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation (W & R)  
- Groundwater Banking (W & R)  
- Wholesale Master Plan Update (W)  
- Other Engineering Matters  
- Public Comment  

At the request of GM Helliker, the Chair moved agenda items 2 and 3 before agenda item 1; however, the meeting minutes will remain in the original order.  

1. **CARB – Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation (W & R)**  
Mr. Barela conducted a presentation that will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained that to meet the California Air Resources Board (CARB) Advanced Clean Fleets Regulation, after 2024, 50% of new vehicle purchases will need to be zero emission vehicles and after 2027, 100% of new purchases will have to be zero emission vehicles. He reviewed the Project Purpose, Existing Conditions, Industry Review, Energy Modeling, Financial Requirements, Implementation Strategies, and Site Improvements.  

Mr. Barela informed the committee that there are a few implementation options that are being considered. He explained that the options will need to be coordinated with the planning of the new Administration Building so that the charging stations are located appropriately. In addition, he explained that staff is recommending replacing three vehicles sooner than planned (FY 23/24) in order to have them prior to the regulation implementation date. This allows the District time to delay implementation of the fleet electrification until 2030. Delaying the implementation allows the industry to advance and for costs to stabilize.  

2. **Groundwater Banking (W & R)**  
GM Helliker provided a written staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained that staff has been meeting with multiple agencies to discuss groundwater banking and possible partnerships. He informed the committee that the most promising
<!-- Page 100 -->
![Engineering Committee Meeting Minutes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Engineering+Committee+Meeting+Minutes+March+13%2C+2023+Page+2)

partnership is probably with Sacramento Suburban Water District (SSWD). He explained that there are three different preliminary scenarios:
1. Invest directly in a well and be a joint owner
2. Invest in a facility(ies) with an agreement with the owner for capacity
3. No specific capacity at any wells, but pay for water supply to be delivered

GM Helliker commented that each scenario would have to be looked at closer and more details would need to be worked out. Mr. Dan York, SSWD General Manager, informed the committee that the concept was presented to their Facility & Operations Committee and was well received. In addition, Mr. York commented that SSWD is working under contract with Kirby Pumps for the next five years to repair and maintain their existing wells and there is a clause in the contract for SSWD to purchase Kirby Pumps after three years.

GM Helliker reported that SJWD has conducted surface water transfers to SJWD in the past. By investing in groundwater production facilities, it will provide SJWD with backup supplies in severe droughts and will help establish capacity for groundwater substitution transfers, both for the Voluntary Agreement and at market rates. In response to Director Rich’s question, GM Helliker and Mr. York explained that SSWD’s is planning production capacity adequate to meet a level of demand of 15% above maximum peak, with San Juan’s investment adding capacity beyond this level.

GM Helliker informed the committee that the RWA Subscription Program has been working to augment existing banking operations, to allow CVP water to be banked outside of the District’s service area. He explained that the wholesale area will need to establish a groundwater banking protocol. In addition, he explained that RWA is completing the environmental work necessary for Reclamation to be able to federally acknowledge the groundwater bank, to allow this augmentation of banking CVP water. Mr. York informed the committee that 4 new wells are planned to be constructed in the next 2-3 years, some existing wells will get back online and more new wells are planned to be completed in 6-7 years. GM Helliker informed the committee that the Board will be updated at the March Board meeting.

3. Wholesale Master Plan Update (W)  
Mr. Pierson informed the committee that the last Wholesale Master Plan update was completed in 2001 with a minor update in 2007. He introduced Mr. Jeff Lawrence who conducted a presentation that will be attached to the meeting minutes. Mr. Lawrence reviewed the Master Plan Objectives, Supply & Demand data, Supply Reliability Options, Cost Summaries, Groundwater Supply Well Options, Water Treatment Plan Assessment and a Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Summary.

The committee discussed the options for reservoir storage and groundwater wells, drought issues with regard to pumping water from Folsom Dam, and some of the projects in the CIP. Mr. Pierson informed the committee that he will be presenting the information to the full Board at the March meeting.

1. **Review General Manager Reimbursements (W & R)**  
   The committee reviewed the February credit card charges for the General Manager and found them to be in order and there was no reimbursement request from the General Manager.

2. **Review Check Register from February 2023 (W & R)**  
   The committee reviewed the February 2023 check register and found them to be in order.

3. **Potential Rebate to Retail Customers (R)**  
   GM Helliker provided a staff report which will be attached to the meeting minutes. He explained that Director Zamorano suggested at the last Board meeting that a rebate be given to retail customers. GM Helliker stated that the funds would come from revenue received from the water transfer and not from savings on the reduced COLA.

   GM Helliker informed the committee, and Ms. Silva agreed, that staff is not recommending issuing a rebate since it would be confusing to customers who receive a rebate then receive a rate increase as projected in the retail financial plan.

   Director Costa stated that should the Board approve a rebate, then he would hope that it would not use funds from the working capital but instead from the proceeds of the water transfer and that he would not want individual checks to be issued but instead a credit applied to the customer’s account. Mr. Barrett confirmed that a credit could easily be applied.

   Director Miller voiced concern that issuing a rebate could set a precedent that savings from projects or extra revenue would generate a customer rebate each time. Ms. Silva commented that every year there will be variances from the budget versus the actual expenditures and provided some examples. She stated that as long as there are...

approved rate increases and planned debt issuances there are not surplus funds on hand. The committee requested that the Board be provided a list of the upcoming retail projects and debt at the March Board meeting.

4. Other Finance Matters (W & R)  
Director Costa informed the committee that the Sacramento Area Sewer District spends about $12 million per year on chlorine and is considering producing their own supply. He suggested that staff contact them to discuss possible opportunities.

Ms. Silva informed the committee that the District did not have any investments in the banks that recently failed.

5. Public Comment  
There were no public comments.

The meeting was adjourned at 4:22 p.m.
