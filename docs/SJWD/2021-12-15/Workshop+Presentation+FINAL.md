# Retail Master Plan

**Purpose:** Evaluate existing & future distribution system & water demands to determine any improvements required to meet the needs of existing & future customers.

**Results:** Capital Improvements needed in the following categories:
- Transmission & Main Pipelines
- Service Lateral replacements
- Valve Replacements
- Water Storage

**Additional Needs:** Identified outside of the Retail Master Plan
- Meter Replacement Program: originally installed starting back in 1997. With a life of 20-25 years it is time to start replacing aged meters
- Groundwater Production Facility (well)

# Service Laterals

- A “service lateral” is the pipeline that runs from the main line, in or next to the road, to your water meter.

- Failure rate is 35% worse than national average.

- Currently 25 more service line failures than the last six years at this time, which is a new failure record.

- Plan is to replace approximately 85 services per year.

- Annual cost $1.4m to $2m.

![Air Release Valves](https://www.sanjuanwater.com)

# Air Release Valves

- Allows air to enter or leave pipelines as needed
  - Removing air pockets allows water to flow more freely
  - Allowing air to enter if there is a leak or break prevents the creation of a vacuum, which can cause a pipeline to collapse

- California law requires vent opening to be above grade, to minimize opportunities for contamination.

- Most of the District’s valves are in boxes in the street, below grade.

- Apx. 750 valves need to be relocated to the side of the road & vented above ground.

- Cost: $20 million over 20 years (replaces 45 per year)

---

§64576. Air-Release, Air Vacuum, and Combination Valves.  
Each new air-release, air vacuum, or combination valve, and any such valve installed to replace an existing valve shall be:  
(a) Installed such that its vent opening is above grade, above the calculated 100-year flood water level, and, if recorded data are available, above the highest recorded water level;  
(b) Readily accessible for inspection, maintenance and replacement;  
(c) Constructed and designed to prevent exposure to rainwater or runoff, vandalism, and birds, insects, rodents, or other animals;  
(d) Fitted with a downward-facing screened vent or a domed and screened cap; and  
(e) Installed pursuant to American Water Works Association Standard C512-04 and Manual M51 (2001), which are hereby incorporated by reference.

# Water Storage

## Kokila Reservoir Replacement:
- 4.56 million gallon lined & covered earthen reservoir
- Serves as an operational & emergency storage facility
- Installed in 1984 & expected to last 25 years – good maintenance has extended its life but it now needs to be replaced.
- $9.565 million
- Debt financed

![Meter Replacement Program](https://www.sanjuanwater.com/images/logo.png)

## Meter Replacement Program

### Current Meter Stock:
- Originally installed between 1997 & 2004
- Age: apx. 4,400 meters > 18 years old
- Typical meter life: 20-25 years
- Current meters:
  - Total 10,779
  - Manual read meters: 736
  - Touch read meters: 7,987
  - Radio read meters: 2,056

### The Plan:
- Replace 5% of meters each year (515) 20 year cycle
- Replace all end-points over 5 years (2,118 per year)
- Cost $3.2 million over next 5 years, then apx. $250,000 per year
