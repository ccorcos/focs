## SACRAMENTO COUNTY READS BOARD LITERACY RESOLUTION  

### RESOLUTION NO. 24-18  

WHEREAS, the Sacramento County Board of Education is committed to ensuring that all youth in the region are fully literate when they graduate from high school and are able to fully participate in their community and our democracy;  

WHEREAS, the Board recognizes that literacy levels profoundly influence socioeconomic and health outcomes, with a direct correlation between low literacy and unemployment, part-time employment, and higher incarceration rates;  

WHEREAS, the statewide assessment results for Sacramento County show a dire need for literacy improvement in the region. A significant portion of Sacramentoâ€™s students are below proficient reading levels, and there are significant inequities in reading performance between student groups, particularly impacting foster youth, homeless, African American, English learners, and students with disabilities;  

WHEREAS, the Board supports evidence-aligned reading instruction and coherent systems of support, grounded in the science of reading, which is proven to significantly enhance reading and literacy skills.  

WHEREAS, research has shown that struggling readers, including those at risk for, or with, dyslexia, whose needs are identified early using universal screening are less likely to need intensive support in later grades;  

WHEREAS, the Sacramento County Office of Education has statewide expertise in improving literacy outcomes utilizing these concepts. With its Sacramento County READS partners, it has developed Guiding Principles to be implemented in their entirety. Specifically, the Guiding Principles call for:  

1. Designing educational systems where science of reading practices thrive from early learning through adult education.  
2. Ensuring equitable access to high-quality instructional materials and practices for every learner, inclusive of all languages, backgrounds and disabilities.  
3. Promoting linguistic and cultural diversity in reading and literacy education.  
4. Allocating resources to support implementation of science of reading aligned practices.  
5. Developing and empowering literacy leaders at all levels of the organization through ongoing professional development and coaching.  
6. Utilizing comprehensive literacy assessment systems, including universal screening, to inform instruction.  
7. Addressing individual student needs through Multi-Tiered Systems of Support, using data-based decision making and continuous improvement.

1. Recognizes that implementing Sacramento County READ's Guiding Principles will improve literacy outcomes in the Sacramento region if they are implemented with fidelity.

2. Commits to supporting community literacy initiatives, especially those that promote family engagement, to foster a culture of literacy and lifelong learning in Sacramento County;  
3. Resolves to actively support partnerships in service of literacy initiatives aligned with the Guiding Principles in order to achieve equitable literacy outcomes for all children and youth across Sacramento County.
