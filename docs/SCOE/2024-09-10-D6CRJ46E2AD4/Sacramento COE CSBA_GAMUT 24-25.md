Dear Superintendent and Board President of Sacramento COE:

Please find your enclosed invoice for Sacramento COE’s 2024–25 CSBA membership dues. We greatly appreciate your membership in CSBA and the difference it makes for California’s public schools, and we look forward to our continued partnership. This mailing contains:

**Invoice for your 2024-25 CSBA membership dues:**

Your membership in CSBA allows you to take advantage of a host of CSBA’s optional subscription services.

**Invoice(s) for optional subscription services, as listed below:**

- **Educational Legal Alliance (ELA)** offer of membership, included on your membership invoice ([csba.org/ela](http://csba.org/ela)).
- **GAMUT** subscription renewal (Policy, Policy Plus and/or Meetings, as applicable, for current subscribers).

**Important note:** As part of CSBA’s commitment to providing custom supports and services that best meet the unique and critically important needs of county boards, CSBA’s new County Board Member Services (CBMS) is now included with your CSBA dues. In previous years, your county office was billed for similar services provided by CCBE – this suite of services now operates under the banner of CSBA’s County Board Member Services (CBMS). As part of the transition for 2024-25, we have applied a **25 percent reduction** to your CBMS dues from the previous year’s CCBE dues, which is reflected in your enclosed membership invoice. Your CBMS dues go towards the funding of a full-time staff member to support county board members and county board services, as has been requested by the prior leadership of CCBE. For additional information on CSBA’s County Board Member Services, please visit [www.csba.org/countyboardmemberservices](http://www.csba.org/countyboardmemberservices).

2024-25 CSBA membership: $12318  
Prior CCBE dues: $5560  
25% reduction applied: $(1390)  
2024-25 total CSBA & CBMS dues: $16488  

For any questions about your membership benefits, CSBA’s Director of Membership, Aaron Davis, can be reached at (916) 669-3274 or adavis@csba.org.

CSBA is your association, and we encourage you to contact us any time regarding your membership needs. Thank you for your membership in CSBA and for all that you do to ensure a quality education for every student you serve.

Sincerely,

Albert Gonzalez  
CSBA President
