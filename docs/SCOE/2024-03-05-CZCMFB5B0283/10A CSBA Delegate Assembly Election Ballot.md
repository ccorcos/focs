### Why are you interested in becoming a Delegate? 
Please describe the skills and experiences you would bring to the Delegate Assembly.  
I believe that the Delegate Assembly brings a strong voice to public policy. As a grassroots community leader, it is important to have a balanced approach to ensuring that our policies are aligned with the needs of schools and also practical.

### Please describe your activities and involvement on your local board, community, and/or CSBA.  
I have spent many decades working and serving in the Del Paso Heights community. I have served as secretary on the Grant Little League. I have served two terms as a cheerleader coach to many students at Grant Union High School. I have served on the UCAN Board helping to promote students going to college. I have also volunteered for over 20 years at the TLC Soup Kitchen helping to feed the community. I have helped to form the Del Paso Heights Community Association. I have served along as a volunteer chaplain at Folsom State Prison for two years.

### What do you see as the biggest challenge facing governing boards and how can CSBA help address it?  
I believe the achievement gap is the biggest challenge facing governance boards and CSBA can address by providing and promoting learning opportunities on how boards can address this in a practical way.

<!-- Page 6 -->
11. Why are you interested in becoming a Delegate? Please describe the skills and experiences you would bring to the Delegate Assembly. *

I am in my 12th year as a member of the Robla ESD School Board, and have 25 years of experience in career services at the University of California, Davis. That means I have experience in preparing children for college, helping them successfully navigate a top-ranked university, and entering the next chapter of their lives as they graduate and join the workforce. That perspective, and the experience associated with it, should be represented in the Delegate Assembly.

The skills I bring are program analytics, detailed knowledge of the job market and what it takes for people to successfully enter it, program evaluation, and key involvement in DEI topics that enrich districts. I also bring an awareness and experience in how to achieve goals when facing challenges, whether they are financial, structural, or curricular. I have led programs from creation to fruition, and have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to be innovative, develop ideas, and see them through to completion and assessment.

12. Please describe your activities and involvement on your local board, community, and/or CSBA. *

I have been an active member of my school board for 11 years, and have held the roles of President, Vice President (currently), and Clerk. I have also been active on other boards such as the Sacramento Area Bicycle Advocates (SABA). Before joining the Robla School Board I was an active member of Site Council, and actively participated in endorsing and supporting local political candidates.

I have also participated in numerous educational conferences that enhance my KSAs in serving my district's and state's diverse student population.

13. What do you see as the biggest challenge facing governing boards and how can CSBA help address it? *

This is a tough question because there are several large challenges - including funding schools at necessary levels through the current state deficit, the politicalization of school boards, school safety, and the effects of COVID-19 on academic performance. I cannot pick one challenge because every corner of our state and many districts face severe and multiple challenges. If you want the single largest challenge, I would say it is providing the children of California with the resources they need to succeed in the face of budget deficits, a polarizing political environment, school safety, and the effects of COVID-19 - among other things.
