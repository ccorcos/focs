SCOE IN THE NEWS  
On January 18, SCOE held a press tour at Ethel I. Baker Elementary School to highlight how our clinician, in partnership with the school leadership, and the Sacramento County Department of Health Services, has helped transform their school into a Center of Wellness. Thank you, President Bina Lefkovitz for attending and for your support of the School-Based Mental Health and Wellness initiative. The Sacramento Bee has since published an article for local readers. We also published an article on our SCOE website that was included in the California County Superintendent’s statewide “Take 5” newsletter.  

On February 2, in partnership with the Language Academy of Sacramento, and the UC Davis Center for International Education, SCOE hosted a large delegation from Taiwan that included government leaders, officials from institutes of higher education, and 34 Fulbright elementary and middle school teachers. The government of Taiwan launched its Bilingual 2030 policy in 2021 to make all schools bilingual with English as the second language. The delegation and teachers asked to visit SCOE and our Language Academy of Sacramento to learn about the projects we are leading in multilingual education and to see a dual immersion program in action. Graciela Garcia-Torres was the main presenter and was joined by Brent Malicote, Amy Kraft, and Xanth Soriano for a Q&A that covered biliteracy, multilingualism, the science of reading, and climate.

Yesterday, we joined Dr. Mary Ann Dewan, County Superintendent of Schools for the Santa Clara County Office of Education (SCCOE), to welcome more than 137 attendees to the kick-off webinar for the Children and Youth Behavioral Health Initiative School-Linked Partnership and Capacity Grant Program. We shared that as we have been tasked with administering this $400 million grant program, we are excited to serve with Santa Clara as technical assistance leads for districts and county offices of education throughout the state.

Our Sacramento County READS initiative, led by Channa Pitt, continues to build the capacity of teams of educators. Sixty educators attended our January Community of Practice led by Dr. Dale Webster and Brittany Cufaude from CORE Learning.
