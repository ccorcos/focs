![MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=MEMORANDUM+OF+UNDERSTANDING)

This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is made and entered into this ___ day of March 2020 by, between, and among the Sacramento County Board of Education (hereinafter "County Board"), Sacramento County Superintendent of Schools/Office of Education (hereinafter "SCOE"), and, The Rocklin Academy (hereinafter referred to as "TRA"). Hereinafter, the County Board, SCOE, and TRA shall be collectively referred to as "the Parties."

1. Purpose of Memorandum of Understanding

1.1. The State of California enacted the Charter Schools Act of 1992 (hereinafter "The Act") authorizing the formation of charter schools with the intent that the schools improve student learning through a variety of means, including increased learning opportunities, innovative teaching methods, performance-based accountability, and expanded choice for parents within the public school system. The Act authorizes the County Board to grant charter petitions under specified circumstances.

1.2. The County Board has conditionally approved a charter petition (hereinafter "the Charter") for TRA for the operation of the American River Collegiate Academy (hereinafter “the Charter School” or “ARCA”). Unless otherwise stated, for the purposes of this MOU, the terms Charter School and TRA may be used interchangeably, with the duties and responsibilities of the Charter School and TRA being the same under this Agreement.

1.3. TRA is a California non-profit public benefit corporation which manages and operates the Charter School. TRA is responsible for the Charter School’s compliance with the terms of the Charter and with this MOU.

1.4. All Parties agree that no single party to this Agreement waives any of the rights, responsibilities, and privileges established by the Charter Schools Act of 1992 that may change from time to time during the term of this MOU.

1.5. To the extent permitted by applicable law, including California Education Code (Ed. Code) Section 47605.6(c), the County Board has, by agreement with the County Superintendent, delegated its obligations to oversee the Charter School, whether arising at law, by the terms of TRA's Charter, by this MOU, or from any other source, to the County Superintendent and SCOE; and in connection with the said delegation, the County Superintendent and SCOE shall report periodically to the County Board.

1.6. The fundamental interest of SCOE is, on a continuing basis, to be reasonably assured that TRA is: 1) implementing the provisions of the Charter and any material revisions as approved; 2) obeying all requirements of federal, state, and local law that apply to the Charter School; 3) operating prudently and soundly in all respects; and 4) providing a sound education for the Charter School's students; and 5) serving the interests of the community where the Charter School is proposing to operate.

1.7. The Parties recognize that there are many matters related to the operation of the Charter School and the effective oversight of TRA, which go beyond the provisions included in TRA's Charter or need further clarification. SCOE also acknowledges that the operation of the Charter School is to be solely carried out by TRA. This MOU is intended to address those matters that have not been covered in the Charter or that require clarification or elaboration, and to provide guidance on the oversight policies and procedures of SCOE. Further, this MOU is intended to outline the Parties’ agreements governing their respective fiscal and administrative responsibilities and their legal relationships.

1.8. The Parties recognize and agree that TRA shall not charge tuition, shall be nonsectarian, and shall be open to all students regardless of ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other characteristic contained in California Ed. Code § 220, and those provisions of non-discrimination shall also apply to employment.

2. Term of the Memorandum of Understanding

2.1. This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), provided it is fully executed by all Parties, shall cover the term of the Charter five (5) years commencing on July 1, 2020, and ending on June 30, 2025 ("Term"). The "effective date" of the Charter is July 1, 2020. This MOU will automatically expire upon the expiration or revocation of the Charter.

2.2. The MOU is subject to early termination only as set forth in this MOU or as otherwise permitted by law. Renewal of the Charter and this MOU shall be based, in part, on compliance with the terms set forth in this Agreement, SCOE policy, and applicable law.

2.3. This MOU between and among the County Board, SCOE, and TRA shall include Schedules A, B, C, D, and E.

2.4. Any modification of this MOU must be made in accordance with Section 31: Amendment and Waiver.

3. Operation of Charter School

3.1. Charter School is a public charter school that shall be operated pursuant to the Charter, any approved material revisions to the charter, and any specific conditions approved. It shall be TRA’s duty and obligation, at its own expense and cost under the direction of the TRA Board of Directors to manage, operate, and administer the approved Charter School.

3.2 The Charter was conditionally approved by the County Board on February 4, 2020. The conditions under which the Charter was granted are enumerated in Schedule C to this MOU. Should the County Board determine that TRA has failed to comply with these conditions, the action granting the Charter shall be nullified and the Charter deemed not to have been granted.

3.3. Charter School is authorized to open with grades K through 2, and plans to open with approximately 144 pupils at the beginning of its operation in 2020-2021. Charter School may grow to serve grades K through 6, with projected enrollment of 468 students by the end of the Term, as set forth in the Charter. TRA will provide enrollment figures to SCOE by August 1 of each year. If the Charter School fails to meet its projected enrollment and the variance is ten (10) percent or greater, TRA will revise its budget to ensure financial solvency while implementing the educational program described in the Charter, or will delay opening by one year. If needed, TRA shall submit the revised budget reflecting current enrollment figures to SCOE within one day following the nearest TRA Board meeting following August 1.

3.4. The Parties acknowledge that the provisions of the Charter and this MOU are not intended to conflict. However, in the event of a conflict between the law and terms of this MOU, the law shall prevail, and any such conflicting terms shall be severed from this Agreement and nullified. To the extent that this MOU is inconsistent with any of the terms of the Charter, the terms of this MOU shall supersede the terms of the Charter, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Parties. The Parties further agree to jointly make any modification to this MOU or the Charter needed to effectuate changes in state or federal laws following the execution of this MOU.

3.5 Future review and extension of the Charter shall be based on compliance with the terms set forth in this MOU, the Charter, requirements of the Education Code, and any and all supporting regulations. SCOE or its charter oversight contractor shall review all materials submitted in accordance with County Board policy on charter schools, SCOE Administrative Rules and Regulations (ARRs) on charter schools and this MOU, and review the continued fiscal viability of TRA and its conformance with any annual audit issues. The oversight and monitoring of the Charter School shall be in accordance with the law, and as further described in this MOU. TRA and the Charter School shall comply with all of the requirements of County Board policies and SCOE ARRs, as applied to charter schools.

4. Governance and Management

4.1. The Charter School will operate consistent with California Ed. Code § 47604(a). TRA acknowledges, as is stated in its Charter, that it is a separate legal entity and neither the County Board nor SCOE are liable for the debts and obligations of TRA or the Charter School as per Ed. Code § 47604(c).

4.2. The Parties further recognize that consistent with the Charter, TRA has obtained and maintains status as a public benefit corporation as provided in California Ed. Code § 47604.

4.3. The County Board reserves the right to appoint a representative to the TRA Board of Directors in accordance with California Ed. Code § 47604 (b).

TRA shall ensure that the Charter School's facility is located in an area that is properly zoned for operation of a school and that has received a conditional use permit, and that has been cleared for student occupancy by all appropriate local authorities. All facilities must meet all applicable health and fire code requirements and zoning laws. TRA will furnish SCOE, as provided in Schedule A, with all local approvals (Ed. Code § 47610(d)), including applicable fire marshal clearances, certificates of occupancy, signed building permit inspections, and approved zoning variances. The Charter School cannot exempt itself from applicable local zoning or building code ordinances.

13.3. A pre-opening site visit will be conducted prior to opening any school facility to determine that the facility is clean, safe, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliant, has necessary local approvals, and meets other requirements.

Schedule D outlines the expectations for the condition of Charter School facilities and includes a checklist that will be used for site visits.

13.4.

The Parties acknowledge that material revision of the Charter may be necessary to align the LCAP with the Charter's Measureable Pupil Outcomes, and that results reported on the LCAP may be relied upon by the County Board in making decisions on material revisions, charter renewal, and replication of charter schools.

15.4. If the Charter School fails to meet state and federal performance standards and expectations or fails to improve pupil outcomes as specified in Education Code 47607.3, it will be required to prepare a Student Achievement Plan (Achievement Plan).

16.1. At all times during the Term of the Charter and this MOU, TRA shall act as its own local education agency (“LEA”) in a Special Education Local Planning Area (“SELPA”), or as a duly constituted SELPA approved by the State of California.

TRA shall provide its own properly credentialed and fully qualified coordinator for special education and shall be responsible for referrals, identification, assessments, IEPs and Section 504 team meetings, implementation of Section 504 Plans and IEPs, complaints, mediations, and due process hearings. TRA may contract with any school district or other qualified organization for the services on behalf of the Charter School, provided that such are at no cost to the County Board and/or SCOE. Written agreements shall be authorized to specify such services and costs. It is further recognized that TRA and/or the Charter School may contract with a SELPA, employ its own staff and/or contract with other vendors to deliver services required by the IEPs and/or Section 504 Plans of students enrolled in the Charter School and as otherwise required by applicable state and federal laws.

16.4. As specified in Schedule A, TRA shall provide special education revenue and expense schedules to SCOE as back-up to required regular financial reports. To the extent that the delivery of Section 504 and/or special education services and adherence to Section 504 and special education laws have costs in excess of revenue allocated to the Charter School for such purposes, TRA and the Charter School shall be responsible for any and all costs related to students of the Charter School.

16.5. TRA and the Charter School agree to fully and promptly comply with any reasonable requests for information made by SCOE with regard to special education services and individual students at the Charter School. SCOE may establish regular meetings with the TRA special education coordinator for purposes of reviewing special education and/or Section 504 compliance. SCOE may also take action to monitor the Charter School to ensure that special education and/or Section 504 services are being provided as required by law and applicable SELPA policy.

In addition to the general indemnification requirement, TRA shall hold harmless, defend, and indemnify the County Board, County Superintendent, SCOE, its officers, employees, volunteers, and agents from every liability, claim, demand, action, cause of action, suit, loss, expense, penalty, obligation, error, omission, including all legal fees and costs which actually or allegedly arise in any manner from TRA’s responsibility to provide special education services. In such cases, TRA at its own expense and risk shall defend, with counsel satisfactory to SCOE, all legal or other proceedings that may be brought against it and/or the County Board, County Superintendent, SCOE, its officers, employees, volunteers, and agents involving a student’s enrollment, services, and/or attendance at the Charter School, and satisfy any resulting judgments, including attorney fees and costs, up to the required amounts that may be rendered against any of them.

16.7. TRA acknowledges that its failure to provide any Section 504 and/or special education services for students as required in their Section 504 Plans and IEPs may constitute a material violation of the conditions, standards and procedures set forth in the Charter and this MOU, as well as violation of applicable law which may be sufficient to support the County Board's revocation of TRA's Charter pursuant to Ed. Code § 47607.

16.8. TRA shall develop, maintain, and implement policies and procedures to ensure that eligible students with disabilities are properly identified, assessed by qualified assessors and IEPs or 504 Plans for the students are properly established, implemented, and complied with such that a Free and Appropriate Public Education (“FAPE”) in the Least Restrictive Environment (“LRE”) is provided in accordance with state and federal law. Such policies shall, as specified in Schedule A, be provided to SCOE.

17. Independent Study  
17.1. The Charter School may offer families the opportunity to use short-term independent study contracts for students who receive prior approval for absences due to travel or for absences due to illness. Any such independent study will be limited to occasional, incidental instances of absences, and must be fully compliant with all independent study statutes and regulations applicable to charter schools.

17.2. If the Charter School provides instruction through independent study on more than an incidental basis, it shall comply with all requirements of statute applicable to independent study in charter schools, including Ed. Code § 51745, et seq., and applicable regulations.

18.3. In the event that the County Board seeks and receives a voter approved bond, parcel tax, etc., the Charter School and/or TRA shall have no entitlement to any portion of the funds unless otherwise negotiated in advance and agreed to in writing. The Parties shall meet sufficiently in advance of any action by SCOE to pursue such measures so as to advise TRA and to determine the positions of the Parties. TRA agrees that it and the Charter School have no entitlement to funds currently being received, if any, by the County Board and/or SCOE under former parcel tax or bond elections.

18.4. TRA is to operate the Charter School in a financially sound fashion. It is agreed that borrowing (as defined in Section 10) sought by TRA for the Charter School shall be authorized in writing by TRA, approved in advance by SCOE, and shall be the sole responsibility of TRA. Notification of borrowing shall be provided pursuant to Section 10 of this MOU. In no event shall the County Board and/or SCOE have any obligation for repayment of such borrowing. This provision shall not be interpreted to require TRA to seek advance approval from SCOE for borrowing sought by TRA to benefit other charter schools operated by TRA. TRA agrees that it will not enter into borrowing that causes TRA to arrive at or have a qualified or negative certification as that standard is defined for school districts pursuant to Education Code 42131, or that causes it to lack the ability to continue as a “going concern.”

18.5. SCOE shall not advance any funds to TRA for the Charter School. In addition, SCOE shall not act as or provide a line of credit to TRA for the Charter School.

18.6. The Parties agree that neither SCOE nor the County Board shall act as fiscal agent for TRA or the Charter School. It is agreed that TRA shall be solely responsible for all fiscal services for the Charter School such as payroll, purchasing, attendance reporting, and completion and submission of state budget forms. SCOE shall process and transfer to TRA all payments received by SCOE for the Charter School in a timely fashion.

18.7. To the extent that TRA wishes to contract with SCOE for any services to the Charter School beyond those specified in this agreement, a separate written contract with SCOE shall be required and the costs of such services paid in full by TRA.

18.8. TRA and the Charter School will use all revenue received from state and federal sources only for the educational services of TRA and the Charter School and for the benefit of the students enrolled and attending the Charter School. Sources of funding must be used in accordance with applicable state and federal statutes, and the terms or conditions, if any, of any grant or donation.

![American River Collegiate Academy](https://example.com/image.png)

18.9. TRA will develop and maintain internal fiscal management and control policies governing all fiscal activities. Such policies and procedures are required prior to opening the Charter School, as specified in Schedule A, and are subject to review during site visits to verify that they are being implemented.

18.10. TRA shall adopt and apply generally accepted accounting principles, as well as policies, to ensure the Charter School’s funds are used to most effectively support its mission, and to ensure that funds are budgeted, accounted for, expended, and maintained in an appropriate fashion. Such policies will include, but are not limited to, principles that ensure that:
- Expenditures are authorized by and in accord with amounts specified in the TRA Board of Directors’ adopted or revised budget.
- TRA funds are managed and held in a manner that provides a high degree of protection of the Charter School’s assets.
- All transactions are recorded and documented in an appropriate manner that allows reporting to the State as required by SCOE or the California Department of Education (CDE).

18.11. Where applicable, the Parties agree that prior to the Charter School commencing operations, the Charter School’s advance apportionment and any subsequent appointments will be retained by SCOE until all conditions approved by the County Board and all requirements of County Board Policy and SCOE ARRs have been met.

19. Attendance Reporting

19.1. TRA shall use commercially available attendance accounting software (such as PowerSchool, SASI, etc.) for student attendance accounting at the Charter School. TRA on behalf of the Charter School shall submit enrollment and attendance data as required to receive apportionment of funding according to the deadlines specified in Schedule A. SCOE staff will review and certify the accuracy of the Charter School’s attendance data submitted by TRA only when all documentation has been submitted and is accurate. Attendance data submitted without the requisite detail will not be processed and may result in a delay of funding to the Charter School.

19.2. TRA shall make available to SCOE on request all backup attendance documents. TRA shall submit monthly summary reports, due the 15th of every month, of enrollment and average daily attendance ("ADA").

19.3. Monthly site-based attendance sheets, signed and dated by teachers, and evidence of contact made with parents when students are absent from school, (e.g., parent contact log, absence log, etc.), shall be maintained by TRA, and may be reviewed by SCOE during site visitations.

20. Financial Reporting  
20.1. TRA is required by Ed. Code § 47604.33 to submit periodic financial reports of revenues, expenditures, and reserves. In order to meet statutory timelines for financial reporting, TRA shall submit such reports to SCOE for review, using the state software or the Charter School Alternative Reporting form. Specified backup information shall be consistently provided for each reporting period. Any significant changes in the budget or interim reports from one reporting period to the next must be explained in writing. Schedule E outlines the financial information that shall be reported to SCOE. SCOE may request additional information, as necessary, to evaluate the fiscal condition of the Charter School.  
20.2. The Parties agree that maintenance of a sufficient level of funding reserve is in the best interest of the Charter School and its successful operation. Accordingly, ARCA shall maintain unrestricted reserves of no less than five percent (5%) for the Charter School.  

21. Annual Audit  
21.1. TRA shall submit an annual independent financial audit in accordance with Ed. Code §§ 47605(m) and 41020(h), as applicable, to the State Controller's Office, SCOE, and the California Department of Education ("CDE") no later than December 15 of each year. In order for TRA to receive a favorable recommendation for renewal, corrective action plans shall have been implemented in a timely manner to the satisfaction of SCOE for any findings or exceptions identified in each annual audit, such that there are no continuing prior findings or deficiencies identified in the following year. The audit shall be conducted by an auditor from the list approved by the State Controller's Office. SCOE shall be notified of TRA's selection of an auditor by April 1.  
21.2. In addition to TRA's financial statements for the Charter School, the audit shall include, as applicable, but not be limited to, review of contemporaneous records of attendance and annual instructional minutes, and such other reviews as required by law for the audit of charter schools.  

22. Monitoring and Oversight  
22.1. SCOE will conduct at least one (1) visit to the Charter School annually in accordance with the Charter Schools Act. The information gathered will be used to assess the Charter School's progress in governance and organizational management, educational performance, fiscal operations, and fulfillment of the terms of the Charter and this MOU. A school site visit may include review of the facility, review of records maintained by TRA for the Charter School, interviews with the management of TRA, TRA employees working at the Charter School including the site principal, and the Charter School's students and parents, as well as observation of instruction in the classroom(s). Any deficiencies will be reviewed with the Charter School’s site principal and TRA staff and an opportunity provided for comment, explanation and/or correction. The evaluations for each year will be used, in addition to other information and reports, to determine a renewal decision to the extent allowed by law.
