# I. PROGRESS TOWARD MEETING CHARTER AND LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN (LCAP) GOALS

The American River Collegiate Academy (ARCA) is part of the Rocklin Academy Family of Schools (RAFOS), a California public charter school organization that was established in 2000 and serves 2,516 students in transitional kindergarten (TK) through twelfth grade. ARCA began serving students on August 13, 2020. During the 2023-2024 school year, ARCA operated a full-day traditional school schedule serving 105 students in transitional kindergarten (TK) through fourth grade with plans to expand one grade level per year until they are a full TK through sixth grade campus.

As reported in ARCA’s 2024-2025 Local Control and Accountability (LCAP) Engaging Educational Partners section, ARCA conducted LCAP and Budget Engagement Workshops during the months of November 2023, January 2024, and March 2024. The purpose was to engage educational partners in a collaborative assessment of student progress and achievement gaps, and a collective decision-making process to inform planning and budget allocation. Educational partners included parents/guardians, teachers, school staff, and administrators.

The process involved several key steps including a planning phase, workshops, and post-workshop actions. The planning phase prioritized the compilation of representative groups especially parents/guardians to ensure families of English learners, socioeconomically disadvantaged students, and students with disabilities were equitably represented during the workshops. During the planning phase, data was collected, analyzed, and prepared for presentation at the workshops including academic performance data, attendance rates, suspension rates, and other relevant metrics. To provide for effective partner engagement during the workshops, a survey was developed to gather input from all attendees about priorities, concerns, and suggestions for improving student outcomes and addressing achievement gaps.

The workshops prompted a strategic shift to prioritize interventions to address disparities and ensure equitable opportunities and outcomes for underperforming student groups so that all students succeed academically. The LCAP goal descriptions were modified to reflect this shift. ARCA’s 2024-2025 LCAP and budget were presented to and approved by the RAFOS Board of Directors on June 18, 2024.

## 2023-24 LCAP Goal 1
Rocklin Academy Family of Schools will maintain the high academic achievement levels of all students in ELA and math while increasing performance outcomes for underperforming student groups.

**Progress Toward Meeting LCAP Goal 1**

Goal 1 reflects ARCA’s commitment to maintain the academic achievement levels of their current high-performing students while supporting improvement for underperforming student groups. ARCA reports there are minimal or no achievement gaps for individual student groups compared to all students in reading and math based on internal assessment data. Until the 2023-2024 school year, student group comparisons based on public assessment data were not possible due to ARCA’s small student population. However, in the Spring of 2024, ARCA students in third and fourth grade took the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments in English language arts (ELA) and math, providing sufficient students overall and for the socioeconomically disadvantaged student group to report the data publicly. Overall, ARCA students performed higher in both ELA and math compared to all students in Sacramento County and comparison schools in the San Juan Unified School District. ARCA’s socioeconomically disadvantaged students also performed higher in both ELA and math compared to socioeconomically disadvantaged students in Sacramento County and comparison schools in the San Juan Unified School District as illustrated in Table 5 on page 5. ARCA’s commitment to maintaining high levels of student academic performance is evidenced in their performance on the 2024 statewide assessments in ELA and math.

ARCA lists 15 actions under LCAP Goal 1. The actions focus on the effective elements of an academic multi-tiered system of supports including universal screening of all students, tiered interventions with increasing levels of intensity based on need (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3), progress monitoring, data-driven decision making, evidence-based practices, and continuous opportunities for professional learning and team collaboration to support these elements. An emphasis on evidence-based practices for English language learners is highlighted in actions to provide daily designated and integrated English language development while prioritizing the needs of long-term English learners through Individual Learning Plans. The effective implementation of these actions was evidenced during school site visits which included campus and classroom observations at all grade levels and discussions with school and district leaders.

English language development (ELD) is supported by an English Learner Coordinator who ensures all English learner students are appropriately placed into a Structured English Immersion program and receive daily integrated and designated ELD instruction. ARCA monitors the progress of their English learners in ELA and math using their local assessments, the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA) Measures of Academic Progress (MAP). The spring 2024 MAP assessment results show the English Learner student group exceeded their projected growth targets in both reading and math as illustrated on page 8. Additionally, beginning in the 2023-2024 school year, ARCA’s English learner progress is reported publicly based on the English Learner Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) as illustrated on page 6. The ELPAC results show that 73% of ARCA’s English learners achieved well-developed or moderately-developed levels of English language proficiency in the 2023-2024 school year compared to 43% in Sacramento County.

# Student Progress Measured by State Assessments

The statewide California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) System includes federally required assessments in English language arts (ELA), math, and science. These assessments include the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments in ELA and math, and the California Science Test (CAST). The Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments are administered to students in grades 3-8 and grade 11. The CAST is administered to students in grades 5, 8, and once in high school. Students at ARCA were not yet eligible to participate in the CAST in the 2023-2024 school year. Their first year of participation will be the 2024-2025 school year.

## Student Progress in ELA and Math as Measured by State Assessments

The 2023-2024 results in ELA and math provide an overall level of performance for students in third and fourth grade and a disaggregated result for socioeconomically disadvantaged students at the school level. However, a comparison of 2022-2023 to 2023-2024 outcomes for the socioeconomically disadvantaged students is not available due to the low number of students (less than 11 students) in that group during the 2022-2023 school year. To date, no other student groups have a significant number of students to allow for disaggregation of public assessment data.

Tables 1 and 2 illustrate increases in overall student performance in ELA from 55% in 2022-2023 to 66% in 2023-2024 and in math from 45% to 69%. Tables 3 and 4 provide results by grade level. A comparison of the student cohort that was in third grade in 2022-2023 and then fourth grade in 2023-2024 also shows increases in both subject areas from 55% to 57% in ELA and from 45% to 50% in math.

In Table 5, a comparison of ARCA’s student academic performance in ELA and math is made to third and fourth grade students in eight elementary schools in the San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD) located in the City of Citrus Heights. The comparison to only third and fourth grade students shows the degree of consistency between the academic performance of ARCA students and the school community it serves. In addition to this comparison to third and fourth grade students attending elementary schools in the City of Citrus Heights, ARCA has included in their annual report, a comparison to all SJUSD elementary schools.  

**American River Collegiate Academy Charter School Annual Oversight Report**  
<!-- Page 6 -->
The comparison in Table 5 shows ARCA students are outperforming their peers in the City of Citrus Heights and at the state level in both ELA and math. Overall, 66% of ARCA students are meeting or exceeding standards in ELA compared to 32% in the comparison schools and 43% statewide. In the area of math, 69% of ARCA’s students met or exceeded standards compared to 31% at the comparison schools and 43% statewide. High levels of achievement are also true for the socioeconomically disadvantaged students attending ARCA. In 2023-2024, 55% of ARCA’s socioeconomically disadvantaged students met or exceeded standards in ELA compared to 28% at the comparison schools and 33% statewide, and 55% of ARCA’s socioeconomically disadvantaged students met or exceeded standards in math compared to 26% at the comparison schools and 33% statewide.

**English Learner Progress as Measured by State Assessments**

The 2023-2024 school year is the first year that English learner performance was made available to the public due to the low numbers of English learners attending ARCA in previous years. The results of English learner performance on the 2023-2024 Summative ELPAC provide the percentage of English learners scoring at each of the four levels of English language development. The results of the Summative ELPAC assessment are also used to calculate the California School Dashboard English Learner Progress Indicator (ELPI). Schools with at least 30 English learners with Summative ELPAC results in both the current and prior year receive an ELPI performance color. Schools are assigned an ELPI Status if they have at least 10 students with valid test scores from the current and prior year. Thirteen (13) English learners attended ARCA during the 2023-2024 school year. There were fewer than 10 English learners attending ARCA in the 2022-2023 school year. For this reason, ARCA will not receive an ELPI performance color or status on the 2024 California School Dashboard.

Until ARCA receives an ELPI performance color or status on the Dashboard, the results of the 2023-2024 Summative ELPAC assessment provide evidence of ARCA’s English learner achievement. ARCA English learners scored comparatively higher with 73% achieving well-developed or moderately-developed English language skills compared to 43% in Sacramento County and 48% statewide.

**English Learner 2023-24 Summative ELPAC Performance**

| Developed English Skills Level | ARCA | Sacramento County | State of California |
|-------------------------------|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Level 4: Well Developed       | 18%  | 13%               | 15%                 |

# Student Progress as Measured by Local Assessments

ARCA monitors the progress of all students through formal and informal assessment measures. The MAP assessments in reading and math provide an internal reliable measure of student academic progress. ARCA has used the MAP assessments since opening to monitor both student progress and to ensure students are performing at expected levels on the California Content Standards through predicted proficiency levels on the statewide assessments in ELA and math.

Based on the MAP assessments administered in the Spring of 2024 illustrated in Table 7, 76% of ARCA students in grades K-4 were predicted to meet or exceed grade-level standards in reading and 83% of ARCA students in grades K-4 were predicted to meet or exceed grade-level standards in math. The MAP assessment results illustrated in Table 7 show the overall percentage of students in grades K-4, whereas, the statewide assessments reflect the academic performance of students in grades 3 and 4 only.

| 2024 NWEA MAP in Reading Spring Assessment | 2024 NWEA MAP in Math Spring Assessment |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| % Predicted to Meet or Exceed Grade-Level Standards | % Predicted to Meet or Exceed Grade-Level Standards |
| All Students: 76%                          | All Students: 76%                       |

On average, projected scale score growth for all students from the fall assessment to the spring assessment was 12.7 points in reading and 14.6 points in math. Overall, observed growth between the fall and spring MAP assessments surpassed projected growth in reading and math by 107.9% and 123.9%, respectively. Overall, and for each significant student group, academic growth in the areas of reading and math exceeded projected growth targets.

The following table illustrates the percentage of students in kindergarten through fourth grade who met their individual growth goals in reading and math. In reading, from the fall to spring assessments, 53% of students met or exceeded their individual growth goals. In the area of math, 75% of students met or exceeded their growth goals from winter to spring.

The NWEA MAP assessments are for students in K-8. More developmentally appropriate measures of progress are used for students in transitional kindergarten (TK). Progress and proficiency data is calculated for TK students through a variety of assessments ranging from curriculum tools to teacher-created resources and rubrics.

The RAFOS Universal Prekindergarten Team, in collaboration with administration and instructional coaching staff, created standards-aligned assessment tools (i.e., curriculum assessments and teacher-created resources) to measure mastery and progress toward mastery of TK learning standards. As illustrated in the example on page 9, ARCA continues to measure student progress in TK using rubrics that benchmark progress over the school year. As intended for TK curriculum per California EC 48000(f), the literacy standard shown in the example is aligned with the California Preschool Learning Foundations developed by the California Department of Education.

**Progress toward meeting LCAP Goal 2**

ARCA lists 11 actions under Goal 2. The actions focus on a comprehensive MTSS that supports the whole child and creates an environment where all students are safe, engaged, supported, challenged, and healthy. ARCA’s MTSS model is a fluid, tiered system of supports with robust Tier 1 levels of support in the classroom including the social-emotional curriculum, *In Focus*, and a Positive Behavioral and Intervention Supports (PBIS) team. *In Focus* was implemented upon ARCA’s opening in 2020 and continues to be implemented at all grades levels, including transitional kindergarten. Social-emotional learning is explicitly taught during the first 20 minutes of each school day. In addition to the 20 minutes of explicit teaching, frequent check-ins were used during the 2023-2024 school year to monitor the progress of student learning and identify opportunities to further develop student’s social-emotional learning. Additional learning occurred through community circles, occasions for students to showcase their interests, cultures, and backgrounds, and structured opportunities for students to learn to give and receive affirmations from one another. Additional support to help students regulate emotions was provided and teachers received training to provide trauma-informed practices and utilize strategies to help regulate emotions in a restorative classroom environment.

Integrated within ARCA’s MTSS model is a Student Study Team (SST) process. Teachers, parents, administrators, and other applicable staff members supported students at the Tier 2 level by setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals to help students progress in behavioral and social skills. ARCA’s SST process also supports students with academic progress. SMART goals were revisited every 6-8 weeks or sooner, if needed. The goal of ARCA’s SST process is to identify and intervene early to support students' academic, behavioral, and social-emotional needs. ARCA’s purpose for incorporating SMART goals into the SST process is to ensure individual student goals developed during SST meetings are specific, trackable, and achievable. Tier 2 interventions ARCA added during the 2023-2024 school year based on identified student needs included a student group that focused on developing executive functioning skills such as emotional control and self-regulation, teacher-provided collaborative activities and games to help scaffold, model, and encourage collaborative work between peers, and structured instruction through recess games to help students interact and build relationships with one another while also learning playground rules, expectations, and problem-solving techniques.

ARCA’s network for Tier 3 supported students with specialized staff including an educational specialist, psychologist, speech and language pathologist, behaviorist, and a school nurse. Working in partnership with families, ARCA utilized student 504s and IEPs, as applicable, to provide targeted behavior and emotional interventions for students and families including mentoring, counseling, and connection to wraparound services to meet specific needs. ARCA staff received training to support behavior challenges in the classroom and partnered with the El Dorado SELPA to provide professional development on verbal de-escalation strategies.

In 2023-2024, ARCA measured the impact of their actions by administering a self-created student survey tailored to their younger students since the California Healthy Kids Survey is intended for older students and is administered to students beginning in the fifth grade. ARCA reported that 92% of students stated they “feel like I belong at my school.” High levels of student engagement at ARCA are further supported by decreasing their chronic absenteeism rate of 15.3% in 2022-2023 to 0% in 2023-2024.

The following executive summary of the 2023-2024 Annual LCAP metric outcomes for LCAP Goal 2 indicates success in promoting the development of students who are responsible, compassionate, and engaged citizens.

## II. DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AND ENROLLMENT

ARCA demonstrates a commitment to serve the students and community of Citrus Heights and replicate the diversity and needs of the surrounding schools. ARCA prioritizes enrollment preferences to socioeconomically disadvantaged students, foster youth, and San Juan Unified residents in an effort to reflect the demographics of San Juan Unified School District schools.

The percentage of African American, Hispanic, and White students enrolled at ARCA has remained relatively constant over the past three years with 4% of the student population identifying as African American in 2023-2024, 27% as Hispanic or Latino, and 46% as White. The percentage of English learner students increased slightly to 12%.

In Table 14 on page 15, a comparison of ARCA’s student demographics is made to eight elementary schools in the San Juan Unified School District located in the City of Citrus Heights. A comparison to these schools shows the degree of consistency between the student demographics of ARCA and the school community it serves.

Overall, the comparisons between ethnic and student groups show similarities between ARCA and the San Juan Unified schools located in the City of Citrus Heights. ARCA has 4% African American students enrolled compared to 6% attending San Juan Unified comparison schools. The percentage of White students attending ARCA is 46% compared to 42% in the San Juan Unified comparison schools. The percentage of English learner students and Hispanic students enrolled at ARCA is slightly less than San Juan Unified comparison schools. However, the percentage of Hispanic students attending ARCA is the same as SJUSD. The percentage of socioeconomically disadvantaged students is less at ARCA compared to San Juan Unified comparison schools, yet increased in 2023-2024. The number of socioeconomically disadvantaged students represented by the 37% at ARCA during the 2023-2024 school year equals 39 students which is 18 more socioeconomically disadvantaged students than the previous year.

Illustrated in Table 15, on page 16, ARCA's LCFF Unduplicated Pupil Count (i.e., students eligible for free or reduced-price meals, English learners, and foster youth) increased in the 2023-2024 school year to 45.71% from 41.25% in the previous year. As illustrated in Table 16, San Juan Unified comparison schools and San Juan Unified School District on average have greater percentages of unduplicated pupils than ARCA.

![Projected Enrollment Compared to 2024-2025 Actual Enrollment](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Projected+Enrollment+Compared+to+2024-2025+Actual+Enrollment)

As outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding with SCOE, a material revision is required when enrollment fluctuates by 25% in any grade level or 10% of total enrollment projected in the charter petition. ARCA’s original charter petition was written prior to the events of 2020 which severely impacted educational systems worldwide. The original projected enrollment numbers were significantly greater than the actual enrollment numbers in the first four years of operations. Since opening in 2020, ARCA has submitted two material revisions to address enrollment projections. The most recent was submitted to SCOE on September 19, 2023 to align actual enrollment with an enrollment projection that aligns with currently projected growth and waitlist demand.

### Projected Enrollment Compared to 2024-2025 Actual Enrollment

| Projected Enrollment | 2020-2021 | 2021-2022 | 2022-2023 | 2023-2024 | 2024-2025 | 2025-2026 | 2026-2027 |

*Source: CDE, Data Quest, Enrollment. *ARCA 2024-25 enrollment as of 9/4/2024.

The 2024-2025 Rocklin Academy Family of Schools (RAFOS) Adopted Budget Report presented to and approved by the RAFOS Board of Directors on June 18, 2024 increased the 2024-2025 enrollment projection above the September 2023 material revision from 130 students to 146 students. As described in the 2024-2025 adopted budget report, the enrollment assumption is based on the addition of an administrative space in the 2024-2025 school year and another modular building for the 2025-2026 school year. The planned new location for a permanent modular building was observed during a school site visit conducted on September 24, 2024. Due to limitations on classroom space in the fourth and fifth grade classrooms until such space is added, ARCA created a waitlist. Of the 50 students on the waitlist, 20 students are fifth grade students. The remaining 30 students on the waitlist are kindergartners. ARCA is at capacity for kindergarten with 24 students. As of September 4, 2024, the current 2024-2025 enrollment is 134 students which is less than a 10% difference between projected and actual enrollment.

### Campus Update

Since opening in the 2020-2021 school year, RAFOS has actively pursued a long-term campus location for ARCA. The current location at 7755 Hazel Avenue will continue to serve as the ARCA campus during the 2024-2025 school year. There are current plans to add administrative space.

and a new permanent modular building at the current location during the 2025-2026 school year with continued improvements to the outdoor space to accommodate a growing student population.

## Admissions Practices

ARCA strives to serve the students and community of Citrus Heights and replicate the diversity and needs of the surrounding schools. In an effort to mirror the enrollment of the San Juan Unified Schools nearest ARCA, ARCA prioritizes enrollment preferences to socioeconomically disadvantaged students, foster youth, and San Juan Unified residents. Preferences are also offered to siblings of currently enrolled students and children of full-time employees and board members. ARCA admits students who wish to attend the school. No assessment is administered to students prior to acceptance and enrollment into the school and ARCA complies with all laws establishing minimum and maximum age for public school attendance in charter schools. Mandatory parental volunteer hours as a criterion for admission or continued enrollment is not required. The ARCA admission process consists of completion and submission of:

- Registration Form
- Proof of Residency Form for students residing in the authorizing district
- Proof of Minimum Age Requirements
- Proof of Required Immunizations

Applications are accepted during a publicly advertised lottery application period each year for possible enrollment in the following school year. Following the lottery application period, ARCA holds a lottery to determine admission, except for existing students who are guaranteed admission in the following school year.

### Student Recruitment

ARCA implemented several strategies during the 2023-2024 school year to recruit students that mirror the diversity and needs of the surrounding community. ARCA continues to engage with community organizations with whom they have established relations including the Chamber of Commerce, Rotary, Single Mom Strong, the Sayonara Center, and Citrus Heights Neighborhood Associations. On August 6, 2024, ARCA participated in the annual Citrus Heights National Night Out event. ARCA staff hosted a booth and provided families with information.

In advance of the 2023-2024 enrollment cycle, ARCA conducted research to develop a community profile report to better understand the demographics of students immediately surrounding ARCA. This research continues to support a more targeted marketing campaign which includes strategies such as Search Engine Marketing, targeted social media ads, and print and radio advertisements in Russian Media.

ARCA held multiple parent information meetings, providing families with an overview of ARCA’s Core Knowledge Curriculum. Lottery information was posted on the RAFOS website, advertised on social media, and emailed to every family who applied. The number of applications received for the 2024-2025 school year exceeded all previous lotteries.

ARCA’s end-of-year audited financial statements for 2022-2023 show a $200,000 contribution from RAFOS. In the 2023-2024 school year, the contribution from RAFOS was again $200,000. Although both years show deficit spending for ARCA, revenues increased by 28% from 2022-2023 to 2023-2024. Budget projections for the 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 also include contributions from RAFOS. However, beginning in the 2026-2027 school year, ARCA is self-sustaining with no projected contribution from RAFOS.

## IV. GENERAL INFORMATION

### Family and Community Engagement

RAFOS’ partnership with the Community Engagement Initiative (CEI), which is part of the California Statewide System of Support, continued in its second year with a focus on the problem of practice that was identified in the first year of the partnership. RAFOS’ problem of practice is: **The two-way communication between families and teachers is not as effective and equitable as we want it to be.** RAFOS’ theory of action is that with improved two-way communication between families and teachers, they will see benefits for their students and their educational outcomes. Aligned with the theory of action, a new strategy was implemented at ARCA during the 2023-2024 school year. The family orientation was restructured to emphasize families engaging with each other, sharing their why, and making connections, while exploring programmatic resources. RAFOS leaders also strategically integrated the work of RAFOS’ Parent School Partnerships (PSPs) with the CEI partnership by establishing a PSP Collective consisting of members from each school’s PSP who meet with the Superintendent and Director of Finance to establish and work on shared priorities including family engagement and communication.

### ARCA Parent School Partnership

ARCA believes that parents are valued partners in strengthening the school’s program. The role of ARCA’s Parent School Partnership (PSP) is to help build community within the school and develop connections between the school and the community. The PSP Board positions were
<!-- Page 23 -->
![American River Collegiate Academy Charter School Annual Oversight Report](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

filled during the 2023-2024 school year and board members provided the strategic direction of the PSP by identifying multiple goal areas to support the school including school and classroom support, fundraising, and school culture. The PSP Board also identified specific projects including the development of an Art Docent Program, funding classroom budgets, hosting teacher appreciation week, and holding at least two school/community events. The PSP Board successfully accomplished the projects and exceeded expectations by providing additional school events for families and increasing the PSP budget for the 2023-2024 school year.

**Governance**  
The Rocklin Academy Family of Schools (RAFOS) is organized as a California nonprofit, public benefit corporation 501(c)(3), and is governed by a Board of Directors pursuant to its bylaws. The Board of Directors is responsible for guiding ARCA in the pursuit of its vision and mission.

**Impact of New Legislation in 2023-2024**  
The passing of AB 1165 on June 29, 2023 encourages LEAs to take proactive steps to ensure the victims and perpetrators of racist bullying receive supports and interventions so schools remain safe, supportive places for everyone. The RAFOS Board of Directors responded with the adoption of Board Policy 5145.3. Also, the adoption of Board Policy 5145.71 further protects against acts of discrimination.

On June 27, 2024, the RAFOS Board of Directors approved Board Policy 5145.3 - Harassment, Intimidation, Discrimination, and Bullying Policy which explicitly outlined the student education and staff professional development that will be implemented within their schools to proactively address discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying.

On June 17, 2024, the RAFOS Board of Directors also approved Board Policy 5145.71 - Title IX Policy Prohibiting Discrimination on the Basis of Sex. The policy prohibits discrimination against students, employees, and visitors within the educational setting including those who identify as LGBTQ+.

The passing of SB 671 on October 8, 2023 requires LEAs to include procedures to assess and respond to reports of any dangerous, violent, or unlawful activity that is being conducted or threatened to be conducted at the school, at any activity sponsored by the school, or on a school bus serving the school.

On February 26, 2024, the RAFOS Board of Directors approved the 2024-2025 ARCA Comprehensive School Safety Plan developed by the ARCA Comprehensive Safety Team. In response to SB 671, the Plan outlines the school’s Behavioral Threat Assessment (BTA)

process to be implemented in response to any reports of potential dangerous, violent, or unlawful activities. The BTA team uses a systematic approach for reviewing and responding to potential threats. The steps of BTA include: 1) Referral, 2) Behavioral Threat Assessment Screening, 3) Location Determination, 4) Information Gathering, 5) Information Analysis and Determination of Threat Level, and 6) Development/Implementation of an Intervention Plan. If a referral indicates that there is immediate danger or an imminent safety concern, the BTA process would be put on hold and 911 would be called.

## Approved Revised Board Policies in 2023-2024
- Approved Revised Suicide Prevention Policy
- Approved Revised Special Education Policy
- Approved Revised Policy, Procedures and Parent Rights Regarding Identification, Evaluation and Education Under Section 504
- Approved Revised Education for Homeless Children and Youth Policy
- Approved Revised Attendance, Chronic Absence, And Truancy Policy

## Professional Development
Professional development is a priority for ARCA. Thirteen full days were integrated within the school calendar for the 2023-2024 school year for the purpose of providing professional development for teachers, paraprofessionals, and education specialists. Additionally, every Monday afternoon was protected for teacher collaborative planning time.

During the 2023-2024 school year, there were two key areas of focus for professional development, the science of reading and equity. The science of reading was grounded in the work of Lucy Calkins and The Collaborative Classroom which believes in surrounding teachers with a system of support that builds professional learning into the curriculum and provides professional learning content that is relevant to what teachers do in the classroom. Professional learning opportunities for teachers emphasized deepening their understanding of the Core Knowledge Language Arts (CKLA) units which are grounded in the science of reading and characterized by sequential knowledge building and systematic foundational skills instruction. Charlotte Danielson’s Framework for Teaching was another resource used in professional learning to strengthen teacher effectiveness by developing three key areas of success within teachers including disciplinary expertise, pedagogical content knowledge, and knowledge of interdisciplinary relationships and skills. Charlotte Danielson emphasizes the importance of encouraging students’ natural intellectual curiosity and creating the conditions that allow them to engage with important concepts and content.

Guided by Dr. Stacy Ault, founder of the Race and Gender Equity Project, ARCA continued to work during the 2023-2024 school year on the development and implementation of equity-centered social and emotional learning opportunities. ARCA’s goal is to create a safe and inclusive school community centered on compassion and empathy that provides students the ability to form authentic, diverse relationships that build a better future for themselves and the broader community. ARCA provided leadership and staff training focused on the power of leading with empathy based on Brene Brown’s four attributes of empathy: perspective-taking, staying out of judgment, recognizing emotions, and communication. Staff were provided the resources to explicitly teach empathy and inclusion in the classrooms and on campus.

**Summary**

ARCA’s mission is to provide a distinct educational program strengthened by community and parent partnerships to achieve high standards, rich core content, and innovation learning. ARCA envisions a school community that inspires its students to excel academically, pursue their passions and impact the world with excellence. Evidence to support ARCA’s commitment to their mission and vision during the 2023-2024 school year exists through direct observation of their educational program, the knowledge and professionalism of leaders and teachers alike, the welcoming culture of the school, the engaging and safe classrooms where students demonstrated their joy of learning, the shared commitment of parents, and outcome data that confirms ARCA’s students, including socioeconomically disadvantaged students, are outperforming their peers.

ARCA’s teaching and learning environments engage students in authentic, interactive, hands-on learning aligned to the California Content Standards. Observations of ARCA’s classrooms revealed students in the primary grades excitedly blended beginning, medial, and ending sounds during an interactive phonics lesson while students in an upper primary grade showed their excitement and anticipation as they participated in an integrated science, literacy, and math lesson that investigated changing properties of matter as students asked questions, defined problems, made predictions, and analyzed and interpreted data. Classroom visits reinforced the reported practice of effective teacher collaboration as evidenced by the vertical alignment of lessons and consistent use of instructional strategies that engage all learners and differentiate learning for students who need additional support.

ARCA’s partnership with families continues to strengthen through staff and family participation in the California Community Engagement Initiative during the 2023-2024 school year. Family engagement and partnership activities continue to grow in number and quality. The 2023-2024 school year was alive with authentic family partnerships and engagement including trimester conferences, the development of Individual Learning Plans, budget and LCAP development.

meetings, facilities meetings, and volunteering in the classrooms, the garden, on field trips, and on campus. Many successful school events and activities were held during the 2023-2024 school year which all relied on family members to make them happen. ARCA is actualizing their mission and vision to create a school community that inspires its students to excel academically and is strengthened by community and parent partnerships.
