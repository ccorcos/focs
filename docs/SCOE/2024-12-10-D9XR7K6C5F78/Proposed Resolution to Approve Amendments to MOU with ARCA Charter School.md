## Resolution Approving Amendments to the American River Collegiate Academy Charter School’s Memorandum of Understanding  
### Resolution No. 24-22

WHEREAS, pursuant to Resolution Nos. 20-02, 22-02, and 23-13, the Sacramento County Board of Education (Board) has approved the American River Collegiate Academy (ARCA) Charter School to serve students in grades TK-5 within the San Juan Unified School District.

WHEREAS, the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Board and ARCA approves ARCA to open and operate its charter school at a temporary school site at 7755 Hazel Avenue in Orangevale, California while it seeks a long-term facility within Citrus Heights.

WHEREAS, ARCA has submitted the attached explanation of its multiple efforts to secure a long-term school facility in Citrus Heights, without success.

WHEREAS, ARCA is now planning to make significant expenditures to improve and enhance its current school facility and has asked for the Board’s approval to amend its MOU to clarify that ARCA may remain at its current location for the foreseeable future.

WHEREAS, consistent with governing law in February 2020, the Board approved the ARCA charter and executed its MOU for a five-year term (July 1, 2020 – June 30, 2025). Subsequently, Education Code section 47607.4 extended the term of charter schools whose terms expire on June 30, 2025 by three years. Accordingly, ARCA has asked for the Board’s approval to adjust the term of its MOU so that the MOU does not expire before the end of ARCA’s charter term.

WHEREAS, the Board considered ARCA’s request at a properly noticed, open public meeting on December 10, 2024, and good cause appearing:

THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED that:

1. The recitals set forth above are true and correct.

2. The Sacramento County Board of Education approves the American River Collegiate Academy (ARCA) charter school’s request to amend its MOU as follows:

### Section 13. Facilities

13.1. It is understood and agreed that the County Board and/or SCOE have no obligation to provide facilities to TRA for the Charter School. The Charter School intends to begin operating in 2020-2021 at a temporary school site located at 7755 Hazel Avenue in Orangevale, California, and to move to a permanent school site in Citrus Heights as soon as feasible. The Charter School will regularly update SCOE on the progress and plans for its permanent school facility in Citrus Heights, and will obtain County Board approval before opening and operating its permanent school facility or any other school facility.
