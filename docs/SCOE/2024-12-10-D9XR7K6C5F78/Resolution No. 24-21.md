# SACRAMENTO COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION

**Resolution Authorizing Five Percent Increase in Board Member Compensation Under Education Code Section 1090**  
**Resolution No. 24-21**

WHEREAS, pursuant to Education Code section 1090(a)(2) and (g), Sacramento County Board of Education (Board) members who attend all meetings in a month currently receive compensation of $463.05 per month.

WHEREAS, pursuant to Education Code section 1090(g), on an annual basis, the Board may increase its members’ present monthly compensation by up to 5 percent.

WHEREAS, according to information provided by 8 county boards of education in similarly sized counties, their county board of education members receive between $546.02 to $1,170.12 per month as compensation for their services.

WHEREAS, based upon the survey information referenced above, Board members’ present monthly compensation is less than the compensation received by county board of education members in other similarly sized counties.

WHEREAS, increasing Board members’ present monthly compensation by 5 percent would increase members monthly compensation by $23.15, which is a reasonable cost of living adjustment.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, for the reasons set forth above and as authorized by Education Code section 1090(g), the Board hereby increases the monthly compensation received by its members by 5 percent, from $463.05 to $486.20 per month, effective with the December 2024 payroll, which is payable on the first business day of January 2025.
