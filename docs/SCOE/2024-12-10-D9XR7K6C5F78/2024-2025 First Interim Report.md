# 2024-25 First Interim
Sacramento County Office of Education  
County School Service Fund  
Form 06851 000000  
County Office of Education Criteria and Standards Review  
FBFIRMSE(T2024-25)

## ADDITIONAL FISCAL INDICATORS

The following fiscal indicators are designed to provide additional data for reviewing agencies. A "Yes" answer to any single indicator does not necessarily suggest a cause for concern, but may alert the reviewing agency to the need for additional review.

| Indicator | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| A1. Data Entry: Check the appropriate Yes or No buttons for Items A2 through A8. Item A1 is automatically completed based on data from Criterion 7. |  |
| A2. Is the system of personnel position control independent from the pay roll system? | No |
| A3. Is the County Operations Grant ADA decreasing in both the prior and current fiscal years? | No |
| A4. Are new charter schools operating in county office boundaries that impact the county office's ADA, either in the prior or current fiscal year? | No |
| A5. Has the county office entered into a bargaining agreement where any of the current or subsequent fiscal years of the agreement would result in salary increases that are expected to exceed the projected state funded cost-of-living adjustment? | Yes |
| A6. Does the county office provide uncapped (100% employer paid) health benefits for current or retired employees? | No |
| A7. Does the county office have any reports that indicate fiscal distress? (Yes, two copies to the CDE.) | No |
| A8. Have there been personnel changes in the superintendent or other business office positions within the last 12 months? | No |

When providing comments for additional fiscal indicators, please include the item number applicable to each comment.

### Comments: (optional)
A. A negotiated salary increase for FY 24/25 is 4%, the state COLA for FY 24/25 is at 1.07%.
