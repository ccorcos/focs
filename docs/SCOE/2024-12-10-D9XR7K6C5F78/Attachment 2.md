# I. Key Questions Guiding American River Collegiate Academy’s Annual Report

## Key Questions
The evaluation of a school can be a very complicated and involved process. However, no matter how complex and involved the process may be, at its core, it needs to be based on some fundamental objectives/criteria. In the writing of the American River Collegiate Academy (ARCA / the Academy) charter, significant thought was given to the issue of assessing the Academy. Based on the work of Ted Kolderie, three key questions were incorporated into American River Collegiate Academy’s Charter to guide the ongoing evaluation of the school.

1. Is American River Collegiate Academy’s academic program a success?
2. Is American River Collegiate Academy a viable organization?
3. Is American River Collegiate Academy true to its charter?

# II. Mission Statement, Vision Statement, and Core Values

## Mission Statement
Rocklin Academy Family of Schools provides a distinct educational program strengthened by community and parent partnerships to achieve high standards, rich core content, and innovative learning.

## Vision Statement
We envision a school community that inspires its students to excel academically, pursue their passions, and impact the world with excellence.

## Core Values
1. The future we want to create includes a community of leaders who have strong shared beliefs and values that all students have the ability to learn at high levels and the expectations of our organization/schools to meet or exceed that level.
2. The future we want to create includes a community of leaders who are data savvy; they embrace and monitor data and use it to drive continuous improvement.
3. The future we want to create includes a community of leaders who have a collaborative relationship and establish a strong communication structure to inform and engage both internal and external stakeholders in setting and achieving organization-wide student learning and achievement goals.
4. The future we want to create includes a community of leaders who are

knowledgeable, ethical, responsible, critical thinking, and engaged members of society.

5. The future we want to create includes a community of leaders who utilize research based, varied, differentiated and effective instructional practices to ensure all students learn at high levels.

III. Review of Major Activities and Progress

Overview of Major Activities and Progress in the 2023-24 School Year  
American River Collegiate Academy began serving students on August 13, 2020. The 202324 school year was our fourth year supporting and serving students in and around the community of Citrus Heights.

This past year, we prioritized and targeted instruction by focusing on patterns of academic strengths and weaknesses in order to develop pathways for students to progress toward proficiency in all content areas. All students continued to be provided with the necessary tools to engage in learning including Chromebooks, textbooks, and school supplies. Additionally, Tier II and III supports were implemented at all grade levels to address learning gaps and support catch up growth.

During the 2023-24 school year, our students, families, and staff engaged in a variety of in person, community-based events. At the start of the school year, we welcomed existing and new families on campus for our annual Meet the Teacher and Back to School Night events. Additionally, our Parent School Partnership (PSP) hosted a number of community events throughout the school year including Fall Festival, Family Movie Night, Spring Fling, and multiple restaurant nights. Our staff participated in thirteen professional learning days throughout the course of the school year, which provided teachers and support staff the opportunity to reflect on and refine their professional skills, create opportunities for students to establish and maintain a sense of community in their classrooms, and develop targeted instructional plans aligned to grade level Common Core and essential standards.

Staff implemented a variety of instructional practices to support students including, but not limited to small group instruction, flexible grouping and seating, shared use of supplies and classroom learning resources, and intervention supports that allowed for greater flexibility.

During the 2023-24 school year, we served 15 transitional kindergarteners, 18 kindergarteners, 23 first graders, 20 second graders, 15 third graders, and 14 fourth graders. This is a total of 105 students with 99% of those families indicating an intent to return for the 2024-25 school year. All families stayed engaged in the school community through our thriving Parent School Partnership (PSP), school events, academic partnering, and

volunteering in the classroom. We were delighted at the outpouring of support and partnership from our families and the community throughout the school year.

We strongly believe that our fourth year was our strongest yet. We continued to grow in numbers, while serving a student population that reflected the diversity of the community of Citrus Heights and the surrounding area, and remained open to all students regardless of race, gender, socioeconomic status, or disability.

We are excited to continue establishing our own unique customs and traditions, while maintaining our high expectations around learning and student achievement.

## Strategic Planning
In partnership with Friday, a strategy and design firm, RAFOS pursued a four-phased approach to strategic planning to guide the organization towards a strong sense of identity, updated 3–5-year core goals, and key strategies, and a supporting action plan. The first phase identified internal and external factors influencing the organization, incorporating findings on key conditions of learning from the Highlight Student Equity survey. During the second phase, a strategic planning committee was formed to participate in two full-day strategic planning workshops to process key findings; revisit the organization’s identity and long-term impact; and bridge its current reality with its desired impact by identifying strategic priorities and defining 3–5-year core goal outcomes. The third phase produced two foundational strategic planning documents: a Theory of Change (Appendix A), communicating an updated vision for our model, values, approach, and impact; and a 2022-2027 Strategic Plan Framework (Appendix B), summarizing our 3-5 year organization-wide core goals and key strategies. The Strategic Plan Update 2023-2024 (Appendix C), provides a summary of the actions and strategies implemented in the 2023-2024 schoolyear.

## LCAP Goals
The Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) is a three-year plan that describes the goals, actions, services, and expenditures to support positive student outcomes that address state and local priorities. The LCAP provides an opportunity for local educational agencies (LEAs) to share their stories of how, what, and why programs and services are selected to meet their local needs. The components of the LCAP for the 2024-25 LCAP (developed in the 2023-24 school year) year include:
- Budget Overview for Parents (BOP)
- Plan Summary
- Engaging Educational Partners
- Goals and Actions
- Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-income students
- Action Tables

Data and information that was gathered through educational partner engagements and surveys helped guide the development of the 3-year LCAP and annual updates.

This process led us to two main areas of focus for the next 3-year cycle. Goal one focuses on academic achievement, and goal two, on the social emotional needs of our students. In the 2023-24 school year we also had a third goal which focused on improving chronic absenteeism rates. Through the LCAP engagement process with educational partners, it was determined that this goal had been achieved and was no longer necessary. Therefore, we were able to remove that from the new 2024-25 LCAP. These updated goals are supported by several actions that are outlined in the LCAP. When developing the actions, we first considered the unique needs of our high-needs students to ensure that we would have appropriate plans in place to support them and eliminate any potential barriers to their success.

Goal 1  
Rocklin Academy Family of Schools will maintain the high academic achievement levels of all students in ELA and math while increasing performance outcomes with underperforming student groups.

Goal 2  
Rocklin Academy Family of Schools will promote the development of students who are responsible, compassionate, and engaged citizens.

Expanded Learning Opportunities Grant  
For the 2023-24 school year, Rocklin Academy Family of Schools utilized the ELO Grant to support students. American River Collegiate Academy prioritized the grant funds to support our EL and SED students and provide structures for additional learning. Funds were also provided to support students needing additional instruction and practice on grade level targets to meet essential standards. The following areas were supported with the ELO grant.

1. Summer Academy is categorized as extending instructional learning time.

2. LLI Tier II intervention curriculum is categorized under integrated student supports.

3. Enrichment Support Specialist to support accelerating progress. On top of providing Tier II supports, our ESS teacher provided before school math.

**Instruction, push-in math support for SED students, and pull out designated EL supports.**

4. Professional Development for staff to help support extending instructional learning instruction with Tier II support in the classroom.

**Professional Development**  
We value professional learning and dedicate time for staff each year. We embed 13 full days into our calendars to provide professional development to our teachers, paraprofessionals, and education specialists. We also continued with early-release Mondays to provide opportunities for staff to engage in collaborative planning and data analysis.

This year, a majority of our full days and early release days were dedicated to professional learning aligned with our ELA Vision. In 2022-23 we began crafting our clear vision for ELA classrooms grounded in the science of reading and committed to equity. We spent this year refining that vision, pushing for clarity, and engaging in the vulnerable work of opening up our classrooms so we could truly understand what our vision looks and sounds like when it is enacted. Our learning continued to be grounded in research, particularly the work of Lucy Calkins and the Collaborative Classroom.

A key component of our professional learning this year was the deep dive into CKLA units. We focused on internalizing the units, understanding the underlying structures and design, and identifying opportunities for guided discourse. Through collaborative analysis and reflection, teachers developed a shared understanding of how to effectively implement these units in their classrooms. This included exploring strategies for fostering rich and meaningful conversations that support students' comprehension, critical thinking, and language development.

The following is a list of PD topics that were covered in the 2023-24 school year:
- Refining our ELA Vision
- CKLA unit internalization & opportunities for guided discourse
- PBIS, school culture & 8 Keys of Excellence
- Reflecting on our practice using Charlotte Danielson’s Framework for Teaching
- School safety procedures & health training
- Principles of mastery-based learning
- MTSS student support & behavior training
- Trauma-informed practices & SEL curriculum implementation
- NWEA MAP data reflection

## IV. Student Recruitment

### Marketing and Recruitment
American River Collegiate Academy strives to serve the students and community of Citrus Heights and the surrounding area and to replicate the diversity and needs of nearby schools. In an effort to mirror the enrollment of San Juan Unified School District schools closest to the proposed American River Collegiate Academy site, we have prioritized enrollment preferences to socioeconomically disadvantaged students, foster youth students, and San Juan Unified residents. Preferences are also offered to siblings of currently enrolled students and children of full-time employees and board members. We have implemented several tactics including Search Engine Marketing, targeted social media ads, print and radio advertisements in Russian Media, and attending community events.

We continue to engage with community organizations with which we have established relationships, including the Chamber of Commerce, Rotary, Single Mom Strong, the Sayonara Center, and Citrus Heights Neighborhood Associations.

In advance of the 2023-24 enrollment cycle, we did some secondary research to create community profile reports to better understand the demographics immediately surrounding our schools. This has allowed our marketing campaign to be more targeted, more efficient, and more successful. Utilizing the information learned via the community profile reports, we created a targeted social media campaign toward American River audiences. We held multiple parent information meetings, providing an overview of American River Collegiate Academy including Core Knowledge Curriculum and how it is implemented.

The number of applications submitted for the 2024-25 lottery exceeded the number of openings available. We had 310 families submit applications and 45 seats were available. The lottery information was posted on The Rocklin Academy Family of Schools Website, advertised on social media, and emailed to every family who had applied. All applicants were invited to attend the public lottery in March. We currently have 50 students on the waiting list.

## VI. Academic Program

One of the most important elements that sets American River Collegiate Academy apart from other schools is its enriching, research-based, and proven Core Knowledge curriculum. Beginning with the foundation of the Core Knowledge Curriculum Sequence and implementing it with rich and engaging materials and outstanding teaching, the Academy provided an excellent educational opportunity for students in grades TK through fourth grade during the 2023-24 school year.

### Core Knowledge and the Core Knowledge Movement

The Core Knowledge movement is an educational reform based on the premise that a grade-by-grade core of common learning is necessary to ensure a sound and fair elementary education. The movement was started by Dr. E. D. Hirsch, Jr., author of *Cultural Literacy* and *The Schools We Need* and is based on a large body of research in cognitive psychology, as well as a careful examination of several of the world's fairest and most effective school systems. Dr. Hirsch believes that early schooling should provide a solid, specific, shared core curriculum to help children establish strong foundations of knowledge. After wide consultation, the content of this core curriculum has been outlined in two books - the Core Knowledge Preschool Sequence and the Core Knowledge Sequence, Pre-K-8 - which explicitly state what students should learn at each grade level. “Only a well-rounded, knowledge-specific curriculum can impart needed knowledge to all children and overcome inequality of opportunity.” - E.D. Hirsch, Jr., *Core Knowledge Foundation Chairman and Founder Why Knowledge Matters* (2016)

The Core Knowledge sequence provides for the logical progression of subject content throughout a child’s schooling. The social studies sequence, for example, presents periods of American history beginning in kindergarten and continuing into eighth grade. This allows students to constantly build upon prior knowledge, thus enhancing interest level and individual self-confidence year after year. The Academy uses the Core Knowledge approach in social studies and science in order to go above and beyond the California State Standards and to give our students genuine ownership of their own learning process. For more information about Core Knowledge, readers are asked to visit the Core Knowledge website.

American River Collegiate Academy uses several curricular materials and programs to implement Core Knowledge and to provide a comprehensive educational program. Summarized below are key components of these programs.

### Language Arts

American River Collegiate Academy’s language arts curriculum provides solid, research-based instruction using the research of reading experts from the Report of the National
<!-- Page 18 -->
![Reading Panel and Put Reading First. The Core Knowledge Sequence ensures that content is incorporated into the language arts blocks, which ensures a knowledge-rich curriculum core for all students. American River Collegiate Academy’s program provides strong instruction in the areas of decoding (learning how to read), comprehension (understanding what you read), inquiry and investigation (learning how to apply what you have read), and writing (learning how to communicate with others in print). It will continue to include ongoing student assessment. The program will continue to support the teaching of spelling, vocabulary, grammar, usage and mechanics, penmanship, listening, and speaking. Our TK-4 curriculum addresses the areas of phonemic awareness, systematic and explicit phonics instruction, fluency, and vocabulary. For older students, the focus will continue to be on teaching comprehension, genre, and content literacy. This will continue to be accomplished through independent reading, guided reading, close reading, literature study and analysis, concept and comprehension strategies, word analysis, and the reading/writing connection. The instructional materials used include: ● Core Knowledge Language Arts and Literature - grades TK-8 ● Trade Books related to Core Knowledge content TK-8 ● Reference books and online resources Core Knowledge Literature The Core Knowledge literature sequence is rich, engaging and builds the cultural literacy of students. It includes poetry, sayings and phrases, and classic literature at all grade levels. There is an equitable balance between both fiction and nonfiction literature, which aligns beautifully to the Common Core State Standards. Additionally, the Core Knowledge literature sequence is easily integrated with the history content for each grade level which assists the teacher in developing and implementing thematic instructional strategies. English Language Development Rocklin Academy Family of Schools is committed to providing comprehensive English Language Development (ELD) services to our English Learner (EL) students, ensuring they have the opportunity to acquire English language proficiency and achieve academic success. Our ELD program aligns with California's Education Code and the English Language Development Standards. We offer a structured English immersion approach that integrates ELD instruction with core content areas, fostering the development of all four language domains (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) while ensuring academic progress in American River Collegiate Academy APR 2024 17 | P a g e.**

**English Learner Program**

American River Collegiate Academy is committed to providing a high-quality education for English learners (EL) through a structured English immersion approach. Our program integrates English language development (ELD) instruction with grade-level content in subjects like math, science, and social studies. Our highly qualified teachers deliver targeted ELD instruction alongside grade-level content instruction, ensuring EL students receive the support they need to develop their language skills while keeping pace with their peers.

Our structured English immersion approach provides EL students with intensive exposure to English in a supportive and engaging learning environment. We seamlessly integrate ELD instruction with core content areas, allowing EL students to develop academic language proficiency while learning subject matter. We continuously monitor student progress through ongoing assessments and evaluations to ensure the effectiveness of our ELD program.

At American River Collegiate Academy, classroom teachers provide designated ELD instruction to all EL students daily using Amplify's Language Studio program. This program complements our Core Knowledge Language Arts ELA program.

Rocklin Academy Family of Schools is dedicated to providing equitable access to quality education for all students, including English learners. Our ELD program is designed to support EL students in achieving their full academic potential and becoming successful bilingual individuals.

**Mathematics**

American River Collegiate Academy uses Eureka Math, also known as Engage New York, curriculum for transitional kindergarten through fourth grade mathematics instruction. The content and instructional approach used by Eureka Math meet both California Common Core State and Core Knowledge standards. There is a continual review of the concepts learned along with frequent and cumulative testing. The instructional approach, specifically incremental development, continual review of concepts, and frequent and cumulative testing, embodied in the Engage New York curriculum is consistent with that used by Core Knowledge.

The Eureka Math curriculum is used throughout the United States. Extensive paper and online resources support this curriculum. Additional material and information about this math program are available on the Great Minds website.

American River Collegiate Academy will continue the successful practices utilized to offer opportunities for students who are working above and below grade-level. For students working above grade-level in mathematics, our common school-wide schedule for mathematics instruction accommodates their participation in appropriate grade-level work. Curriculum differentiation opportunities are offered in all classrooms.

# History and Geography
The Core Knowledge Sequence significantly exceeds California state standards in history and geography. The Core Knowledge Foundation has published history and geography textbooks and instructional materials aligned to the Core Knowledge Sequence. Core Knowledge history and geography textbooks/instructional materials and web-based resources are used in addition to state adopted social studies textbooks/materials. The expertly written and illustrated, content-rich textbooks transform learning in the early grades and provide powerful cross curriculum connections with language arts, and visual and performing arts.

# Science
The Core Knowledge Sequence was revised in 2020 to align with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The Core Knowledge Foundation has published instructional materials, CKSci, to address the NGSS and include additional content from the Core Knowledge Sequence. We continue our professional learning about Next Generation Science Standards to further develop our implementation of cohesive science instruction using CKSci. As part of Core Knowledge’s commitment to building knowledge and a rich vocabulary, science is integrated part of the curriculum in every grade starting in kindergarten. American River Collegiate Academy uses various science trade books with supplemental learning and significant hands-on, minds-on, and web-based science material and activities.

# Visual and Performing Arts
The Core Knowledge Sequence includes visual and performing arts in all grade levels. This content is readily integrated throughout all the content areas and includes hands-on activities. American River Collegiate Academy will continue the art docent supported program in all grades, which is based on curriculum and methods of instruction consistent with the California Visual and Performing Arts standards and the Core Knowledge Sequence. The Academy provides music instruction twice a week to students in all grades.

# Character Education, Democratic Principles and Core Values
American River Collegiate Academy believes in a democratic society. We also believe that there are universally important civic and ethical virtues that are the foundations of a free and democratic society, such as respect, responsibility, trustworthiness, fairness, caring, courage, self-control, and diligence. American River Collegiate Academy continued to develop their system of Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS). The PBIS system ties into our character education, 8 Keys of Excellence. Information on the 8 Keys can be found on the 8 Keys website.

We continued with our adopted Social Emotional Learning Curriculum in the 2023-24 school year, In Focus. In Focus, from Thoughtful Learning, is a curriculum that helps students develop their social and emotional intelligence. Through guided weekly lessons by a credentialed instructor, students were taught ways to recognize emotions and were given the tools and scenarios to practice how to regulate and handle specific situations that are relevant to real-life situations.

## VII. Educational Approach

During the 2023-24 school year we provided a comprehensive education which included mathematics, English language arts, English language development (ELD), science, history, arts, technology, and social emotional learning. We creatively provided instruction that included collaboration and support to meet the needs of our students and provide an education that is rigorous, engaging, and inclusive. We were committed to keeping our enrichment block model where no new instruction was given but individualized support was provided. We enhanced our commitment to minimize learning gaps and put interventions in place with our Enrichment Support Specialist to provide additional learning and supports for our EL and SED students. Our Enrichment Support Specialist provided comprehensive support to our students, focusing on areas of need identified through frequent data analysis and offering additional assistance to newcomer students. In addition, we had credentialed staff to serve our students with disabilities on campus daily.

### Social and Emotional Learning

We continued to utilize the In Focus curriculum that was implemented at the start of American River Collegiate Academy in 2020. Social emotional learning was explicitly taught daily in school. In addition, our school wanted to have classrooms built around safety and an environment where learning could occur with respect and rapport from all. This required instruction and modeling beyond the 20-minute lesson from our curriculum. In August, our staff used frequent check-ins to monitor the progress of students and collectively identified a goal to help students feel a sense of belonging. Staff held community circles, provided opportunities for students to showcase their interests, cultures, and backgrounds and helped students learn to give and receive affirmations from one another. Students also needed support to help regulate emotions on campus and teachers were trained to provide trauma informed practices and utilize tools and strategies to help regulate emotions in a restorative classroom environment.

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

Rocklin Academy Family of Schools believe all children can learn at high levels. To be inclusive of all students, Rocklin Academy Family of Schools recognizes the need to engage in learning around diversity, equity, and inclusion. Pre-pandemic, RAFOS engaged in work.

with Dr. Stacy Ault to develop equity centered SEL. This work was included in professional development for staff and this learning continues to be a top priority as seen by our 2022-2027 Strategic Plan. For the 2023-24 school year, a committee continued to work on Strategic Plan Goal 2, for staff-wide collaboration around diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) with a focus on Goal 2’s DEI connection statement: Creating a safe and inclusive school community centered on compassion and empathy provides students the ability to form authentic, diverse relationships that build a better future for themselves and the broader community. We conducted both Leadership and whole staff training on the power of leading with empathy with a focus on Brene Brown’s four attributes of empathy: perspective taking, staying out of judgment, recognizing emotions and communication. Resources were provided to staff to emulate activities with students to ensure our entire school community was focused on empathy and inclusion as research notes that empathy contributes to positive outcomes including innovation, engagement, retention, inclusivity and work-life balance.

This work with the ARCA staff and students contributed to increased student engagement as seen by both increased attendance and decreased disciplinary data. We went from a chronic absenteeism rate of 15.3% in 2022-23 to 0.0% in 2023-24. Regarding suspensions, we went from a rate of 3.4% in 2022-23 to 1.8% in 2023-24.

VIII. Student Supports

Multi-Tiered System of Supports  
To support our students, we use an MTSS model for academic, social, and behavioral intervention. Developing a solid, yet fluid, tiered system of support has been a focus for Rocklin Academy Family of Schools for well over six years. Through various teams and committees, we have identified strong Tier I levels of support in classrooms through our SEL curriculum, enrichment blocks for academic support, and through our PBIS team. All our Tier I supports are embedded into American River Collegiate Academy. For Tier II supports, our academic model was supported by interventions identified by using multiple assessments to target needs and then instruct students during our enrichment block or through a pullout model where targeted instruction was taught with our Enrichment Support teacher. Students were given the opportunity to meet with a credentialed teacher to target instruction for intervention. It is important to note that during this time block, no new instruction was introduced. Our Tier II supports also included the SST process where teachers, administrators, parents, and any additional support staff were invited to participate in setting SMART goals to help students progress in academic, behavioral, or social skills. SMART goals were revisited every 6-8 weeks or sooner if determined appropriate by the team. We had a wonderful network of support for Tier III where students were supported by our specialist staff which included an Educational Specialist,  
American River Collegiate Academy APR 2024

<!-- Page 23 -->
![American River Collegiate Academy APR 2024](https://example.com/image.png)

Psychologist, Speech and Language Pathologist, Behaviorist, School Nurse, and any additional support staff as applicable. We supported our students through IEPs and 504s and worked directly with families and our specialist team to ensure an equal educational opportunity for all. We also partnered with the Sacramento County Office of Education for targeted professional development and support for SED, Foster Youth, and EL students. We also provided information in our weekly newsletter to support all families around the 8 Keys of Excellence and during Kindness Week provided families with at home resources around showing kindness at home and in the community.

This school year we recognized a need for additional Tier II interventions in the area of social-emotional support. In the fall we offered a Tier II social emotional group focused on building and maintaining healthy relations to students who were identified in needing support with social skills and problem-solving skills. We also provided support to a group of students who needed support with executive functioning skills. Additionally, our staff purposely provided intervention for students through increased use of collaborative activities and games to help scaffold, model, and encourage collaborative work between peers. For outside of the classroom support, we provided structured instruction on recess games to help students interact and build relationships with one another while also learning playground rules, expectations and problem-solving techniques. When needed, our school psychologist was able to provide Tier III support with students.

As a staff, we sought professional development to support our students further. Our leadership team requested additional training to support behavior challenges in the classroom and our organization partnered with the El Dorado SELPA to provide professional development on Verbal De-Escalation. Additionally, an organization-level Behavior Specialist was hired mid-year to support staff and students.

Another action the American River Collegiate Academy staff took was to build on last year’s goal around students feeling like they belonged at school and in late fall administered the SEL survey in which 92% of students reported feeling like they belonged at school.

**Student Study Team Process**  
Rocklin Academy Family of Schools has a tiered system approach for academic, social, emotional, and behavior needs. Part of that process is providing support for students and families with a Student Study Team. An SST is very much data driven with the goal of setting attainable goals to help build support and skills for students with a specific need. During the 2023-24 school year, American River Collegiate Academy offered SSTs for academics, social emotional, behavior, and attendance. In partnership with parents, staff, and support specialists, we have been able to set and monitor student growth in these areas. We have set dates in which to return as a team to review data, growth, and celebrate progress made. These review meetings are typically scheduled 6-8 weeks from the original goal date.

![504 Plans](https://example.com/image.png)

# 504 Plans
Our school supports include serving students eligible for a 504 plan in order to provide equal access to learning and access to all. We work closely with families to review 504 plans annually as a team with staff and parents. At the start of this school year, we identified students with 504 plans and met to review any updates and accommodations to support student learning.

## Special Education
Education Code Section 47641 provides that, for the purpose of federal special education law and for eligibility for federal and state special education funds, a charter school shall be deemed a public school of the local education agency (LEA) that authorized the charter, unless it is itself deemed an LEA. American River Collegiate Academy is their own LEA for purposes of special education and is a member of the El Dorado County Charter Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA).

An Education Specialist, Speech and Language Pathologist and School Psychologists employed by Rocklin Academy Family of Schools provided IEP supports and services to identified students. To address the needs of our students organization-wide, a Behavior Specialist is also on staff. Additional assessments, services, and supports were provided by contracted providers, including School Psychologists, Occupational Therapists and a School Nurse. Assistive technology needs were served by Sail Learning, LLC.

As of census day, October 4, 2023, sixteen students at American River Collegiate Academy were eligible for Special Education, which is approximately 15.2% of the enrollment.

## Mental Health/Counseling
During the 2023-24 school year, a school psychologist actively supported students' mental health and well-being by providing counseling services as outlined in their Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). Additionally, the psychologist implemented Tier 1 and Tier 2 mental health supports, tailored to the diverse needs of the student population, in collaboration with school staff.

To further enhance the school's capacity to address students' mental health needs, American River Collegiate Academy contracted with the community-based organization Wellness Together to provide supplementary mental health and counseling support during April and May. The collaborative partnership between the school psychologist, Wellness Together, and school staff demonstrates a shared commitment to delivering comprehensive and effective mental health services to students, fostering a supportive and conducive learning environment.

![Socioeconomically Disadvantaged](https://example.com/image1.jpg)

## Socioeconomically Disadvantaged
American River Collegiate Academy supports students who are socioeconomically disadvantaged and provide students with support through targeted intervention and instruction. Our academic structure allows for an enrichment block period where students are academically challenged to meet their individual needs. This is a time where no new instruction is provided but rather skills to strengthen academic need are taught and supported. In addition, our SED students are provided school supplies at no cost and access to materials for instructional and recreational purposes. Students are provided technology resources to support at home learning. Our enrichment support specialist pushed into math, reading and writing blocks of instruction to provide additional support and monitoring of progress to students.

## Foster Youth and Homeless
Rocklin Academy Family of Schools has a Foster Youth/Homeless Liaison for each of our school sites that works closely with both Placer and Sacramento County personnel to support these students in a variety of ways. Each school site has posters with local and county liaison contact information that includes educational rights to those experiencing homelessness.

## Gifted and Talented Education (GATE)
In an effort to ensure equity among students, all first and fourth grade students at American River Collegiate Academy were screened for Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) identification in October of the 2023-24 school year. Additionally, parents of students in 2nd and 3rd grades were provided information about how to independently sign their student(s) up to be GATE assessed. American River Collegiate Academy universally screens all 1st and 4th grade students each year for possible GATE identification. American River Collegiate Academy strives to identify and serve gifted and high achieving students from all groups, including those from diverse racial, socioeconomic, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds. Our organization provides highly motivating lessons and differentiated learning opportunities during the regular school day that are based on grade-level standards extended by depth, complexity, and acceleration, which enable students to reach their full academic and personal potential.

## Childcare
American River Collegiate Academy is committed to offering after school childcare for all students. This past year, we offered ELO-P to qualifying students as well as our fee-based program which provided all families an opportunity to receive homework support and enrichment beyond the school day. Our afterschool care was offered 5 days a week and care was provided for 30 additional non-school days including professional learning days, holidays, and summer.

**Technology**  
Each classroom on site is equipped with technology for instruction and learning. Our classrooms have a SMART Board with corresponding SMART technology and each teacher has a laptop for planning and instruction. Students in transitional kindergarten and kindergarten received iPads while our 1st - 4th grade students had 1:1 Chromebook devices and Wi-Fi hotspots were provided to families in need. Each classroom has internet access, headsets for students, a projector, and additional monitors for teachers to maximize instruction.  

**IX. Academic Achievement**  
Student progress at American River Collegiate Academy is continuously monitored using various structures executed with the greatest intent. We are a group of data savvy leaders who embrace and monitor data to drive continuous improvement. Student data was monitored in the classroom through formal and informal assessments. We also recognized the need to monitor the social emotional wellness of students to ensure wrap-around support and services were offered and provided, as needed. Using Essential Standards and Year Long Plans that included common assessments across the grade level and organization, our team was able to use multiple measures to identify and target academic skills and standards requiring follow-up support.  

American River Collegiate Academy is a professional learning community that values data, encourages meaningful professional conversations focused on student learning and outcomes, and utilizes formative and summative assessments to target instruction and individualized student work. Structures used to facilitate those conversations and collaboration include protected professional learning time for goal setting through a collaborative inquiry process. Teachers dedicated time to analyzing data and setting goals to improve student learning.  

During the 2023-24 school year, ARCA’s administration and teachers continued a four-year partnership with Instruction Partners. Instruction Partners is a non-profit coaching organization that works side by side with teachers to support great teaching and accelerate student learning. Through on-site visits, teacher observations, staff interviews, and collaborative meetings with administration, our school team identified ELA planning and instruction as a school wide goal area for the 2023-24 school year and beyond. Throughout the course of the school year, staff collaborated during professional development sessions to refine our ELA Vision that aligned to core values and expectations around providing high quality, rigorous, and well-balanced ELA/Reading instruction. Professional learning and ongoing coaching focused our team in implementing our ELA curriculum in a way that aligned to that vision.

Our daily schedule offered at least 30 minutes of enrichment time to meet the needs of students that would be best met through intervention. Enrichment Block also offers opportunities for continued practice to reach academic goals and/or enrich learning through extension activities. Staff collaboration occurs weekly and is aimed at discussing current support and developing next step action plans. Family collaboration occurs through frequent communication with staff and conferencing opportunities. In November and March, teachers met with families to share report cards and assessment data to ensure they were kept up to date with current progress information and made to be a part of the process to help support students along the learning continuum. Our school and classroom newsletters provided resources to families to support understanding our reporting systems and share avenues to seek clarification and assistance, if needed.

### California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress
California's student assessment system, known as the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP) is based on the Common Core State Standards for English language arts/literacy, mathematics, and science.
- The Smarter Balanced Assessment System measures what students know based on Common Core State Standards for English language arts/literacy and mathematics. Our students in grades 3- 8 and 11 are assessed annually.
- The California Alternate Assessment (CAA) is a standards-based test in ELA, math, and science for students with an individualized education program. The CAA is administered to eligible students annually.
- The California Standards Test for science (CAST) was developed for California public schools and is administered to students in grades 5, 8, and once in high school.
- The Standards-based Tests in Spanish (STS) is for Spanish speaking – English learners. Local educational agencies have the option of administering the STS to Spanish-speaking English learners (ELs) who either were receiving instruction in Spanish or had been enrolled in school in the United States for less than 12 months when testing began.

The following tables show the core academic categories of English/language arts and math and the percentage of students who have met or exceeded the standard in each category for the years CAASPP testing was administered.

The data and information shared above are evidence that American River Collegiate Academy is demonstrating strong academic performance in English language arts and mathematics.

## NWEA Measures of Academic Progress (MAP)
During the 2023-24 school year, American River Collegiate Academy used Measures of Academic Progress® (MAP®) as a tool to assess student learning and to help monitor student progress over the course of the school year. The MAP assessment was implemented to students in grades Kindergarten through fourth grade in the fall, winter, and spring trimesters. Site administration dedicated professional development days for staff to analyze data results, identify areas of growth, and determine the greatest needs for support. School staff worked collaboratively to identify goals and develop next steps to address and support students with targeted instruction aimed at closing gaps. While analyzing data, staff aggregated information in a variety of ways during the 2023-24 school year. Some of these included: single administration period data (i.e., fall performance data), growth data between administration periods (i.e. fall to winter/spring growth data), and subgroup data (SED, EL, SWD).

When it came to overall student growth, gains were observed. Using fall to spring growth data, anticipated RIT growth for all students was projected to be 12.7 points in reading. Actual growth amounted to 13.7 points. This means that American River Collegiate Academy students surpassed anticipated growth at a rate of 107.9%. Similarly, in the area of math, anticipated growth for the “all students” group was 14.6 RIT points. Our average growth in the “all students” group was 18.9, meaning they exceeded their growth goal at 123.9%.

Over the past year, teachers focused on meeting the needs of all students - placing effort on ensuring our students in special populations (SED, EL, and SWD) were closing achievement gaps and making steady academic growth. In both reading and math, all student groups surpassed their anticipated growth goals. Most notably, our socio-economically disadvantaged students made more growth than the “all students” group. It is this type of accelerated growth that we strive for in order to keep reducing and eventually eliminating achievement gaps between our student groups.

**Collaborative Inquiry**  
Rocklin Academy Family of Schools is proud to have Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) working together at each school site. American River Collegiate Academy continued to prioritize the development of our PLC this school year. One component of an effective PLC is to provide a structure for staff to collaborate on effective teaching strategies and instructional practices to improve student outcomes. During the 2023-24 school year, American River Collegiate Academy staff and administration had the opportunity to collaborate with a team of instructional leaders from Instruction Partners, a nonprofit organization that works alongside educators to support equitable access to great instruction. The collaborative work of this partnership helped guide professional learning structures and material throughout the school year. Including, but not limited to, site visits with observations and direct feedback, virtual coaching sessions with live Zoom feedback sessions, the sharing of high-quality research that supported learning targets and goals, and tailored professional learning development materials and resources. For American River Collegiate Academy, this work and collaboration was specifically tied to effective instruction and engagement on foundational reading standards.

The Instruction Partner team provided administrators and teachers with new learning around a unique and detailed Instructional Practice Guide (IPG). This observation tool separates effective teaching into four sections: Aligned Content, Teacher Directed Instruction, Student Practice, and Assessment and Data, and allows for scoring on a four-point rubric. Throughout the school year, the administration engaged in multiple classroom walkthroughs to collect data and track progress around a set of core actions that encompass the shifts in the instructional practices required by our guiding standards, including Common Core. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected during each lesson observation and were used to tailor professional learning and drive instructional coaching.

During the 2023-24 school year, American River Collegiate Academy focused on two IPG indicators. The first was element 2B, which states:

**Questions and tasks require students to use evidence from the text to demonstrate understanding and support their ideas. These ideas are expressed through both written and oral responses.**

The second IPG indicator we focused on was 3c, which states:

**Students provide accurate text evidence to support the explanation of their ideas and display precision in their oral and/or written responses.**

The following data tables reflect the score progression from baseline data, collected in Trimester 1, to the end of coaching data, collected near the end of the school year.

| Indicator | Baseline Rubric Score | End of Coaching Cycle Rubric Score |
|-----------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| 2b        | 1.4, out of 4.0      | 2.3, out of 4                      |
| 2c        | 1.2, out of 4.0      | 1.3, out of 4                      |

The administrative team at American River Collegiate Academy also tracked student NWEA MAP data, aligned to the rollout of professional learning and direct coaching sessions, to gauge the effectiveness of adult learning on student outcomes. The table below outlines the percentage of each student group’s growth goal that was achieved. As you can see, post-targeted professional learning and coaching, students exceeded their growth goals.

### Percentage of Growth Made by All Students

| Student Group                          | Pre-Targeted PL and Coaching Fall to Winter | Post-Targeted PL and Coaching Winter to Spring |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| All Students                           | 82%                                         | 149%                                          |
| Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students | 85%                                         | 189%                                          |
| Multilingual Learners                  | 99%                                         | 113%                                          |
| Students with Disabilities              | 88%                                         | 138%                                          |

### X. Facilities

As you know, we have been working on a long-term facility within the Citrus Heights community since we originally submitted our charter petition back in 2019. We have explored countless options for our cozy school and continue to face challenges in securing a different long-term fiscally viable solution. We have continued to work with our current partners at Temple Or Rishon on enhancing facility and play spaces to provide a learning environment where students will thrive. As we continue with these projects, we’ll provide regular updates as we work to ensure a strong future for our school.

# XI. Governance of Rocklin Academy Family of Schools

The Rocklin Academy is organized as a California nonprofit, public benefit corporation 501(c)(3), and is governed by a Board of Directors pursuant to its bylaws.

The Board is composed of five voting members: Doug Johnson, Alice Dowdin-Calvillo, Tim Klotz, Larry Stieber and Adam Schwarz. In addition, four non-voting Teacher Advisors served on the Board from across the organization.

During the 2023-24 school year, the Board met thirteen times to conduct its business. Part of each agenda is an opportunity for public input, as well as a report from the Parent School Partnership.

- Financial audit oversight
- All matters related to charter approval, amendment, or revocation

The Board continues to improve its ability to operate as a performance-based organization by setting specific goals and measurable objectives while allowing management the flexibility to achieve these goals. The Board currently uses various assessments to review the academic success of the school including the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) and the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP). The Board delegates the implementation of all policies to the administration of the school, the superintendent, and the principal.

The Rocklin Academy Family of Schools Board has financial audit oversight of the school. An annual independent fiscal audit of the books and records of The Rocklin Academy is conducted as required under the Charter Schools Act, section 47605(b)(5)(I) and 47605(m). The books, records, and audit are kept in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The audits are conducted in accordance with applicable provisions within the California Code of Regulations governing audits of charter schools.

Ongoing Evaluation and Assessment of The Rocklin Academy

The Board of Directors evaluates the ongoing operations of Rocklin Academy throughout the year and through a range of vehicles. This includes the review of student performance information and ongoing analysis of student testing data. Annually, Rocklin Academy reviews progress toward the goals identified in the Strategic Plan and the Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP).

XII. Financial Audit

Budget

The financial statements of the American River Collegiate Academy are included within the organization-wide financial statements for the Rocklin Academy. Each school is tracked separately and presented separately within our organization-wide financial statements. At the Rocklin Academy we believe that budgets are “living documents” and are regularly adjusted at the site level through the direction of the principal in collaboration with the back-office support. This is a collaborative process between the educational needs at the site and balancing financial resources through the organization level.

At the June 17, 2024, Board meeting, our Board approved the budget and multi-year projection for the 2024-25 school year and two subsequent fiscal years. The budget continues to support the fact that we will meet our financial obligations and covenants for

| **Total** | **146** | **165** | **180** |

Our out-year enrollment projections include revenue and expense assumptions for our current facility and adding another classroom. We are currently estimating a positive fund balance, using inter-fund transfers, to ensure that students have sufficient resources and cash balances to meet our site level obligations. We are projecting a positive ending fund balance (above the 5% REU) through all fiscal years as well as positive cash flows for all months and fiscal years.

**XIV. Staff Recruitment**

Rocklin Academy Family of Schools (RAFOS) has taken several additional measures to address the statewide staffing shortage crisis. In collaboration with other charter partners, RAFOS created and launched the Charter School Collaborative Career Fair where organizations recruited candidates for both certificated and classified positions. This successful event was created for Sacramento, Placer, and Yolo counties and will be held annually. In addition, RAFOS participated in several job fairs and events in Sacramento County including the Multicultural Business and Career Expo and the Sacramento County Office of Education Career Fair. To build our relationships within Sacramento County, and connect with other schools, our team attended the CCAC (Credential Counselors and Analysts of California) Conference. Most recently, we partnered with the Sacramento County Office of Education and their Teacher Residency Program (TRP) which has increased collaboration and the partnership between our organizations. With our aligned mission to develop and retain quality teachers from diverse backgrounds who are inclusive of all students, SCOE and RAFOS are placing TRP candidates in our schools. In an effort to recruit from our local community in Citrus Heights, we included staffing opportunities at local community events we attended including National Night Out and Citrus Heights Sunday Funday.
<!-- Page 45 -->
# XV. Parental Engagement

American River Collegiate Academy values the importance of community connection and involvement. Families are encouraged to be a part of the school community through communications, events, and as members of our Parent School Partnership group. Our “Otter News” weekly update was shared with families every Wednesday through our organization's communication platform (ParentSquare) and was logged and kept available on our school’s website throughout the school year. Classroom teachers consistently sent weekly communication to families to ensure they were kept informed about school and classroom business, as well as provide them with learning activities to complete in the event their student was absent from school.

## American River Collegiate Academy Parent School Partnership (PSP)

At American River Collegiate Academy, we believe that parents are valued partners in strengthening our school’s program. During the 2023-24 school year, we had a strong Parent School Partnership (PSP) Board that supported the school with fundraising efforts and planning/hosting a number of community focused family events. The PSP helps to build community at school and develop connections between the school and community. This year’s PSP board and parent support group continued to build upon the foundation and traditions that were established in 2020-21. Before the school year began, the PSP Board identified multiple goal areas to support the school including school and classroom support, fundraising, and school culture. Additionally, they identified areas of targeted support in developing the Art Docent Program, funding classroom budgets, hosting teacher appreciation week, and holding at least two school/community events. Through the works listed (see below) it is clear that the 2023-24 PSP Board met these targeted areas of support and exceeded expectations by providing additional school events for families. Due to the success of our family engagement in our events, our Annual Giving Campaign, and school fundraisers, which were held in the Citrus Heights area, the Board was able to increase the budget in these prioritized areas for the 2023-24 school year.

### Highlights of Parent Involvement and Engagement Activities:
- All positions filled on the PSP Board
- Fall festival and Spring Fling committees with parent volunteers and student support from local high schools
- School events: Fall Festival, Holiday Movie and Craft Night, Family Movie Night, Spring Fling, Family Fundraiser Nights at local restaurants, Core Knowledge Showcase Art Docent Gallery and Snack Station, End of Year Otter Party with shaved ice truck, Teacher Appreciation Week and more!

# Parent/Guardian Survey

As one piece of the engagement process, Rocklin Academy Family of Schools has gathered input through several surveys this year. The Intent to Return Survey had an impressive 100% participation rate, and the data is outlined below.

## Annual Intent to Return Survey:

## Community Engagement Initiative (CEI)
Rocklin Academy Family of Schools participated in their second year with California's Community Engagement Initiative through the California Collaborative of Educational Excellence (CCEE). Staff and families continued through their problem of practice: *The two-way communication between families and teachers is not as effective and equitable as we want it to be. If improved, we will see benefits for our students and their education outcomes.* Strategies incorporated at American River Collegiate Academy include welcome stations at parent-teacher conferences with coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and a card writing station for parents to write a card to their child, teacher, or staff member, restructured new family orientation with an emphasis on families engaging with one another, sharing their why and making connections while also providing an opportunity to explore programmatic resources.

In addition to the site-specific strategies at American River Collegiate Academy, a PSP Collective was established where all PSPs across Rocklin Academy Family of Schools meet with the Superintendent and Director of Finance to establish and work on shared priorities including family engagement and communication.

## XVI. Community Engagement
During the 2023-24 school year, American River Collegiate Academy staff and families continued to partner with our broader community. In August we proudly sponsored a booth at the Citrus Heights National Night Out Event where we were able to connect with current and prospective students and families and share information about our organization and school. Additionally, we participated in the Citrus Heights PAL’s Trunk or Treat event and

the city’s Sunday Funday festival. This was a great way to connect and share the strength of our Core Knowledge school and what we have to offer to the city. We also regularly attended and participated in the Citrus Heights Neighborhood Association meetings and Citrus Heights Chamber meetings and events. We are thrilled that the local community is offering more in-person events, and we will continue to be actively involved with our local community.

**XVII. Support from Sacramento County Office of Education**  
**Our Authorizer**  
Sacramento County Board of Education’s role as the authorizer of American River Collegiate Academy’s charter is very important, and we recognize the support provided by the Sacramento County Office of Education and Board of Trustees since the approval of the charter in March 2020 and the support it has received from administration and staff. American River Collegiate Academy’s staff have found great value in attending the multitude of trainings, workshops, and collaborative meetings offered by SCOE, including the Multilingual Education Leadership Network meetings, the Transitional Kindergarten Network, the Capital Regional Assessment Network meetings, State and Federal Programs meetings, and the LCAP workshops.

![Progress Goal One](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1086.png?text=Progress+Goal+One)

**PROGRESS GOAL ONE**

We are excited to share our progress that has been made in Goal One as we strive to ensure all students are building depth of understanding in core concepts through an equitable and cohesive education program. Through this work, our Leadership Team has continued our learning around grading and assessment systems with the goal of accurately reporting grades and progress on grade level standards. Our research has included parent feedback, researching best practices in the field of education, as well as seeking input from our educational partners to ensure we can accurately assess grade level standard mastery as well as clearly communicate progress to students and parents. In an effort to communicate progress, NWEA MAP data and ELPAC Summative scores have been added to elementary report cards.

This year, we adopted Core Knowledge Language Arts (CKLA), Version 2, Language Studio in grades K-5 as well as began a three year partnership with Instruction Partners to ensure fidelity of implementation of the new curriculum while also defining high quality Tier I instruction aligned to grade level standards as well as unit and lesson internalization guides. The Leadership Team has facilitated grade level unit and lesson internalization, a focus on guided discourse related to priority questions within lessons, as well as observation and feedback to support and enhance learning within the new curriculum. In addition, Enrichment Blocks have been restructured around the integration of Language Studio, a companion to CKLA, which provides daily designated English Language Development instruction for our English Language Learners.

In alignment, our secondary program provided multiple professional development sessions on Integrated EL instructional and support strategies with a focus on reducing barriers on content area vocabulary and prior knowledge. Furthermore, Western Sierra 11th and 12th grade students are providing after school tutoring and academic guidance four days a week to support all students’ academic success.

The RAFOS Preschool-Kindergarten team has continued their learning around early education as universal TK will be offered to all 4 year olds in 2025. This team piloted three Social Emotional Learning curriculums this year and are moving forward with Slumberkins as it is designed to meet the learning and engagement needs of 4 year olds and aligns to the components of TK Learning Foundations from CDE: Self, Social Interaction, and Relationships.

We are proud of the work we have accomplished this year and look forward to continuing to expand upon our equitable and cohesive academic program to ensure all students are building a depth of understanding of core concepts.

<!-- Page 63 -->
![Progress Goal Two](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1086.png?text=Progress+Goal+Two)

**PROGRESS GOAL TWO**

As an organization, the focus this year has centered around creating a safe and inclusive school community centered on compassion and empathy. We have conducted both Leadership and whole staff training on the power of leading with empathy with a focus on Brene Brown’s four attributes of empathy: perspective taking, staying out of judgment, recognizing emotions and communication. Empathy contributes to positive outcomes including innovation, engagement, retention, inclusivity and work-life balance.

At the site level, we have continued the implementation of our Social Emotional Curriculum and enhanced both Gator and Pack Time lessons that hone in on essential skills of the CASEL Wheel, including self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making. In an effort to continue to create opportunities to develop college and career readiness skills, Western Sierra counselors hosted a college application summer camp available to all seniors as well as a College Night for grades 7-12 with breakout sessions including financial aid, STEM majors and more! In addition, Gateway hosted a Career Fair for middle school students where students presented career research boards and parents volunteered to share their career paths and education with students.

Along with these opportunities, we are continually looking at ways to expand student leadership programs in ways that promote community and Western Sierra developed two programs this year including after school tutoring and a buddy program. After school tutoring was offered to all students Monday through Thursday from 3:30 to 4:30 PM in the College and Career Center. High school students earned community service hours and students were paired up with these upperclassmen based on their academic needs. Our Wolf Pack Buddy Program.

**Text Content:**

consisted of thirty 10th grade students paired up with thirty new 7th grade students first connecting at orientation by getting to know their buddies, taking them on a tour of the campus, helping them learn how to use their lockers and explaining what a typical day at Western Sierra is like. Throughout the school year, they met up once a month to play games and do crafts together. The 10th graders earned community service hours and the 7th graders benefited from connecting with an upperclassman they wouldn’t normally get to spend time with - helping to build a bridge between our high school and middle school programs. The work in Goal Two is vital to student academic, behavioral and emotional growth and we are eager to continue the work to ensure we are creating an inclusive school environment for every student.

![Progress Goal Three](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1086.png?text=Progress+Goal+Three)

**PROGRESS GOAL THREE**

We are pleased to share the strides made in Goal Three of our strategic plan. Our efforts in recruitment and collaboration have highlighted our commitment to hiring stellar staff and further developing partnerships with the greater community.

Our recruitment initiatives have been amplified through active participation in various job fairs and community outreach events across Placer and Sacramento Counties. Notably, RAFOS partnered with another charter organization to host the second annual Charter School Collaborative Career Fair for Sacramento, Placer, and Yolo counties, which saw the participation of over 13 charter schools and organizations. This event proved to be a resounding success! Our increased presence in such events has contributed significantly to our goal of building a diverse staff and collaborative ties with educational stakeholders.

These initiatives have also served to bring awareness of charter schools to a wider audience, and enhance awareness and understanding of what charter schools and organizations are.

This year, RAFOS partnered with the Sacramento Office of Education, hosting a teacher resident, and supporting SCOE’s newly launched Teacher Residency Program. This collaboration not only facilitated the expansion of our teaching staff but also fostered our partnership with SCOE. Additionally, our outreach efforts have led to positive interactions with multiple credential programs spanning across California. As a result, several student teachers from these programs are completing their education with the invaluable support of our schools, furthering our commitment to nurturing talent and supporting staff.

A comprehensive certificated compensation study was conducted this year. The RAFOS Compensation Design Team, comprising diverse certificated staff perspectives, meticulously analyzed data, prioritized needs, and generated innovative ideas. To ensure inclusivity and transparency, these findings were shared with all certificated staff through in-person, site-level focus group meetings, alongside twenty-nine individual interviews and an in-depth survey. The collaborative process culminated in the recommendation and subsequent approval by the Board of a revised salary structure and schedule, reflective of our unwavering dedication to fostering equitable compensation practices.

We take immense pride in the significant strides achieved in Goal Three, which demonstrates our relentless pursuit of continuous growth and sustainability.

![Progress Goal Four](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1086.png?text=Progress+Goal+Four)

**PROGRESS GOAL FOUR**

We have continued to make great growth in Goal Four, focused on family engagement to strengthen our schools and programs. This year, we continued to focus on two-way communication with our families. We implemented ParentSquare, a new communication tool, which has increased accessibility of school-to-home communication. As an app-based program, families can select how they wish to receive information from the school, and can select their primary language to receive translated communication.

We continued with our work with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence’s Community Engagement Initiative (CCEE/CEI), this year, adding a student leader to the team of parent, school site, organization, and Placer County Office of Education leaders. Along with other schools and districts across the state, this team engaged in deep learning on best practices in family and community engagement, implemented strategies based on that learning, and shared successful strategies with leaders across the organization to be replicated. The CCEE/CEI team brainstormed simple shifts in current structures of family engagement that could increase the opportunities for trust to be built through two-way communication between families and school staff. Professional Learning was piloted to support teachers in effectively communicating with families. Innovative strategies were implemented in new family onboarding, as well in welcoming current families back to campus, starting the year off by setting a tone that values parents’ voice and expertise. At the elementary level, Parent/Teacher Conferences provided an opportunity to connect with families around their student success, and parent input was gathered to shape those conversations. Data collected showed that these strategies helped to increase family engagement and built stronger relationships between the schools and parents. The two-year CCEE/CEI program has come to an end, but the learning will be long lasting, and growth will continue through collaboration across the sites. 

| 16 |
<!-- Page 70 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1086.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

To enhance effective, two-way communication between families and the school, a new communication tool is being considered to help track and collect data on the level of engagement with communication and newsletters, and to provide equitable and easy access for families to information provided by the school.

The Parent School Partnership (PSP) Boards from each campus collaborated together in several facilitated sessions, focusing on examining current structures and systems, and reimagining how PSPs could support the school through diversifying and unifying parent involvement across each site. This collaboration allowed for unified goals, time for collaboration, and opportunities for collective problem solving. PSPs from each site will continue to meet together regularly, which will support parent leaders in continuing to lead family engagement work at our schools.

We are proud of the work we have done in engaging with our families and communities to best support our students, and look forward to continuing to strengthen our relationships by finding opportunities for true, authentic two-way communication.

<!-- Page 72 -->
![Progress Goal Five](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1086.png?text=Progress+Goal+Five)

**PROGRESS GOAL FIVE**

We are excited to share our continued progress on Goal Five, focusing on the sustainability of our organization. Last year we spent a significant amount of time and effort in marketing and branding of our organization. We revised our messaging efforts to further clarify that we are a tuition free public charter school and our parent information meetings highlighted our amazing Core Knowledge Curriculum that has proven to support students in their learning. Our continued efforts in marketing and messaging has led to an increase in our number of applications this year, as well as an increase to the number of students on our wait lists at all schools. We are looking forward to the start of school this coming school year and to evaluate our recruitment efforts.

As we continue to grow at American River Collegiate Academy and with the expansion of Transitional Kindergarten, the pressure on our facilities continues to grow. We know that securing long-term, low-cost facilities is crucial to our sustainability as an organization and are very proud of the efforts we have put forward this year in our search for facilities and identifying multiple plans to expand learning opportunities. Some of the key actions we have taken this year are continuing to explore potential facilities for American River. Though we have not yet identified a long-term permanent plan, we are grateful for our continued partnership with Temple Or Rishon who has proven to be very supportive of our students. We are also continuing our efforts on the lease at Gateway as well as a long term plan for the lot next to Western Sierra Collegiate Academy.

Our continued growth at our school sites further supports the need for continued advocacy within our communities as those efforts can help shape policy decisions, secure funding, build community support and promote innovation in education. We have continued to build on our strong relationships with our authorizers and community organizations. We are on track with our progress on Goal 5 and are confident in our ability to sustain a high quality learning experience for all students.
