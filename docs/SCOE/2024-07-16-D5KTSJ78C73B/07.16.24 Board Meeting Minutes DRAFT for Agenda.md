The Career Pipeline Summer Career Paths to Success program provided 124 high school students with 40 hours of training in mental health and wellness, 21st Century workplace skills, financial literacy, post-secondary options, and peer mentoring. Each of these students received a $1,000 stipend.

During the last three weeks of June 2024, the “Game On” Exploring Careers program served 18 students from Nathaniel S. Colley, Elinor L. Hickey, and Leo A. Palmiter high schools. Students participated in hands-on career exploration activities in numerous industry sectors and career pathways. Students who completed the program received their food handlers’ certificate and course credit, in addition to a stipend.  

In collaboration with our Career Pipeline Program, 17 students from our SCOE Community Schools and Senior Extension Programs were introduced to careers in mental health and wellness, planning for the future, career exploration, and techniques for building healthy relationships through Mentor California.

The Extended School Year (ESY) program at Leo A. Palmiter provided an opportunity for students to recover lost credits or get ahead in their studies. Students engaged in hands-on learning by working in the garden, used the produce to explore culinary skills, and engaged in competitions. Our Foundations Academy ESY Program at Cyril Spinelli Elementary School provided targeted literacy and math support to students. In addition to academic instruction, students engaged in science, social skills, and art activities.

At the Hillsdale Head Start program, we continued to offer full inclusion with SCOE staff support ending on July 3. Due to the Head Start programs in the south area being closed for the summer, SCOE offered a Special Day Class program at Fairsite Preschool focusing on sensory and social skills. And at the other Foundations sites, programs were fully staffed. Community-Based Instruction continued at many sites.

**RECOGNITION AND NEWS**  
The California Department of Health Care Access and Information awarded SCOE a “Certified Wellness Coach Employer Support” grant. Funding will partially fund family navigators who will act as liaisons between families, public health, and educational systems in support of our School-Based Mental Health and Wellness program.

The California Department of Education awarded SCOE a two-year “California Serves” grant to be implemented in partnership with educators from San Juan Unified School District and Gateway Community Charters.

During the last week of June, a collaboration across Early Learning, Curriculum and Instruction, Expanded Learning, and Multilingual Education brought together 150 educators ranging from PK through Grade 2 from the County for the “Joyful Literacy Institute.” As a component of our Sacramento County READS Literacy Initiative, participants received trade books and resources to implement repeated interactive read-alouds. Attendees also engaged in learning activities for language and literacy development, which included foundational literacy skills. Through a special grant, the School of Ed’s 21CSLA collectively partnered to provide funding for some of the books as well as the keynote speaker, Minh Le (author of ‘Drawn Together’ – which is one of the culturally-affirming books that was provided).

Through a partnership with the Elk Grove Unified School District’s Civic Summer program, five high school interns started their three-week internship at SCOE on July 8. Three of the interns attend Pleasant Grove High School and the other two attend Sheldon High School.
