**Civic Learning in Grades 1-8:**  
**Creating Pathways for the State Seal of Civic Engagement**  

**Purpose:**  
Require public school districts to establish pathways for civic education in grades 1-8. In addition, requires civic learning resources and support for teachers to set specific learning objectives for students, including understanding the Constitution and actively engaging with democratic institutions at least once in grades 1-6 and once in grades 7-8.

**Background**  
In October 2017, then-Governor Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 24 into law. The law required the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to recommend to the State Board of Education (SBE) criteria for awarding a State Seal of Civic Engagement (SSCE) to pupils who have demonstrated excellence in civic education and participation and an understanding of the United States Constitution, the California Constitution, and the democratic system of government.

On September 10, 2020, the SBE adopted criteria and guidance to award a State Seal of Civic Engagement to California students in public schools, grades 11 and 12, who demonstrate excellence in civics education and participation, including an understanding of the United States Constitution, the California Constitution, and the democratic system of government.

According to the law, it is the intent of the Legislature to establish a State Seal of Civic Engagement to encourage and create pathways for pupils in elementary and secondary schools to become civically engaged in democratic governmental institutions at the local, state, and national levels.

However, there currently is no requirement for elementary and middle schools to establish a pathway for students to become civically engaged in democratic governmental institutions in order to prepare them to meet the criteria to earn the State Seal of Civic Engagement in grades 11 or 12.

**Benefits**  
To promote civic engagement by encouraging and establishing pathways for elementary and secondary school pupils to actively participate in democratic governmental institutions at various levels. Additionally, this would underscore the need for earlier preparation in elementary and middle schools, creating a foundation for students to meet the criteria for the SSCE in later grades.

CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE— 2023–2024 REGULAR SESSION  
SENATE BILL NO. 1094  

Introduced by Senator Limón  
(Coauthor: Assembly Member Pellerin)  

February 12, 2024  

An act to amend Sections 51210 and 51220 of the Education Code, relating to pupil instruction.  

LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST  

SB 1094, as introduced, Limón. Pupil instruction: course of study: social sciences: civic engagement.  

Existing law requires the adopted course of study for grades 1 to 6, inclusive, and the adopted course of study for grades 7 to 12, inclusive, to include certain areas of study, including, among others, social sciences. Existing law requires instruction in social sciences to provide a foundation for understanding, among other things, the history, resources, development, and government of California and the United States of America.  

This bill, with respect to both of the above-referenced adopted courses of study, would explicitly require instruction in social sciences to also include principles of democracy and the State and Federal Constitutions. The bill would also require pupils, at least once while in either grade 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and at least once while in either grade 7 or 8, to complete one civic engagement or experience with a governmental institution at the local, state, or national level, as provided. To the extent that this bill would create new duties for local educational agencies or local officials, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.  

The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.  

This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.
