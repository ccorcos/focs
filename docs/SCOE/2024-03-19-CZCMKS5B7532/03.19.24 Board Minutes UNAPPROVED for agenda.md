**PROGRAM RECOGNITION**  
On March 12, we celebrated our 2024 Sacramento County Teachers of the Year at the Sacramento Kings game. The event was co-sponsored by Jamba Juice, and their staff and the Kings staff did a wonderful job of honoring our teachers. One lucky teacher, Lyndsay Hall (from Robla School District), was selected to go on court to do timed free throws. She made all three shots earning herself Jamba smoothies for a year, plus a free smoothie for everyone attending the game. Thank you to Vice President Brown, and Trustees Ahola, Davis, and Corona Sabeniano for attending.

Also last week, SCOE joined Friends of Sacramento Arts at the Heroes of Arts Education Gala where extraordinary arts teachers and educators throughout Sacramento County were honored, including our own Dr. Steve Winlock who received a very special award. Thank you, Board President Lefkovitz and Vice President Brown for being there.

**LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES**  
During the week of March 18–22, 2024, Friday Night Live and Club Live chapters are organizing schoolwide events for the National Alcohol and Drug Facts Week where students will facilitate activities to educate their peers in an engaging and fun way.

Also, our College and Career Readiness team kicked off their second annual Counselor Spring Institute at California State University, Sacramento, yesterday. The program included Dr. Steve Winlock and Assistant Superintendent Jackie White facilitating a California County Superintendents Region 3 Arts Convening to address Prop 28 implementation and the intersection of Arts and Social Emotional Learning. Today there was a panel discussion about women in non-traditional occupations moderated by Cristina Mendonsa. The guests included influential women leaders who spoke about overcoming challenges, having grit, being resilient, and leadership. Thank you, Board President Lefkovitz for attending the event, and Board Student Liaison Marquez for participating in several of the counseling professional learning sessions, as well as the Arts Convening.

On March 22, in collaboration with the K16 Dual Enrollment collaborative, SCOE will hold a convening to enhance access to Dual Enrollment in the Sacramento Region at the Rancho Cordova City Hall.
