## Highlights of the 2023-2024 LCAP

Fortune is committed to serving disadvantaged students with 62% African American youth and 74% socioeconomically disadvantaged students enrolled during the 2022-2023 school year, compared to the state averages of 5% African American and 62% socioeconomically disadvantaged students. To address the unique needs of their students, Fortune focuses their LCAP goals on three key areas; 1) closing the achievement gap, 2) providing safe, welcoming, and rigorous learning environments, and 3) providing nurturing communities that engage and support students.

In 2023-2024, Fortune allocated nearly $18.5M to fund schoolwide actions targeting students with the lowest academic achievement. Prioritizing lower teacher-student ratios, more instructional aides, small-group instruction, and longer instructional days are intended to provide more individualized student support at all grade levels. High school students receive the support they need.

### 2023-24 LCAP Goal 1

**Maintain classrooms that close the achievement gap.** This is a broad goal that includes four dashboard indicators: ELA, Math, College and Career, and English Learner Progress. It also includes a locally designed metric: the percentage of seniors who graduate with their associate degree.

---

### Progress Toward Meeting LCAP Goal 1

Fortune includes six actions under LCAP Goal 1. The actions focus on instruction, English language learner programs, and course offerings with an emphasis on college courses and dual enrollment. The metrics used to measure progress towards meeting Goal 1 include the California School Dashboard Academic Indicators in ELA, math, and science, measures of English Learner progress, and the percentage of 12th grade students with college credit.

The following executive summary of the 2022-2023 Annual LCAP Metric Outcomes for LCAP Goal 1 provides specific evidence of progress in providing an academic program that results in academic growth. Although overall targets in ELA, math, and science were not met in 2022-2023, the African American and English Learner student groups met the target in math by scoring yellow on the Math Academic Indicator. This is a notable achievement considering African American youth statewide were the lowest performing ethnic student group on the Math Academic Indicator, and Fortune serves the highest percentage of African American youth statewide at 62% of the student population.¹

Additionally, Fortune’s performance on the College and Career Indicator significantly exceeds the statewide average with 76% of Fortune high school students prepared for college and career compared to 43.9% statewide.

When making comparisons of student groups between Fortune and Sacramento County, it is important to note that 62% of Fortune students identify as African American and 22% identify as Hispanic accounting for 84% of the total student population. A comparison of academic performance in Sacramento County illustrates Fortune’s African American students perform similarly in ELA to African American students countywide and Fortune’s Latino students outperformed their peers in ELA. In math, both African American and Latino students outperformed their peers in Sacramento County.

Fortune prioritizes the academic achievement of all students and aims to provide students with the individualized support they need to close achievement gaps. In the 2022-2023 school year, Fortune piloted Fortune Rise as an afterschool high dosage tutoring program in ELA and math. The results of the pilot were positive as reported by Fortune. In total 431 scholars were eligible based on test scores, and 236 scholars participated. The scholars who did not participate had a baseline achievement level of 40% meeting state standards, and those who did participate had a slightly lower baseline of 37%. Those who did not participate declined by 9% in proficiency over the course of the year. In contrast, the scholars who participated in Fortune Rise grew by 5% in proficiency. The result was a net 14% gain by scholars who participated compared to their eligible peers who did not participate.

A comparison of i-Ready assessment results from the beginning of the year 2023-2024 to the Fall of 2023-2024 demonstrates growth in reading and math at every grade level except for reading at Grade 7. The i-Ready assessment results provide Fortune leaders and teachers with information about the progress students are making over time including details about specific skills students may be missing so instruction can be adjusted to meet individual student needs. Fortune implements the i-Ready assessments each trimester at each grade level to identify students who will benefit from interventions during the school day. Interventions are designed to accelerate learning through the alignment of customized instruction using i-Ready instructional materials that are identified to meet individual student needs based on their i-Ready assessment results.

# 2023-2024 LCAP Goal 2
**Support schools that are safe, aligned with state standards, and welcoming. This is a broad goal that includes facilities maintenance, course offerings, and behavior management. Progress toward meeting LCAP Goal 2**

Fortune lists 10 actions under Goal 2. The actions focus on teacher and leadership professional development, instructional materials, music and art education, English Learner support, facilities, partnership with parents.

The following executive summary of the 2022-2023 Annual LCAP metric outcomes for LCAP Goal 2 shows a continued commitment in providing a safe and welcoming school environment aligned with state standards. An annual survey of students, parents, and teachers confirmed that the majority feel safe at school. Students have access to standards-aligned curriculum and instruction as evidence during site visits.

Although 100% of teachers may not be fully credentialed due to the current teacher shortage, Fortune is committed to hiring qualified teachers through a wide range of approaches. Human Resources staff attend university job fairs and community hiring events. Fortune hosts its own job fairs monthly from January through August and posts all openings on a wide variety of social media platforms. Fortune has partnerships with teacher training programs through local agencies where candidates are sourced. Most importantly, Fortune operates its own teacher credentialing program which launched a Fortune Teacher Fellows Program in January 2024, establishing a cohort of teachers to serve in Fortune schools.

A priority focus for the 2023-2024 school year is reducing the suspension rate through alternatives to suspension. Fortune leaders are actively communicating the belief that rather than suspending students, “we need to give them the skills that they need to help scholars understand the harm done by their actions and to allow them an opportunity to repair this harm and learn from their actions.” Fortune’s focus on student discipline and social-emotional learning dates back to 2016. Fortune’s history includes training around federal discipline guidelines, implementing social.

emotional learning curriculum, piloting anti-bullying programming, providing Crisis Prevention & Intervention Training (CPI) for Behavior Techs across the organization, piloting Life Skills 911 programming, establishing Fathers of Fortune, and conducting annual legal reviews of Fortune’s Discipline Matrix to ensure consistency with California Education Code.

In 2021-2022, when students returned to campus, they exhibited difficulty adjusting to campus culture which led to a higher number of suspensions. Fortune responded immediately by establishing a partnership with the Center for Fathers and Families. In the 2022-2023 school year, a pilot of Life Skills 911 course was launched. The pilot was successful in reducing referrals which led to two more cohorts of Life Skills 911 during the 2022-2023 school year. In January 2023, a Discipline Matrix Task Force was created to begin identifying alternatives to suspension and interventions to improve student behavior. In March 2023, a variety of stakeholder engagement activities were conducted to create an organizational priority on campus culture. The Fortune Board of Directors adopted a 2023-2024 Budget that included initiatives to reduce suspensions and improve campus culture. During the summer and fall of 2023, the Discipline Matrix Task Force held regular meetings to review the Discipline Matrix in detail to modify consequences and to organize infractions into appropriate categories. In August 2023, Fortune partnered with the Center for Council to implement Restorative Circles. Restorative Circles were previewed during the leadership retreat, and then all staff received training during the Summer Symposium to learn how to implement this alternative to suspension. The contract with the Center for Fathers and Families was renewed to offer Life Skills 911 training across all middle and high school campuses. In November 2023, the Fortune Board of Directors approved a revised Discipline Matrix. The rollout of the new matrix began during the winter of 2023.

Fortune implements Second Step, a social emotional learning curriculum, in preschool through Grade 8 which is designed to reduce impulsive, high-risk, and aggressive behaviors and increase children's social competence and other protective factors. Students engage in weekly lessons to help them acquire the skills, knowledge, and mindsets needed to persevere through challenges. They also learn to set and achieve goals, handle strong emotions, better understand and connect with others, and resolve interpersonal conflicts. Aligned with the Second Step curriculum, Fortune also utilizes the Character Counts’ Six Pillars of Character (trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship) as a framework for teaching character traits to help students become good citizens.

In addition to the social emotional learning curriculum and programs used to teach students skills to manage emotions and resolve conflict, Fortune has also instituted a new practice of community building through Community Circles to help classrooms and schools become a community where scholars feel safe to share their emotions and resolve conflicts peacefully with the support of adults. With training and support from the Center for Council, Fortune has dedicated 30 minutes of the bell schedule for social-emotional learning to include a community circle where students respond to a prompt in a systematic way to allow them to feel heard and create a sense of community. As students engage in morning community circles, the goal is students will generalize the skills within Restorative Circles.

# 2023-2024 LCAP Goal 3
Nurture communities of engagement and support. This is a broad goal that includes our engagement with scholars and their families both inside and outside of school.

## Progress toward meeting LCAP Goal 3
Fortune lists six actions under Goal 3. The actions focus on creating communities of engagement and support that result in families being informed and empowered to help their children persevere in school through graduation.

The following executive summary of the 2022-2023 Annual LCAP metric outcomes for LCAP Goal 3 shows opportunities for continued improvement in increasing attendance rates and decreasing chronic absenteeism. While Fortune made significant improvement in chronic absenteeism in 2022-2023, decreasing the rate over 22 percentage points to 38.1%, they are committed to decreasing chronic absenteeism further through targeted communication and outreach strategies. Attendance rates have continued to improve since the pandemic with the target of 94% anticipated in the 2023-2024 school year.

Fortune continues to realize success in preparing students for college and career by meeting graduation rate targets and ensuring graduates are enrolled in a 4-year college. In 2022-2023, 27% of Fortune’s graduates earned an associate degree while attending high school, 91% applied to a 4-year college, 82% were accepted into a 4-year college, and 32% of graduates earned a full-ride scholarship.

Fortune’s Chronic Absenteeism Rate Indicator on the 2023 Dashboard was yellow indicating significant growth since last year, a decline of 22%. Fortune remains focused on reducing chronic absenteeism with intention and partners with Attention to Attendance (A2A) to ensure timely communication with parents and guardians to communicate the importance of regular attendance at school. Letters are sent to all students who exceed a certain number of unexcused absences. Fortune schedules virtual and in-person School Attendance Review Team (SART) meetings for any student with five or more unexcused absences. Additionally, weekly outreach to families is conducted by staff for students with three or more consecutive absences. If staff are unable to contact families to understand the context, then principals attempt to contact families. Information regarding Fortune’s Short Term Independent Study (IS) program is provided when it could serve as an appropriate solution.

Finally, Fortune’s Independent Study team is making targeted efforts to enroll students in this program by sending daily emails and texts to families when there is an absence. Parents receive a personal link to submit a request for Independent Study as an alternative to consecutive absences. Our Independent Study teachers work with families to connect with students and help them complete their work for attendance credit. As of December 6, 2023, the Independent Study team has prevented 1,265 student absences during the 2023-24 school year and the numbers are anticipated to rise.

**LCAP Summary**

An analysis of the 2023-24 LCAP reflects a commitment by Fortune leaders to take targeted and deliberate actions that are designed to reverse the disproportionate impact the pandemic and post-pandemic years have had on the academic achievement and social-emotional well-being of their student population which consists of 62% African American and 22% Hispanic youth.

Fortune’s partnerships with the Center for Fathers and Families and the Center for Council to implement Restorative Circles is evidence of their ongoing fidelity to the process of developing a culture that is safe, welcoming, nurturing, engaging, and rigorous that is supported by knowledgeable and competent staff capable of helping their students develop the skills to understand their actions and to allow them an opportunity to repair any harm they may have caused to others and to learn from their actions.

**Differentiated Assistance**

Fortune School is eligible for differentiated assistance. The performance criteria for charter schools are the same as districts and COEs, except charter schools must meet the criteria based on their performance in 2023 and 2022. Fortune is eligible for differentiated assistance based on the performance of the following student groups on the 2022 and 2023 Dashboards:

Differentiated assistance determinations for charter schools are made annually and are eligible for a one-year support cycle. Differentiated assistance is intended to help charter schools address the underlying causes that led to its eligibility for assistance and strengthen their overall ability to evaluate the effectiveness of programs and adjust, as appropriate, to improve student outcomes. Charter schools are eligible for technical assistance from the COE in which they are located unless the COE is the authorizer in which case the Geographic Lead Agency offers support. Given that SCOE is a Geographic Lead Agency in partnership with Placer County Office of Education, Fortune is eligible for technical assistance from the Placer County Office of Education.

### III. KEY DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AND ENROLLMENT

#### Admissions Practices

The Fortune School of Education admissions and lottery process begins with the completion of a student application submitted with the following required documents: proof of birth date, proof of residency, immunization records, and physical examination (for TK/K only). Fortune School of Education enrolls all students who submit complete applications unless the number of applications exceeds the charter school's capacity. In the event the number of students seeking admission to any grade level exceeds capacity, a lottery is held. During the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school years, no lotteries were held at any Sacramento County campuses.

Fortune may grant priority in admissions to current students and residents of Sacramento County, as provided under the law when the lottery was conducted. The school may also grant admission preference to siblings of existing pupils and children of school faculty, provided students admitted under any such preference do not constitute more than 10% of the school’s total enrollment. Currently enrolled students do not participate in the random drawing, as they are automatically reserved a space for the following year.

Fortune reported 1,747 students enrolled in 2023-2024, a decrease of 119 students from 2022-2023.

**Cycle of Professional Development and Dissemination of Best Practices**

Annually, Fortune follows a strategic cycle of professional development to ensure that organizational priorities guide the work of all staff members throughout the year. The professional development cycle begins with a cabinet retreat and a leadership retreat. The cabinet retreat includes members of the cabinet who work to define their roles and responsibilities in line with organizational priorities. The leadership retreat includes cabinet members in addition to directors, principals, assistant principals, and master teachers. At the leadership retreat, leaders work together to integrate organizational priorities with other schoolwide planning efforts and prepare for the launch of the new school year.

These retreats lead into the Principal Institute where principals align objectives with the tools that will help them accomplish their yearly goals. Following the Principal Institute is the annual Summer Symposium which every staff member attends. At the Summer Symposium, staff are introduced to the organizational culture. Following the Summer Symposium, staff receive additional site-level training led by the principal. Teachers and instructional aides also receive curriculum training led by master teachers.

Throughout the year, the cycle of professional development continues focusing on different professional learning goals at different points in the year. The year begins, with a focus on culture which pivots to academic rigor, and then to review and synthesis of learning, ending the year with planning for the following year based on learning.

The cycle of professional development integrates job-embedded teacher learning through weekly early-release days. Teachers attend professional development tailored to their grade and subject expertise. Master teachers facilitate the process of data analysis with teachers and instructional aides to ensure data is driving the instructional process. Master teachers also model best practices monthly and provide coaching support to ensure teacher development continues throughout the year.

Additionally, all master teachers, principals, and principal managers attend the RELAY Graduate School of Education’s Instructional Leader Professional Development, National Principals Academy Fellowship and National Principal Supervisors Academy. This is a one-year program that focuses on developing school leaders by training them to build and execute professional development on school culture and instruction and provide effective observation and feedback.

# Board Decisions and Policy Revisions in 2022-2023

Fortune reports the adoption of a revised Short Term Independent Study Policy as a major policy decision of the Fortune School of Education Board of Directors during the 2022-2023 school year. The policy was revised in response to the need to increase attendance and reduce chronic absenteeism amidst persistent increased student absences due to COVID-19-related or other illnesses. The independent study program is an optional educational alternative in which no student may be required to participate. It is offered for the educational benefit of Fortune students to encourage daily engagement in schoolwork during times of extended absences.

## Parental Involvement in Governance and School Operations

Fortune’s School Site Council (SSC) consists of 10 members comprised of the principal/designee, one non-teaching staff, three teachers, four parents, and one high school student. All members serve a two-year term. In the fall of 2023, Fortune held nominations and elections for all members except for the high school student member who is serving the second of a two-year term. Fortune received more nominations than available spots for parents and non-teaching staff. For this reason, elections were held for these groups. Fifteen parent nominees were received, more than were received in previous years.

Fortune’s SSC meetings occur four times a year and are open to the public. The first meeting was held on November 30, 2023, at which members were provided an orientation, the School Safety Plan was reviewed and approved, and members were provided information about the Fortune Rise program. At future SSC meetings, Fortune plans to review school data, track progress toward LCAP goals, and seek input on the School Plan for Student Achievement (aka: LCAP).

To engage families in conversations about what they envision for their children in the Fortune after-school program, Fortune facilitated the Dream Big Tour. In May 2023, Fortune leaders visited all seven sites to meet with families and collected feedback to inform decisions before relaunching the after-school program under the statewide Expanded Learning Opportunities Program guidelines. They used interactive digital polls, community partner panel discussions, and provided free dinner and music to make the event fun and engaging for everyone involved.

## Summary

Fortune School leaders are responding with deliberate and purposeful action to the shifting academic, social, emotional, and behavioral needs of their students in a post-pandemic world. During the 2022-2023 school year, staff engaged in thoughtful reflection and adult learning guided by experts in the field of school culture which began as early as 2016. The necessary groundwork has been laid to achieve the goal of redesigning the system to respond appropriately to student needs.

behavior rooted in the belief that rather than suspending students, “we need to give them the skills that they need to help scholars understand the harm done by their actions and to allow them an opportunity to repair this harm and learn from their actions.”

In the 2023-2024 school year, Fortune School is realizing their goal of redesigning the system which has been verified through site visits and an analysis of mid-year discipline data. The school environments are safe and orderly with positive relationships exhibited between students and staff. The accelerated transformation is made possible by the existing mission-driven culture of Fortune School. The purpose for change was effectively articulated and supported which made it easier to create new strategies that are embraced by all. The suspension rate has decreased dramatically to 1% at mid-year in 2023-2024 compared to 13% at the same time last year.

School culture has a significant impact on student learning. A positive school culture engages students, helps them feel safe and supported, and promotes their overall academic and personal growth. Fortune School understands the relationship between culture and academics which is why they addressed it in 2022-2023 with immediacy. By successfully implementing and sustaining systemic changes that result in an improved school culture in 2023-2024, they are concurrently creating an environment ideal for improved student learning. During the 2022-2023 school year, Fortune School prioritized academic achievement through individualized support. Fortune piloted Fortune Rise as an afterschool high dosage tutoring program in ELA and math. Fortune reports the results of the pilot were positive and, in 2023-2024, implemented the Fortune Rise program system-wide. From the beginning of the 2023-2024 school year to the first trimester, overall student performance on local benchmark assessment in ELA and math increased by 8% and 12%, respectively.
