**IN THE COMMUNITY**  
Thank you President Lefkovitz for attending the El Centro graduation on October 18. Your presence along with SCOE and El Centro staff, and the probation team make a world of difference to our students and their families.

On October 27, President Lefkovitz, Trustee Corona Sabeniano, and I visited American River Collegiate Academy (ARCA). We thank the ARCA team for organizing an excellent tour. ARCA continues to diligently explore options for a facility in Citrus Heights and updates will be provided by ARCA as more information becomes available.

On November 1, Vice President Brown, Xanthi Soriano, and I attended the PBS KVIE special screening of Season 5 of Inside California Education at the Sofia Theater. This new series features student and school stories from around the state and several here in Sacramento County. You can visit the insidecaled.org website and the PBS streaming app to watch and share.

Congratulations to Jared Amalong and the Computer Science and Ed Tech Team in College and Career for winning the Innovation Award for the “Season of Computer Science (CS)” program, which was presented at the recent Computer Science Education Conference.

On November 6, Vice President Brown took part in a special speaker series to honor the words, life, and legacy of one of our namesakes, the prolific civil rights attorney Nathaniel Colley. The series was co-sponsored by the California Association of Black Lawyers, the Sacramento County Bar Association, and the Wiley Manuel Bar Association.

On November 13, our Human Resources team, led by our Chief Administrator of Human Resources, Darrien Johnson, continued in their recruitment outreach focused on diversity and attended the Local Chamber Collaborative 2023 Diversity Summit & Expo hosted by the Sacramento Black Chamber, Sacramento Hispanic Chamber, and Sacramento Rainbow Chamber.

On November 14, we continued in our literacy work in holding the Literacy Chat titled “Accelerating Foundational Literacy in an MTSS Framework,” which was a highly collaborative day of learning with educators and leaders throughout local districts focused on Literacy and a Multi-Tiered Systems of Support framework.

On November 15, the second Sacramento County READS! Community of Practice (CoP) is taking place at the SCOE Conference Center and will focus on Multilinguals and English Learners and the Science of Reading featuring Dr. Elsa Cárdenas-Hagan. Each participant will receive a copy of Dr. Cárdenas-Hagan’s book, “Literacy Foundations for English Learners: A Comprehensive Guide to Evidence-Based Instruction.” More than 99 participants are registered for this session. Last week more than 800 participants were registered for a webinar featuring Dr. Anita Archer who presented “The ‘How’ of Structured Literacy,” as part of our California Dyslexia Initiative.

On November 16, the Foundations Academy will host a Fall Celebration for families in Oluchi Okemiri’s classroom at Sheldon High School. Along with a delicious feast, families and honored guests will enjoy decorations created by the students and will recognize students in their progress learning the correlating American Sign Language motions for the four colors in nature.

This past week, we kicked off our Season of Giving with many opportunities for SCOE employees to help SCOE students and families, as well as our community. We have book drives, fundraisers, food drives, toy drives, and more. This year’s turkey drive, led by Robin Ryan and her team, that benefits the Sacramento Food Bank, exceeded last year’s number by three with a total of 45 turkeys donated.

Our ongoing giving opportunities include:
