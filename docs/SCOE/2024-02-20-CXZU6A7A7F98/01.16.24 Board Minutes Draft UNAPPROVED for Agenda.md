Our Season of Giving through December, in support of SCOE programs, was a great success! Hats off to everyone for their generosity and acts of kindness. One hundred and five Holiday Meals were packaged and delivered to SCOE students and families. Another 25 families received gifts from our Adopt-a-Family program. Seventy-two new books were donated to the library at El Centro. During this time, we received $1,200 to support the Gary K. Hart Resiliency Scholarship. And, last but not least, the toy bins for the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Toy Drive were overflowing.  

STUDENT EVENTS IN FEBRUARY  
We have several student events happening in February starting with the Academic Decathlon – “Technology and Humanity” – that will be held Saturday, February 3, 2024, at the Sheldon High School Gymnasium located at 833 Kingsbridge Drive in Elk Grove. The Super Quiz is at 3:45 p.m. Teams of students from throughout the county engage in friendly but competitive academic team rivalry and parents and family members are present to cheer them on. The Academic Decathlon Awards Banquet will be held on Monday, February 5, 2024, in the Sacramento State University Union Ballroom located at 6000 Jed Smith Drive in Sacramento at 6:00 p.m.  

The final round and awards ceremony for Moot Court will take place on Tuesday, February 13, 2024, at the Third District Court of Appeal located at 914 Capitol Mall, Sacramento.

It is followed by the award ceremony at the Library Galleria at 8:00 p.m. located at 828 I Street in Sacramento. Both events are intense and engage students in on-the-spot decision-making and critical thinking and are also core to civic learning.  

On February 21, 2024, our School of Education will host the Poetry Out Loud competition at SCOE in the Mather Room starting at 4:30 p.m. This excellent arts program supports our literacy initiative and provides students with an opportunity to be on stage and demonstrate their skills in language with an artistic bent.

**STATE BUDGET**  
The Governor released his budget proposal for 2024-2025 last Wednesday. Although the state has a budget shortfall estimated at $37.9 billion, the Governor does not propose significant reductions to education programs but does fund a small COLA for schools. We will provide additional details in a presentation on the Governor’s 2024-2025 budget proposal at the February 6 Board meeting.

**UPCOMING EVENTS**  
Our Sacramento County Reads initiative is continuing to make an impact on literacy instruction by building the capacity of teams of educators participating in our monthly community of practice. Our next Community of Practice is scheduled for January 17, 2024, at the California Endowment building at 1414 K Street in Sacramento. This session will be led by Dr. Dale Webster and Brittany Cufaude from CORE Learning. Participants will examine MTSS practices in reading and literacy to better meet the needs of all learners. They will examine the importance of designing coherent systems that include curriculum assessment, use of data, and the maximization of resources across all tiers of instruction.

On January 23, 2024, at our Conference Center, SCOE, My Brother’s Keeper Sacramento Collaborative, and MENTOR California invite you to an inspiring evening as we delve into "The Stories We Tell," a captivating exploration of the intersectionality of the arts and mentoring. Guest speaker will be Dr. Christopher Emdin, author of numerous award-winning works including, “Urban Science Education for the Hip-hop Generation,” and the New York Times bestseller, “For White Folks Who Teach In The Hood and the Rest of Y’all.”

As a reminder, the Sacramento County School Boards Association Dinner Meeting is scheduled for February 7, 2024, in the Mather Room.
