## LCAP Midyear Outcomes Report February 2024  

### LCAP Midyear Report Purpose  
Local educational agencies (LEAs) must present the information required in the mid-year update to their local governing board or body on or before February 28, 2024, and must include all available mid-year outcome data related to metrics identified in the 2023–24 LCAP, and all available mid-year expenditure and implementation data on all actions identified in the previous LCAP year, as it evaluates and considers progress for the development of the new 2024-27 LCAP. The mid-year and annual LCAP updates are used to continuously refine the goals throughout all LCAP cycles.  

This report provides a table with the initial LCAP metrics, baseline measurements, subsequent mid-year (where available and applicable) and end-of-year measurements, and revisions to metrics (noted in yellow) due to changes in federal accountability calculations or the cessation of metrics. Because some data may lag across parts of the year, the report provides multi-year data to foster analyses. Measures that are new, or where a baseline is not yet available contain an n/a in the cell. Where new metrics have been identified, but contain no data as they require further definition of measurement, population inclusion, and data are marked with **New Metric**. At this point in the school year, some metric outcomes are unknown, such as mid-year local accountability data and survey results, but will be updated prior to the adoption of the LCAP in June 2024. Mid-year local accountability data will be presented to the Board in April.  

### LCAP Midyear Data Summary of Findings  
This report includes an analysis of the multi-year data across priority areas and metrics. It is important to note that data for the 2020-21 year were atypical as much of the learning occurred online due to the pandemic and the data reflects this. Subsequent measures also reflect the learning loss that occurred during the pandemic. The overall findings of the multi-year data review include:  

- Measures reflecting teacher assignments and implementation of state standards remained consistent.  
- Pupil achievement showed some areas of growth and some areas of decline.  
  - As compared to the baselines, CAASPP scores improved in ELA and math for the Smarter Balanced exams and declined in ELA and math for the alternate assessment.  
  - Local accountability measures for ELA and math also showed a slight drop as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline year.

- Multilingual learners (English learners) showed progress in English language development  
- UC/CSU a-g courses and CTE courses have been put into place and local data are now available  
- Parent and family engagement showed an increase in the number of parents responding to the LCAP survey and an increase in perceptions of safety and connectedness.  
- Analysis of pupil engagement metrics showed slight decreases among several metrics, most notably the graduation rate as calculated by the four to five-year cohort rate. Although SCOE graduates a substantial number of students each year, most do so in their 6th year and are counted as non-graduates in the CA Schools Dashboard Rate.  
- School climate showed improvements in suspension rates over time and a slight decrease in staff perceptions of safety and connectedness.  
- Foster Youth continue to demonstrate high successful transition rates and also a higher graduation rate than other student groups.  
- Literacy is a new focus area and data specific to this measure is not yet available.
