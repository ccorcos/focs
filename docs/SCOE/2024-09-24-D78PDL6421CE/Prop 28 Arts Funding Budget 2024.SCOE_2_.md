**LEA Name:** Sacramento County Office of Education  
**Contact Name:** Jacqueline White  
**Email Address:** jwhite@scoe.net  
**Phone Number:** (916) 228-2507  

**Total amount of funds received by the LEA:** $153,719  

**Purpose:** Arts and Music in Schools (Prop 28) provides funding to supplement arts education programs. Local educational agencies with more than 500 pupils must expend at least 80 percent of the funds to employ certificated or classified employees to provide arts education instruction and the remaining funds for training supplies, curriculum, professional learning, materials, and arts educational partnership programs.  
**Eligible grades:** Pre-K to 12  
**Additional resource:** California Arts Standards for Public Schools, Prekindergarten Through Grade Twelve  
The 2019 California Arts Standards for Public Schools, Prekindergarten Through Grade Twelve (Arts Standards) update the four arts disciplines—dance, music, theatre, and visual arts—and include new standards for media arts as a discrete discipline.  
**Annual Average Number of Students Served:** 1,760  
SCOE plans to support an Arts Integration Coordinator to provide direct instruction for students, coach existing teachers around the implementation of Arts and Arts Integration and provide professional learning around Arts and Arts integration to ensure that every student in SCOE school programs has access to Arts Instruction. Additionally, SCOE will use the Any Given Child and Sacramento Healthy HeARTs and Minds programs to provide arts instruction and access to arts experiences through community-based artists and arts organizations. This methodology will allow every youth in SCOE programs access to the Arts as part of a whole child, culturally and linguistically responsive educational approach. SCOE’s annual Arts plan will be updated annually beginning in Spring 2025.
