**Education Code 48926**

As required by AB 922 (Chapter 974, Statutes of 1995; E.C. 48926), the County Superintendent, in conjunction with district superintendents, developed a plan for providing education services to all expelled students in the county. The plan was adopted by the governing board of each school district and the County Board of Education. The plan was subsequently submitted to the Superintendent of Public Instruction by the deadline of June 30, 1997.

In addition, E.C. 48916.1 requires that “at the time an expulsion of a pupil is ordered, the governing board will refer each expelled student to an appropriate educational placement for the period of the expulsion.” The educational placement will be determined on an individual basis by the school district’s governing board based on:

- Seriousness of offense
- Available educational alternatives
- Other related factors

In accordance with Education Code Section 48926, each County Office of Education operating county community schools under Education Code Section 1980, in conjunction with the superintendents of the school districts within the county, shall develop a plan for providing educational services to all expelled students in Sacramento County. The plan shall be adopted by the governing board of each school district within Sacramento County and by the County Board of Education.

AB 922 requires the County Superintendent, in conjunction with district superintendents, to submit a triennial update to the plan to the Superintendent of Public Instruction on June 30th thereafter. This plan reflects the 2024 update.

# The Countywide Plan for Identifying and Outlining Gaps and Strategies in Educational Services to Expelled Students

The AB 922 Countywide Task Force committee met to discuss current issues affecting expelled students. The following gaps and strategies were identified. It is important to note that the responses provided might not pertain to each district and are a compilation of the responses. Confirmation that many of the previous identified Gaps and Strategies are still relevant.

## Gap:
Transportation to school may not be available to expelled students due to Sacramento County’s large geographic area. Regional program sites serve a number of surrounding districts, and district transportation may not be available to these sites. Expelled students may not be eligible to receive transportation services.

### Strategy:
Information can be shared with parents and students about access to public transportation. Regional Transit currently offers free public transportation passes to all students.

#### Were the strategies successful?
Yes, students may obtain monthly or daily bus passes at no cost.

## Gap:
A student who has been expelled from a district under E.C. 48915 and referred to the Sacramento County Community School program could commit another violation of E.C. 48915.

### Strategy:
If the expelled student commits another violation of E.C. 48915 while enrolled in the SCOE Community School Program, the student will be placed in another Community School program or be placed in the Independent Study Program (with parental/student consent) operated by the Sacramento County Office of Education or referred to the County Probation Department for appropriate intervention. Other Interventions i.e. Counseling, Anger Management, Violence Prevention, etc.

#### Were the strategies successful?
Yes, SCOE administration collaborates together to move students when needed under E.C. 48900.

## Gap:
Homeless or unaccompanied students/families may struggle with navigating due process procedures due to economic hardships or adequate access to resource guidance.

### Strategies:
Districts work closely with county wide and district resources to ensure that homeless and unaccompanied minors receive appropriate resources and support to be able to fully participate in due process proceedings for students.

## Gap:
Refugee or immigrant students and guardians going through the expulsion proceedings may...

struggle with fully understanding laws related to due process proceedings for students referred for expulsion.  
**Strategies:**  
Districts work closely with county and district refugee and immigrant programs that provide resources and support to families going through expulsion proceedings so that they understand the cultural norms and legal practices related to due process and expulsion proceedings.  

**Gap:**  
Students in elementary grades who are expelled may not have the same educational options available as do expelled youth in secondary grades.  
**Strategy:**  
Sacramento County Office of Education is committed to providing all means of prevention prior to expelling elementary school students. All efforts will be utilized to prevent the expulsion of students kindergarten through sixth grade including, but not limited to, working with county partners, mental health professionals, and family members. Districts will contact the Sacramento County Office of Education for assistance prior to expelling elementary school students. If districts within Sacramento County have sufficient numbers of elementary students expelled, the Sacramento County Superintendent of Schools may establish an elementary community school program. Independent Study programs may be offered with placement contingent on parent/student consent.  
Only expel K-6 for 48915(c)—Mandatory—offenses if too many primary students are being expelled for discretionary offenses.  
**Were the strategies successful?**  
This remains a successful strategy. The strategy was not implemented because no need or circumstances arose to trigger its use since the 2015 plan was issued.  

**Strategies for Improvement 2024-2027**  

Continued collaboration with the AB 922 group in quarterly meetings to discuss:  

• Behavior intervention practices at both site and district levels with a focus on options to:  
  - Minimize the number of suspensions leading to expulsions  
  - Explore and expand alternative means of correction in lieu of suspension  
  - Minimize the number of expulsions being ordered  
  - Support students returning from expulsions  

• Specific explanation of how those practices relate to any disproportionate representation of minority students in such interventions.  

• Identify professional development, to be hosted by SCOE, to address disproportionality in suspensions and expulsion

![Educational Services Provided to Expelled Students with Exceptional Needs](https://www.scoe.net/educational-services/expelled-students)

**Educational Services Provided to Expelled Students with Exceptional Needs**

Consistent with law, a student with exceptional needs may be expelled (EC 48915.5) and referred by the district's I.E.P. Team for placement in a County Community School program, provided that:

- The requirements as stipulated in EC 48915.5 have been met.

- The referring school district shall provide a copy of an I.E.P. to the Sacramento County Office of Education Special Education Department for review and determine:

  - The educational needs of the students based upon a current student assessment;
  
  - Determine appropriate educational goals and objectives;
  
  - Identify the services and resources to meet the needs of the exceptional student;
  
  - Identify an appropriate placement for the student in the least restrictive environment;

- If it is determined that a County Community School program is an appropriate educational placement, the school district shall ensure that all necessary and specified educational services are:

  - Either provided directly by district staff; or
  
  - Provided to the student on a contractual service basis through the Sacramento County Office of Education with appropriate reimbursement to SCOE for services provided;
  
  - Those specified services, whether provided directly by the district staff or provided by SCOE on a contractual basis, shall be written onto the I.E.P. and.

shall be binding to all parties.

- The district and SCOE shall jointly be responsible to ensure that requirements for service, assessment, timelines and due process items are met as established in both Federal and State Law.
- If it is determined that an initial Special Education Assessment is necessary, the district will take the lead in the assessment, with the assistance of SCOE.

The referring school district representative and its Special Education Department representative shall be invited to attend and participate in the Intake Meeting to identify the educational needs of the student. The outcome of the meeting will determine if the County Community Schools program is an appropriate educational program for the student.

If the outcome of the Intake Meeting recommends that the County Community School Program is an appropriate educational program without the need for special education support services, an enrollment date for the student shall be finalized. However, if it is determined that the student may require on-going special education services to benefit from an appropriate placement in the Sacramento County Community Schools Program, the process outlined in Section IV (A) shall be followed.

**Students Who Fail to Meet Their Rehabilitation Plan**

The following options have been identified for a student who has failed to meet the terms and conditions of their rehabilitation plan or pose a danger to other district pupils as outlined in the individual expulsion packet. Not all of these options and alternative settings will meet the needs of each district.

- Placement in a different SCOE Community School.
- Possible referral to SCOE Independent Study Program.
- Student remains in their current alternative placement.

When it has been mutually determined by SCOE and the school district that the SCOE Community Schools program may not be an appropriate educational placement for a student, the district shall be responsible for identifying and providing for an alternative educational placement pursuant to AB 922.

**Countywide Plan for Regional Perspective**

Sacramento County Office of Education  
Educational Services for Expelled Students

<!-- Page 12 -->
The AB 922 Countywide Task Force will continue to meet on a quarterly basis to ensure the proper coordination between districts and the County Office of Education. This committee will explore various ways the County Office of Education and local districts can better serve students. The County Office of Education will continue to be supportive if assistance is needed by an individual district.

Each quarter, district personnel are invited to visit the community school programs to meet with their students and monitor students’ progress towards meeting the terms of their rehabilitation plans. These meetings are arranged and facilitated by SCOE staff.
