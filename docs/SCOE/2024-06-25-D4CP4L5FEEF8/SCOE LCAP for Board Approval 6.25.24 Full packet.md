# LCFF Budget Overview for Parents

The LCFF gives school districts more flexibility in deciding how to use state funds. In exchange, school districts must work with parents, educators, students, and the community to develop a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) that shows how they will use these funds to serve students.

## Goal Analysis
An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.  
A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.

The actions in Goal 1 were implemented fully and we can point to several successes: The Director of Student Programs (identified as Court and Community Schools in Action 1.1) has been hired and is providing leadership to site administrators by observing and coaching instruction and supporting school planning initiatives. The Director of College and Career Readiness (Action 1.2) has been hired and is providing guidance in developing innovative new CTE programming to address the needs of SCOE's low-income, English learner and foster youth. The 21st Century Learning Center (Action 1.4) has been acknowledged as an exemplary resource for students attending the juvenile court school, El Centro, offering a wide variety of high-interest, culturally relevant reading materials. In 2023-24, SCOE's curriculum collaboration team piloted a Professional Learning Community (PLC) structure for professional development (Action 1.5) and collaborative planning time, which will continue in 2024-25. The district's Multilingual Learning Specialist provided yearlong coaching and support to teachers and administrators.

Measures for credits earned and state testing participation fall below expectations. One of the challenges SCOE schools face is ensuring students complete work in a timely manner to earn credits, especially in the independent study model. Another challenge is helping students persevere through state testing. Students don't recognize the benefit or purpose of these tests, which is a challenging mindset to overcome. Because many have struggled with tests earlier in their educational career, they often choose not to participate. Educational partner consultation with students regarding test participation brought forth some suggestions for increasing participation rates, though acknowledged that their suggestions may not be successful with the independent study program students.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.

**Action 1.1 -** Implementation of the Student Success Plan expended less than planned and **Action 1.12 -** Support Staff shows an increase over planned expenditures. When totaled, the expenditures for staff that are included in Actions 1.1 and 1.12 do not demonstrate material differences ($8,925,157 planned vs $9,766,640 estimated actuals). All services were provided to students as planned.

**Action 1.2 -** Career and Post-Secondary Exploration - actual expenditures are less than planned because of a late hire.

An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.

The a-g course passage rate has surpassed the goal set for 2022-23. This is a result of a focused effort to increase the number of courses that meet a-g certification; and to offer support toward completion of the classes. Several of the Career Technical Education (CTE) pathways are well established, but suggestions received from students are helping to reshape programs for 2024-25. SCOE's Program Manager leads program evaluation, surveys, and has determined areas where greater efficiency is needed. Summer learning is well-attended and student feedback is positive. (Actions 1.2, Career and Post-Secondary Exploration; 1.3, Early College Programming; 1.6, Virtual Learning; 1.8, Summer School; 1.10 Data to Inform Instruction; 1.12, Support Staff) The 21st Century Learning Center (Action 1.4) is effective in supporting literacy skills and supporting postsecondary exploration. The Library / Media teacher provides students in the Youth Detention Facility with a warm welcome - a carefully chosen book upon arrival - and subsequent access to arts and media as well as research materials and high-interest reading.

The percent of students meeting or exceeding standards in the ELA Smarter Balanced assessment improved slightly, but math performance remains flat. Students' expected credit completion rates did not match up to expectations. To make these actions more effective, SCOE will standardize systems for enrollment, assessment, placement, and intervention. Upon enrollment, students will receive a warm welcome and full assessment and transcript review. The student and family will be encouraged to set goals and take advantage of resources offered. Professional development in 2024-25 will feature a Professional Learning Community structure to capitalize on real-time challenges and addressing student needs collaboratively. (Actions 1.1, Implementation of the Student Success Plan; 1.5 Professional Development; 1.9 Credit Completion)

These actions, when taken together, are moderately successful to attaining the goal of student success when consideration is given to the short duration that students are enrolled in the Court or Community schools. While some actions will continue, this goal is changing in 202425.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.

**Goal 1 - Student Success** was designed to support students with the highest needs in Sacramento County. Post-secondary success, academic achievement, and progress for English learners were areas of focus. In developing the goal for Student Success, SCOE had identified a need for students to improve their academic outcomes and to become more aware of post-secondary options for education or employment. The actions and metrics in Goal 1 defined SCOE's focus on state standards, basic services, pupil achievement and student outcomes, measuring progress by both state assessments and formative assessments. Actions in Goal 1 were designed to provide a clear pathway for students to finish their high school education and successfully transition to post-secondary training and employment/career. SCOE’s Career Technical Education pathways forge partnerships with experts in each respective field to inspire students to choose employer engagement activities for a “real world” experience, or community college classes to accrue credits and receive exposure to college-level coursework. The ultimate outcome is for students to be prepared academically, emotionally, and socially for success in post-secondary and to secure employment.

Goal 1 will not continue unmodified into the 2024-25 LCAP. SCOE's Court and Community Schools leadership defined current student needs and solicited feedback from educational partners to reframe goals for the new LCAP. Going forward, Goal 1 will focus on Achievement, with continuing actions associated with basic services and teaching and learning. To increase student proficiency in ELA and Math, Universal Design for Learning will be fully embedded in the instructional system. A learning community will be established at each site. Leaders model learning and create the conditions for all to learn by offering frequent walk throughs, feedback and coaching. Professional learning provided on topics such as Culturally and Linguistically Responsive Instruction, Visible Learning, Lesson and Unit Design and Implementation, Integrated and Designated ELD, and Community Based Curriculum. Supports for foster and homeless youth will be built into Goal 1 in 2024-25.

Most metrics in Goal 1 will continue, as they provide a local focus that is captured longitudinally. Some will be reallocated to better align to the new goals. Metrics reported in the LCAP beginning in 2024-25 will represent the end of year data from the previous year. This aligns with Dashboard data and decreases variation that might occur when midyear metrics are included. SCOE is also revising metrics to provide clarity for existing measures. As an example, the measure for teacher credentialing has been modified to report the Teacher Assignment Monitoring Outcome data from DataQuest. SCOE's local measure for EL Progress will be replaced by the Dashboard English Language Progress Indicator. The measure for post-secondary exploration will be gathered using other indicators in the future rather than self-reported by students.

A report of the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for last year’s actions may be found in the Annual Update Table. A report of the Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services for last year’s actions may be found in the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table.

## Goal Analysis

An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.  
A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.

The actions in Goal 2 were implemented as planned with a few exceptions. Supports provided to students through SCOE's mental health and wellness department (Action 2.1) were highly anticipated and cited by district administrators and teachers as critical to student success. The administrators identified in Home School Partnership (Action 2.4) are invested in creating and sustaining relationships with parents and caregivers, and have made some innovations to the "Back to School" meetings to provide families with more choice and flexibility. Staff declare that translation services are easily accessed and have been a successful way to communicate with families of English learners. Community-based organizations (Action 2.5) continue to be the "boots on the ground" who provide engaging activities and give students vision for their future. Mentors (Action 2.9) are identified and are trained to work effectively with students. SCOE's Mentor Coordinator has developed a robust and expansive program to offer every student an adult protective relationship. The Activities Director / Physical Education Specialist (planned in Action 2.8) has not been hired. This service has been fulfilled by contracted staff.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.

- Action 2.1 - Mental Health and Wellness: Estimated actuals surpassed the planned expenditures
- Action 2.6 - Professional Development Culture & Climate reflects higher estimated actuals as additional professional development was offered in response to demand.
- Action 2.8 - Student Engagement: Estimated actuals surpassed the planned expenditures due to increases in salary and benefits.

An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.

The actions in the Partnership Goal are championed by students. Students state that they feel comfortable working with mental health providers, mentors, and staff from community based organizations (CBOs). They look forward to the activities provided by CBOs (arts, clubs, etc.).

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.

**Goal 2:** Partnership was developed to ensure that students and their families feel welcome, supported, and valued for their unique qualities. Both qualitative and quantitative data demonstrated the need to establish higher attendance rates and strengthen a positive school climate and relationships systemwide. The actions and metrics in Goal 2 show alignment to state priorities for student engagement, school climate, and parent and family engagement. The actions in Goal 2 made engagement a priority through the careful selection of administrators, community partners, and mentors; as well as site-based transition specialists and mental health professionals. All staff show care and establish connections and present engaging activities. Social and emotional learning is embedded throughout programs, through mental health clinicians and counselors skilled in relationship-building and SEL interventions.

The partnership goal will not continue without modifications into the 2024-25 LCAP. Goal 2 is being revised to identifying a broader focus on Student and Family Engagement. As SCOE begins to Implement the Community Schools Partnership Planning Grant, the new goal will

include alignment to the pillars of a community school. This goal will include many of the metrics from the current Goal 2, and the actions will be realigned to show the focus on families as well as students. As with Goal 1, the majority of LCAP metrics reported will provide data from End of Year. This aligns with Dashboard reporting and decreases the potential for variation that could occur with a midyear data report.

## Goal Analysis

### An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.
**A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.**  
The overall implementation of the action in Goal 3 was successful. This was a required goal based on the performance of Foster youth. Staffing was strengthened by the addition of a Project Specialist II serving as a Case Manager. This staff member provided enhanced communication with each school site and participated in transition meetings. There were no substantive challenges noted for the implementation of the action.

**An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.**  
There are no material differences to report for this goal.

**An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.**  
Based on the continued successful transition rate for foster youth, and the graduation rate increase over baseline, the single action (3.1) within this goal was implemented successfully. However, foster youth continue to demonstrate academic needs, which will be addressed in the upcoming year through the implementation of improved enrollment and intake processes for all SCOE students, and more targeted interventions as identified through the use of Achieve 3000.

**A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.**  
Goal 3 will not be continued into the 2024-25 LCAP. Foster youth will continue as a student group that will be highlighted, but the services and associated metrics will be embedded within the new goal structure.

## Goal Analysis
An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.  
A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.

This goal was established to support the documented need for student support in literacy, especially for white and Hispanic students. The Curriculum and Collaboration team has met monthly since August 2023 to review existing assessments and to establish a cycle of assessments leading to improved teaching and support. Most actions in Goal 4 were implemented: Professional development with a literacy focus has been provided by a contractor, and instructional materials are ordered. The plan to provide professional development in the use of diagnostic literacy assessments (Action 4.3) has not yet been implemented.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.

Action 4.3 - Diagnostic Information as a Driver: As mentioned above, the planned expenditure for professional development and coaching in the use of diagnostic literacy assessments did not take place. It will be continued into the 2024-25 LCAP.

An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.

Data is still being collected as of May 2024. The 2023-24 implementation of the literacy initiative is underway, and Achieve 3000 is still being piloted. This required goal was added in 2022-23 and has not been in place long enough to be evaluated for effectiveness.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.

The implementation of the actions in this new goal is expected to improve overall levels of reading proficiency; with all students making expected growth. We do not yet have the data needed to fully assess successful implementation, but new local metrics are being developed to demonstrate progress in literacy measures. For 2024-25, the Literacy goal will not continue as a stand-alone goal, but will be embedded within the new Equity Multiplier goal. The metrics will be redesigned to meet the current needs of the literacy initiative.

A report of the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for last year’s actions may be found in the Annual Update Table. A report of the Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services for last year’s actions may be found in the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table.

## Plan Summary [2024-25]

### General Information
A description of the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades transitional kindergarten–12, as applicable to the LEA.

The Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE) directly operates school sites and programs that provide full-time and part-time instruction for specific student populations in specialized programs that are more effective, innovative, and cost effective to operate on a regional basis.

SCOE currently enrolls 938 students across six schools in 2023-24. SCOE Court and Community Schools (CCS) provide services to students who require more services than a traditional middle or high school program can offer. SCOE is directly responsible for serving expelled and incarcerated youth in our CCS programs. SCOE CCS also provide a high quality education to students mobilizes supports for their families as they seek a smaller school environment through a referral process.

SCOE operates highly specialized Special Education programs to serve students with severe disabilities in Special Day classes located in school district and community sites. Leo A. Palmiter Jr./Sr. High School (Palmiter) serves 100% students with disabilities. The Foundations Academy also serves 100% students with moderate to severe disabilities. SCOE CCS programs consistently enroll students with high needs: 67.1% socioeconomically disadvantaged, 35.1% students with disabilities, 12.7% homeless and 5.3% foster youth. The English Learner (EL) population is 139 students, or 14.6% of total enrollment. Of those 139 ELs, 105 are identified as Long Term English Learners. Enrollment at SCOE’s court school, El Centro Jr./Sr. High School (El Centro) is 100% socioeconomically disadvantaged (SED) pupils. North Area Community School (North Area) serves 82% SED, Nathaniel S. Colley Sr. High (Colley) serves 74% and Elinor Hickey Jr./Sr. High School (Hickey) serves just over 67%. In 2023, Palmiter, El Centro, North Area, Colley and Hickey were identified to receive Equity Multiplier funding.

![SCOE CCS Programs](https://example.com/image.png)

SCOE was awarded two California Community Schools Partnership Program Implementation grants in 2024. The planning process and landscape analysis work done in preparation for the grant was incorporated into the SCOE LCAP. While all SCOE schools were not awarded grant funds, planned activities will happen at the Colley, Hickey, North Area and El Centro schools. Our primary goal as a result of these grants is to increase student access to high quality instruction through a wide array of whole child services. SCOE’s vision is to transform three community schools into full-service community schools that are racially just and culturally relevant. Leveraging this funding supports engaging a range of stakeholders to shape programming that is integrated in SCOE school neighborhoods and allows for broader communities to be prioritized. Efforts toward continuous improvement each year through intentional processes of modifying systems structures, professional learning, and best instructional practices with supports embedded are primary objectives for SCOE schools. Each of our SCOE schools is small but with the utilization of this funding, SCOE resources and whole-child approaches for all three nurtures and supports the process of building relationship-centered schools that meet the specific needs of students and families at each. We are still visioning—growing shared understanding and awareness but moving into engaging—building capacity and initiative alignment.

**SCOE CCS Programs:**
The SCOE CCS programs at El Centro, Hickey, Colley, and North Area were designed to serve expelled and detained youth, but also serve youth on the cusp of delinquency and/or those who need support not commonly found within traditional middle or high schools. The students SCOE serves often have needs that extend beyond routine school services: the severely credit deficient; foster youth (FY); students who are experiencing homelessness and who are in temporary housing; and a growing population of English learners (ELs). SCOE also provides a high quality alternative educational setting to students not expelled or detained at youth facilities who seek a smaller school environment through a district or probation referral.

SCOE’s Senior Extension program, offered at Colley, Hickey, and North Area sites, provides students with the support they need to graduate from high school. The Senior Extension Program allows students to extend the amount of time they can remain in high school and provides more flexibility to complete courses through an alternative education model. Staff extend outreach to local high schools, identifying students who are at risk of failing due to poor attendance or limited engagement. With a personalized approach from engaging staff members to address their individual needs, students are more likely to complete high school and transition to postsecondary education, military service, or the workforce.

In general, students in the CCS programs have a high rate of school mobility, or non-stable enrollment. The average enrollment period in court school is 31 days, and the community school average period of enrollment is 125 school days. Student mobility makes it challenging to utilize all of the state mandated LCAP metrics to measure academic progress. However, SCOE monitors school progress with a locally adopted accountability system for Court and Community Schools that uses five indicators to measure the efficacy of our programs: Attendance, Reading Achievement, Math Achievement, Credit Completion, and Successful Transition. To measure the academic growth of students, staff utilize a Renaissance Learning (Ren Learn) reading and mathematics short cycle assessment tool. Faculty also utilize Math and English placement assessments embedded in our web-based Edgenuity platform.

The high mobility rate and short enrollment periods impact students’ ability to complete a course path to meet UC/CSU a-g requirements. Advanced placement courses are not offered; however, the courses that SCOE offers via the online / in-class Edgenuity program are also offered in local districts. This sustains continuity among programs where students keep working on the same courses as they transfer in and out of SCOE schools.

To support long-term student success, secondary students enroll in Career Technical Education (CTE) courses, complete a comprehensive career interest survey, create a career development plan, and begin sequences of CTE programming. CTE goals are based on each student acquiring 21st Century Skills delineated by the Partnership for 21st Century Skills and the five core social-emotional competencies: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making. SCOE also offers accelerated and exploratory CTE programming through the online partner eDynamic Learning and through nonprofit partners, such as Northern California Construction and Training (NCCT). Each of these programs is designed to support initial skill acquisition and transition to a post-secondary training program. In addition to the robust CTE model, SCOE utilizes a comprehensive Work Experience Education (WEE) Course approved by the California Department of Education.

The Sacramento County Office of Education is utilizing the court school and community school base grant to continue and increase access to dual enrollment and concurrent enrollment classes through staffing and programs that increase enrollment. These funds are designated to address key areas of focus within our educational plan, including expanding access to A-G courses, fostering dual enrollment partnerships, enhancing elective offerings, strengthening vocational and career technical education, facilitating college preparation and application support, providing mental health services, and ensuring high school completion and successful transitions. These funds will also be used for the enhancement and continuation of career technical education (CTE), youth leadership empowerment programs, and increased academic intervention services. The Student Enrichment and Support Block Grant will ensure that our teachers provide the highest level of instruction and support to students with the greatest amount of need. This will be done through specific support and training provided to certificated and classified staff to target those students who are falling behind academically and emotionally. The Student Enrichment and Support Block Grant will foster an increase in work-based and vocational learning experiences and additional access to dual enrollment programs.

SCOE also coordinates services for foster youth in Sacramento County through the grant-funded Foster Youth Services Coordinating Program (FYSCP), and has added a Program Specialist to provide additional support. Assembly Bill 130 enables SCOE to coordinate and provide direct services to foster youth in school districts and charter schools within the county, including those in SCOE Court and CCS. SCOE partners with the Sacramento County Juvenile Courts, the Sacramento County Probation Department, Child Welfare, Behavioral Health, Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), and several other nonprofits to coordinate services to foster youth in the county who are in the child welfare system and are at a higher risk of crossing over to the juvenile justice system. SCOE's involvement in this process includes Special Ed, CCS, SCOE legal counsel, and Title I program coordination.

SCOE Programs for Students with Disabilities:
The Special Education Department provides services to students with disabilities referred from local school districts. SCOE provides special day class programs on district and community sites for students with severe disabilities from 5 -22 years of age, and students in grades TK12 with emotional and behavioral support needs, as well as an inclusive preschool program in collaboration with local Head Start program sites. In addition to providing Special Education services to students in the CCS, SCOE also serves Arcohe Union Elementary, and Elverta Joint Elementary (small districts within Sacramento County), and students with developmental delays or disabilities ages birth to three through the Infant Development Program.

# Reflections: Annual Performance
A reflection on annual performance based on a review of the California School Dashboard (Dashboard) and local data.

To ensure that the LCAP is meeting the needs of the lowest performing student groups, an analysis of the 2023 Dashboard results is presented to reflect areas of need by student group.

## At the LEA level:
All student groups received the lowest performance level in Graduation and the College Career Indicator (African American, English Learners, Foster Youth, Hispanic, Homeless, Two or More Races, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged (SED), Students with Disabilities and White).

## At the school level:
Elinor Lincoln Hickey (Hickey) students received the lowest performance level in Math, Suspension, Graduation, and the College Career Indicator. North Area Community School (North Area) students received the lowest performance level in English Language Arts and Math, Graduation, and the College Career Indicator. El Centro and Nathaniel S. Colley (Colley) received the lowest performance levels in Graduation and College Career Indicator. Palmiter Jr. / Sr. High received the lowest performance indicator for Suspensions, and Foundations Academy received the lowest performance level for Chronic Absenteeism.

### Student groups within each school received the lowest performance levels in the indicators noted below:

**Hickey:**
- SED students - Math, Graduation, Suspension, College Career Indicator
- White students - ELA and Math
- Hispanic students - Math and Suspension
- Homeless students - College Career Indicator
- Two or More races - Suspension

**Colley:**
- SED, Hispanic, and Homeless students - Graduation and College Career Indicator

<!-- Page 34 -->
![Foundations Academy](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Foundations Academy:**
- SED, Students with Disabilities, and Hispanic - Chronic Absenteeism

**Other reflections on locally-gathered data:**
- Measures reflecting teacher assignments and implementation of state standards remained similar.
- Pupil achievement showed some areas of growth and some areas of decline. As compared to the baselines, CAASPP scores improved in ELA and math for the Smarter Balanced exams and declined in ELA and math for the alternate assessment. Local accountability measures for ELA and math also showed a slight drop as compared to the pre-Covid baseline year.
- Multilingual learners (English learners) showed progress in English language development.
- UC/CSU a-g courses and CTE courses have been put into place and local data are now available.
- Parent and family engagement showed an increase in the number of parents responding to the LCAP survey and an increase in perceptions of safety and connectedness.
- Analysis of pupil engagement metrics showed slight decreases among several metrics, most notably the graduation rate as calculated by the four to five-year cohort rate. Although SCOE graduates a substantial number of students each year, most do so in their 6th year and are counted as non-graduates per Dashboard rules.
- School climate showed improvements in suspension rates over time and a slight decrease in staff perceptions of safety and connectedness.
- Foster Youth continue to demonstrate high successful transition rates and also a higher graduation rate than other student groups, though still in need of improvement.
- Literacy is a new focus area and data specific to this measure is not yet available.

Through a review of these state data points, surveys, and other qualitative assessments, four new goals were developed for the 2023 LCAP, acknowledging the need for continuous improvement.

**Reflections: Technical Assistance**
As applicable, a summary of the work underway as part of technical assistance.

SCOE is identified as eligible for Differentiated Assistance based on 2023 Dashboard performance for:
- Homeless, SED, African American, Hispanic, and White student groups: Chronic Absenteeism, Graduation, Academics (ELA and Math)
- English Learners and Foster Youth: Graduation, Academics (ELA and Math)

SCOE is identified as eligible for Differentiated Technical Assistance (DTA) for persistent low performance of these student groups in three out of four years:
Foster Youth: Graduation, College Career Indicator, Suspension and Academics (ELA and Math)  
Hispanic: Graduation, College Career Indicator, Chronic Absenteeism and Academics (ELA and Math)  
White: Graduation, College Career Indicator, Chronic Absenteeism, Suspension and Academics (ELA and Math)

![Support for Identified Schools](https://example.com/image.png)

**Support for Identified Schools**  
A description of how the LEA has or will support its eligible schools in developing comprehensive support and improvement plans.

CSI plans for the four identified schools were developed using Improvement Science strategies, including Root Cause Analysis to examine various data sets of student academic, social and post-secondary college and career readiness indicators. The data sets include California School Dashboard data, pre and post academic assessments in ELA and mathematics and college and career readiness indicators included in individualized student success plans embedded in the student information system database. Social emotional indicators are included as well, such as attendance, discipline and wellness surveys conducted by licensed mental health clinicians. School programs are analyzed to disaggregate the graduation rate for each school by program type when multiple programs are housed on one site, such as Senior Extension and the Base Program.

SCOE is receiving CSI funds to improve the Graduation Rate at Elinor Lincoln Hickey Jr. / Sr. High School, El Centro Jr./Sr. High School, Nathaniel Colley Sr. High School and North Area Community School. Research-based interventions are designed to help students reduce credit deficiencies and increase engagement. The percentage of SCOE students that graduate increases as the students’ engagement increases and they continue to earn academic credit.

SCOE involves students, parents, community-based organizations, employers, partnering government organizations and post-secondary partners with in-person and online surveys. Faculty, staff, management, leadership and board comment on the draft plan and survey data. Administrators and SCOE leadership engage with site councils, parent advisories, and collective bargaining units. Input is analyzed in conjunction with student and site level data and helps to inform focus areas.

SCOE has implemented a live data dashboard so decisions can be made in real time. SCOE utilizes evidence-based interventions. SCOE’s Program Manager for Research and Evaluation is able to study the impact of interventions.

Resource inequities are identified using The Education Combination: Ten Dimensions of Resource Equity to Unlock Opportunities for Every Student. Resource inequities exist due to the small size of each of our schools and the high proportion of students living in poverty. In addition, many of our students have experienced trauma and have not experienced success at comprehensive high schools. Our El Centro site serves justice-involved youth. The aforementioned resource inequities impact students’ engagement in schooling. We focus on reengaging our youth and providing whatever is needed to help them get back on track to earn credits towards graduation with engaging, rigorous and relevant content and learning activities and meeting their social emotional needs. Our students often have reduced access to wellness and mental health supports due to lack of transportation to and from provider locations. SCOE employs licensed mental health clinicians to increase engagement both during the school day and after the school day. We also contract with non-profits that provide creative and relevant opportunities for students to earn credits toward graduation. SCOE received a California Community Schools Partnership Program implementation grant which will continue our work towards a whole child approach to integrated support services to meet students' needs.

Each year administrators examine data to determine the effectiveness of our programs. They use a Student Information System-linked database to monitor partner engagement with students and academic and social outcomes and graduation rates. Our students provide feedback on their experiences.

**Monitoring and Evaluating Effectiveness**  
A description of how the LEA will monitor and evaluate the plan to support student and school improvement.

On an annual basis SCOE conducts a cohort study of each student in the CSI identified school. This study includes available state reported data, locally reported academic and social emotional data for the local accountability system and transition data for exiting students. Additionally, feedback data from stakeholder surveys is included. SCOE uses the cohort study to examine its continuous improvement process for future decisions.

Transition specialists ensure every student has a Student Success Plan developed collaboratively with staff, students, and parents/guardians so that the roadmap for each student’s progress is clear. Transition specialists monitor the implementation of the Student Success Plan throughout the year.

ELA and Math Ren Learn Short Cycle Assessments are used to monitor student progress throughout the year in Math and ELA. In 2024-25, ELA data will be monitored with Achieve 3000. Data is shared at School Site Council meetings and progress of the CSI plan is monitored. Additionally, principals meet monthly with the Assistant Superintendent of Court and Community Schools to discuss progress of goals and actions in the school plan. Students are monitored for credit completion towards meeting the goal of a minimum of 10 credits earned per month. Student participation with community-based organizations is monitored and data reviewed. Staff monitor student attendance with daily check in calls and home visits to address barriers to school attendance. Staff review rehabilitation plans for expelled youth and monitor suspension rates by student groups quarterly to identify and address potential disproportionalities.

# Engaging Educational Partners
A summary of the process used to engage educational partners in the development of the LCAP.

School districts and county offices of education must, at a minimum, consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, local bargaining units, parents, and students in the development of the LCAP.

Charter schools must, at a minimum, consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, parents, and students in the development of the LCAP.

An LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funds must also consult with educational partners at schools generating Equity Multiplier funds in the development of the LCAP, specifically, in the development of the required focus goal for each applicable school.

### A description of how the adopted LCAP was influenced by the feedback provided by educational partners:

**Ideas, trends and inputs that were provided by educational partners:**

The LCAP survey results for staff continues to evidence that SCOE schools provide positive and supportive educational environments for students. Many staff provided positive comments and feedback about the programs as well as areas for development or improvement. Several connected themes emerged, from the survey and also noted in the consultation with SCOETA.
- Staff need more specific and in-depth professional development, in the content areas and especially with strategies for behavior management.
- Staff support coordination of processes, manuals and consistent policies, such as for grading and credits.
- Staff appreciate collaboration and expressed a desire for data to inform students' needs.
- Staff would like funding to be provided for programmatic supports such as field trips, CTE, and career exploration opportunities.

Community-based organizations emphasized the importance of:
- Continuing to capture student voice
- Career pathways for students, internships,
- Culturally relevant materials
- Engaging students with the arts, hands-on learning, a center for urban entrepreneurship
- Involving parents and caregivers in learning about student progress.

A majority of parents surveyed agree that SCOE programs are beneficial to their child, and that they have seen academic growth and improvement in behavior. Some parents were unsure about whether their students were provided access to programs such as career exploration activities. Specifically, parents and guardians value:
- Teachers who care for the whole child;
- Intensive intervention, for academics and behavior;
- School climate and safety;
- Career technical education and assistance with employment;
- Easy communication with school leadership and teachers.

Administrators, principals and district leadership shared these opinions:

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE)  
Page 40 of 109
<!-- Page 41 -->
- There is a need for a systems approach to processes such as enrollment, transcript review, assessment and data collection;
- Greater emphasis on literacy should continue, as it will support students' proficiency in all content areas;
- Focus on supporting students in SEL growth and general well-being;
- Provide professional development on developing culturally and linguistically responsive instruction; continue with coaching and classroom observations.

The student listening sessions (including participation of foster youth) and the student survey highlighted these priorities:
- Connections with caring staff: Transition specialists and mental health clinicians as well as teachers
- Attachment to community-based organization staff and mentors
- Opportunities to learn about employment and other post-secondary options;
- Need for a positive and safe school climate
- Academic support (including options for credit recovery)
- Opportunities for student voice and agency to participate in decision-making
- Hands-on arts education
- Regular physical activity
- School is a place where they are learning more, have better relationships with teachers, and are getting better grades.

Equity Multiplier School Sites:
The need at these five schools is greatest in improving student readiness for college and career. Educational partners consulted at Colley, El Centro, Hickey, North Area and Palmitier identified low levels of student engagement as a concern. Students at the Equity Multiplier sites strongly advocated for CTE classes and pathways, enrichment activities, and more opportunities for parents to come to campus and observe student presentations or awards.

Graduation rate and preparedness for college and career as measured by the College/Career Indicator (CCI) presented the lowest performance levels for all student groups. The first step to improving the CCI is to increase the graduation rate for the students that SCOE serves at Equity Multiplier sites. More engaging and relevant classes and activities will be included to combat problem behaviors that lead to suspension.

Areas of Influence, synthesized:
- Processes and procedures such as enrollment, attendance, and assessments shall be designed to be followed with fidelity;
- Continue to deepen the welcoming environment for students and families;
- Use student voice to design engaging and educational activities at each site;
- Ensure that professional development is responsive to site needs and includes behavior management strategies;
- Continue weekly preventative support from mental health clinicians and intensive (tier 3) interventions on request;
- Continued focus on career and post-secondary exploration;
- Provide work readiness and work-based learning.

The general aspects of the LCAP that were influenced by educational partner input include:

Provide / continue:

<!-- Page 42 -->
- Mental health clinician support
- Increased support for students struggling with learning and student engagement and connection
- The vice principals for El Centro, Colley, and Hickey, to enhance student and family engagement, facilitate ongoing two-way communication and implement restorative practices
- Support the 21st Century Learning Center within the Juvenile Hall to increase engagement and literacy
- Expanded services for students formerly served by the Division of Juvenile Justice
- Professional development and collaboration to support all content areas, including ELD; professional development on diversity, equity and inclusion and trauma-informed practices

# Goals and Actions

## Goal
| Goal # | Description | Type of Goal |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 1      | Achievement: Through improved instructional systems, increase student achievement in literacy and math; expand student completion of courses; and develop college and career readiness. All students will meet or exceed grade-level academic growth. The percentage of students meeting or exceeding their grade level growth in ELA and math will increase by three percentage points annually. | Broad Goal |

## State Priorities addressed by this goal.
- Priority 2: State Standards (Conditions of Learning)
- Priority 4: Pupil Achievement (Pupil Outcomes)
- Priority 8: Other Pupil Outcomes (Pupil Outcomes)
- Priority 9: Expelled Pupils – COEs Only (Conditions of Learning)
- Priority 10: Foster Youth – COEs Only (Conditions of Learning)

## An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.
This goal was developed in response to the needs identified through data analysis and input from educational partners.

The analysis of California School Dashboard (Dashboard) data indicated the need to continue the focus on literacy that was initiated in the 2023-24 LCAP. Student performance on Smarter Balanced Assessments has been flat, in particular for the middle school students in the CARE programs who are represented in Hickey's enrollment. SCOE's local assessments, administered in English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics at least 40 instructional days apart, show that just 46% of students tested made grade-level growth in ELA and 41% made grade-level growth in math. While all student groups are not performing at standard, these student groups at Hickey will be supported by targeted actions in Goal 1 to improve academics: White students (ELAMath); Socio-Economically Disadvantaged and Hispanic (Math). North Area Community School had no students participate in Smarter Balanced Assessments in 2023, resulting in SED, White, and Hispanic students receiving the lowest performance level. All eligible students will be engaged and supported through the testing process, with consideration for providing incentives to motivate participation.

During the LCAP development process, teachers and administrators positively noted the 2023-24 pilot of professional learning communities. SCOE's Curriculum Collaboration team guides this process to develop, implement and co-teach effective strategies. Principals are modifying their site meeting schedules within existing timeframe parameters in order to allow their instructional staff additional opportunities to collaborate with the objective of working toward the cycles of continuous improvement, including coaching for lessons that include culturally and linguistically responsive instruction. Community based organizations supported the provision of high-dosage tutoring for intervention and engaging students' interests in topics ranging from Arts and CTE to experiences such as field trips, internships, apprenticeships and civics education.

SCOE plans to improve student achievement using a systematic approach, using data to provide appropriate interventions, and building capacity of staff to provide high quality first instruction. Progress will primarily be measured using the California School Dashboard metrics and select local metrics, including qualitative data obtained from surveys, listening circles, and regular educational partner engagement.

# Goals and Actions

## Goal
**Goal #**: 2  
**Description**: Student and Family Engagement: Using a whole child approach, provide students with supports and enriching educational experiences through the power of partnership with families, targeted staff, and community partners. Ninety-five percent of parents and students will report a positive school climate annually.  
**Type of Goal**: Broad Goal  

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.
- Priority 3: Parental Involvement (Engagement)  
- Priority 5: Pupil Engagement (Engagement)  
- Priority 6: School Climate (Engagement)  
- Priority 8: Other Pupil Outcomes (Pupil Outcomes)  
- Priority 9: Expelled Pupils – COEs Only (Conditions of Learning)  
- Priority 10: Foster Youth – COEs Only (Conditions of Learning)  

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.
This goal seeks to build a sense of community for parents and students in the context of alternative education that meets the needs of all, given the specialized settings of SCOE schools and programs. SCOE schools provide positive and supportive educational environments for students, but a review of qualitative data reflects a need to continue expanding partnerships with families.

SCOE's survey of parents, students, staff and educational partners assesses student needs and family perception of the resources and services provided by SCOE schools. In addition to academic programs, the survey assessed school climate and culture, and supports for students. The parent survey demonstrated that parent engagement with the school continues to be an area for growth. About one-fifth of parent respondents indicated they had not participated in any activities with their child's school. Nearly half (43%) were unsure that their child's school offers activities that include families. A majority of survey respondents felt welcomed at school, but a small percentage disagreed. This goal expands SCOE's engagement with families with additional opportunities for capacity-building workshops and improved two-way communication. The home visit model will be shifted to one that builds trusting relationships with students and families.

Students surveyed on their engagement noted they feel supported by their teacher and are progressing in their core classes, but several barriers were noted for their consistent attendance: doctor's appointments, lack of sleep, transportation, and childcare were frequently cited. By providing students with supports and resources, we expect to improve attendance and reduce chronic absenteeism, especially for students experiencing homelessness and those in the Foundations Academy. Partnerships with community-based organizations, mentors, and activities both in and out of school that foster engagement are planned to increase student interest in attending school. About half of students are provided with counseling and support services; these wraparound services continue to be key to supporting student needs.

# Goals and Actions

## Goal
| Goal # | Description | Type of Goal |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 4      | Equitable College and Career Access By 2027, increase the percent of students attending El Centro, Colley, Hickey, North Area and Palmiter identified as Prepared on the Dashboard College Career Indicator from 0.5% to 30%. | Equity Multiplier Focus Goal |

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.
- Priority 4: Pupil Achievement (Pupil Outcomes)
- Priority 5: Pupil Engagement (Engagement)
- Priority 8: Other Pupil Outcomes (Pupil Outcomes)

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.
The College Career Indicator (CCI) results for the graduating class of 2023 demonstrated a strong need to provide SCOE students with a wider range of opportunities to explore career and post-secondary options. Every student group received the lowest performance level on the Dashboard. With the multiple measures that comprise the CCI in mind, SCOE plans to implement additional services and supports for students. These additions will be designed to increase student engagement, and ensure that students are ready for the workforce or future post-secondary training opportunities. SCOE will implement these activities address the suspension rate at Hickey and Palmiter Jr. / Sr. High Schools as the root cause analysis and student climate survey indicated that the students enrolled are less engaged in their programming.

All educational partners consulted for the development of the Equity Multiplier goal strongly supported enhancing the aspects of Career Technical Education, work-based learning / SCOE Enterprises, arts and media access to support re-engagement and foster students' interest in their educational program. Administrators, teachers and district staff continue to emphasize the need for literacy intervention based on the very low reading levels of SCOE students. Students expressed their interest in participating in CTE pathways, and having opportunities for enriching activities.

SCOE plans to measure the progress of this goal with the Dashboard College Career Indicator, the one year DASS graduation rate, and the suspension rate at Equity Multipliers sites.

## Required Descriptions

### LEA-wide and Schoolwide Actions
For each action being provided to an entire LEA or school, provide an explanation of (1) the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed, (2) how the action is designed to address the identified need(s) and why it is being provided on an LEA or schoolwide basis, and (3) the metric(s) used to measure the effectiveness of the action in improving outcomes for the unduplicated student group(s).

| Goal and Action # | Identified Need(s) | How the Action(s) Address Need(s) and Why it is Provided on an LEA-wide or Schoolwide Basis | Metric(s) to Monitor Effectiveness |
|-------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1.1 Action: Increase student proficiency in English Language Arts and Math | Need: After assessing the needs, conditions, and circumstances of low income students, foster youth, and English learners, we noted that the specific academic performance of these student groups are very low. The 2023 California School Dashboard (Dashboard) | SCOE will provide a coherent learning system, including aligned professional learning and interventions. This action is provided on an LEA-wide basis and we expect that all students will benefit. However, SCOE continues to believe that regular, data-informed collaboration and focused, collaborative leadership is the key to providing differentiated instruction, intervention, and engaging curriculum for struggling low-income students, foster youth, and English learners to ensure they receive the targeted attention that will | Dashboard Academic Indicator (ELA/Math), CAASPP assessments |

| 1.3 Action: College and Career Readiness | reported very low performance for these student groups in ELA and Math: Socioeconomically Disadvantaged (SED), Hispanic, African American and White. Additionally upon disaggregating the performance of English learners, the academic performance on the Dashboard (excluding Reclassified Fluent English Proficient) is lower than almost every other student group. Despite CTE offerings, few students are completing a CTE pathway. The reading level for students entering SCOE programs is gauged at approximately fourth grade level. Scope: SCOPE students performance on the Dashboard College Career Indicator (CCI) reflects the lowest performance level. Despite CTE offerings, few students complete a CTE pathway. Educational partner engagement across all groups (students, teachers, parents, community based organizations) stressed the importance of providing students with classes and experiences that will support positive outcomes in post-secondary. Students are interested in out of the classroom and "real world" experiences. | A new framework of leadership to support implementation of High Quality First Instruction for high-need student groups has been implemented. The addition of a Director of Court and Community Schools, Director of College and Career Readiness, and CTE Coordinator work together to observe and coach instruction in the classroom, lead the expansion of CTE programs, and develop additional curricular resources designed to be culturally relevant and aligned to the interests of SCOE students. These actions are provided on an LEA-wide basis and we expect that all students will benefit. However, SCOE continues to believe that regular, data-informed collaboration and focused, collaborative leadership is the key to providing differentiated instruction, intervention, and engaging curriculum for struggling low-income students, foster youth, and English learners to show positive outcomes. | Dashboard College Career Indicator |

| **2.1 Action:** Strengthen Home School Partnership | **Need:** The needs of unduplicated students are connected to the engagement of their family members. SCOE's parent survey demonstrated that parent engagement with the school continues to be an area for growth. About one-fifth of parent respondents indicated they had not participated in any activities with their child's school. Nearly half (43%) were unsure that their child's school offers activities that include families. A majority of survey respondents felt welcomed at school, but a small percentage disagreed. | To address the needs, conditions and circumstances of SCOE students and their families, the vice principal roles will continue and will further build trust and strong relationships through consistent two-way communication. SCOE continues to fund translation services to facilitate effective, language-appropriate communication with families. In 2023-24, SCOE plans to provide resources through parent classes on parenting skills, combating substance abuse, post secondary options, and career opportunities. Teachers and classified staff will have the opportunity to participate in Parent Teacher Home Visit training as another means of building relationships. The expectation is that the expansion of this action will be effective in improving parent and guardian satisfaction with programs, attendance at school events and participation in school committees. | Parent Satisfaction as measured by annual LCAP survey |

| 2.4 Action: Enrichment | Need: SCOE has learned through listening circles, the Youth Advisory Council, and annual LCAP survey that students report their greatest engagement is with activities that connect to career exploration and provide hands-on experience. Increasing student engagement is expected to increase attendance rates and reduce chronic absenteeism. | Scope: LEA-wide | SCOE partners with a select group of dedicated nonprofits to provide in-school and after school interventions: HAWK Institute, 916 Ink, Green Tech, Earth Mama Healing, Scholastic Journalism Project, and Northern California Construction Training. Court and Community Schools also contract externally with Mentor California and Services Department to provide mentoring services to identified high need students. Summer Learning is a program titled "Game On" which combines technology with learning. In 2023-24, a new project, SCOE Enterprises, will be implemented to provide an opportunity for student enterprise. Students will become involved in developing business-type programs that will mirror what may be experienced upon successful | Annual Student Survey, Chronic Absenteeism rate |

Limited Actions |  |  | 
1.2 | Action: English Language Development<br>Need: English learners are performing below All Students on the Dashboard academic indicators when disaggregated as "Current ELs." The English Learner Progress Indicator has shown that ELs are making progress, but the 2023 Dashboard still reports about 35% of ELs maintain or decrease their ELPI level.<br>Scope: Limited to Unduplicated Student Group(s) | This action is provided on an LEA-wide basis but is focused on the needs of English learners. Differentiated instruction, intervention, and engaging curriculum for English learners and students identified as Long Term English Learners (LTELs) will be coached and monitored. Professional development offered will also focus on the unique needs of LTELs for the most impact. The expectation will be continued improvement in the reclassification rate of English learners and Dashboard performance in Academics as well as the English Learner Progress Indicator. | Dashboard English Learner Progress Indicator (ELPI), Reclassification Rate

# Local Control and Accountability Plan Instructions

## Plan Summary

## Engaging Educational Partners

## Goals and Actions

## Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students

For additional questions or technical assistance related to the completion of the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) template, please contact the local county office of education (COE), or the California Department of Education’s (CDE’s) Local Agency Systems Support Office, by phone at 916-319-0809 or by email at LCFF@cde.ca.gov.

## Introduction and Instructions

The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) requires local educational agencies (LEAs) to engage their local educational partners in an annual planning process to evaluate their progress within eight state priority areas encompassing all statutory metrics (COEs have 10 state priorities). LEAs document the results of this planning process in the LCAP using the template adopted by the State Board of Education.

The LCAP development process serves three distinct, but related functions:

- **Comprehensive Strategic Planning**: The process of developing and annually updating the LCAP supports comprehensive strategic planning, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the California School Dashboard (California Education Code [EC] Section 52064[e][1]). Strategic planning that is comprehensive connects budgetary decisions to teaching and learning performance data. LEAs should continually evaluate the hard choices they make about the use of limited resources to meet student and community needs to ensure opportunities and outcomes are improved for all students.

- **Meaningful Engagement of Educational Partners**: The LCAP development process should result in an LCAP that reflects decisions made through meaningful engagement (EC Section 52064[e][1]). Local educational partners possess valuable perspectives and insights about an LEA's programs and services. Effective strategic planning will incorporate these perspectives and insights in order to identify potential goals and actions to be included in the LCAP.

- **Accountability and Compliance**: The LCAP serves an important accountability function because the nature of some LCAP template sections require LEAs to show that they have complied with various requirements specified in the LCFF statutes and regulations, most notably:
  - Demonstrating that LEAs are increasing or improving services for foster youth, English learners, including long-term English learners, and low-income students in proportion to the amount of additional funding those students generate under LCFF (EC Section 52064[b][4-6]).
  - Establishing goals, supported by actions and related expenditures, that address the statutory priority areas and statutory metrics (EC sections 52064[b][1] and [2]).
  
  - **NOTE**: As specified in EC Section 52064(b)(1), the LCAP must provide a description of the annual goals, for all pupils and each subgroup of pupils identified pursuant to EC Section 52052, to be achieved for each of the state priorities. Beginning in 2023–24, EC

Page 82 of 109
<!-- Page 83 -->
![2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE)](https://example.com/image.png)

Section 52052 identifies long-term English learners as a separate and distinct pupil subgroup with a numerical significance at 15 students.

- Annually reviewing and updating the LCAP to reflect progress toward the goals (EC Section 52064[b][7]).
- Ensuring that all increases attributable to supplemental and concentration grant calculations, including concentration grant add-on funding and/or LCFF carryover, are reflected in the LCAP (EC sections 52064[b][6], [8], and [11]).

The LCAP template, like each LEA’s final adopted LCAP, is a document, not a process. LEAs must use the template to memorialize the outcome of their LCAP development process, which must: (a) reflect comprehensive strategic planning, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the California School Dashboard (Dashboard), (b) through meaningful engagement with educational partners that (c) meets legal requirements, as reflected in the final adopted LCAP. The sections included within the LCAP template do not and cannot reflect the full development process, just as the LCAP template itself is not intended as a tool for engaging educational partners.

If a county superintendent of schools has jurisdiction over a single school district, the county board of education and the governing board of the school district may adopt and file for review and approval a single LCAP consistent with the requirements in EC sections 52060, 52062, 52066, 52068, and 52070. The LCAP must clearly articulate to which entity’s budget (school district or county superintendent of schools) all budgeted and actual expenditures are aligned.

The revised LCAP template for the 2024–25, 2025–26, and 2026–27 school years reflects statutory changes made through Senate Bill 114 (Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review), Chapter 48, Statutes of 2023.

At its most basic, the adopted LCAP should attempt to distill not just what the LEA is doing for students in transitional kindergarten through grade twelve (TK–12), but also allow educational partners to understand what and why, and whether those strategies are leading to improved opportunities and outcomes for students. LEAs are strongly encouraged to use language and a level of detail in their adopted LCAPs intended to be meaningful and accessible for the LEA’s diverse educational partners and the broader public.

In developing and finalizing the LCAP for adoption, LEAs are encouraged to keep the following overarching frame at the forefront of the strategic planning and educational partner engagement functions:

Given present performance across the state priorities and on indicators in the Dashboard, how is the LEA using its budgetary resources to respond to TK–12 student and community needs, and address any performance gaps, including by meeting its obligation to increase or improve services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students?

LEAs are encouraged to focus on a set of metrics and actions which, based on research, experience, and input gathered from educational partners, the LEA believes will have the biggest impact on behalf of its TK–12 students.

These instructions address the requirements for each section of the LCAP, but may include information about effective practices when developing the LCAP and completing the LCAP document. Additionally, the beginning of each template section includes information emphasizing the purpose that section serves.

# Plan Summary

## Purpose
A well-developed Plan Summary section provides a meaningful context for the LCAP. This section provides information about an LEA’s community as well as relevant information about student needs and performance. In order to present a meaningful context for the rest of the LCAP, the content of this section should be clearly and meaningfully related to the content included throughout each subsequent section of the LCAP.

## Requirements and Instructions

### General Information
A description of the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades transitional kindergarten–12, as applicable to the LEA.

Briefly describe the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades TK–12, as applicable to the LEA.
- For example, information about an LEA in terms of geography, enrollment, employment, the number and size of specific schools, recent community challenges, and other such information the LEA may wish to include can enable a reader to more fully understand the LEA’s LCAP.
- As part of this response, identify all schools within the LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funding.

### Reflections: Annual Performance
A reflection on annual performance based on a review of the California School Dashboard (Dashboard) and local data.

Reflect on the LEA’s annual performance on the Dashboard and local data. This may include both successes and challenges identified by the LEA during the development process.

LEAs are encouraged to highlight how they are addressing the identified needs of student groups, and/or schools within the LCAP as part of this response.

As part of this response, the LEA must identify the following, which will remain unchanged during the three-year LCAP cycle:
- Any school within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the 2023 Dashboard;
- Any student group within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the 2023 Dashboard; and/or
- Any student group within a school within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the 2023 Dashboard.

### Reflections: Technical Assistance
As applicable, a summary of the work underway as part of technical assistance.

Annually identify the reason(s) the LEA is eligible for or has requested technical assistance consistent with EC sections 47607.3, 52071, 52071.5, 52072, or 52072.5, and provide a summary of the work underway as part of receiving technical assistance. The most common form of this technical assistance is frequently referred to as Differentiated Assistance; however, this also includes LEAs that have requested technical assistance from their COE.

- If the LEA is not eligible for or receiving technical assistance, the LEA may respond to this prompt as "Not Applicable."

**Comprehensive Support and Improvement**  
An LEA with a school or schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement (CSI) under the Every Student Succeeds Act must respond to the following prompts:

**Schools Identified**  
A list of the schools in the LEA that are eligible for comprehensive support and improvement.
- Identify the schools within the LEA that have been identified for CSI.

**Support for Identified Schools**  
A description of how the LEA has or will support its eligible schools in developing comprehensive support and improvement plans.
- Describe how the LEA has or will support the identified schools in developing CSI plans that included a school-level needs assessment, evidence-based interventions, and the identification of any resource inequities to be addressed through the implementation of the CSI plan.

**Monitoring and Evaluating Effectiveness**  
A description of how the LEA will monitor and evaluate the plan to support student and school improvement.
- Describe how the LEA will monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the CSI plan to support student and school improvement.

**Engaging Educational Partners**  
**Purpose**  
Significant and purposeful engagement of parents, students, educators, and other educational partners, including those representing the student groups identified by LCFF, is critical to the development of the LCAP and the budget process. Consistent with statute, such engagement should support comprehensive strategic planning, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the Dashboard, accountability, and improvement across the state priorities and locally identified priorities (EC Section 52064[e][1]). Engagement of educational partners is an ongoing, annual process.

This section is designed to reflect how the engagement of educational partners influenced the decisions reflected in the adopted LCAP. The goal is to allow educational partners that participated in the LCAP development process and the broader public to understand how the LEA engaged educational partners and the impact of that engagement. LEAs are encouraged to keep this goal in the forefront when completing this section.

<!-- Page 86 -->
School districts and COEs: EC sections 52060(g) (California Legislative Information) and 52066(g) (California Legislative Information) specify the educational partners that must be consulted when developing the LCAP:

- Teachers,
- Principals,
- Administrators,
- Other school personnel,
- Local bargaining units of the LEA,
- Parents, and
- Students

A school district or COE receiving Equity Multiplier funds must also consult with educational partners at schools generating Equity Multiplier funds in the development of the LCAP, specifically, in the development of the required focus goal for each applicable school.

Before adopting the LCAP, school districts and COEs must share it with the applicable committees, as identified below under Requirements and Instructions. The superintendent is required by statute to respond in writing to the comments received from these committees. School districts and COEs must also consult with the special education local plan area administrator(s) when developing the LCAP.

Charter schools: EC Section 47606.5(d) (California Legislative Information) requires that the following educational partners be consulted with when developing the LCAP:

- Teachers,
- Principals,
- Administrators,
- Other school personnel,
- Parents, and
- Students

A charter school receiving Equity Multiplier funds must also consult with educational partners at the school generating Equity Multiplier funds in the development of the LCAP, specifically, in the development of the required focus goal for the school.

The LCAP should also be shared with, and LEAs should request input from, schoolsite-level advisory groups, as applicable (e.g., schoolsite councils, English Learner Advisory Councils, student advisory groups, etc.), to facilitate alignment between schoolsite and district-level goals. Information and resources that support effective engagement, define student consultation, and provide the requirements for advisory group composition, can be found under Resources on the CDE’s LCAP webpage.

Before the governing board/body of an LEA considers the adoption of the LCAP, the LEA must meet the following legal requirements:

- For school districts, see Education Code Section 52062 (California Legislative Information);

  - Note: Charter schools using the LCAP as the School Plan for Student Achievement must meet the requirements of EC Section 52062(a).

A summary of the process used to engage educational partners in the development of the LCAP.  
School districts and county offices of education must, at a minimum, consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, local bargaining units, parents, and students in the development of the LCAP.  
Charter schools must, at a minimum, consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, parents, and students in the development of the LCAP.  
An LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funds must also consult with educational partners at schools generating Equity Multiplier funds in the development of the LCAP, specifically, in the development of the required focus goal for each applicable school.  

**Complete the table as follows:**  
**Educational Partners**  
Identify the applicable educational partner(s) or group(s) that were engaged in the development of the LCAP.  

**Process for Engagement**  
Describe the engagement process used by the LEA to involve the identified educational partner(s) in the development of the LCAP. At a minimum, the LEA must describe how it met its obligation to consult with all statutorily required educational partners, as applicable to the type of LEA.  
- A sufficient response to this prompt must include general information about the timeline of the process and meetings or other engagement strategies with educational partners. A response may also include information about an LEA’s philosophical approach to engaging its educational partners.  
- An LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funds must also include a summary of how it consulted with educational partners at schools generating Equity Multiplier funds in the development of the LCAP, specifically, in the development of the required focus goal for each applicable school.  

**A description of how the adopted LCAP was influenced by the feedback provided by educational partners.**  
Describe any goals, metrics, actions, or budgeted expenditures in the LCAP that were influenced by or developed in response to the educational partner feedback.  

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE)  
Page 87 of 109  
<!-- Page 88 -->
- A sufficient response to this prompt will provide educational partners and the public with clear, specific information about how the engagement process influenced the development of the LCAP. This may include a description of how the LEA prioritized requests of educational partners within the context of the budgetary resources available or otherwise prioritized areas of focus within the LCAP.

- An LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funds must include a description of how the consultation with educational partners at schools generating Equity Multiplier funds influenced the development of the adopted LCAP.

- For the purposes of this prompt, this may also include, but is not necessarily limited to:
  - Inclusion of a goal or decision to pursue a Focus Goal (as described below)
  - Inclusion of metrics other than the statutorily required metrics
  - Determination of the target outcome on one or more metrics
  - Inclusion of performance by one or more student groups in the Measuring and Reporting Results subsection
  - Inclusion of action(s) or a group of actions
  - Elimination of action(s) or group of actions
  - Changes to the level of proposed expenditures for one or more actions
  - Inclusion of action(s) as contributing to increased or improved services for unduplicated students
  - Analysis of effectiveness of the specific actions to achieve the goal
  - Analysis of material differences in expenditures
  - Analysis of changes made to a goal for the ensuing LCAP year based on the annual update process
  - Analysis of challenges or successes in the implementation of actions

**Goals and Actions**

**Purpose**  
Well-developed goals will clearly communicate to educational partners what the LEA plans to accomplish, what the LEA plans to do in order to accomplish the goal, and how the LEA will know when it has accomplished the goal. A goal statement, associated metrics and expected outcomes, and the actions included in the goal must be in alignment. The explanation for why the LEA included a goal is an opportunity for LEAs to clearly communicate to educational partners and the public why, among the various strengths and areas for improvement highlighted by performance data and strategies and actions that could be pursued, the LEA decided to pursue this goal, and the related metrics, expected outcomes, actions, and expenditures.

A well-developed goal can be focused on the performance relative to a metric or metrics for all students, a specific student group(s), narrowing performance gaps, or implementing programs or strategies expected to impact outcomes. LEAs should assess the performance of their student groups when developing goals and the related actions to achieve such goals.

**Requirements and Instructions**  
LEAs should prioritize the goals, specific actions, and related expenditures included within the LCAP within one or more state priorities. LEAs must consider performance on the state and local indicators, including their locally collected and reported data for the local indicators that are included in the Dashboard, in determining whether and how to prioritize its goals within the LCAP. As previously stated, strategic planning that 2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE) Page 88 of 109
<!-- Page 89 -->
![Image](https://example.com/image.png)

is comprehensive connects budgetary decisions to teaching and learning performance data. LEAs should continually evaluate the hard choices they make about the use of limited resources to meet student and community needs to ensure opportunities and outcomes are improved for all students, and to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the Dashboard.

In order to support prioritization of goals, the LCAP template provides LEAs with the option of developing three different kinds of goals:

- **Focus Goal:** A Focus Goal is relatively more concentrated in scope and may focus on a fewer number of metrics to measure improvement. A Focus Goal statement will be time bound and make clear how the goal is to be measured.
  - All Equity Multiplier goals must be developed as focus goals. For additional information, see Required Focus Goal(s) for LEAs Receiving Equity Multiplier Funding below.

- **Broad Goal:** A Broad Goal is relatively less concentrated in its scope and may focus on improving performance across a wide range of metrics.

- **Maintenance of Progress Goal:** A Maintenance of Progress Goal includes actions that may be ongoing without significant changes and allows an LEA to track performance on any metrics not addressed in the other goals of the LCAP.

### Requirement to Address the LCFF State Priorities

At a minimum, the LCAP must address all LCFF priorities and associated metrics articulated in EC sections 52060(d) and 52066(d), as applicable to the LEA. The LCFF State Priorities Summary provides a summary of EC sections 52060(d) and 52066(d) to aid in the development of the LCAP.

Respond to the following prompts, as applicable:

### Focus Goal(s)

**Description**

The description provided for a Focus Goal must be specific, measurable, and time bound.

- An LEA develops a Focus Goal to address areas of need that may require or benefit from a more specific and data intensive approach.
- The Focus Goal can explicitly reference the metric(s) by which achievement of the goal will be measured and the time frame according to which the LEA expects to achieve the goal.

### Type of Goal

Identify the type of goal being implemented as a Focus Goal.

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.

Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

LEAs are encouraged to approach an Equity Multiplier goal from a wholistic standpoint, considering how the goal might maximize student outcomes through the use of LCFF and other funding in addition to Equity Multiplier funds.

- Equity Multiplier funds must be used to supplement, not supplant, funding provided to Equity Multiplier schoolsites for purposes of the LCFF, the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program (ELO-P), the Literacy Coaches and Reading Specialists (LCRS) Grant Program, and/or the California Community Schools Partnership Program (CCSPP).
- This means that Equity Multiplier funds must not be used to replace funding that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement LEA-wide actions identified in the LCAP or that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement provisions of the ELO-P, the LCRS, and/or the CCSPP.

Note: EC Section 42238.024(b)(1) (California Legislative Information) requires that Equity Multiplier funds be used for the provision of evidence-based services and supports for students. Evidence-based services and supports are based on objective evidence that has informed the design of the service or support and/or guides the modification of those services and supports. Evidence-based supports and strategies are most commonly based on educational research and/or metrics of LEA, school, and/or student performance.

**Broad Goal Description**

Describe what the LEA plans to achieve through the actions included in the goal.

- The description of a broad goal will be clearly aligned with the expected measurable outcomes included for the goal.
- The goal description organizes the actions and expected outcomes in a cohesive and consistent manner.
- A goal description is specific enough to be measurable in either quantitative or qualitative terms. A broad goal is not as specific as a focus goal. While it is specific enough to be measurable, there are many different metrics for measuring progress toward the goal.

**Type of Goal**

Identify the type of goal being implemented as a Broad Goal.

**State Priorities addressed by this goal.**

Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

Explain why the LEA developed this goal and how the actions and metrics grouped together will help achieve the goal.

**Maintenance of Progress Goal**  
**Description**  
Describe how the LEA intends to maintain the progress made in the LCFF State Priorities not addressed by the other goals in the LCAP.
- Use this type of goal to address the state priorities and applicable metrics not addressed within the other goals in the LCAP.
- The state priorities and metrics to be addressed in this section are those for which the LEA, in consultation with educational partners, has determined to maintain actions and monitor progress while focusing implementation efforts on the actions covered by other goals in the LCAP.

**Type of Goal**  
Identify the type of goal being implemented as a Maintenance of Progress Goal.

**State Priorities addressed by this goal.**  
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.  
Explain how the actions will sustain the progress exemplified by the related metrics.

**Measuring and Reporting Results:**  
For each LCAP year, identify the metric(s) that the LEA will use to track progress toward the expected outcomes.
- LEAs must identify metrics for specific student groups, as appropriate, including expected outcomes that address and reduce disparities in outcomes between student groups.
- The metrics may be quantitative or qualitative; but at minimum, an LEA’s LCAP must include goals that are measured using all of the applicable metrics for the related state priorities, in each LCAP year, as applicable to the type of LEA.
- To the extent a state priority does not specify one or more metrics (e.g., implementation of state academic content and performance standards), the LEA must identify a metric to use within the LCAP. For these state priorities, LEAs are encouraged to use metrics based on or reported through the relevant local indicator self-reflection tools within the Dashboard.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE)  
Page 92 of 109
<!-- Page 93 -->
- **Required metrics for LEA-wide actions:** For each action identified as 1) contributing towards the requirement to increase or improve services for foster youth, English learners, including long-term English learners, and low-income students and 2) being provided on an LEA-wide basis, the LEA must identify one or more metrics to monitor the effectiveness of the action and its budgeted expenditures.
  - These required metrics may be identified within the action description or the first prompt in the increased or improved services section, however the description must clearly identify the metric(s) being used to monitor the effectiveness of the action and the action(s) that the metric(s) apply to.

- **Required metrics for Equity Multiplier goals:** For each Equity Multiplier goal, the LEA must identify:
  - The specific metrics for each identified student group at each specific schoolsite, as applicable, to measure the progress toward the goal, and/or
  - The specific metrics used to measure progress in meeting the goal related to credentialing, subject matter preparation, or educator retention at each specific schoolsite.

Complete the table as follows:

**Metric #**
- Enter the metric number.

**Metric**
- Identify the standard of measure being used to determine progress towards the goal and/or to measure the effectiveness of one or more actions associated with the goal.

**Baseline**
- Enter the baseline when completing the LCAP for 2024–25.
  - Use the most recent data associated with the metric available at the time of adoption of the LCAP for the first year of the three-year plan. LEAs may use data as reported on the 2023 Dashboard for the baseline of a metric only if that data represents the most recent available data (e.g., high school graduation rate).
  - Using the most recent data available may involve reviewing data the LEA is preparing for submission to the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CALPADS) or data that the LEA has recently submitted to CALPADS.
  - Indicate the school year to which the baseline data applies.
  - The baseline data must remain unchanged throughout the three-year LCAP.
    - This requirement is not intended to prevent LEAs from revising the baseline data if it is necessary to do so. For example, if an LEA identifies that its data collection practices for a particular metric are leading to inaccurate data and revises its practice to obtain accurate data.

accurate data, it would also be appropriate for the LEA to revise the baseline data to align with the more accurate data process and report its results using the accurate data.

- If an LEA chooses to revise its baseline data, then, at a minimum, it must clearly identify the change as part of its response to the description of changes prompt in the Goal Analysis for the goal. LEAs are also strongly encouraged to involve their educational partners in the decision of whether or not to revise a baseline and to communicate the proposed change to their educational partners.

  - Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one- or two-year LCAP may identify a new baseline each year, as applicable.

### Year 1 Outcome
- When completing the LCAP for 2025–26, enter the most recent data available. Indicate the school year to which the data applies.
  - Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one-year LCAP may provide the Year 1 Outcome when completing the LCAP for both 2025–26 and 2026–27 or may provide the Year 1 Outcome for 2025–26 and provide the Year 2 Outcome for 2026–27.

### Year 2 Outcome
- When completing the LCAP for 2026–27, enter the most recent data available. Indicate the school year to which the data applies.
  - Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one-year LCAP may identify the Year 2 Outcome as not applicable when completing the LCAP for 2026–27 or may provide the Year 2 Outcome for 2026–27.

### Target for Year 3 Outcome
- When completing the first year of the LCAP, enter the target outcome for the relevant metric the LEA expects to achieve by the end of the three-year LCAP cycle.
  - Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one- or two-year LCAP may identify a Target for Year 1 or Target for Year 2, as applicable.

### Current Difference from Baseline
- When completing the LCAP for 2025–26 and 2026–27, enter the current difference between the baseline and the yearly outcome, as applicable.
  - Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one- or two-year LCAP will identify the current difference between the baseline and the yearly outcome for Year 1 and/or the current difference between the baseline and the yearly outcome for Year 2, as applicable.

- For actions that contribute to meeting the increased or improved services requirement, the LEA may include an explanation of how each action is principally directed towards and effective in meeting the LEA's goals for unduplicated students, as described in the instructions for the Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students section.

- As previously noted, for each action identified as 1) contributing towards the requirement to increase or improve services for foster youth, English learners, including long-term English learners, and low-income students and 2) being provided on an LEA-wide basis, the LEA must identify one or more metrics to monitor the effectiveness of the action and its budgeted expenditures.

### Total Funds
- Enter the total amount of expenditures associated with this action. Budgeted expenditures from specific fund sources will be provided in the action tables.

### Contributing
- Indicate whether the action contributes to meeting the increased or improved services requirement as described in the Increased or Improved Services section using a “Y” for Yes or an “N” for No.
  
  - **Note:** for each such contributing action, the LEA will need to provide additional information in the Increased or Improved Services section to address the requirements in California Code of Regulations, Title 5 [5 CCR] Section 15496 in the Increased or Improved Services section of the LCAP.

### Actions for Foster Youth
- School districts, COEs, and charter schools that have a numerically significant foster youth student subgroup are encouraged to include specific actions in the LCAP designed to meet needs specific to foster youth students.

### Required Actions
- LEAs with 30 or more English learners and/or 15 or more long-term English learners must include specific actions in the LCAP related to, at a minimum:
  - Language acquisition programs, as defined in EC Section 306, provided to students, and
  - Professional development for teachers.
  
  - If an LEA has both 30 or more English learners and 15 or more long-term English learners, the LEA must include actions for both English learners and long-term English learners.

- LEAs eligible for technical assistance pursuant to EC sections 47607.3, 52071.5, 52072, or 52072.5, must include specific actions within the LCAP related to its implementation of the work underway as part of technical assistance. The most common form of this technical assistance is frequently referred to as Differentiated Assistance.

- LEAs that have Red Dashboard indicators for (1) a school within the LEA, (2) a student group within the LEA, and/or (3) a student group within any school within the LEA must include one or more specific actions within the LCAP:
  - The specific action(s) must be directed towards the identified student group(s) and/or school(s) and must address the identified state indicator(s) for which the student group or school received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard. Each student group and/or school that receives the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard must be addressed by one or more actions.
  - These required actions will be effective for the three-year LCAP cycle.

## Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students

### Purpose
A well-written Increased or Improved Services section provides educational partners with a comprehensive description, within a single dedicated section, of how an LEA plans to increase or improve services for its unduplicated students as defined in EC Section 42238.02 in grades TK–12 as compared to all students in grades TK–12, as applicable, and how LEA-wide or schoolwide actions identified for this purpose meet regulatory requirements. Descriptions provided should include sufficient detail yet be succinct to promote a broader understanding of educational partners to facilitate their ability to provide input. An LEA’s description in this section must align with the actions included in the Goals and Actions section as contributing.

**Please Note:** For the purpose of meeting the Increased or Improved Services requirement and consistent with EC Section 42238.02, long-term English learners are included in the English learner student group.

### Statutory Requirements
An LEA is required to demonstrate in its LCAP how it is increasing or improving services for its students who are foster youth, English learners, and/or low-income, collectively referred to as unduplicated students, as compared to the services provided to all students in proportion to the increase in funding it receives based on the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the LEA (EC Section 42238.07[a][1], EC Section 52064[b][8][B]; 5 CCR Section 15496[a]). This proportionality percentage is also known as the “minimum proportionality percentage” or “MPP.” The manner in which an LEA demonstrates it is meeting its MPP is two-fold: (1) through the expenditure of LCFF funds or through the identification of a Planned Percentage of Improved Services as documented in the Contributing Actions Table, and (2) through the explanations provided in the Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students section.

To improve services means to grow services in quality and to increase services means to grow services in quantity. Services are increased or improved by those actions in the LCAP that are identified in the Goals and Actions section as contributing to the increased or improved services requirement, whether they are provided across the entire LEA (LEA-wide action), provided to an entire school (Schoolwide action), or solely provided to one or more unduplicated student group(s) (Limited action).

Therefore, for any action contributing to meet the increased or improved services requirement, the LEA must include an explanation of:
- How the action is increasing or improving services for the unduplicated student group(s) (Identified Needs and Action Design), and
- How the action meets the LEA's goals for its unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priority areas (Measurement of Effectiveness).

Page 98 of 109
<!-- Page 99 -->
![LEA-wide and Schoolwide Actions](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=LEA-wide+and+Schoolwide+Actions)

**LEA-wide and Schoolwide Actions**  
In addition to the above required explanations, LEAs must provide a justification for why an LEA-wide or Schoolwide action is being provided to all students and how the action is intended to improve outcomes for unduplicated student group(s) as compared to all students.

- Conclusory statements that a service will help achieve an expected outcome for the goal, without an explicit connection or further explanation as to how, are not sufficient.
- Further, simply stating that an LEA has a high enrollment percentage of a specific student group or groups does not meet the increased or improved services standard because enrolling students is not the same as serving students.

**For School Districts Only**  
Actions provided on an LEA-wide basis at school districts with an unduplicated pupil percentage of less than 55 percent must also include a description of how the actions are the most effective use of the funds to meet the district's goals for its unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priority areas. The description must provide the basis for this determination, including any alternatives considered, supporting research, experience, or educational theory.

Actions provided on a Schoolwide basis for schools with less than 40 percent enrollment of unduplicated pupils must also include a description of how these actions are the most effective use of the funds to meet the district's goals for its unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priority areas. The description must provide the basis for this determination, including any alternatives considered, supporting research, experience, or educational theory.

**Requirements and Instructions**  
Complete the tables as follows:

**Total Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants**  
- Specify the amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grant funds the LEA estimates it will receive in the coming year based on the number and concentration of foster youth, English learner, and low-income students. This amount includes the Additional 15 percent LCFF Concentration Grant.

**Projected Additional 15 percent LCFF Concentration Grant**  
- Specify the amount of additional LCFF concentration grant add-on funding, as described in EC Section 42238.02, that the LEA estimates it will receive in the coming year.

**Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year**  
- Specify the estimated percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the LCAP year as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(7).

**LCFF Carryover — Percentage**  

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE)  
Page 99 of 109
<!-- Page 100 -->
- Specify the LCFF Carryover — Percentage identified in the LCFF Carryover Table. If a carryover percentage is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify a percentage of zero (0.00%).

**LCFF Carryover — Dollar**

- Specify the LCFF Carryover — Dollar amount identified in the LCFF Carryover Table. If a carryover amount is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify an amount of zero ($0).

**Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year**

- Add the Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year and the Proportional LCFF Required Carryover Percentage and specify the percentage. This is the LEA’s percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the LCAP year, as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(7).

---

**Required Descriptions:**

**LEA-wide and Schoolwide Actions**

For each action being provided to an entire LEA or school, provide an explanation of (1) the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed, (2) how the action is designed to address the identified need(s) and why it is being provided on an LEA or schoolwide basis, and (3) the metric(s) used to measure the effectiveness of the action in improving outcomes for the unduplicated student group(s).

If the LEA has provided this required description in the Action Descriptions, state as such within the table.

**Complete the table as follows:**

**Identified Need(s)**

Provide an explanation of the unique identified need(s) of the LEA’s unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed.

An LEA demonstrates how an action is principally directed towards an unduplicated student group when the LEA explains the need(s), condition(s), or circumstance(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) identified through a needs assessment and how the action addresses them. A meaningful needs assessment includes, at a minimum, analysis of applicable student achievement data and educational partner feedback.

**How the Action(s) are Designed to Address Need(s) and Why it is Provided on an LEA-wide or Schoolwide Basis**

Provide an explanation of how the action as designed will address the unique identified need(s) of the LEA’s unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed and the rationale for why the action is being provided on an LEA-wide or schoolwide basis.

- As stated above, conclusory statements that a service will help achieve an expected outcome for the goal, without an explicit connection or further explanation as to how, are not sufficient.

- Further, simply stating that an LEA has a high enrollment percentage of a specific student group or groups does not meet the increased or improved services standard because enrolling students is not the same as serving students.

### Metric(s) to Monitor Effectiveness
Identify the metric(s) being used to measure the progress and effectiveness of the action(s).

**Note for COEs and Charter Schools:** In the case of COEs and charter schools, schoolwide and LEA-wide are considered to be synonymous.

**Limited Actions**  
For each action being solely provided to one or more unduplicated student group(s), provide an explanation of (1) the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) being served, (2) how the action is designed to address the identified need(s), and (3) how the effectiveness of the action in improving outcomes for the unduplicated student group(s) will be measured.

If the LEA has provided the required descriptions in the Action Descriptions, state as such.

Complete the table as follows:

### Identified Need(s)
Provide an explanation of the unique need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) being served identified through the LEA’s needs assessment. A meaningful needs assessment includes, at a minimum, analysis of applicable student achievement data and educational partner feedback.

### How the Action(s) are Designed to Address Need(s)
Provide an explanation of how the action is designed to address the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) being served.

### Metric(s) to Monitor Effectiveness
Identify the metric(s) being used to measure the progress and effectiveness of the action(s).

For any limited action contributing to meeting the increased or improved services requirement that is associated with a Planned Percentage of Improved Services in the Contributing Summary Table rather than an expenditure of LCFF funds, describe the methodology that was used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage, as applicable.

- For each action with an identified Planned Percentage of Improved Services, identify the goal and action number and describe the methodology that was used.

- When identifying a Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA must describe the methodology that it used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage. The percentage of improved services for an action corresponds to the amount of LCFF funding that the LEA estimates it would expend to implement the action if it were funded.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE)  
Page 101 of 109
<!-- Page 102 -->
- For example, an LEA determines that there is a need to analyze data to ensure that instructional aides and expanded learning providers know what targeted supports to provide to students who are foster youth. The LEA could implement this action by hiring additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students, which, based on the LEA’s current pay scale, the LEA estimates would cost $165,000. Instead, the LEA chooses to utilize a portion of existing staff time to analyze data relating to students who are foster youth. This analysis will then be shared with site principals who will use the data to coordinate services provided by instructional assistants and expanded learning providers to target support to students. In this example, the LEA would divide the estimated cost of $165,000 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Total Planned Expenditures Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Planned Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

**Additional Concentration Grant Funding**  
A description of the plan for how the additional concentration grant add-on funding identified above will be used to increase the number of staff providing direct services to students at schools that have a high concentration (above 55 percent) of foster youth, English learners, and low-income students, as applicable.

An LEA that receives the additional concentration grant add-on described in EC Section 42238.02 is required to demonstrate how it is using these funds to increase the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent as compared to the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is equal to or less than 55 percent. The staff who provide direct services to students must be certificated staff and/or classified staff employed by the LEA; classified staff includes custodial staff.

Provide the following descriptions, as applicable to the LEA:

- An LEA that does not receive a concentration grant or the concentration grant add-on must indicate that a response to this prompt is not applicable.
  
- Identify the goal and action numbers of the actions in the LCAP that the LEA is implementing to meet the requirement to increase the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent.

- An LEA that does not have comparison schools from which to describe how it is using the concentration grant add-on funds, such as a single-school LEA or an LEA that only has schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, must describe how it is using the funds to increase the number of credentialed staff, classified staff, or both, including custodial staff, who provide direct services to students at selected schools and the criteria used to determine which schools require additional staffing support.

- In the event that an additional concentration grant add-on is not sufficient to increase staff providing direct services to students at a school with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, the LEA must describe how it is using the funds to retain staff providing direct services to students at a school with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent.

**Complete the table as follows:**

- Provide the staff-to-student ratio of classified staff providing direct services to students with a concentration of unduplicated students that is 55 percent or less and the staff-to-student ratio of classified staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, as applicable to the LEA.

  - The LEA may group its schools by grade span (Elementary, Middle/Junior High, and High Schools), as applicable to the LEA.

- The staff-to-student ratio must be based on the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) staff and the number of enrolled students as counted on the first Wednesday in October of each year.

- Provide the staff-to-student ratio of certificated staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is 55 percent or less and the staff-to-student ratio of certificated staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, as applicable to the LEA.

  - The LEA may group its schools by grade span (Elementary, Middle/Junior High, and High Schools), as applicable to the LEA.

  - The staff-to-student ratio must be based on the number of FTE staff and the number of enrolled students as counted on the first Wednesday in October of each year.

## Action Tables
Complete the Total Planned Expenditures Table for each action in the LCAP. The information entered into this table will automatically populate the other Action Tables. Information is only entered into the Total Planned Expenditures Table, the Annual Update Table, the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table, and the LCFF Carryover Table. The word "input" has been added to column headers to aid in identifying the column(s) where information will be entered. Information is not entered on the remaining Action tables.

The following tables are required to be included as part of the LCAP adopted by the local governing board or governing body:

- **Table 1:** Total Planned Expenditures Table (for the coming LCAP Year)

Note that the LCFF Base Grant for purposes of the LCAP also includes the Necessary Small Schools and Economic Recovery Target allowances for school districts, and County Operations Grant for COEs.

See EC sections 2574 (for COEs) and 42238.02 (for school districts and charter schools), as applicable, for LCFF entitlement calculations.

2. **Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants:** Provide the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants estimated on the basis of the number and concentration of unduplicated students for the coming school year.

3. **Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year:** This percentage will not be entered; it is calculated based on the Projected LCFF Base Grant and the Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8). This is the percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the coming LCAP year.

- **LCFF Carryover — Percentage:** Specify the LCFF Carryover — Percentage identified in the LCFF Carryover Table from the prior LCAP year. If a carryover percentage is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify a percentage of zero (0.00%).

- **Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year:** This percentage will not be entered; it is calculated based on the Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year and the LCFF Carryover — Percentage. *This is the percentage by which the LEA must increase or improve services for unduplicated pupils as compared to the services provided to all students in the coming LCAP year.*

- **Goal #:** Enter the LCAP Goal number for the action.

- **Action #:** Enter the action’s number as indicated in the LCAP Goal.

- **Action Title:** Provide a title of the action.

- **Student Group(s):** Indicate the student group or groups who will be the primary beneficiary of the action by entering “All,” or by entering a specific student group or groups.

- **Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?:** Type “Yes” if the action is included as contributing to meeting the increased or improved services requirement; OR, type “No” if the action is not included as contributing to meeting the increased or improved services requirement.

- If “Yes” is entered into the Contributing column, then complete the following columns:

  - **Scope:** The scope of an action may be LEA-wide (i.e., districtwide, countywide, or charterwide), schoolwide, or limited. An action that is LEA-wide in scope upgrades the entire educational program of the LEA. An action that is schoolwide in scope upgrades the entire educational program of a single school. An action that is limited in its scope is an action that serves only one or more unduplicated student groups.

<!-- Page 105 -->
- **Unduplicated Student Group(s)**: Regardless of scope, contributing actions serve one or more unduplicated student groups. Indicate one or more unduplicated student groups for whom services are being increased or improved as compared to what all students receive.

- **Location**: Identify the location where the action will be provided. If the action is provided to all schools within the LEA, the LEA must indicate “All Schools.” If the action is provided to specific schools within the LEA or specific grade spans only, the LEA must enter “Specific Schools” or “Specific Grade Spans.” Identify the individual school or a subset of schools or grade spans (e.g., all high schools or grades transitional kindergarten through grade five), as appropriate.

- **Time Span**: Enter “ongoing” if the action will be implemented for an indeterminate period of time. Otherwise, indicate the span of time for which the action will be implemented. For example, an LEA might enter “1 Year,” or “2 Years,” or “6 Months.”

- **Total Personnel**: Enter the total amount of personnel expenditures utilized to implement this action.

- **Total Non-Personnel**: This amount will be automatically calculated based on information provided in the Total Personnel column and the Total Funds column.

- **LCFF Funds**: Enter the total amount of LCFF funds utilized to implement this action, if any. LCFF funds include all funds that make up an LEA’s total LCFF target (i.e., base grant, grade span adjustment, supplemental grant, concentration grant, Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant, and Home-To-School Transportation).
  - **Note**: For an action to contribute towards meeting the increased or improved services requirement, it must include some measure of LCFF funding. The action may also include funding from other sources; however, the extent to which an action contributes to meeting the increased or improved services requirement is based on the LCFF funding being used to implement the action.

- **Other State Funds**: Enter the total amount of Other State Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.
  - **Note**: Equity Multiplier funds must be included in the “Other State Funds” category, not in the “LCFF Funds” category. As a reminder, Equity Multiplier funds must be used to supplement, not supplant, funding provided to Equity Multiplier schoolsites for purposes of the LCFF, the ELO-P, the LCRS, and/or the CCSSP. This means that Equity Multiplier funds must not be used to replace funding that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement LEA-wide actions identified in the LEA’s LCAP or that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement provisions of the ELO-P, the LCRS, and/or the CCSSP.

- **Local Funds**: Enter the total amount of Local Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.

- **Federal Funds**: Enter the total amount of Federal Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.

- **Total Funds**: This amount is automatically calculated based on amounts entered in the previous four columns.

- **Planned Percentage of Improved Services**: For any action identified as contributing, being provided on a limited basis to unduplicated students, and that does not have funding associated with the action, enter the planned quality improvement anticipated for the action as.

a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.00%). A limited action is an action that only serves foster youth, English learners, and/or low-income students.

- As noted in the instructions for the Increased or Improved Services section, when identifying a Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA must describe the methodology that it used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage. The percentage of improved services for an action corresponds to the amount of LCFF funding that the LEA estimates it would expend to implement the action if it were funded.

For example, an LEA determines that there is a need to analyze data to ensure that instructional aides and expanded learning providers know what targeted supports to provide to students who are foster youth. The LEA could implement this action by hiring additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students, which, based on the LEA’s current pay scale, the LEA estimates would cost $165,000. Instead, the LEA chooses to utilize a portion of existing staff time to analyze data relating to students who are foster youth. This analysis will then be shared with site principals who will use the data to coordinate services provided by instructional assistants and expanded learning providers to target support to students. In this example, the LEA would divide the estimated cost of $165,000 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Data Entry Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Planned Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

## Contributing Actions Table
As noted above, information will not be entered in the Contributing Actions Table; however, the ‘Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?’ column will need to be checked to ensure that only actions with a “Yes” are displaying. If actions with a “No” are displayed or if actions that are contributing are not displaying in the column, use the drop-down menu in the column header to filter only the “Yes” responses.

## Annual Update Table
In the Annual Update Table, provide the following information for each action in the LCAP for the relevant LCAP year:

- **Estimated Actual Expenditures:** Enter the total estimated actual expenditures to implement this action, if any.

## Contributing Actions Annual Update Table
In the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table, check the ‘Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?’ column to ensure that only actions with a “Yes” are displaying. If actions with a “No” are displayed or if actions that are contributing are not displaying in the column, use the drop-down menu in the column header to filter only the “Yes” responses. Provide the following information for each contributing action in the LCAP for the relevant LCAP year:

- **6. Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants:** Provide the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants estimated based on the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the current school year.

- **Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions:** Enter the total estimated actual expenditure of LCFF funds used to implement this action, if any.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE)  
Page 106 of 109
<!-- Page 107 -->
- **Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services**: For any action identified as contributing, being provided on a Limited basis only to unduplicated students, and that does not have funding associated with the action, enter the total estimated actual quality improvement anticipated for the action as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.00%).
  - Building on the example provided above for calculating the Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA in the example implements the action. As part of the annual update process, the LEA reviews implementation and student outcome data and determines that the action was implemented with fidelity and that outcomes for foster youth students improved. The LEA reviews the original estimated cost for the action and determines that had it hired additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students that estimated actual cost would have been $169,500 due to a cost of living adjustment. The LEA would divide the estimated actual cost of $169,500 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Data Entry Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

**LCFF Carryover Table**
- **9. Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant**: Provide the total amount of estimated LCFF Target Entitlement for the current school year, excluding the supplemental and concentration grants and the add-ons for the Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant program, the former Home-to-School Transportation program, and the Small School District Transportation program, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8). Note that the LCFF Base Grant for purposes of the LCAP also includes the Necessary Small Schools and Economic Recovery Target allowances for school districts, and County Operations Grant for COEs. See EC sections 2574 (for COEs) and 42238.02 (for school districts and charter schools), as applicable, for LCFF entitlement calculations.
  
- **10. Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Current School Year**: This percentage will not be entered. The percentage is calculated based on the amounts of the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9) and the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants (6), pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8), plus the LCFF Carryover – Percentage from the prior year. This is the percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the current LCAP year.

- **11. Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services (7 divided by 9, plus 8)**
  - This percentage is the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions (7) divided by the LCFF Funding (9), then converting the quotient to a percentage and adding the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (8).

- **12. LCFF Carryover — Dollar Amount LCFF Carryover (Subtract 11 from 10 and multiply by 9)**
  - If the Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services (11) is less than the Estimated Actual Percentage to Increase or Improve Services (10), the LEA is required to carry over LCFF funds.
  - The amount of LCFF funds is calculated by subtracting the Estimated Actual Percentage to Increase or Improve Services (11) from the Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services (10) and then multiplying by the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9). This amount is the amount of LCFF funds that is required to be carried over to the coming year.

- **13. LCFF Carryover — Percentage (12 divided by 9)**
  - This percentage is the unmet portion of the Percentage to Increase or Improve Services that the LEA must carry over into the coming LCAP year. The percentage is calculated by dividing the LCFF Carryover (12) by the LCFF Funding (9).
