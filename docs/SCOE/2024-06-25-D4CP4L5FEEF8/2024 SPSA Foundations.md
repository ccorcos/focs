# School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA)

| School Name        | County-District-School (CDS) Code | Schoolsite Council (SSC) Approval Date | Local Board Approval Date |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Foundations Academy | 34-10348-106294                   | June 25, 2024                          |                           |

The School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) is a strategic plan that maximizes the resources available to the school while minimizing duplication of effort with the ultimate goal of increasing student achievement. SPSA development should be aligned with and inform the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) process.

This SPSA template consolidates all school-level planning efforts into one plan for programs funded through the Consolidated Application (ConApp), and for federal Additional Targeted Support and Improvement (ATSI), pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 64001 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). This template is designed to meet schoolwide program planning requirements for both the SPSA and federal ATSI planning requirements.

California’s ESSA State Plan supports the state’s approach to improving student group performance through the utilization of federal resources. Schools use the SPSA to document their approach to maximizing the impact of federal investments in support of underserved students. The implementation of ESSA in California presents an opportunity for schools to innovate with their federally-funded programs and align them with the priority goals of the school and the local educational agency (LEA) that are being realized under the state’s Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF).

The LCFF provides schools and LEAs flexibility to design programs and provide services that meet the needs of students in order to achieve readiness for college, career, and lifelong learning. The SPSA planning process supports continuous cycles of action, reflection, and improvement. Consistent with EC 64001(g)(1), the Schoolsite Council (SSC) is required to develop and annually review the SPSA, establish an annual budget, and make modifications to the plan that reflect changing needs and priorities, as applicable.

This plan is being used by Foundations Academy for meeting the following ESSA planning requirements in alignment with the LCAP and other federal, state, and local programs:

- **Schoolwide Program**
- Additional Targeted Support and Improvement
- Hispanic students and students considered to be low socio-economic disadvantaged (SED) status

This template is based on the December, 2023 CDE revision of the School Plan for Student Achievement. Some modifications have been made to inform the SPSA development process.

**Plan Description**  
Briefly describe your school’s plan for effectively meeting ESSA’s planning requirements in alignment with the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) and other federal, state, and local programs.

This plan is being used by Foundations Academy for meeting the following ESSA planning requirements in alignment with the LCAP and other federal, state, and local programs:

- Schoolwide Program
- Additional Targeted Support and Improvement
- Hispanic students and students considered to be low socio-economic disadvantaged (SED) status

Consistent with the SCOE LCAP, the Foundations Academy serves students in special education who require extensive supports to access their education. Within the Foundations Academy there are two programs. One program located at Spinelli Elementary School, supports students grades transitional kindergarten (TK) through 6th grade with behavior management and emotional regulation; many of these students qualify for special education under the eligibility criteria for Emotional Disturbance. The other programs support students ages 3-22 with daily living skills, mobility, communication, community-based instruction and academics in our Moderate/Severe special day classes located at various school campuses across Sacramento County. Students in the Foundations Academy are referred by collaborating districts within Sacramento County, and these districts remain the District of Special Education Accountability, while SCOE is the service provider for the students and the reporting LEA.

Students participating in the Spinelli Elementary program are predominately low income and often have needs that extend beyond routine school services, including those experiencing homelessness, or who are in temporary housing, and those who have experienced a high level of trauma. The Spinelli program uses board adopted curriculum as well as supplemental materials to support the needs of its students.

Students in our Moderate/Severe Special Day Classes utilize Mobility Opportunities via Education (MOVE) and Unique Learning Systems (ULS) as their curriculum. MOVE is an activity-based curriculum designed to teach basic functional motor skills and meaningful life skills targeting the areas of sitting, standing and walking. ULS is a standards-based curriculum modified to provide access to the core curriculum and meet the academic needs of those students who require extensive supports.

The Foundations Academy actively engages and involves the families of our English learners (ELs) by providing translation and interpreting. We are committed to improving academic outcomes and meeting the needs of the whole child. Our student achievement is a result of a continuous improvement cycle focusing on the education and overall well-being of all our Foundations Academy students.

**Educational Partner Involvement**  
How, when, and with whom did Foundations Academy consult as part of the planning process for this SPSA/Annual Review and Update?

**Involvement Process for the SPSA and Annual Review and Update**  
We used input from our LCAP surveys and parent input from our IEP meetings to inform all of the information within the SPSA. The site principal led a variety of engagement processes that included individual parent engagement and staff survey administration, email engagement for all parents, and IEPs.

**Resource Inequities**  
Briefly identify and describe any resource inequities identified as a result of the required needs assessment, as applicable.

This section is required for all schools eligible for ATSI and CSI.

A primary inequity for the Foundations Academy is permanent and substitute staff. We have had to use staffing agencies to adequately staff our classrooms. This has been extremely challenging this year to fill our paraprofessional vacancies. In addition, we have struggled to hire substitute staff to fill in behind staff absences. The lack of stability in staffing has a direct impact on the achievement of our students.

There is an inequity with Hispanic students, students with chronic health conditions, and students who are considered socio-economically disadvantaged (SED). Our students with chronic health conditions, consistently miss more school than students who do not have similar health conditions. Factors that may contribute to this inequity are that parents of students with chronic health conditions tend to be overly cautious, which may result in parents not sending their students to school to avoid exposure to further illness. In addition, they may have limited access to comprehensive health care, which may increase the frequency of absences and prolong the time out of school.

# Comprehensive Needs Assessment Components

Identify and describe any areas that need significant improvement based on a review of Dashboard and local data, including any areas of low performance and significant performance gaps among student groups on Dashboard indicators, and any steps taken to address those areas.

## California School Dashboard (Dashboard) Indicators

Referring to the California School Dashboard (Dashboard), any state indicator for which overall performance was in the “Red” or “Orange” performance category.

- Orange–ELA & Math  
- Red–Chronic Absenteeism

Referring to the California School Dashboard (Dashboard), any state indicator for which performance for any student group was two or more performance levels below the “all student” performance.

- N/A

## Other Needs

In addition to Dashboard data, other needs may be identified using locally collected data developed by the LEA to measure pupil outcomes.

Students who are SED, Hispanic students and Students with Disabilities (SWD) are all Red.

# CAASPP Results
## English Language Arts/Literacy (All Students)

The Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for ELA and mathematics are an annual measure of what students know and can do using the Common Core State Standards for English language arts/literacy and mathematics.

The purpose of the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments is to assess student knowledge and skills for English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, as well as how much students have improved since the previous year. These measures help identify and address gaps in knowledge or skills early so students get the support they need for success in higher grades and for college and career readiness.

All students in grades three through eight and grade eleven take the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments unless a student’s active individualized education program (IEP) designates the California Alternate Assessments.

Visit the California Department of Education’s Smarter Balanced Assessment System web page for more information.

**Conclusions based on this data:**
1. Students in the Foundations Academy do not take the CAASPP assessment in ELA, but instead take the California Alternate Assessment (CAA).
2. Participation rates for the CAA continue to increase.
3. On the 2022-23 dashboard 30% more students were nearly meeting or met standards.

# School and Student Performance Data
## CAASPP Results
### Mathematics (All Students)

The Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for ELA and mathematics are an annual measure of what students know and can do using the Common Core State Standards for English language arts/literacy and mathematics.

The purpose of the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments is to assess student knowledge and skills for English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, as well as how much students have improved since the previous year. These measures help identify and address gaps in knowledge or skills early so students get the support they need for success in higher grades and for college and career readiness.

All students in grades three through eight and grade eleven take the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments unless a student’s active individualized education program (IEP) designates the California Alternate Assessments.

Visit the California Department of Education’s Smarter Balanced Assessment System web page for more information.

# School and Student Performance Data

The English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) system is used to determine and monitor the progress of the English language proficiency for students whose primary language is not English. The ELPAC is aligned with the 2012 California English Language Development Standards and assesses four domains: listening, speaking, reading, and writing.

Visit the California Department of Education’s English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) web page or the ELPAC.org website for more information about the ELPAC.

# Overall Performance

The 2023 California School Dashboard provides parents and educators with meaningful information on school and district progress so they can participate in decisions to improve student learning.

The California School Dashboard goes beyond test scores alone to provide a more complete picture of how schools and districts are meeting the needs of all students. To help parents and educators identify strengths and areas for improvement, California reports how districts, schools (including alternative schools), and student groups are performing across state and local measures.

Performance on state measures, using comparable statewide data, is represented by one of five colors. The performance level (color) is not included when there are fewer than 30 students in any year. This is represented using a greyed out color dial with the words “No Performance Color.”

## 2023 Fall Dashboard Overall Performance for All Students

# School and Student Performance Data
## Academic Engagement
### Graduation Rate

The 2023 California School Dashboard provides parents and educators with meaningful information on school and district progress so they can participate in decisions to improve student learning.

The California School Dashboard goes beyond test scores alone to provide a more complete picture of how schools and districts are meeting the needs of all students. To help parents and educators identify strengths and areas for improvement, California reports how districts, schools (including alternative schools), and student groups are performing across state and local measures.

Performance on state measures, using comparable statewide data, is represented by one of five colors. The performance level (color) is not included when there are fewer than 30 students in any year. This is represented using a greyed out color dial with the words “No Performance Color.”

| Color | Description          |
|-------|----------------------|
| Red   | Lowest Performance    |
| Orange|                      |
| Yellow|                      |

Describe the overall implementation and effectiveness of the strategies/activities to achieve the articulated goal.  
Chronic Absenteeism increased for all of our sub groups in Foundations Academy.  

Describe any major differences between the intended implementation and/or the budgeted expenditures to implement the strategies/activities to meet the articulated goal.  
The first two strategies were implemented as planned, we were not able to implement the short term independent study option.  

Describe any changes that will be made to this goal, the annual outcomes, metrics, or strategies/activities to achieve this goal as a result of this analysis. Identify where those changes can be found in the SPSA.  
Metric refined to % of student IEP goals being met. Chronic Absenteeism metrics will move to Goal 2--this goal has been changed to align with the LCAP. We added the local assessment and implementation plan as an activity to support progress monitoring, as well as the IEP goal tracker. A professional development plan was added to support teachers in improving their instruction.

![Instructions](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Instructions)

**Instructions**  
The School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) is a strategic plan that maximizes the resources available to the school while minimizing duplication of effort with the ultimate goal of increasing student achievement. SPSA development should be aligned with and inform the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) process.

This SPSA template consolidates all school-level planning efforts into one plan for programs funded through the Consolidated Application (ConApp) pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 64001 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). This template is designed to meet schoolwide program planning requirements.

California’s ESSA State Plan supports the state’s approach to improving student group performance through the utilization of federal resources. Schools use the SPSA to document their approach to maximizing the impact of federal investments in support of underserved students. The implementation of ESSA in California presents an opportunity for schools to innovate with their federally-funded programs and align them with the priority goals of the school and the local educational agency (LEA) that are being realized under the state’s Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF).

The LCFF provides schools and LEAs flexibility to design programs and provide services that meet the needs of students in order to achieve readiness for college, career, and lifelong learning. The SPSA planning process supports continuous cycles of action, reflection, and improvement. Consistent with EC 64001(g)(1), the Schoolsite Council (SSC) is required to develop and annually review the SPSA, establish an annual budget, and make modifications to the plan that reflect changing needs and priorities, as applicable.

![Additional ATSI Planning Requirements](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Additional+ATSI+Planning+Requirements)

**Additional ATSI Planning Requirements:**
When completing this section to meet federal planning requirements for ATSI, improvement goals must also align with the goals, actions, and services in the LEA’s LCAP.

**Goal**
Well-developed goals will clearly communicate to educational partners what the school plans to accomplish, what the school plans to do in order to accomplish the goal, and how the school will know when it has accomplished the goal. A goal should be specific enough to be measurable in either quantitative or qualitative terms. Schools should assess the performance of their student groups when developing goals and the related strategies/activities to achieve such goals. SPSA goals should align to the goals and actions in the LEA’s LCAP.

A goal is a broad statement that describes the desired result to which all strategies/activities are directed. A goal answers the question: What is the school seeking to achieve?

It can be helpful to use a framework for writing goals such the S.M.A.R.T. approach.  
A S.M.A.R.T. goal is:
- Specific,
- Measurable,
- Achievable,
- Realistic, and
- Time-bound.

A level of specificity is needed in order to measure performance relative to the goal as well as to assess whether it is reasonably achievable. Including time constraints, such as milestone dates, ensures a realistic approach that supports student success.  
A school may number the goals using the “Goal #” for ease of reference.

**Additional CSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal CSI planning requirements.

**Additional ATSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal ATSI planning requirements.

**Identified Need**
Describe the basis for establishing the goal. The goal should be based upon an analysis of verifiable state data, including local and state indicator data from the Dashboard and data from the School Accountability Report Card, including local data voluntarily collected by districts to measure pupil achievement.

**Additional CSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal CSI planning requirements.

**Additional ATSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal ATSI planning requirements.

**Annual Measurable Outcomes**
Identify the metric(s) and/or state indicator(s) that the school will use as a means of evaluating progress toward accomplishing the goal. A school may identify metrics for specific student groups. Include in the
<!-- Page 50 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

baseline column the most recent data associated with the metric or indicator available at the time of adoption of the SPSA. The most recent data associated with a metric or indicator includes data reported in the annual update of the SPSA. In the subsequent Expected Outcome column, identify the progress the school intends to make in the coming year.

**Additional CSI Planning Requirements:**  
When completing this section for CSI, the school must include school-level metrics related to the metrics that led to the school’s eligibility for CSI.

## Schoolwide Program Requirements
This School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) template meets the requirements of a schoolwide program plan. The requirements below are for planning reference. A school that operates a schoolwide program and receives funds allocated through the ConApp is required to develop a SPSA. The SPSA, including proposed expenditures of funds allocated to the school through the ConApp, must be reviewed annually and updated by the Schoolsite Council (SSC). The content of a SPSA must be aligned with school goals for improving student achievement.

## Requirements for Development of the Plan
I. The development of the SPSA shall include both of the following actions:
   A. Administration of a comprehensive needs assessment that forms the basis of the school’s goals contained in the SPSA.
      1. The comprehensive needs assessment of the entire school shall:
         a. Include an analysis of verifiable state data, consistent with all state priorities as noted in Sections 52060 and 52066, and informed by all indicators described in Section 1111(c)(4)(B) of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, including pupil performance against state-determined long-term goals. The school may include data voluntarily developed by districts to measure pupil outcomes (described in the Identified Need).
         b. Be based on academic achievement information about all students in the school, including all groups under §200.13(b)(7) and migratory children as defined in section 1309(2) of the ESEA, relative to the State’s academic standards under §200.1 to:
            i. Help the school understand the subjects and skills for which teaching and learning need to be improved.
            ii. Identify the specific academic needs of students and groups of students who are not yet achieving the State’s academic standards.
            iii. Assess the needs of the school relative to each of the components of the schoolwide program under §200.28.
            iv. Develop the comprehensive needs assessment with the participation of individuals who will carry out the schoolwide program plan.
            v. Document how it conducted the needs assessment, the results it obtained, and the conclusions it drew from those results.
   B. Identification of the process for evaluating and monitoring the implementation of the SPSA and progress towards accomplishing the goals set forth in the SPSA (described in the Expected Annual Measurable Outcomes and Annual Review and Update).

## Requirements for the Plan
II. The SPSA shall include the following:
   A. Goals set to improve pupil outcomes, including addressing the needs of student groups as identified through the needs assessment.

Proposed expenditures, based on the projected resource allocation from the governing board or body of the LEA may include funds allocated via the ConApp, federal funds, and any other state or local funds allocated to the school, to address the findings of the needs assessment consistent with the state priorities, including identifying resource inequities, which may include a review of the LEAs budgeting, its LCAP, and school-level budgeting, if applicable (described in Proposed Expenditures and Budget Summary). Employees of the schoolwide program may be deemed funded by a single cost objective.

D. A description of how the school will determine if school needs have been met (described in the Expected Annual Measurable Outcomes and the Annual Review and Update).
   1. Annually evaluate the implementation of, and results achieved by, the schoolwide program, using data from the State’s annual assessments and other indicators of academic achievement;
   2. Determine whether the schoolwide program has been effective in increasing the achievement of students in meeting the State's academic standards, particularly for those students who had been furthest from achieving the standards; and
   3. Revise the plan, as necessary, based on the results of the evaluation, to ensure continuous improvement of students in the schoolwide program.

**Appendix B: Plan Requirements for School to CSI/ATSI Planning Requirements**  
For questions or technical assistance related to meeting federal school improvement planning requirements, please contact the CDE’s School Improvement and Support Office at SISO@cde.ca.gov.

**Comprehensive Support and Improvement**  
The LEA shall partner with educational partners (including principals and other school leaders, teachers, and parents) to locally develop and implement the CSI plan for the school to improve student outcomes, and specifically address the metrics that led to eligibility for CSI (Educational Partner Involvement).

The CSI plan shall:

1. Be informed by all state indicators, including student performance against state-determined long-term goals (Sections: Goal, Identified Need, Expected Annual Measurable Outcomes, Annual Review and Update, as applicable);

2. Include evidence-based interventions (Sections: Strategies/Activities, Annual Review and Update, as applicable) (For resources related to evidence-based interventions, see the U.S. Department of Education’s “Using Evidence to Strengthen Education Investments” at https://www2.ed.gov/fund/grant/about/discretionary/2023-non-regulatory-guidance-evidence.pdf);

   Non-Regulatory Guidance: Using Evidence to Strengthen Education Investments

3. Be based on a school-level needs assessment (Sections: Goal, Identified Need, Expected Annual Measurable Outcomes, Annual Review and Update, as applicable); and

4. Identify resource inequities, which may include a review of LEA- and school-level budgeting, to be addressed through implementation of the CSI plan (Sections: Goal, Identified Need, Expected Annual Measurable Outcomes, Planned Strategies/Activities; and Annual Review and Update, as applicable).

**Single School Districts and Charter Schools Eligible for ESSA School Improvement**  
Single school districts (SSDs) or charter schools that are eligible for CSI, TSI, or ATSI, shall develop a SPSA that addresses the applicable requirements above as a condition of receiving funds (EC Section 64001[a] as amended by Assembly Bill 716, effective January 1, 2019).

However, a SSD or a charter school may streamline the process by combining state and federal requirements into one document which may include the LCAP and all federal planning requirements, provided that the combined plan is able to demonstrate that the legal requirements for each of the plans is met (EC Section 52062[a] as amended by AB 716, effective January 1, 2019).

Planning requirements for single school districts and charter schools choosing to exercise this option are available in the LCAP Instructions.
