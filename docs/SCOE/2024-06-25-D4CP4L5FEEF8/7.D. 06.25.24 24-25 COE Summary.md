Local Context (Optional)

The Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE) is one of 58 county offices of education in California and serves 13 school districts: Aroche (K-8, 501 students); Center (K-12, 4,439 students); Elk Grove (K-12, 62,317); Elverta (K-8, 223 students); Folsom Cordova (K-12, 20,828); Galt Elementary (K-8, 3,382 students); Galt High (9-12, 1,978 students); Natomas (K-12, 11,208 students); River Delta (K-12, 1,753 students); Robla (K-6, 1,919 students); Sacramento City (K-12, 36,762 students); San Juan (K-12, 38,211 students); and Twin Rivers (K-12, 22,102 students). Additionally, our county has 52 charter schools serving 46,776 students. In total, there are over 250,000 students in Sacramento County and LEAs are both rural and urban. The demographic makeup of our county consists primarily of Hispanic/Latino (32.2%) and White (26.7%) students with also some Asian (17.9%) and African American (9.9%). Additionally there are 9,365 homeless students and 797 foster youth. English learners comprise 17.9% of the students and 13.6% have some sort of disability.

In the 2023-24 school year, systems across the region continue to grapple with staffing shortages, increased behavior issues, even in early grades, and student absences. In fact, 7 of our 13 school districts were eligible for Differentiated Assistance (DA) this year, with academics and suspensions as the primary drivers for this status. Charter Schools were also eligible for DA for the first time this year, with 15 of the 52 Charters identified. We continue to see that Students with Disabilities, Foster/Homeless and English Learners are the most common areas where LEAs need support. The post-pandemic disruption and stress on educators is unprecedented, yet the commitment to students and to the profession is unwavering. We have witnessed tenacity and a community spirit that hasn’t been seen before where teachers and leaders are making incredible strides to ensure that schools attend to students’ social-emotional learning, offer supports for mental health and wellness, and create conditions for accelerated learning. SCOE is committed to identifying, promoting, and collaborating with experts to provide educational solutions focused on improving opportunities and access in service of high academic achievement for all students to our schools and districts. Utilizing strategies from improvement science, implementation science, and compassionate systems awareness, our support of districts and schools to close achievement and opportunity gaps, advance equity, and support the social-emotional needs of students and staff in Sacramento County will continue to be of utmost importance in 2024-25.

The following plan to support districts in implementing Local Control Accountability Plans (LCAPs) and to strive for continuous improvement adheres to the provisions/requirements of California Education Code (EC) 52066.

**Actions the school district(s) will take independent of the COE**  
Please provide a description of the actions the school district(s) will take independent of the COE to improve student outcomes.  

SCOE will guide and coach the district/charter through the continuous improvement process and identify resources to support them in identified areas of need. The LEA will have additional responsibilities: gather, organize and display data related to their area(s) of focus; gather feedback from educational partners on root causes; gather input and prioritize change ideas; integrate change ideas into a coherent system that aligns to LEA priorities; monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of their change ideas; and integrate actions and funding into their LCAP and/or SPSAs.

**For COEs who have Local Educational Agencies meet the eligibility criteria under Ed Code 52072(a) [“Direct Technical Assistance” (DTA) supports]**

**OPTIONAL: Prompt for COEs with districts who meet criteria:** For districts who meet eligibility criteria under Ed Code 52072 (a), describe how the COE is prioritizing and adjusting their support and continuous improvement actions in the areas of intensity and frequency:  
- When a district fails to improve student achievement across more than one state priority for three or more student groups for three out of four consecutive years or more.

| Prompt | Narrative |
|--------|-----------|
| Optional Prompt for COEs with districts who meet criteria [EC Section 52072 (f)] | SCOE collaborates with CCEE and other technical assistance providers quarterly to ensure aligned and strategic support is provided. Support varies by need but is also targeted to areas identified for DTA. Varied support examples include coaching for increased usage of data, improved instructional focus in literacy development, LCAP technical assistance and improved systems and procedures for supporting students with disabilities. |
