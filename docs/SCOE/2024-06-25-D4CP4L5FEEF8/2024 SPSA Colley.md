# School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA)

**School Year:** 2024-25

| School Name                          | County-District-School (CDS) Code | Schoolsite Council (SSC) Approval Date | Local Board Approval Date |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Nathaniel S. Colley Senior High School | 34-10348-0118745                  | May 30, 2024                          | June 25, 2024             |

The School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) is a strategic plan that maximizes the resources available to the school while minimizing duplication of effort with the ultimate goal of increasing student achievement. SPSA development should be aligned with and inform the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) process.

This SPSA template consolidates all school-level planning efforts into one plan for programs funded through the Consolidated Application (ConApp), and for federal Additional Targeted Support and Improvement (ATSI), pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 64001 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). This template is designed to meet schoolwide program planning requirements for both the SPSA and federal ATSI planning requirements.

California’s ESSA State Plan supports the state’s approach to improving student group performance through the utilization of federal resources. Schools use the SPSA to document their approach to maximizing the impact of federal investments in support of underserved students. The implementation of ESSA in California presents an opportunity for schools to innovate with their federally-funded programs and align them with the priority goals of the school and the local educational agency (LEA) that are being realized under the state’s Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF).

The LCFF provides schools and LEAs flexibility to design programs and provide services that meet the needs of students in order to achieve readiness for college, career, and lifelong learning. The SPSA planning process supports continuous cycles of action, reflection, and improvement. Consistent with EC 64001(g)(1), the Schoolsite Council (SSC) is required to develop and annually review the SPSA, establish an annual budget, and make modifications to the plan that reflect changing needs and priorities, as applicable.

This plan is being used by Nathaniel S. Colley Senior High School for meeting the following ESSA planning requirements in alignment with the LCAP and other federal, state, and local programs:

- Schoolwide Program
- Comprehensive Support and Improvement

This template is based on the December, 2023 CDE revision of the School Plan for Student Achievement. Some modifications have been made to inform the SPSA development process.

**Plan Description**  
Briefly describe your school’s plan for effectively meeting ESSA’s planning requirements in alignment with the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) and other federal, state, and local programs.

This plan is being used by Nathaniel S. Colley Senior High School for meeting the following ESSA planning requirements in alignment with the LCAP and other federal, state, and local programs:

- Schoolwide Program
- Comprehensive Support and Improvement

Consistent with the SOCE LCAP, Nathaniel S. Colley Sr. High School serves students who need supports not commonly found within traditional middle or high schools. Nathaniel S. Colley Sr. High School is directly responsible for serving expelled youth. Within the school there are two programs: the base program serves students who are in 7th-12th grades. Students are primarily served through a daily in-class program. The Senior Extension Program focuses on students who are in 12th grade and need additional time to graduate. We also provide a high-quality alternative education to students and families seeking a smaller school environment through a parent request process.

Our students are predominantly low income and often have needs that extend beyond routine school services. We serve Foster Youth (FY), students who are experiencing homelessness, or who are in temporary housing, and those who have experienced a high level of trauma. We actively engage and involve the families of our English learners (ELs) by providing translation, interpreting, and provide an EL parent liaison as needed. An ELD/ELS Program specialist has been hired to improve services provided to English learners. In general, our students have a high rate of school mobility across all student subgroups.

We are committed to improving academic outcomes and meeting the needs of the whole child. We utilize multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS), intensive intervention in English Language Arts (ELA) and mathematics, project based learning, and a focus on 21st Century skills so students will be successful in their post-secondary education, technical training, or employment. Our achievement is a result of a continuous improvement cycle focusing on the education and wellness programs in our school.

**Educational Partner Involvement**  
How, when, and with whom did Nathaniel S. Colley Senior High School consult as part of the planning process for this SPSA/Annual Review and Update?

**Involvement Process for the SPSA and Annual Review and Update**  
Stakeholder engagement processes include the School Site Council with the development of the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) and review of the LCAP goals. The site principal led a variety of engagement processes, individual parent engagement and survey administration, parent and student engagement following student exhibitions, email engagement for all parents, and IEP and SST meetings.

Stakeholders were involved throughout the year through parent, student and staff meetings, non-profit partners, ongoing surveys distributed to certificated and classified staff, students, parents, and all relevant stakeholders. This engagement process included site safety planning, school site council, and weekly staff meetings.

---

**Resource Inequities**  
Briefly identify and describe any resource inequities identified as a result of the required needs assessment, as applicable.

This section is required for all schools eligible for ATSI and CSI.

We have compared distributions of funds to our three community schools within SOCE to ensure equitable allocation of funds including federal, state, and local sources to our schools with the highest concentration of low income students.

We ensure equitable access to quality instruction and educational equity for all students. We also ensure that effective, credentialed and experienced teachers are teaching our low income students and students of color.

We ensure equitable access to rigorous course offerings by providing access to advanced education opportunities and UC a-g coursework. In addition we ensure our students have access to writing workshops.

Our students have experienced struggles accessing their education at comprehensive high schools. Many of our students have experienced trauma or unstable home environments.

It has been difficult to staff CTE positions and fill substitute teacher positions. Many of our students and families struggle with reliable transportation. Students have a low stability rate.

# Comprehensive Needs Assessment Components

Identify and describe any areas that need significant improvement based on a review of Dashboard and local data, including any areas of low performance and significant performance gaps among student groups on Dashboard indicators, and any steps taken to address those areas.

## California School Dashboard (Dashboard) Indicators

Referring to the California School Dashboard (Dashboard), any state indicator for which overall performance was in the “Red” or “Orange” performance category.

- English
- Mathematics
- Graduation Rate

Referring to the California School Dashboard (Dashboard), any state indicator for which performance for any student group was two or more performance levels below the “all student” performance.

- NA

## Other Needs

In addition to Dashboard data, other needs may be identified using locally collected data developed by the LEA to measure pupil outcomes.

- Attendance
- Credit recovery
- Family Community engagement
- Literacy
- Social/Emotional learning
- Transition Services
- DEI

### English Language Arts/Literacy (All Students)

The Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for ELA and mathematics are an annual measure of what students know and can do using the Common Core State Standards for English language arts/literacy and mathematics.

The purpose of the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments is to assess student knowledge and skills for English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, as well as how much students have improved since the previous year. These measures help identify and address gaps in knowledge or skills early so students get the support they need for success in higher grades and for college and career readiness.

All students in grades three through eight and grade eleven take the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments unless a student’s active individualized education program (IEP) designates the California Alternate Assessments.

Visit the California Department of Education’s Smarter Balanced Assessment System web page for more information.

**Conclusions based on this data:**
1. To address the high number of students testing below standards in ELA, staff will continue to participate in ongoing PD focusing on research-based instructional strategies in ELA and will continue to provide intensive intervention to all students performing below grade level.
2. SCOE sites utilize Ren Learn ELA, Ren Learn pre and post assessments, Achieve 3000, and Springboard and intervention materials to support students testing below grade level in reading. These are all evidence-based ELA programs designed to increase literacy rates.
3. We have increased our participation but there is a need to increase CAASPP participation among our independent study students.

These measures help identify and address gaps in knowledge or skills early so students get the support they need for success in higher grades and for college and career readiness.

All students in grades three through eight and grade eleven take the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments unless a student’s active individualized education program (IEP) designates the California Alternate Assessments.

Visit the California Department of Education’s Smarter Balanced Assessment System web page for more information.

## Conclusions based on this data:
1. To address the high number of students testing below standard in math, staff will continue to participate in an ongoing PD focusing on research-based instructional strategies in math and will continue to provide intensive intervention to all students performing below grade level.
2. SCOE utilizes SBE adopted curriculum from Pearson Integrated Math I, II, III, and McGraw Hill California Math in all CCS programs.
3. We have increased the participation rate but there is a need to increase CAASPP participation among our independent study students.

# School and Student Performance Data

The English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) system is used to determine and monitor the progress of the English language proficiency for students whose primary language is not English. The ELPAC is aligned with the 2012 California English Language Development Standards and assesses four domains: listening, speaking, reading, and writing.

Visit the California Department of Education’s English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) web page or the ELPAC.org website for more information about the ELPAC.

# School and Student Performance Data

## Overall Performance

The 2023 California School Dashboard provides parents and educators with meaningful information on school and district progress so they can participate in decisions to improve student learning.

The California School Dashboard goes beyond test scores alone to provide a more complete picture of how schools and districts are meeting the needs of all students. To help parents and educators identify strengths and areas for improvement, California reports how districts, schools (including alternative schools), and student groups are performing across state and local measures.

Performance on state measures, using comparable statewide data, is represented by one of five colors. The performance level (color) is not included when there are fewer than 30 students in any year. This is represented using a greyed out color dial with the words “No Performance Color.”

### Chronic Absenteeism

The 2023 California School Dashboard provides parents and educators with meaningful information on school and district progress so they can participate in decisions to improve student learning.

The California School Dashboard goes beyond test scores alone to provide a more complete picture of how schools and districts are meeting the needs of all students. To help parents and educators identify strengths and areas for improvement, California reports how districts, schools (including alternative schools), and student groups are performing across state and local measures.

Performance on state measures, using comparable statewide data, is represented by one of five colors. The performance level (color) is not included when there are fewer than 30 students in any year. This is represented using a greyed out color dial with the words “No Performance Color.”

| Color | Description          |
|-------|----------------------|
| Red   | Lowest Performance    |
| Orange|                      |
| Yellow|                      |

![Goals, Strategies, & Proposed Expenditures](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Goals,+Strategies,+%26+Proposed+Expenditures)

**Goal 1**

**Title and Description of School Goal**  
Broad statement that describes the desired result to which all strategies/activities are directed.  
**Achievement**  
Through improved instructional systems, this goal aims to increase student achievement in literacy and math, expand student completion of courses, and develop college and career readiness.

**LCAP Goal to which this School Goal is Aligned**  
LCAP goal to which this school goal is aligned.  
**Achievement**

**Identified Need**  
A description of any areas that need significant improvement based on a review of Dashboard and local data, including any areas of low performance and significant performance gaps among student groups on Dashboard indicators, and any steps taken to address those areas.  
Nathaniel S. Colley Senior High School serves students with the highest needs in Sacramento County. Post-secondary success, academic achievement, and progress for English learners are areas in need of improvement. In developing the goal for Achievement, we identified a need for SCOE’s students to improve their academic outcomes in both Literacy, math and to become more aware of post-secondary options for education or employment. Students need a clear pathway to finish their high school education and successfully transition to post-secondary training and employment/career. Every student will need a Student Success Plan that will be developed collaboratively with staff, students, and parents/guardians so that the roadmap for each student’s progress is clear. Students need engaging experiences that expose them to post-secondary opportunities. The graduation rate remains well below the state average.

**Annual Measurable Outcomes**  
Identify the metric(s) and/or state indicator(s) that your school will use as a means of evaluating progress toward accomplishing the goal.  

| Metric/Indicator | Baseline/Actual Outcome | Expected Outcome |
|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Percent of students demonstrating progress in reading skills on local assessment (enrolled 30 days or more) | 22/23 Base New Metric 22/23 Senior Extension New Metric | Increase by 5% |
| Percent of students earning at least 10 credits per 30 days enrolled | 22/23 EOY 12.5% - Base Community School 22/23 EOY 35.1%- Senior Extension | 17.5% - Community School 40.1% - Senior Extension |
| Percent of students demonstrating progress in math skills on local assessment (enrolled 30 days or more) | 22/23 Base New Metric 22/23 Senior Extension New Metric | Increase by 5% |
| Percent of ELs who complete the summative ELPAC (Regular or Alt) |  | Increase by 5% |

**Analysis**

Describe the overall implementation and effectiveness of the strategies/activities to achieve the articulated goal.

Overall the strategies used were effective. The MHWC has been integral in the students improved mental health and increased pro-social behaviors, leading to less suspensions in the Community Schools. There is still a need to address suspension rates in the CARE programs. School staff has used the professional development provided to increase the level of trauma informed practices and strategies being used with students. All students have a SSP and upon enrollment graduation options are discussed. There is also a resource that has been created to so students and families have continued access to options leading to graduation. There are identified staff onsite to work specifically with foster youth and unhoused students. Phone calls and incentives were used to acknowledge student attendance. There regular review of rehabilitation plans and revised process with district partners increased the timely transition of students back to district programs.

There is still a need to provide more training and increase staff knowledge around the LGBTQ+ community, so students are supported in the best way possible. While the SSP is used with each student, there continues to be a need to retrain all staff in the usage of the document so that data is collected accurately. Additionally, there is a need to find a way to better monitor data entry in the SSP. While some district level staff worked more with the SIS department, this was limited for the school site team. There is also a need to provide a quarterly report to monitor student suspensions so disproportionality can be addressed as well make real time adjustments to support students and staff.

Describe any changes that will be made to this goal, the annual outcomes, metrics, or strategies/activities to achieve this goal as a result of this analysis. Identify where those changes can be found in the SPSA.  
Goals will change to align with the new LCAP. School leadership SIS discussions was removed and will be modified and added to goal 3. Action 2.1 has modified to include CBO's support and mentoring of students. Graduation rate metric moved to goal 4. Dropout rate by program added to the metrics. New metric add on student engagement and parent satisfaction. Adding a staff connectiveness metric.

![Instructions](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Instructions)

**Instructions**  
The School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) is a strategic plan that maximizes the resources available to the school while minimizing duplication of effort with the ultimate goal of increasing student achievement. SPSA development should be aligned with and inform the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) process.

This SPSA template consolidates all school-level planning efforts into one plan for programs funded through the Consolidated Application (ConApp) pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 64001 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). This template is designed to meet schoolwide program planning requirements.

California’s ESSA State Plan supports the state’s approach to improving student group performance through the utilization of federal resources. Schools use the SPSA to document their approach to maximizing the impact of federal investments in support of underserved students. The implementation of ESSA in California presents an opportunity for schools to innovate with their federally-funded programs and align them with the priority goals of the school and the local educational agency (LEA) that are being realized under the state’s Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF).

The LCFF provides schools and LEAs flexibility to design programs and provide services that meet the needs of students in order to achieve readiness for college, career, and lifelong learning. The SPSA planning process supports continuous cycles of action, reflection, and improvement. Consistent with EC 64001(g)(1), the Schoolsite Council (SSC) is required to develop and annually review the SPSA, establish an annual budget, and make modifications to the plan that reflect changing needs and priorities, as applicable.

![Additional ATSI Planning Requirements](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Additional+ATSI+Planning+Requirements)

**Additional ATSI Planning Requirements:**
When completing this section to meet federal planning requirements for ATSI, improvement goals must also align with the goals, actions, and services in the LEA’s LCAP.

**Goal**
Well-developed goals will clearly communicate to educational partners what the school plans to accomplish, what the school plans to do in order to accomplish the goal, and how the school will know when it has accomplished the goal. A goal should be specific enough to be measurable in either quantitative or qualitative terms. Schools should assess the performance of their student groups when developing goals and the related strategies/activities to achieve such goals. SPSA goals should align to the goals and actions in the LEA’s LCAP.

A goal is a broad statement that describes the desired result to which all strategies/activities are directed. A goal answers the question: What is the school seeking to achieve?

It can be helpful to frame a framework for writing goals such the S.M.A.R.T. approach.  
A S.M.A.R.T. goal is:
- Specific,
- Measurable,
- Achievable,
- Realistic, and
- Time-bound.

A level of specificity is needed in order to measure performance relative to the goal as well as to assess whether it is reasonably achievable. Including time constraints, such as milestone dates, ensures a realistic approach that supports student success.  
A school may number the goals using the “Goal #” for ease of reference.

**Additional CSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal CSI planning requirements.

**Additional ATSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal ATSI planning requirements.

**Identified Need**
Describe the basis for establishing the goal. The goal should be based upon an analysis of verifiable state data, including local and state indicator data from the Dashboard and data from the School Accountability Report Card, including local data voluntarily collected by districts to measure pupil achievement.

**Additional CSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal CSI planning requirements.

**Additional ATSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal ATSI planning requirements.

**Annual Measurable Outcomes**

A school that operates a schoolwide program and receives funds allocated through the ConApp is required to develop a SPSA. The SPSA, including proposed expenditures of funds allocated to the school through the ConApp, must be reviewed annually and updated by the Schoolsite Council (SSC). The content of a SPSA must be aligned with school goals for improving student achievement.

## Requirements for Development of the Plan
I. The development of the SPSA shall include both of the following actions:
   A. Administration of a comprehensive needs assessment that forms the basis of the school’s goals contained in the SPSA.
      1. The comprehensive needs assessment of the entire school shall:
         a. Include an analysis of verifiable state data, consistent with all state priorities as noted in Sections 52060 and 52066, and informed by all indicators described in Section 1111(c)(4)(B) of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, including pupil performance against state-determined long-term goals. The school may include data voluntarily developed by districts to measure pupil outcomes (described in the Identified Need).
         b. Be based on academic achievement information about all students in the school, including all groups under §200.13(b)(7) and migratory children as defined in section 1309(2) of the ESEA, relative to the State’s academic standards under §200.1 to:
            i. Help the school understand the subjects and skills for which teaching and learning need to be improved.
            ii. Identify the specific academic needs of students and groups of students who are not yet achieving the State’s academic standards.
            iii. Assess the needs of the school relative to each of the components of the schoolwide program under §200.28.
            iv. Develop the comprehensive needs assessment with the participation of individuals who will carry out the schoolwide program plan.
            v. Document how it conducted the needs assessment, the results it obtained, and the conclusions it drew from those results.
   B. Identification of the process for evaluating and monitoring the implementation of the SPSA and progress towards accomplishing the goals set forth in the SPSA (described in the Expected Annual Measurable Outcomes and Annual Review and Update).

## Requirements for the Plan

**Appendix B: Plan Requirements for School to CSI/ATSI Planning Requirements**  
For questions or technical assistance related to meeting federal school improvement planning requirements, please contact the CDE’s School Improvement and Support Office at SISO@cde.ca.gov.

**Comprehensive Support and Improvement**  
The LEA shall partner with educational partners (including principals and other school leaders, teachers, and parents) to locally develop and implement the CSI plan for the school to improve student outcomes, and specifically address the metrics that led to eligibility for CSI (Educational Partner Involvement).

The CSI plan shall:

1. Be informed by all state indicators, including student performance against state-determined long-term goals (Sections: Goal, Identified Need, Expected Annual Measurable Outcomes, Annual Review and Update, as applicable);

2. Include evidence-based interventions (Sections: Strategies/Activities, Annual Review and Update, as applicable) (For resources related to evidence-based interventions, see the U.S. Department of Education’s “Using Evidence to Strengthen Education Investments” at https://www2.ed.gov/fund/grant/about/discretionary/2023-non-regulatory-guidance-evidence.pdf);

   Non-Regulatory Guidance: Using Evidence to Strengthen Education Investments

3. Be based on a school-level needs assessment (Sections: Goal, Identified Need, Expected Annual Measurable Outcomes, Annual Review and Update, as applicable); and

4. Identify resource inequities, which may include a review of LEA- and school-level budgeting, to be addressed through implementation of the CSI plan (Sections: Goal, Identified Need, Expected Annual Measurable Outcomes, Planned Strategies/Activities; and Annual Review and Update, as applicable).

**Authority Cited:** Sections 1003(e)(1)(A), 1003(i), 1111(c)(4)(B), and 1111(d)(1) of the ESSA.

**Single School Districts and Charter Schools Eligible for ESSA School Improvement**  
Single school districts (SSDs) or charter schools that are eligible for CSI, TSI, or ATSI, shall develop a SPSA that addresses the applicable requirements above as a condition of receiving funds (EC Section 64001[a] as amended by Assembly Bill 716, effective January 1, 2019).

However, a SSD or a charter school may streamline the process by combining state and federal requirements into one document which may include the LCAP and all federal planning requirements, provided that the combined plan is able to demonstrate that the legal requirements for each of the plans is met (EC Section 52062[a] as amended by AB 716, effective January 1, 2019).

Planning requirements for single school districts and charter schools choosing to exercise this option are available in the LCAP Instructions.
