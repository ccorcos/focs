| Elinor Lincoln Hickey Jr./Sr. High School | 34-10348-0106237                 | May 30, 2024                          | June 25, 2024            |

The School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) is a strategic plan that maximizes the resources available to the school while minimizing duplication of effort with the ultimate goal of increasing student achievement. SPSA development should be aligned with and inform the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) process.

This SPSA template consolidates all school-level planning efforts into one plan for programs funded through the Consolidated Application (ConApp), and for federal Additional Targeted Support and Improvement (ATSI), pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 64001 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). This template is designed to meet schoolwide program planning requirements for both the SPSA and federal ATSI planning requirements.

California’s ESSA State Plan supports the state’s approach to improving student group performance through the utilization of federal resources. Schools use the SPSA to document their approach to maximizing the impact of federal investments in support of underserved students. The implementation of ESSA in California presents an opportunity for schools to innovate with their federally-funded programs and align them with the priority goals of the school and the local educational agency (LEA) that are being realized under the state’s Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF).

The LCFF provides schools and LEAs flexibility to design programs and provide services that meet the needs of students in order to achieve readiness for college, career, and lifelong learning. The SPSA planning process supports continuous cycles of action, reflection, and improvement. Consistent with EC 64001(g)(1), the Schoolsite Council (SSC) is required to develop and annually review the SPSA, establish an annual budget, and make modifications to the plan that reflect changing needs and priorities, as applicable.

This plan is being used by Elinor Lincoln Hickey Jr./Sr. High School for meeting the following ESSA planning requirements in alignment with the LCAP and other federal, state, and local programs:

- Schoolwide Program
- Comprehensive Support and Improvement

This template is based on the December, 2023 CDE revision of the School Plan for Student Achievement. Some modifications have been made to inform the SPSA development process.

**Plan Description**  
Briefly describe your school’s plan for effectively meeting ESSA’s planning requirements in alignment with the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) and other federal, state, and local programs.  

This plan is being used by Elinor Lincoln Hickey Jr./Sr. High School for meeting the following ESSA planning requirements in alignment with the LCAP and other federal, state, and local programs:  

- Schoolwide Program  
- Comprehensive Support and Improvement  

Consistent with the SOCE LCAP, Elinor Lincoln Hickey Jr./Sr. High School serves students who need supports not commonly found within traditional middle or high schools. Elinor Lincoln Hickey Jr./Sr. High School is directly responsible for serving expelled youth. Within Elinor Lincoln Hickey Jr./Sr. High school there are two programs. The base program serves students who are in 7th-12th grades. Students are primarily served through a daily in-class program. The Senior Extension Program focuses on students who are in 12th grade and need additional time to graduate. We also provide a high-quality alternative education to students and families seeking a smaller school environment through a parent request process.  

Our students are predominantly low income and often have needs that extend beyond routine school services. We serve Foster Youth (FY), students who are experiencing homelessness, or who are in temporary housing, and those who have experienced a high level of trauma. We actively engage and involve the families of our English learners (ELs) by providing translation, interpreting, and provide an EL parent liaison as needed. An EL/ELS Program Specialist has been hired to improve EL services. In general, our students have a high rate of school mobility across all student subgroups.  

We are committed to improving academic outcomes and meeting the needs of the whole child. We utilize multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS), intensive intervention in English Language Arts (ELA) and mathematics, project based learning, and a focus on 21st Century skills so students will be successful in their post-secondary education, technical training, or employment. Our commitment is a result of a continuous improvement cycle focusing on the education and wellness programs in our school.

**Educational Partner Involvement**  
How, when, and with whom did Elinor Lincoln Hickey Jr./Sr. High consult as part of the planning process for this SPSA/Annual Review and Update?  

**Involvement Process for the SPSA and Annual Review and Update**  
Stakeholder engagement processes includes School Site Council with the annual development of the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) and review of the LCAP goals. The site principal led a variety of engagement processes, individual parent engagement and survey administration, parent and student engagement following student exhibitions, email engagement for all parents, and IEP and SST meetings.  

Stakeholders were involved throughout the year through parent, student and staff meetings, non-profit partners, ongoing surveys distributed to certificated and classified staff, students, parents, and all relevant stakeholders. This engagement process included site safety planning, school site council, and weekly staff meetings.  

---

**Resource Inequities**  
Briefly identify and describe any resource inequities identified as a result of the required needs assessment, as applicable.  
This section is required for all schools eligible for ATSI and CSI.  

We have compared distributions of funds to our three community schools within SOCE to ensure equitable allocation of funds including federal, state, and local sources to our schools with the highest concentration of low income students.  

We ensure equitable access to quality instruction and educational equity for all students. We also ensure that effective, credentialed and experienced teachers are teaching our low income students, and students of color.

# School and Student Performance Data
## CAASPP Results
### English Language Arts/Literacy (All Students)

The Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for ELA and mathematics are an annual measure of what students know and can do using the Common Core State Standards for English language arts/literacy and mathematics.

The purpose of the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments is to assess student knowledge and skills for English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, as well as how much students have improved since the previous year. These measures help identify and address gaps in knowledge or skills early so students get the support they need for success in higher grades and for college and career readiness.

All students in grades three through eight and grade eleven take the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments unless a student’s active individualized education program (IEP) designates the California Alternate Assessments.

Visit the California Department of Education’s Smarter Balanced Assessment System web page for more information.

**Conclusions based on this data:**
1. To address the high number of students testing below standards in ELA, staff will continue to participate in ongoing PD focusing on research-based instructional strategies in ELA and will continue to provide intensive intervention to all students performing below grade level.
2. SCOE sites utilize Ren Learn ELA, Ren Learn pre and post assessments, and Springboard, and intervention materials (Achieve 3000) to support students testing below grade level in reading. These are all evidence-based ELA programs designed to increase literacy rates.
3. Participation in CAASPP by independent study students has increased, but remains an area of focus.

# School and Student Performance Data  
## CAASPP Results  
### Mathematics (All Students)  

The Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for ELA and mathematics are an annual measure of what students know and can do using the Common Core State Standards for English language arts/literacy and mathematics.

The purpose of the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments is to assess student knowledge and skills for English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, as well as how much students have improved since the previous year. These measures help identify and address gaps in knowledge or skills early so students get the support they need for success in higher grades and for college and career readiness.

All students in grades three through eight and grade eleven take the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments unless a student’s active individualized education program (IEP) designates the California Alternate Assessments.

Visit the California Department of Education’s Smarter Balanced Assessment System web page for more information.

**Conclusions based on this data:**

1. To address the high number of students testing below standard in math, staff will continue to participate in ongoing PD focusing on research-based instructional strategies in math and will continue to provide intensive intervention to all students performing below grade level.
2. SCOPE utilizes SBE adopted curriculum from Pearson Integrated Math I, II, III, and McGraw Hill California Math in all CCS programs.
3. Participation rate of independent student study students increased; however, this is still a need to focus on this area.

# School and Student Performance Data

The English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) system is used to determine and monitor the progress of the English language proficiency for students whose primary language is not English. The ELPAC is aligned with the 2012 California English Language Development Standards and assesses four domains: listening, speaking, reading, and writing.

Visit the California Department of Education’s [English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC)](https://elpac.org) web page or the ELPAC.org website for more information about the ELPAC.

# School and Student Performance Data
## California School Dashboard
### Student Population

The 2023 California School Dashboard provides parents and educators with meaningful information on school and district progress so they can participate in decisions to improve student learning.

The California School Dashboard goes beyond test scores alone to provide a more complete picture of how schools and districts are meeting the needs of all students. To help parents and educators identify strengths and areas for improvement, California reports how districts, schools (including alternative schools), and student groups are performing across state and local measures.

This section provides information about the school’s student population.

### 2022-23 Student Population

| Total Enrollment | Socioeconomically Disadvantaged | English Learners | Foster Youth |

# School and Student Performance Data
## Overall Performance

The 2023 California School Dashboard provides parents and educators with meaningful information on school and district progress so they can participate in decisions to improve student learning.

The California School Dashboard goes beyond test scores alone to provide a more complete picture of how schools and districts are meeting the needs of all students. To help parents and educators identify strengths and areas for improvement, California reports how districts, schools (including alternative schools), and student groups are performing across state and local measures.

Performance on state measures, using comparable statewide data, is represented by one of five colors. The performance level (color) is not included when there are fewer than 30 students in any year. This is represented using a greyed out color dial with the words “No Performance Color.”

### 2023 Fall Dashboard Overall Performance for All Students

| Academic Performance         | Academic Engagement         | Conditions & Climate        |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| English Language Arts        | Orange                      | Graduation Rate              | Red                          |
| Mathematics                  | Red                         | Chronic Absenteeism          | Yellow                       |
| College/Career               | Very Low                    | Suspension Rate              | Red                          |

## Conclusions based on this data:
1. Need to identify sources of suspensions, including CARE versus community school students as well as increase mental health supports for students as well as professional development for staff.
2. Need to review and refine the process for the collection of college and career indicators.
3. The change in California's calculation for DASS schools has resulted in a lower graduation rate.

To help parents and educators identify strengths and areas for improvement, California reports how districts, schools (including alternative schools), and student groups are performing across state and local measures.

Performance on state measures, using comparable statewide data, is represented by one of five colors. The performance level (color) is not included when there are fewer than 30 students in any year. This is represented using a greyed out color dial with the words “No Performance Color.”

This section provides a view of the percentage of current EL students making progress towards English language proficiency or maintaining the highest level.

### 2023 Fall Dashboard English Learner Progress Indicator

| English Learner Progress |
|--------------------------|
| 33.3% making progress towards English language proficiency |
| Number of EL Students: 39 Students |
| Performance Level: 1 |

This section provides a view of the percentage of current EL students who progressed at least one ELPI level, maintained ELPI level 4, maintained lower ELPI levels (i.e., levels 1, 2L, 2H, 3L, or 3H), or decreased at least one ELPI level.

# Goals, Strategies, & Proposed Expenditures
Complete a copy of the following table for each of the school’s goals. Duplicate the table as needed.

## Goal 1
### Title and Description of School Goal
Broad statement that describes the desired result to which all strategies/activities are directed.
- **Achievement**  
  Through improved instructional systems, this goal aims to increase student achievement in literacy and math, expand student completion of courses, and develop college and career readiness.

### LCAP Goal to which this School Goal is Aligned
- **Achievement**  
  LCAP goal to which this school goal is aligned.

### Identified Need
A description of any areas that need significant improvement based on a review of Dashboard and local data, including any areas of low performance and significant performance gaps among student groups on Dashboard indicators, and any steps taken to address those areas.
- Elinor Lincoln Hickey Jr./Sr. High School serves students with the highest needs in Sacramento County. Most of the students enrolled need to improve their ELA and math performance, as well as increase their ability to become college and career ready. The majority of our students are arriving in our school significantly credit deficient and that impacts are graduation rates. There is also a need to address students SEL needs and teaching strategies to reduce the suspension rate.

### Annual Measurable Outcomes
Identify the metric(s) and/or state indicator(s) that your school will use as a means of evaluating progress toward accomplishing the goal.

Describe the overall implementation and effectiveness of the strategies/activities to achieve the articulated goal.  
Overall the strategies used were effective. The MHWK is integral in the students improved mental health and increased pro-social behaviors, leading to less suspensions in the Community Schools. There is still a need to address suspension rates in the CARE programs. School staff has used the professional development provided to increase the level of trauma informed practices and strategies being used with students. All students have a SSP and upon enrollment graduation options are discussed. There is also a resource that has been created to so students and families have continued access to options leading to graduation. There are identified staff onsite to work specifically with foster youth and unhoused students. Phone calls and incentives were used to acknowledge student attendance. There regular review of rehabilitation plans and revised process with district partners increased the timely transition of students back to district programs.  

Describe any major differences between the intended implementation and/or the budgeted expenditures to implement the strategies/activities to meet the articulated goal.  
There is still a need to provide more training and increase staff knowledge around the LGBTQ+ community, so students are supported in the best way possible.

There is a need to create and train all staff in processes for enrollment, data collection/monitoring, and transition services. Common enrollment strategies would ensure that referring districts provide accurate student data. Additionally, assessments upon enrollment would allow students to be properly supported academically. There is a need to review how data is collected, monitored, and shared with all school staff to ensure that school data is accurately reflecting student performance and needs. Having improved process would increase participation rates in local accountability measures and CAASP.

**Instructions**  
The School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) is a strategic plan that maximizes the resources available to the school while minimizing duplication of effort with the ultimate goal of increasing student achievement. SPSA development should be aligned with and inform the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) process.

This SPSA template consolidates all school-level planning efforts into one plan for programs funded through the Consolidated Application (ConApp) pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 64001 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). This template is designed to meet schoolwide program planning requirements.

California’s ESSA State Plan supports the state’s approach to improving student group performance through the utilization of federal resources. Schools use the SPSA to document their approach to maximizing the impact of federal investments in support of underserved students. The implementation of ESSA in California presents an opportunity for schools to innovate with their federally-funded programs and align them with the priority goals of the school and the local educational agency (LEA) that are being realized under the state’s Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF).

The LCFF provides schools and LEAs flexibility to design programs and provide services that meet the needs of students in order to achieve readiness for college, career, and lifelong learning. The SPSA planning process supports continuous cycles of action, reflection, and improvement. Consistent with EC 64001(g)(1), the Schoolsite Council (SSC) is required to develop and annually review the SPSA, establish an annual budget, and make modifications to the plan that reflect changing needs and priorities, as applicable.

![Additional ATSI Planning Requirements](https://example.com/image.png)

**Additional ATSI Planning Requirements:**
When completing this section to meet federal planning requirements for ATSI, improvement goals must also align with the goals, actions, and services in the LEA’s LCAP.

**Goal**
Well-developed goals will clearly communicate to educational partners what the school plans to accomplish, what the school plans to do in order to accomplish the goal, and how the school will know when it has accomplished the goal. A goal should be specific enough to be measurable in either quantitative or qualitative terms. Schools should assess the performance of their student groups when developing goals and the related strategies/activities to achieve such goals. SPSA goals should align to the goals and actions in the LEA’s LCAP.

A goal is a broad statement that describes the desired result to which all strategies/activities are directed. A goal answers the question: What is the school seeking to achieve?

It can be helpful to frame a framework for writing goals such the S.M.A.R.T. approach.  
A S.M.A.R.T. goal is:
- Specific,
- Measurable,
- Achievable,
- Realistic, and
- Time-bound.

A level of specificity is needed in order to measure performance relative to the goal as well as to assess whether it is reasonably achievable. Including time constraints, such as milestone dates, ensures a realistic approach that supports student success.  
A school may number the goals using the “Goal #” for ease of reference.

**Additional CSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal CSI planning requirements.

**Additional ATSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal ATSI planning requirements.

**Identified Need**
Describe the basis for establishing the goal. The goal should be based upon an analysis of verifiable state data, including local and state indicator data from the Dashboard and data from the School Accountability Report Card, including local data voluntarily collected by districts to measure pupil achievement.

**Additional CSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal CSI planning requirements.

**Additional ATSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal ATSI planning requirements.

**Annual Measurable Outcomes**
Identify the metric(s) and/or state indicator(s) that the school will use as a means of evaluating progress toward accomplishing the goal. A school may identify metrics for specific student groups. Include in the
<!-- Page 59 -->
![School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA)](https://example.com/image.png)

baseline column the most recent data associated with the metric or indicator available at the time of adoption of the SPSA. The most recent data associated with a metric or indicator includes data reported in the annual update of the SPSA. In the subsequent Expected Outcome column, identify the progress the school intends to make in the coming year.

**Additional CSI Planning Requirements:**  
When completing this section for CSI, the school must include school-level metrics related to the metrics that led to the school's eligibility for CSI.

**Additional ATSI Planning Requirements:**  
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal ATSI planning requirements.

### Strategies/Activities Table
Describe the strategies and activities being provided to meet the goal.  
Complete the table as follows:

- **Strategy/Activity #:** Number the strategy/activity using the “Strategy/Activity #” for ease of reference.
- **Description:** Describe the strategy/activity.
- **Students to be Served:** Identify in the Strategy/Activity Table either All Students or one or more specific student groups that will benefit from the strategies and activities. ESSA Section 1111(c)(2) requires the schoolwide plan to identify either “All Students” or one or more specific student groups, including socioeconomically disadvantaged students, students from major racial and ethnic groups, students with disabilities, and English learners.
- **Proposed Expenditures:** List the amount(s) for the proposed expenditures. Proposed expenditures that are included more than once in a SPSA should be indicated as a duplicated expenditure and include a reference to the goal and strategy/activity where the expenditure first appears in the SPSA. Pursuant to EC Section 64001(g)(3)(C), proposed expenditures, based on the projected resource allocation from the governing board or governing body of the LEA, to address the findings of the needs assessment consistent with the state priorities including identifying resource inequities which may include a review of the LEA’s budgeting, its LCAP, and school-level budgeting, if applicable.
- **Funding Sources:** List the funding source(s) for the proposed expenditures. Specify the funding source(s) using one or more of the following: LCFF, Federal (if Federal, identify the Title and Part, as applicable), Other State, and/or Local.

Planned strategies/activities address the findings of the comprehensive needs assessment consistent with state priorities and resource inequities, which may have been identified through a review of the LEA’s budgeting, its LCAP, and school-level budgeting, if applicable.

**Additional CSI Planning Requirements:**  
- When completing this section for CSI, this plan must include evidence-based interventions and align to the goals, actions, and services in the LEA’s LCAP.  
- When completing this section for CSI, this plan must address through implementation, identified resource inequities, which may have been identified through a review of LEA- and school-level budgeting.

This annual review and analysis should be the basis for decision-making and updates to the plan.

**Goal Analysis**  
Using actual outcome data, including state indicator data from the Dashboard, analyze whether the planned strategies/activities were effective in achieving the goal. Respond to the following prompts relative to this goal.

- Describe the overall implementation and effectiveness of the strategies/activities to achieve the articulated goal.
- Briefly describe any major differences between the intended implementation and/or material difference between the budgeted expenditures to implement the strategies/activities to meet the articulated goal.
- Describe any changes that will be made to the goal, expected annual measurable outcomes, metrics/indicators, or strategies/activities to achieve this goal as a result of this analysis and analysis of the data provided in the Dashboard, as applicable. Identify where those changes can be found in the SPSA.

Note: If the school is in the first year of implementing the goal, the Annual Review section is not required and this section may be left blank and completed at the end of the year after the plan has been executed.

**Additional CSI Planning Requirements:**
- When completing this section for CSI, any changes made to the goals, annual measurable outcomes, metrics/indicators, or strategies/activities, shall meet the federal CSI planning requirements.
- CSI planning requirements are listed under each section of the Instructions. For example, as a result of the Annual Review and Update, if changes are made to a goal(s), see the Goal section for CSI planning requirements.

# Appendix A: Plan Requirements

## Schoolwide Program Requirements
This School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) template meets the requirements of a schoolwide program plan. The requirements below are for planning reference. A school that operates a schoolwide program and receives funds allocated through the ConApp is required to develop a SPSA. The SPSA, including proposed expenditures of funds allocated to the school through the ConApp, must be reviewed annually and updated by the Schoolsite Council (SSC). The content of a SPSA must be aligned with school goals for improving student achievement.

## Requirements for Development of the Plan
I. The development of the SPSA shall include both of the following actions:
   A. Administration of a comprehensive needs assessment that forms the basis of the school’s goals contained in the SPSA.
      1. The comprehensive needs assessment of the entire school shall:
         a. Include an analysis of verifiable state data, consistent with all state priorities as noted in Sections 52060 and 52066, and informed by all indicators described in Section 1111(c)(4)(B) of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, including pupil performance against state-determined long-term goals. The school may include data voluntarily developed by districts to measure pupil outcomes (described in the Identified Need).
         b. Be based on academic achievement information about all students in the school, including all groups under §200.13(b)(7) and migratory children as defined in section 1309(2) of the ESEA, relative to the State’s academic standards under §200.1 to:
            i. Help the school understand the subjects and skills for which teaching and learning need to be improved.
            ii. Identify the specific academic needs of students and groups of students who are not yet achieving the State’s academic standards.
            iii. Assess the needs of the school relative to each of the components of the schoolwide program under §200.28.
            iv. Develop the comprehensive needs assessment with the participation of individuals who will carry out the schoolwide program plan.
            v. Document how it conducted the needs assessment, the results it obtained, and the conclusions it drew from those results.
   B. Identification of the process for evaluating and monitoring the implementation of the SPSA and progress towards accomplishing the goals set forth in the SPSA (described in the Expected Annual Measurable Outcomes and Annual Review and Update).

## Requirements for the Plan
II. The SPSA shall include the following:
   A. Goals set to improve pupil outcomes, including addressing the needs of student groups as identified through the needs assessment.
   B. Evidence-based strategies, actions, or services (described in Strategies and Activities)

1. A description of the strategies that the school will be implementing to address school needs, including a description of how such strategies will:
   a. Provide opportunities for all children including each of the subgroups of students to meet the challenging state academic standards
   b. Use methods and instructional strategies that:
      i. Strengthen the academic program in the school,
      ii. Increase the amount and quality of learning time, and
      iii. Provide an enriched and accelerated curriculum, which may include programs, activities, and courses necessary to provide a well-rounded education.
   c. Address the needs of all children in the school, but particularly the needs of those at risk of not meeting the challenging State academic standards, so that all students demonstrate at least proficiency on the State’s academic standards through activities which may include:
      i. Strategies to improve students’ skills outside the academic subject areas;
      ii. Preparation for and awareness of opportunities for postsecondary education and the workforce;
      iii. Implementation of a schoolwide tiered model to prevent and address problem behavior;
      iv. Professional development and other activities for teachers, paraprofessionals, and other school personnel to improve instruction and use of data; and
      v. Strategies for assisting preschool children in the transition from early childhood education programs to local elementary school programs.

C. Proposed expenditures, based on the projected resource allocation from the governing board or body of the LEA (may include funds allocated via the ConApp, federal funds, and any other state or local funds allocated to the school), to address the findings of the needs assessment consistent with the state priorities, including identifying resource inequities, which may include a review of the LEAs budgeting, it’s LCAP, and school-level budgeting, if applicable (described in Proposed Expenditures and Budget Summary).

D. A description of how the school will determine if school needs have been met (described in the Expected Annual Measurable Outcomes and the Annual Review and Update).
   1. Annually evaluate the implementation of, and results achieved by, the schoolwide program, using data from the State’s annual assessments and other indicators of academic achievement;
   2. Determine whether the schoolwide program has been effective in increasing the achievement of students in meeting the State's academic standards, particularly for those students who had been furthest from achieving the standards; and
   3. Revise the plan, as necessary, based on the results of the evaluation, to ensure continuous improvement of students in the schoolwide program.
