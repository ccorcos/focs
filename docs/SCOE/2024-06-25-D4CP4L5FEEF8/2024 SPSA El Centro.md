| El Centro Jr./Sr. High School | 34-10348-0106278                 | 06/03/2024                             | June 25, 2024             |

The School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) is a strategic plan that maximizes the resources available to the school while minimizing duplication of effort with the ultimate goal of increasing student achievement. SPSA development should be aligned with and inform the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) process.

This SPSA template consolidates all school-level planning efforts into one plan for programs funded through the Consolidated Application (ConApp), and for federal Additional Targeted Support and Improvement (ATSI), pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 64001 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). This template is designed to meet schoolwide program planning requirements for both the SPSA and federal ATSI planning requirements.

California’s ESSA State Plan supports the state’s approach to improving student group performance through the utilization of federal resources. Schools use the SPSA to document their approach to maximizing the impact of federal investments in support of underserved students. The implementation of ESSA in California presents an opportunity for schools to innovate with their federally-funded programs and align them with the priority goals of the school and the local educational agency (LEA) that are being realized under the state’s Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF).

The LCFF provides schools and LEAs flexibility to design programs and provide services that meet the needs of students in order to achieve readiness for college, career, and lifelong learning. The SPSA planning process supports continuous cycles of action, reflection, and improvement. Consistent with EC 64001(g)(1), the Schoolsite Council (SSC) is required to develop and annually review the SPSA, establish an annual budget, and make modifications to the plan that reflect changing needs and priorities, as applicable.

This plan is being used by El Centro Jr./Sr. High School for meeting the following ESSA planning requirements in alignment with the LCAP and other federal, state, and local programs:

- Schoolwide Program
- Comprehensive Support and Improvement

This template is based on the December, 2023 CDE revision of the School Plan for Student Achievement. Some modifications have been made to inform the SPSA development process.

**Plan Description**  
Briefly describe your school’s plan for effectively meeting ESSA’s planning requirements in alignment with the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) and other federal, state, and local programs.

This plan is being used by El Centro Jr./Sr. High School for meeting the following ESSA planning requirements in alignment with the LCAP and other federal, state, and local programs:

- Schoolwide Program
- Comprehensive Support and Improvement

El Centro Jr./Sr. High School is directly responsible for serving incarcerated youth. Our students often have needs that extend beyond routine school services. We serve Foster Youth (FY), homeless students and a growing population of English learners (ELs). We actively engage and involve the families of our ELs by providing translation, interpreting, and an we have a designated period of EL one day per week, an ELD/ELS Program Specialist to improve and expand EL services.

Our students have a high rate of school mobility across all student subgroups. To address this we partner with the Sacramento County Juvenile Courts, the Sacramento County Probation Department, Child Welfare, Behavioral Health, Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), and other non-profits to coordinate services to FY in the county who are in the child welfare system and have crossed over into the juvenile justice system. SCOE’s involvement in this process includes Special Ed, SCOE Legal Counsel, and Federal Title I coordination.

We are committed to improving academic outcomes and meeting the needs of the whole child. We utilize multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS), intensive intervention in English Language Arts (ELA) and mathematics, and a focus on college and career readiness skills through a dual enrollment MOU with Los Rios Community College District, and an MOU with Lake Tahoe Community College, pre-apprenticeship career technical education (Culinary Arts, and Northern California Construction Training). Our goal is to prepare students to be successful in post-secondary education, training, employment or career pathways. Our program is a result of a continuous improvement cycle focusing on student engagement, student-centered learning opportunities, and quality instruction.

**Educational Partner Involvement**  
How, when, and with whom did El Centro Jr./Sr. High School consult as part of the planning process for this SPSA/Annual Review and Update?

**Involvement Process for the SPSA and Annual Review and Update**  
Stakeholder engagement processes included School Site Council with the annual development of the School Plans for Student Achievement (SPSA), review of LCAP goals and actions, and reviewing and approving our Title I budgets and expenditures.

The site principal leads a variety of engagement processes, individual parent engagement and survey administration, email engagement for all parents, and Individualized Education Plan (IEP), Student Study Team (SST), Child Family Team (CFT), and Multi-disciplinary Team (MDT) meetings.

Stakeholders were involved throughout the year through calls home, surveys, and weekly program planning meetings with probation and mental health clinicians. In addition, we continue to engage stakeholders in site safety planning, School Site Council, and staff meetings.

# School and Student Performance Data

## CAASPP Results  
### English Language Arts/Literacy (All Students)

The Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for ELA and mathematics are an annual measure of what students know and can do using the Common Core State Standards for English language arts/literacy and mathematics.

The purpose of the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments is to assess student knowledge and skills for English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, as well as how much students have improved since the previous year. These measures help identify and address gaps in knowledge or skills early so students get the support they need for success in higher grades and for college and career readiness.

All students in grades three through eight and grade eleven take the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments unless a student’s active individualized education program (IEP) designates the California Alternate Assessments.

Visit the California Department of Education’s Smarter Balanced Assessment System web page for more information.

Conclusions based on this data:

1. To address the high number of students testing below standards, staff will continue to participate in an ongoing PD focusing on research-based instructional strategies in ELA and will continue to provide intensive intervention to all students performing below grade level.
2. We have shown significant growth in our number of students tested since 2020-21.
3. Due to the high mobility of our students, CAASPP participation is challenging.

# School and Student Performance Data

## CAASPP Results  
### Mathematics (All Students)

The Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for ELA and mathematics are an annual measure of what students know and can do using the Common Core State Standards for English language arts/literacy and mathematics.

The purpose of the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments is to assess student knowledge and skills for English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, as well as how much students have improved since the previous year. These measures help identify and address gaps in knowledge or skills early so students get the support they need for success in higher grades and for college and career readiness.

All students in grades three through eight and grade eleven take the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments unless a student’s active individualized education program (IEP) designates the California Alternate Assessments.

Visit the California Department of Education’s Smarter Balanced Assessment System web page for more information.

# School and Student Performance Data

The English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) system is used to determine and monitor the progress of the English language proficiency for students whose primary language is not English. The ELPAC is aligned with the 2012 California English Language Development Standards and assesses four domains: listening, speaking, reading, and writing.

Visit the California Department of Education’s English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) web page or the ELPAC.org website for more information about the ELPAC.

# School and Student Performance Data
## California School Dashboard
### Student Population

The 2023 California School Dashboard provides parents and educators with meaningful information on school and district progress so they can participate in decisions to improve student learning.

The California School Dashboard goes beyond test scores alone to provide a more complete picture of how schools and districts are meeting the needs of all students. To help parents and educators identify strengths and areas for improvement, California reports how districts, schools (including alternative schools), and student groups are performing across state and local measures.

This section provides information about the school’s student population.

### 2022-23 Student Population

| Total Enrollment | Socioeconomically Disadvantaged | English Learners | Foster Youth |

# Overall Performance

The 2023 California School Dashboard provides parents and educators with meaningful information on school and district progress so they can participate in decisions to improve student learning.

The California School Dashboard goes beyond test scores alone to provide a more complete picture of how schools and districts are meeting the needs of all students. To help parents and educators identify strengths and areas for improvement, California reports how districts, schools (including alternative schools), and student groups are performing across state and local measures.

Performance on state measures, using comparable statewide data, is represented by one of five colors. The performance level (color) is not included when there are fewer than 30 students in any year. This is represented using a greyed out color dial with the words “No Performance Color.”

## 2023 Fall Dashboard Overall Performance for All Students

| Academic Performance | Academic Engagement | Conditions & Climate |
|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| College/Career       | Graduation Rate      | Suspension Rate       |
| Very Low             | Red                 | Blue                 |

## Conclusions based on this data:
1. We do not have a 4 year cohort at El Centro so it is challenging to report graduation rate in a way that reflects our progress.
2. We continue to have a very low suspension rate.

## English Learner Progress

The 2023 California School Dashboard provides parents and educators with meaningful information on school and district progress so they can participate in decisions to improve student learning.

The California School Dashboard goes beyond test scores alone to provide a more complete picture of how schools and districts are meeting the needs of all students. To help parents and educators identify strengths and areas for improvement, California reports how districts, schools (including alternative schools), and student groups are performing across state and local measures.

Performance on state measures, using comparable statewide data, is represented by one of five colors. The performance level (color) is not included when there are fewer than 30 students in any year. This is represented using a greyed out color dial with the words “No Performance Color.”

This section provides a view of the percentage of current EL students making progress towards English language proficiency or maintaining the highest level.

### 2023 Fall Dashboard English Learner Progress Indicator

**Annual Review**  
**SPSA Year Reviewed: 2023-24**  

Respond to the following prompts relative to this goal. If the school is in the first year of implementing the goal, an analysis is not required, and this section may be left blank and completed at the end of the year after the plan has been executed.

### Analysis
**Describe the overall implementation and effectiveness of the strategies/activities to achieve the articulated goal.**  
In ELA our listed baseline was 70% which was incorrect and should have been 46.7%. We showed a 10% growth in Ren Learn scores. In math our listed baseline was 72% which was incorrect and should have been 40% and we showed a 2% decline in Ren Learn scores. Our credit completion goal was 48% and we increased by 3.1%. Our Career Assessment completion was at 260 students last year and we increased by 33 students. We have implemented strategies to better support our English Learners, however we continue to have a small percentage of ELs in our school and therefore the numbers reported are not numerically significant to disaggregate this data. Our Successful Transitions continue to be at 100%. Metrics were updated to align with the LCAP and to include new measures.

**Describe any major differences between the intended implementation and/or the budgeted expenditures to implement the strategies/activities to meet the articulated goal.**  
Due to changes in the master schedule, we did not focus on Big Picture Learning. All other intended implementations and budgeted expenditures met the articulated goals.

**Describe any changes that will be made to this goal, the annual outcomes, metrics, or strategies/activities to achieve this goal as a result of this analysis. Identify where those changes can be found in the SPSA.**  
Goals will change to align with our LCAP. PD updated to include Visible Learning, PLCs, training on Achieve 3000, additional goal to support foster/unhoused youth, and added Media Teacher/Librarian will support our ELs through a designated EL class.

Respond to the following prompts relative to this goal. If the school is in the first year of implementing the goal, an analysis is not required, and this section may be left blank and completed at the end of the year after the plan has been executed.

**Analysis**  
Describe the overall implementation and effectiveness of the strategies/activities to achieve the articulated goal.  
Our attendance rate remained constant. Our LCAP student survey percent of positive response to one or more statements measuring connectedness and engagement increased by 7%. Our graduation rate declined by 23%, but is being analyzed for potential data input issues. Our suspension rate remained constant. Our student participation rate with CBOs decreased by 5% and we are auditing our reporting system to ensure all CBOs are tracking their work accurately.

Describe any major differences between the intended implementation and/or the budgeted expenditures to implement the strategies/activities to meet the articulated goal.  
We understand the need to continue to refine SSPs, and will retrain teachers on how to input SSP info. We are still working with our SIS department to develop a format to print the email/SSP in a cleaner format. We will continue to expand access and information for our families and we have created an e signature option for our credit reductions and IEPs when parents are unable to come to our school to sign. All other intended implementations and budgeted expenditures met the articulated goals.

Describe any changes that will be made to this goal, the annual outcomes, metrics, or strategies/activities to achieve this goal as a result of this analysis. Identify where those changes can be found in the SPSA.  
Goals will change to align with our LCAP. School leadership SIS discussions have been removed and will be modified and added to Goal 3. Action 2.1 was modified to include CBOs support and mentoring students. Grad rate metric moved.

The current make-up of the SSC is as follows:

- 1 School Principal
- 3 Classroom Teachers
- 1 Other School Staff
- 2 Parent or Community Members
- 3 Secondary Students

| Name of Members  | Role                      |

Classroom teachers must comprise a majority of persons represented under section (a). At secondary schools there must be, in addition, equal numbers of parents or other community members selected by parents, and students. Members must be selected by their peer group.
