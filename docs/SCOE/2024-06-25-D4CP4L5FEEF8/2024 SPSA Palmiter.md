| Leo A. Palmiter Jr./Sr. High School | 34-10348-0106229                  | June 25, 2024                          |                           |

The School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) is a strategic plan that maximizes the resources available to the school while minimizing duplication of effort with the ultimate goal of increasing student achievement. SPSA development should be aligned with and inform the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) process.

This SPSA template consolidates all school-level planning efforts into one plan for programs funded through the Consolidated Application (ConApp), and for federal Additional Targeted Support and Improvement (ATSI), pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 64001 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). This template is designed to meet schoolwide program planning requirements for both the SPSA and federal ATSI planning requirements.

California’s ESSA State Plan supports the state’s approach to improving student group performance through the utilization of federal resources. Schools use the SPSA to document their approach to maximizing the impact of federal investments in support of underserved students. The implementation of ESSA in California presents an opportunity for schools to innovate with their federally-funded programs and align them with the priority goals of the school and the local educational agency (LEA) that are being realized under the state’s Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF).

The LCFF provides schools and LEAs flexibility to design programs and provide services that meet the needs of students in order to achieve readiness for college, career, and lifelong learning. The SPSA planning process supports continuous cycles of action, reflection, and improvement. Consistent with EC 64001(g)(1), the Schoolsite Council (SSC) is required to develop and annually review the SPSA, establish an annual budget, and make modifications to the plan that reflect changing needs and priorities, as applicable.

This plan is being used by Leo A. Palmiter Jr./Sr. High School for meeting the following ESSA planning requirements in alignment with the LCAP and other federal, state, and local programs:

- Schoolwide Program
- Additional Targeted Support and Improvement
- Socio-economically and students with disabilities

This template is based on the December, 2023 CDE revision of the School Plan for Student Achievement. Some modifications have been made to inform the SPSA development process.

**Plan Description**  
Briefly describe your school’s plan for effectively meeting ESSA’s planning requirements in alignment with the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) and other federal, state, and local programs.  

This plan is being used by Leo A. Palmiter Jr./Sr. High School for meeting the following ESSA planning requirements in alignment with the LCAP and other federal, state, and local programs:  

- Schoolwide Program  
- Additional Targeted Support and Improvement  
- Socio-economically and students with disabilities  

Leo A. Palmiter Jr./Sr. High School provides education to students with disabilities with mental health and behavioral needs. Our program meets the unique educational, behavioral, and mental health needs of our students and offers a range of services that promote a positive learning environment. Students are referred directly from the local school districts of Sacramento County that are unable to provide the more highly structured behavioral support program as well as vocational opportunities. During the 2023-2024 school year, school psychologists provided Educationally Related Mental Health Services (ERMHS). In addition, students were provided a standards-based educational program that is supported by a strong career technical emphasis. The Leo A. Palmiter program is divided into three Linked Learning Pathways: Discovery Academy (pre-vocational skills for grades 7-8), Culinary Arts, and Sustainable Environments Academies (grades 9-12). Each Linked Learning Pathway connects core academics with real-world experience within various fields. Coursework is coordinated with the Career Technical Education (CTE) programs, such as Culinary Arts and Hospitality, Horticulture, and Northern California Construction Training (NCCT).  

Our students also benefit from a Multi-Tiered System of Support model, which provides Tier I - Tier III supports in the area of academics, behavior, and social emotional development. The idea is to strengthen the tiers via targeted professional development for teachers. Teachers will have dedicated collaboration time to plan lessons, analyze student data, and plan next steps for students who need further support or challenge opportunities. During these collaboration times, teachers will practice and create action plans, and have the opportunity to attend professional development trainings with the addition of instructional coaches which can provide relevant feedback.  
The goals and strategies outlined in the SPSA support the district’s LCAP and ESSA requirements by meeting students’ academic, behavioral, and attendance needs for all student groups.  

**Educational Partner Involvement**  
How, when, and with whom did Leo A. Palmiter Jr./Sr. High School consult as part of the planning process for this SPSA/Annual Review and Update?  

**Involvement Process for the SPSA and Annual Review and Update**  
This is for Leo A. Palmiter Jr./Sr. High School. We reviewed and gathered input at our December 2023 ELAC meeting from our stakeholders. Additionally, we used input from our LCAP surveys and regular parent input from our IEP meetings to inform all of the information within the SPSA. The site principal led a variety of engagement processes that included individual parent engagement and survey administration, email engagement for all parents, and IEP meetings.  

**Resource Inequities**  
Briefly identify and describe any resource inequities identified as a result of the required needs assessment, as applicable.  

This section is required for all schools eligible for ATSI and CSI.  

A primary inequity for Leo A. Palmiter is permanent Para-Educators. We have had to use staffing agencies to adequately staff. In addition, there is a lack of substitutes to cover the instructional staff when absent. Lack of these key staff have a direct impact on the achievement of our students. Students have experienced trauma and placed in multiple districts prior to placement at Leo A. Palmiter.

# School and Student Performance Data
## CAASPP Results
### English Language Arts/Literacy (All Students)

The Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for ELA and mathematics are an annual measure of what students know and can do using the Common Core State Standards for English language arts/literacy and mathematics.

The purpose of the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments is to assess student knowledge and skills for English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics, as well as how much students have improved since the previous year. These measures help identify and address gaps in knowledge or skills early so students get the support they need for success in higher grades and for college and career readiness.

All students in grades three through eight and grade eleven take the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments unless a student’s active individualized education program (IEP) designates the California Alternate Assessments.

Visit the California Department of Education’s Smarter Balanced Assessment System web page for more information.

# School and Student Performance Data

The English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) system is used to determine and monitor the progress of the English language proficiency for students whose primary language is not English. The ELPAC is aligned with the 2012 California English Language Development Standards and assesses four domains: listening, speaking, reading, and writing.

Visit the California Department of Education’s English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) web page or the ELPAC.org website for more information about the ELPAC.

# School and Student Performance Data
## California School Dashboard
### Student Population

The 2023 California School Dashboard provides parents and educators with meaningful information on school and district progress so they can participate in decisions to improve student learning.

The California School Dashboard goes beyond test scores alone to provide a more complete picture of how schools and districts are meeting the needs of all students. To help parents and educators identify strengths and areas for improvement, California reports how districts, schools (including alternative schools), and student groups are performing across state and local measures.

This section provides information about the school’s student population.

### English Learner Progress

The 2023 California School Dashboard provides parents and educators with meaningful information on school and district progress so they can participate in decisions to improve student learning.

The California School Dashboard goes beyond test scores alone to provide a more complete picture of how schools and districts are meeting the needs of all students. To help parents and educators identify strengths and areas for improvement, California reports how districts, schools (including alternative schools), and student groups are performing across state and local measures.

Performance on state measures, using comparable statewide data, is represented by one of five colors. The performance level (color) is not included when there are fewer than 30 students in any year. This is represented using a greyed out color dial with the words “No Performance Color.”

This section provides a view of the percentage of current EL students making progress towards English language proficiency or maintaining the highest level.

![Instructions](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Instructions)

**Instructions**  
The School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) is a strategic plan that maximizes the resources available to the school while minimizing duplication of effort with the ultimate goal of increasing student achievement. SPSA development should be aligned with and inform the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) process.

This SPSA template consolidates all school-level planning efforts into one plan for programs funded through the Consolidated Application (ConApp) pursuant to California Education Code (EC) Section 64001 and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). This template is designed to meet schoolwide program planning requirements.

California’s ESSA State Plan supports the state’s approach to improving student group performance through the utilization of federal resources. Schools use the SPSA to document their approach to maximizing the impact of federal investments in support of underserved students. The implementation of ESSA in California presents an opportunity for schools to innovate with their federally-funded programs and align them with the priority goals of the school and the local educational agency (LEA) that are being realized under the state’s Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF).

The LCFF provides schools and LEAs flexibility to design programs and provide services that meet the needs of students in order to achieve readiness for college, career, and lifelong learning. The SPSA planning process supports continuous cycles of action, reflection, and improvement. Consistent with EC 64001(g)(1), the Schoolsite Council (SSC) is required to develop and annually review the SPSA, establish an annual budget, and make modifications to the plan that reflect changing needs and priorities, as applicable.

![Additional ATSI Planning Requirements](https://example.com/image.png)

**Additional ATSI Planning Requirements:**
When completing this section to meet federal planning requirements for ATSI, improvement goals must also align with the goals, actions, and services in the LEA’s LCAP.

**Goal**
Well-developed goals will clearly communicate to educational partners what the school plans to accomplish, what the school plans to do in order to accomplish the goal, and how the school will know when it has accomplished the goal. A goal should be specific enough to be measurable in either quantitative or qualitative terms. Schools should assess the performance of their student groups when developing goals and the related strategies/activities to achieve such goals. SPSA goals should align to the goals and actions in the LEA’s LCAP.

A goal is a broad statement that describes the desired result to which all strategies/activities are directed. A goal answers the question: What is the school seeking to achieve?

It can be helpful to frame a framework for writing goals such the S.M.A.R.T. approach.  
A S.M.A.R.T. goal is:
- Specific,
- Measurable,
- Achievable,
- Realistic, and
- Time-bound.

A level of specificity is needed in order to measure performance relative to the goal as well as to assess whether it is reasonably achievable. Including time constraints, such as milestone dates, ensures a realistic approach that supports student success.  
A school may number the goals using the “Goal #” for ease of reference.

**Additional CSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal CSI planning requirements.

**Additional ATSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal ATSI planning requirements.

**Identified Need**
Describe the basis for establishing the goal. The goal should be based upon an analysis of verifiable state data, including local and state indicator data from the Dashboard and data from the School Accountability Report Card, including local data voluntarily collected by districts to measure pupil achievement.

**Additional CSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal CSI planning requirements.

**Additional ATSI Planning Requirements:**
Completing this section as described above fully addresses all relevant federal ATSI planning requirements.

**Annual Measurable Outcomes**

In this section, a school provides a brief summary of the funding allocated to the school through the ConApp and/or other funding sources as well as the total amount of funds for proposed expenditures described in the SPSA. The Budget Summary is required for schools funded through the ConApp.

**Note:** If the school is not operating a Title I schoolwide program, this section is not applicable and may be deleted.

### Additional CSI Planning Requirements:
- From its total allocation for CSI, the LEA may distribute funds across its schools that are eligible for CSI to support implementation of this plan. In addition, the LEA may retain a portion of its total allocation to support LEA-level expenditures that are directly related to serving schools eligible for CSI.

**Note:** CSI funds may not be expended at or on behalf of schools not eligible for CSI.

### Additional ATSI Planning Requirements:
- Note: Federal funds for CSI shall not be used in schools eligible for ATSI.

### Budget Summary Table
A school receiving funds allocated through the ConApp should complete the Budget Summary Table as follows:

- **Total Funds Provided to the School Through the ConApp:** This amount is the total amount of funding provided to the school through the ConApp for the school year. The school year means the fiscal year for which a SPSA is adopted or updated.
  
- **Total Funds Budgeted for Strategies to Meet the Goals in the SPSA:** This amount is the total of the proposed expenditures from all sources of funds associated with the strategies/activities reflected in the SPSA. To the extent strategies/activities and/or proposed expenditures are listed in the SPSA under more than one goal, the expenditures should be counted only once.

A school receiving funds from its LEA for CSI should complete the Budget Summary Table as follows:

- **Total Federal Funds Provided to the School from the LEA for CSI:** This amount is the total amount of funding provided to the school from the LEA for the purpose of developing and implementing the CSI plan for the school year set forth in the CSI LEA Application for which funds were received.

# Appendix A: Plan Requirements

## Schoolwide Program Requirements
This School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) template meets the requirements of a schoolwide program plan. The requirements below are for planning reference. A school that operates a schoolwide program and receives funds allocated through the ConApp is required to develop a SPSA. The SPSA, including proposed expenditures of funds allocated to the school through the ConApp, must be reviewed annually and updated by the Schoolsite Council (SSC). The content of a SPSA must be aligned with school goals for improving student achievement.

## Requirements for Development of the Plan
I. The development of the SPSA shall include both of the following actions:
   A. Administration of a comprehensive needs assessment that forms the basis of the school’s goals contained in the SPSA.
      1. The comprehensive needs assessment of the entire school shall:
         a. Include an analysis of verifiable state data, consistent with all state priorities as noted in Sections 52060 and 52066, and informed by all indicators described in Section 1111(c)(4)(B) of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, including pupil performance against state-determined long-term goals. The school may include data voluntarily developed by districts to measure pupil outcomes (described in the Identified Need).
         b. Be based on academic achievement information about all students in the school, including all groups under §200.13(b)(7) and migratory children as defined in section 1309(2) of the ESEA, relative to the State’s academic standards under §200.1 to:
            i. Help the school understand the subjects and skills for which teaching and learning need to be improved.
            ii. Identify the specific academic needs of students and groups of students who are not yet achieving the State's academic standards.
            iii. Assess the needs of the school relative to each of the components of the schoolwide program under §200.28.
            iv. Develop the comprehensive needs assessment with the participation of individuals who will carry out the schoolwide program plan.
            v. Document how it conducted the needs assessment, the results it obtained, and the conclusions it drew from those results.
   B. Identification of the process for evaluating and monitoring the implementation of the SPSA and progress towards accomplishing the goals set forth in the SPSA (described in the Expected Annual Measurable Outcomes and Annual Review and Update).

## Requirements for the Plan
II. The SPSA shall include the following:
   A. Goals set to improve pupil outcomes, including addressing the needs of student groups as identified through the needs assessment.
   B. Evidence-based strategies, actions, or services (described in Strategies and Activities).

1. A description of the strategies that the school will be implementing to address school needs, including a description of how such strategies will:
   a. Provide opportunities for all children including each of the subgroups of students to meet the challenging state academic standards
   b. Use methods and instructional strategies that:
      i. Strengthen the academic program in the school,
      ii. Increase the amount and quality of learning time, and
      iii. Provide an enriched and accelerated curriculum, which may include programs, activities, and courses necessary to provide a well-rounded education.
   c. Address the needs of all children in the school, but particularly the needs of those at risk of not meeting the challenging State academic standards, so that all students demonstrate at least proficiency on the State’s academic standards through activities which may include:
      i. Strategies to improve students’ skills outside the academic subject areas;
      ii. Preparation for and awareness of opportunities for postsecondary education and the workforce;
      iii. Implementation of a schoolwide tiered model to prevent and address problem behavior;
      iv. Professional development and other activities for teachers, paraprofessionals, and other school personnel to improve instruction and use of data; and
      v. Strategies for assisting preschool children in the transition from early childhood education programs to local elementary school programs.

C. Proposed expenditures, based on the projected resource allocation from the governing board or body of the LEA may include funds allocated via the ConApp, federal funds, and any other state or local funds allocated to the school, to address the findings of the needs assessment consistent with the state priorities, including identifying resource inequities, which may include a review of the LEAs budgeting, its LCAP, and school-level budgeting, if applicable (described in Proposed Expenditures and Budget Summary). Employees of the schoolwide program may be deemed funded by a single cost objective.

D. A description of how the school will determine if school needs have been met (described in the Expected Annual Measurable Outcomes and the Annual Review and Update).
   1. Annually evaluate the implementation of, and results achieved by, the schoolwide program, using data from the State’s annual assessments and other indicators of academic achievement;
   2. Determine whether the schoolwide program has been effective in increasing the achievement of students in meeting the State's academic standards, particularly for those students who had been furthest from achieving the standards; and
   3. Revise the plan, as necessary, based on the results of the evaluation, to ensure continuous improvement of students in the schoolwide program.

F. A description of the activities the school will include to ensure that students who experience difficulty attaining proficient or advanced levels of academic achievement standards will be provided with effective, timely additional support, including measures to:  
   1. Ensure that those students' difficulties are identified on a timely basis; and  
   2. Provide sufficient information on which to base effective assistance to those students.  
G. For an elementary school, a description of how the school will assist preschool students in the successful transition from early childhood programs to the school.  
H. A description of how the school will use resources to carry out these components (described in the Proposed Expenditures for Strategies/Activities).
