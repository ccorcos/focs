# SACRAMENTO COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING THE PUBLIC HEALTH RISK OF INTOXICATING HEMP TO MINORS

## RESOLUTION NO. 24-13

WHEREAS, the Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE) operates prevention and intervention programs in Sacramento County to prevent substance abuse among youth; and

WHEREAS, SCOE’s prevention and intervention programs partner with schools and districts; local government agencies; law enforcement agencies; community-based organizations; businesses; families, students, and volunteers; and

WHEREAS, these partners have expressed to SCOE and the Sacramento County Board of Education (Board) that intoxicating hemp products (including those from naturally occurring and chemically synthesized cannabinoids) are creating a serious public health risk for Sacramento County youth; and

WHEREAS, a wide range of poorly regulated intoxicating hemp products have proliferated throughout California, and minors can legally purchase them at gas stations, smoke shops, convenience stores, and other retailers that are often located near schools; and

WHEREAS, edible hemp products (from naturally occurring and chemically synthesized cannabinoids) are often packaged in doses that far exceed the legal limit for legalized edible cannabis, and their consumption can lead to serious health risks and emergency room visits; and

WHEREAS, intoxicating hemp products are frequently manufactured in ways that clearly appeal to children and teens and imitate common snack foods like candies, chips, and beverages; and

WHEREAS, Sacramento County schools are experiencing large numbers of students consuming intoxicating hemp products, creating a serious disruption to the learning environment and the health and safety of students; and

WHEREAS, SCOE and the Board see a need for greater regulation of intoxicating hemp and a need for the City and County of Sacramento to implement measures to protect Sacramento’s children and youth and address the public health risks associated with intoxicating hemp products; and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Sacramento County Board of Education hereby:

1. Recognizes that the proliferation of intoxicating hemp is negatively impacting the health, safety, and welfare of Sacramento County students and communities; and
