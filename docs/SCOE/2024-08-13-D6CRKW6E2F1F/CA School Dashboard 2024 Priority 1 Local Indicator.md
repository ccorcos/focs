# CA School Dashboard 2024  
## Priority 1 Local Indicator  

### Overview  
The California Department of Education (CDE) recently released the 2022–23 Teaching Assignment Monitoring Outcomes (TAMO) by Full-Time Equivalency data report on DataQuest. The CDE will report 2022–23 TAMO data for each LEA on the 2024 California School Dashboard (Dashboard) as part of the Priority 1 Local Indicator. Because the 2022–23 TAMO data were unavailable at the time that LEAs were reporting their local indicators, LEAs must report the 2022–23 TAMO data at the next available meeting of the governing board/body. The table below shows the data that will be reported for SCOE.  

| 2022-23 Teaching Assignment Monitoring Outcomes by Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) | Total Teaching FTE | Clear | Out-of-Field | Intern | Ineffective | Incomplete | Unknown | N/A |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sacramento County Office of Education | 68.4 | 53.2% | 29.3% | 1.5% | 4.4% | 11.7% | 0.0% | 0.0% |
| Sacramento County | 9,919.6 | 87.8% | 2.2% | 1.5% | 4.0% | 4.1% | 0.3% | 0.1% |
| Statewide | 245,801.8 | 85.1% | 2.9% | 1.8% | 4.9% | 4.9% | 0.3% | 0.2% |

### Teaching AMO Definitions  
The CTC evaluates each teaching assignment along one or more relevant attributes or dimensions of the teaching assignment to determine if or how the teacher is authorized to hold the assignment based upon the credential authorization data maintained by the CTC. The CDE evaluates the detailed data provided by the CTC to produce a single AMO for each assignment based on a set of business rules described in a separate section below. The following seven AMOs used for reporting purposes are defined in the order in which they appear on the DataQuest report:  

**Clear**  
An assignment monitoring outcome of "clear" indicates that all relevant attributes or dimensions of the assignment were authorized by a clear or preliminary credential or authorized by a local assignment option (LAO) pursuant to Section 80005(b) of the California Code of Regulations [TS §80005(b)] for specific state course codes where a credential or permit does not exist to authorize the indicated teaching assignment (e.g., student government or study hall.)  

**Out-of-Field**  
An assignment monitoring outcome of “out-of-field” indicates that one or more relevant attributes of the assignment were authorized by the following limited permits:

- General Education Limited Assignment Permit (GELAP)
- Special Education Limited Assignment Permit (SELAP)
- Short-Term Waivers
- Emergency English Learner or Bilingual Authorization Permits
- Local Assignment Options (except for those made pursuant to T5 §80005(b))

An "out-of-field" teacher is defined as someone who has a credential but has not yet demonstrated subject matter competence in the subject area(s) or for the student population associated with the assignment.

Intern  
An "intern" teacher is defined as someone who has a bachelor’s degree and has demonstrated subject matter competency in the subject area(s) or for the student population associated with the assignment, and who holds an intern credential while they complete coursework requirements to obtain a preliminary credential.

Ineffective  
An assignment monitoring outcome of "ineffective" indicates that one or more relevant attributes of the assignment had no legal authorization from a permit, credential or waiver, or one or more relevant attributes of the assignment were authorized by the following limited permits:
- Provisional Internship Permits,
- Short-Term Staff Permits
- Variable Term Waivers
- Substitute permits or Teaching Permits for Statutory Leave (TPSL) holders serving as the teacher of record.

Incomplete  
An assignment monitoring outcome of "incomplete" indicates that missing or incorrect information about the assignment was reported to CALPADS by the LEA which prevented a complete and accurate determination of the assignment authorization during the CTC assignment monitoring process. In some cases, the LEA or Monitoring Authority may have indicated that the assignment is appropriate; however, neither the CDE nor the CTC can validate the authorization basis for the assignment.

Unknown (UK)  
An assignment monitoring outcome of "unknown" indicates that insufficient information about the assignment was reported to CALPADS by the LEA which resulted in an "unknown" determination of the assignment authorization during the CTC assignment monitoring process. This outcome is often the result of LEAs not reporting an English language service associated with a course in which English learners are enrolled. Although the assignment authorization may be "clear" in other areas, an assignment monitoring

outcome of “unknown” in the EL authorization space results in an overall determination of "unknown" for the assignment.

## Not Applicable (N/A)
An assignment monitoring outcome of "N/A" indicates that the assignment either required no authorization or evaluation of the authorization was not applicable given the state course code or some other attribute of the assignment. This includes specific state course codes not evaluated during the assignment monitoring process conducted by the CTC (e.g., 9143, 9154, or 9215) or because the assignment was an online, learner-led course in which the student sets the pace of instruction, and where content and instruction are provided solely by the online application.
