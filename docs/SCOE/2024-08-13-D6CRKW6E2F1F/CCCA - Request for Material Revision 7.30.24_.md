**Capital College and Career Academy**  
**Material Revision to Add an International Visiting Student Program**  

Capital College and Career Academy (“CCCA”) seeks a material revision to its charter petition to build on its academic program to include a limited international visiting student (“IVS”) component to welcome IVS program students not to exceed 5% of total enrollment each academic year – each for one academic year only. If approved, the following shall be considered appended to Element 1 of CCCA’s charter petition.

The fundamental objective of CCCA’s charter is to prepare our students for work, college, and life in what is an ever-increasing and challenging global and connected economy. We see it as central to our role and mission to bring opportunities to our students and create opportunities for our students that they would not otherwise experience by virtue of where they live, their socioeconomic status, and the challenges they have faced. By participating in CCCA’s programs, IVS program students are anticipated to contribute to class discussions, build relationships with peers at CCA, and help facilitate cross-cultural understanding related to college, work, and life, and support CCCA’s objective under Education Code Section 47605.6(b)(5)(A)(i) to develop “educated person[s]” in the 21st century” and “enable[d pupils to become self-motivated, competent, and lifelong learners.”

While CCCA’s charter is, by design, intended to principally benefit Sacramento County students (and enroll all other California students for whom there is capacity), the program in the charter has always reflected an ideal for our students to be ready to engage in a global economy. Our charter explains that “High school should be a time where students explore their interests and passions while also acquiring a strong academic preparation for the world ahead.” (p. 6) Further, “CCCA is committed to delivering a quality education in the building trades, but we recognize students today also need to know what it means to be successful in the 21st-century workplace. Employers in all sectors of the economy want a workforce that knows HOW to work. Employers are asking educational institutions to teach students essential 21st-century skills rather than simply memorizing facts and formulas. Employers are seeking employees who understand what it means to collaborate, communicate, and solve complex problems. If education is going to meet the needs of industry and prepare students for success, educators must prepare students to be 21st-century thinkers and learners…” As one example, page 52 of our charter notes that “Tenth-grade students at CCCA will participate in a chemistry course modeled after the Solving Local and Global Building Challenges UC A-G approved science course.” In the context of the construction industry alone (which relates to CCCA’s building trades programs, 21st century students will need to understand and interact with global supply chains and manufacturers around the world that affect the availability of supplies and tools here in the United States. Understanding cultural norms and business practices across the world, and being able to effectively communicate with individuals of different cultural backgrounds will be invaluable to CCCA students.

We believe that IVS program is also consistent with the prevailing policy objectives in California (See, e.g., Global California 2030 plan, https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/ml/documents/globalca2030.pdf ["An Initiative of the CA Department of Education to better equip students for a global economy"]) and the federal government, see, e.g., U.S. Departments of State and Education Joint Statement of Principles in Support of International Education. This statement asserted, “U.S. students … and educators benefit when they engage with peers from around the world, whether overseas or through international education at home.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken remarked that “[i]t’s especially true at the high school level, where the presence of international students in our classrooms benefits American students and schools by promoting cultural curiosity, a global mindset, and mutual

understanding. In addition to helping students develop global competencies, high school exchanges also contribute to a world that is increasingly interconnected...

The technical and compliance aspects of the visa program and placement would operate through a third-party sponsor agency. Sponsor agencies are subject to approval and monitoring by the U.S. Secretary of State for compliance with federal law applicable to international student visitors. Sponsoring agencies facilitate the issuance of a J-1 visa to the international student, and handle all legal and logistical matters related to the student’s arrival, stay, and safety in the United States, and arrange for the international student’s placement at a school in the United States. Sponsors’ specific responsibilities are set forth under federal law, including as follows:

- Sponsors are required to comply with all local, state, federal and professional requirements applicable to the program category and to the activity for which they are designated. Requisite licenses and accreditation are to be current at all times [22 CFR 62.9(c)].
- Sponsors are to appoint adequate staff and support services with appropriate qualifications and training to administer the program in compliance with the Exchange Visitor Program regulations [22 CFR 62.9(f)].
- The sponsor appoints one responsible officer (RO) and alternate responsible officers (ARO) to administer the exchange program under the supervision of the RO. The responsible officer and all alternate responsible officers must be employees or officers of the sponsoring organization, and must be citizens or legal permanent residents of the United States. The RO and ARO must be familiar with current Exchange Visitor Program regulations, and be able to advise and assist program participants as needed, in order to facilitate the successful completion of their programs. Finally, sponsors maintain all program and participant records for a minimum of three years [22 CFR 62.9(g) and 22 CFR 62.11].
- Sponsors devise a method and criteria for selecting participants for their programs. All sponsors, regardless of category, are required to determine 1) the suitability of their program for prospective participants; and 2) that participants have sufficient proficiency in the English language to participate in their programs. In addition, specific regulations pertaining to program categories may define other criteria. [22 CFR 60.10(a)].
- Sponsors must require that all exchange visitors (as well as their accompanying spouses and dependents) have insurance in effect that covers them for sickness or accidents during the time of their exchange visitor program. [22 CFR 62.14].
- Regulations pertaining specifically to orientation (both pre-arrival and arrival) are found at [22 CFR 62.10]. In addition, some categories require additional pre-arrival and/or orientation information to be provided to participants. Program regulations require sponsors to offer appropriate orientation for all exchange visitors and their immediate family. Orientation includes, but is not limited to, the following information:
  - Life and customs in the United States
  - Local community resources (e.g., public transportation, medical centers, schools, libraries, recreation centers and banks), to the extent possible
  - Available health care, emergency assistance, and insurance coverage
  - A description of the program in which the exchange visitor is participating
  - Rules that the exchange visitors are required to follow under the sponsor's program
  - Address of the sponsor and the name and telephone number of the responsible officer
  - Address and telephone number of the Office of Private Sector Exchange of the Department of State

- A copy of the Exchange Visitor Program Welcome Brochure.
  
- Sponsors must provide the following pre-arrival information:
  - The purpose of the Exchange Visitor Program
  - Home-country physical presence requirement
  - Travel and entry into the United States
  - Fees payable to the sponsor
  - Other costs that the exchange visitor will likely incur (e.g., living expenses) while in the United States
  - Health care and insurance
  - Other information which will assist exchange visitors to prepare for their stay in the United States

- Sponsors are required to monitor their participants' welfare and progress to the extent appropriate for the category, and ensure that their activities are consistent with the category indicated on the Form DS-2019. Sponsors are also to require that all exchange visitors keep them apprised of their current addresses and phone numbers of their participants and to maintain this information [22 CFR 62.10(e)]. Sponsors are required to provide all participants with emergency contact information.

- All sponsors are required to submit an annual report, notify the Department of State in writing of certain changes in their program, and of serious problems. In addition, they are to cooperate with any inquiry or investigation taken by the Department of State. Failure to do so may result in the termination. See program regulations found at [22 CFR 62.13] for details regarding a sponsor's accountability to the Department of State, and at [22 CFR Part 62], Subparts D and E for details on Sanctions and Termination.

- Sponsors are required to notify the Department of State promptly by telephone (to be confirmed in writing) of any serious problem or controversy which could be expected to bring the Department of State or the sponsor's program into notoriety or disrepute [22 CFR 62.13(b)].

From the perspective of IVS program students and CCCA administration, IVS program students will participate in CCCA’s programming to the same extent as any other CCCA student, and will be subject to CCCA’s policies and procedures as applicable to any other CCCA student. CCCA's IVS program would operate under the following operational tenets:

- CCCA would accept an international visiting student to participate in CCCA’s programs to the extent that CCCA has excess capacity, e.g., available seats, spaces in classes and programs, materials, and instructional/supervisorial capacity.
- In no circumstance will the operation of the IVS program cause the displacement or loss of capacity to serve California residents who apply to attend CCCA.
- CCCA will accept international visiting students in any academic year only to the extent doing so does not exceed 5% of CCCA's enrollment.
- No international visiting student may visit CCCA under the IVS program for more than one academic year.
- CCCA will not claim apportionment (ADA) for any student participating in the IVS program.
- The IVS program will operate under the direct supervision of the Executive Director who will ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the IVS program and the specific compliance requirements related thereto.
- Each IVS student will be assigned to a certificated employee who will be responsible for regularly checking in on the student to provide ongoing support and assistance to the student as needed.
