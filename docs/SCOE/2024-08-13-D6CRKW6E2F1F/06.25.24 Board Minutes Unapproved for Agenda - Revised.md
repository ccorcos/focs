A. Friends of Sacramento Arts Recognition - Jacqueline White

Assistant Superintendent White introduced Allison Cagley, Executive Director at Friends of Sacramento Arts. Ms. Cagley spoke about the Heroes of Arts event and arts program that was created to honor arts educators. She then introduced the two artists that work in SCOE schools who were recognized this year: Milton Bowens (El Centro Jr./Sr. High School) and Lorenzo McNeal (El Centro Jr./Sr. High School). Dr. L. Steven Winlock was also honored for his support of arts education.

B. Superintendent's Report

Superintendent Gordon reported on the following:

STUDENT EVENTS  
SB 1094, the civics bill authored by Senator Monique Limón, was unanimously approved on June 16, 2024. It passed as amended to be re-referred to the Committee on Appropriations, with the recommendation that it be placed on the Consent Calendar.

On June 18, SCOE hosted its Summer Soiree at the Sacramento State University Alumni Center to celebrate artists and mentors. Thank you Deputy Superintendent Nancy Herota for attending and speaking on behalf of SCOE and thank you Assistant Superintendent White and your team for planning this inaugural event.

Last week, PRO Youth hosted an award ceremony during its Synergy Event during which our own Appointed Board Member Representing Students Judith Marquez was recognized and received the Kathy Hill Hope Award. Congratulations again to Judith! Your acceptance speech touched the hearts of everyone, and inspired students. Board President Lefkovitz was there to help present Judith with this special leadership award.

RECOGNITION AND NEWS  
Starting today, our Early Learning team is hosting a three-day “Joyful Literacy Institute” focused on joyful and evidence-based language and literacy learning for children in PK-1st grade. There will be interactive read-alouds using culturally affirming storybooks designed to support children’s development of oral language, listening and reading comprehension, writing, creative expression, and social-emotional skills. Participants will also learn how to teach and assess foundational literacy skills in joyful and inclusive ways. Minh Lê, author of Drawn Together, will also be joining the group. This work, led by our Executive Director Julie Montali, helps strengthens family-school and program literacy partnerships through a shared understanding of Joyful Literacy techniques and dovetails nicely with our Sacramento County READS literacy initiative.

Earlier this afternoon, we congratulated 50 educational leaders who completed their Preliminary Administrative Services Credential Program. This latest cohort represents 14 districts and five charter schools. Thirty-five of the participants were part of our satellite program in partnership with the Association of CA School Administrators (ACSA) covering Riverside-Ontario-San Bernardino. Twelve participants were from our
