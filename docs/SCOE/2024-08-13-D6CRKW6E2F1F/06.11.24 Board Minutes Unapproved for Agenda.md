RECOGNITION AND NEWS  
On May 30, SCOE hosted a site visit with Congressmember Matsui at Vernon E. Greer Elementary School in Galt for the purpose of showcasing SCOE and the Sacramento County Department of Health Services' Schools as Centers of Wellness program. Congressmember Matsui is a long-time fighter for improving our nation’s mental health care and has stated that she supports the impressive, innovative efforts to address children and youth mental health in our community.

During the month of May, we celebrated our certificated and classified staff with several employee appreciation events. We honored employees who had achieved their 30, 35, and 40+ years of service milestone at a special “Legacy of Dedication” Reception. Throughout the month, employees who reached their 10, 15, 20, and 25 years of service milestones were recognized by their departments and supervisors. They received cards of thanks and a special memento.

On May 29, we brought back our Ice Cream Social with Scoops of Thanks—a favorite SCOE tradition to appreciate our classified school employees. And, to complete our month of certificated and classified employee appreciation and recognition, we held our inaugural retirement dinner, which was a wonderful event with many fun memories shared and celebrated. Thank you Executive Director Xanthi Soriano and your team for leading these events that help our culture evolve and build a sense of belonging.

On June 2, in partnership with the Sacramento River Cats and our sponsor, Schools First Federal Credit Union, we celebrated our 2024 Sacramento County Classified School Employees of the Year at the ballpark.

initiative has informed our work with the Sacramento County READS strategy.

On June 11 and 12, 2024, our own Tami Wilson will be leading a two-day, statewide virtual conference, in collaboration with the California Department of Education, the California State Board of Education, and the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence. The conference will offer a dynamic platform for advancing screening, instruction, and intervention practices and attendees will learn effective ways to teach reading, meet the needs of a range of learners, and address dyslexia and related challenges.

**UPCOMING EVENTS**  
Our sponsored civics bill, SB 1094, was scheduled to be heard in the Assembly tomorrow, June 12.
