This summer, many SCOE departments were involved in providing or taking part in professional learning and preparing for the 2024-2025 school year. In early August, 16 SCOE staff convened for a full day of professional learning centered on inclusion for students with disabilities.

Assistant Superintendents Jackie White and Michael Kast held their “welcome back to school” professional development days for our SCOE schools with more than 260 staff attending. This year’s theme is “Together is Better,” and training focused on building strong Professional Learning Communities and using data to inform instructional practices.

Across the state this summer, reaching 35 counties, 105 districts, and 164 schools, the Computer Science team, led by SCOE Director Jarod Amalong, provided several multi-day regional workshops for teachers, including an intensive Computer Science Week, that attracted more than 720 attendees.

Last week, the Career Pipeline team led by Shanine Coats held a 4-day orientation for 31 interns who will serve as peer specialists and graduate clinical interns in school-based mental health and wellness. They will serve students at elementary, middle, and high school sites county-wide, alongside a licensed clinician.

**RECOGNITION AND NEWS**  
On September 14, 2024, SCOE has been invited by the California School Boards Association to provide three presentations on County Educational Innovations at the 2024 County Board Member Services Conference in Monterey. This year's panels will consist of county board members and staff from Los Angeles, Sacramento, Riverside, and San Diego who will discuss cutting edge innovations. SCOE will provide three presentations, including our Community Schools R-TAC work led by Director Navdeep Purewal.

Associate Superintendent Brent Malicote and Executive Director Chris Williams will present on our partnership with the Sacramento County Department of Health Services (DHS) that has broken ground on an innovative way to augment the outstanding work our school districts do to address student mental health. As you know, we will be placing a mental health clinician in every school in the county to work within a continuum of care at the school site and thus transforming the schools into “Centers of Wellness”.

Director Mai Xi Lee will lead a third presentation entitled, “CalHOPE Student Support: Growing Our Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) Garden.”
