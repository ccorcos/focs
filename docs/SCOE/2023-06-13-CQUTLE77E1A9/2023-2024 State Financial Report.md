## CRITERIA AND STANDARDS

1. **CRITERION: Average Daily Attendance**
   - **STANDARD:** Projected County Operations Grant average daily attendance (ADA) has not been overestimated in 1) the first prior fiscal year OR in 2) two or more of the previous three fiscal years by more than the following percentage levels:
     - **Percentage Level** | **County Operations Grant ADA**
       - 3.0% | 0 to 6,999
       - 2.0% | 7,000 to 59,999
       - 1.0% | 60,000 and over
   - County Office ADA (Form A, Estimated Funded ADA column, Line B5): 224,900
   - County Office County Operations Grant ADA Standard Percentage Level: 1.00%

### 1A. Calculating the County Office's County Operations Grant ADA Variances

**DATA ENTRY:** Enter the County Operations Grant Funded ADA in the Original Budget column for all fiscal years. All other data are extracted or calculated.

| Fiscal Year | County Operations Grant Funded ADA | Original Budget (Form A, Line B5) | Estimated/Unaudited Actuals | ADA Variance Level (If Budget is greater) | Status |
|-------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------|
| Third Prior Year (2020-21) | 232,678.44 | 237,515.31 | N/A | Actuals, else N/A | Met |

### 1A-2. Comparison of County Office County Operations Grant ADA to the Standard

**DATA ENTRY:** Enter an explanation if the standard is not met.

1a. **STANDARD NOT MET** - Projected County Operations Grant ADA was estimated above the standard for the first prior year. Provide reasons for the overestimate, a description of the methods and assumptions used in projecting ADA, and what changes will be made to improve the accuracy of projections in this area.
   - **Explanation:** Declining enrollment across the county (required if NOT met)

1b. **STANDARD NOT MET** - Projected County Operations Grant ADA was estimated above the standard for two or more of the previous three years. Provide reasons for the overestimate, a description of the methods and assumptions used in projecting ADA, and what changes will be made to improve the accuracy of projections in this area.
   - **Explanation:** Declining enrollment across the county (required if NOT met)

### 2. CRITERION: LCFF Revenue
**STANDARD:** Projected local funding formula (LCFF) revenue for any of the budget year or two subsequent fiscal years has not changed from the prior fiscal year by more than the change in population, plus the county office’s gap funding or its cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) plus or minus one percent.

* County offices that are already at or above their LCFF target funding level receive no gap funding. These county offices have a COLA applied to their LCFF target, but their year-over-year revenue increase might be less than the statutory COLA due to certain local factors and components of the funding formula.

### 2A. County Office's LCFF Revenue Standard
**Indicate which standard applies:**
- LCFF Revenue
- Excess Property Tax/Minimum State Aid

The County office must select which LCFF revenue standard applies.
**LCFF Revenue Standard selected:** LCFF Revenue

### 2A-1. Calculating the County Office's LCFF Revenue Standard
**DATA ENTRY:** Section 1, enter applicable data for all fiscal years. Section 1-a is completed by a county office funded at Hold Harmless. Per AB 181, Chapter 52, Statutes of 2022, hold harmless codes include a COLA add-on. Section 1-b, enter the projected County Operations Grant for all fiscal years and Section 1-c, enter the projected Alternative Education Grant for all fiscal years. Section III, all data are extracted or calculated. Section IV, enter data in Step 1a for the two subsequent fiscal years. Step 2b1 for all fiscal years, and Step 2b3 for current year only. All other data are extracted or calculated.

**Projected LCFF Revenue**

**Select County Office's LCFF revenue funding status:**

| Status: | Hold Harmless |
|---------|---------------|
| At Target | If status is at target, then COLA amount in Step 2b2 is used in Step 2c in Sections II and III. |
| Hold Harmless | If status is hold harmless, then amount in Step 2c is zero in Sections II and III. |

### I. LCFF Funding
