Members of the County Board of Education shall be entitled to receive compensation, as provided by Education Code section 1090, to be prorated when members fail to attend any regular or special meeting during that month. A Board member may be compensated for any meeting for which he/she is absent if the Board by resolution duly adopted and included within its minutes find that at the time of the meeting, he or she was either:  
A. performing services outside the meeting on behalf of the board, or;  
B. was ill or on jury duty; or;  
C. the absence was due to a hardship deemed acceptable by the board.  

No member shall receive additional compensation, as provided by Education Code section 1090, for attending meetings in any one month.  

On an annual basis, the Board may increase the compensation of board members, in an amount not to exceed 5 percent based on the present monthly rate of compensation. Any increase shall be effective upon the date approved by the Board. The Boardâ€™s action may be rejected by a majority of Sacramento County voters in a referendum established for that purpose.  

Any member not desiring to be fully or partially compensated shall file a written statement with the Secretary of the County Board of Education indicating nonacceptance of payment for serving as a County Board of Education member.  

County Board of Education members will receive a benefit allowance, not to exceed the fringe benefit allowance provided to SCOE management personnel, which members may use for SCOE health, dental, vision, and/or life insurance benefit coverage.
