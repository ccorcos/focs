# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

**Board of Education**  
Sacramento County Office of Education  
Sacramento, California  

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements**

**Adverse and Unmodified Opinions**

We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Sacramento County Office of Education (the “County Office”), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the County Office’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents.

## Summary of Opinions

| Opinion Unit                     | Type of Opinion |
|----------------------------------|------------------|
| Governmental Activities          | Unmodified        |
| Governmental Funds               | Unmodified        |
| Fiduciary Funds                  | Adverse           |
| Aggregate Remaining Fund Information | Unmodified    |

**Unmodified Opinions on Governmental Activities, Each Major Fund, and Aggregate Remaining Fund Information**

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the Sacramento County Office, as of June 30, 2023, and the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Adverse Opinion on Fiduciary Funds**

In our opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the Basis for Adverse and Unmodified Opinions section of the report, the accompanying financial statements do not present fairly the financial position of Sacramento County Office of Education, as of June 30, 2023, or the changes in financial position for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Basis for Adverse and Unmodified Opinions**

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing.

![Standards (GAS), issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of Sacramento County Office of Education and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit.

## Matter Giving Rise to Adverse Opinion on Fiduciary Funds

The Payroll Clearing fund is used to administer the payroll of the districts within the county. The fund should net to zero, where administered funds transferred in equal payroll and related expenses paid out. There could be times where there are amounts due to and due from outside districts. As of June 30, 2023, the fund shows a deficit of $26,731,483 in aggregate. This deficit indicates that there is significant doubt that the assets, liabilities, and net position are fairly stated, and give rise to this adverse opinion.

## Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements

The County Office’s management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the County Office’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter.

## Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of County Office’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.
<!-- Page 6 -->
- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the County Office’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control–related matters that we identified during the audit.

**Required Supplementary Information**

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance-Budget (Non-GAAP) and Actual – County School Service Fund, Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance-Budget (Non-GAAP) and Actual – Special Education Pass-through Fund, Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in the Net OPEB Liability/(Asset) and Related Ratios, Schedule of OPEB Contributions, Schedule of Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability, and Schedule of Pension Contributions be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

**Supplementary Information**

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the County Office’s basic financial statements. The supplementary information as listed in the table of contents are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements.

The supplementary information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the supplementary information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

![Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards](attachment://image.png)

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated March 27, 2024, on our consideration of County Office’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering County Office’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

# MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
<!-- Page 9 -->
# SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION  
## MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
### JUNE 30, 2023  

The Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of the audit report is management’s view of the Sacramento County Office of Education’s (“County Office”) financial condition and provides an opportunity to present important fiscal information to the County Board of Education and the public. This document is designed to enhance the understandability and usefulness of the audited financial statements for all users.  

## FINANCIAL REPORTS  
At specific reporting periods during the year, the County Office prepares and presents budget revisions and interim financial reports for County Board of Education and public review. These documents represent changes to the County Office’s budgeted receipts and expenditures since the July 1st adoption of the County School Services Fund budget and present the most accurate information available at the time.  

Alternatively, the Management’s Discussion and Analysis and annual audit report include several financial reports that present actual receipts and expenditures and year-end balances at the close of the fiscal year using the accrual basis of accounting. In addition to the basic Governmental Fund financial statements that comprise the Unaudited Actuals report, two government-wide financial statements are included in the audit report: the Government-Wide Statement of Net Position, which reports financial condition at the end of the year, and the Government-Wide Statement of Activities, which reports activity during the year. These two statements present a longer-term view of the County Office’s finances. All statements are described below.  

### Governmental Fund Financial Statements  
County Office fund financial statements report operations using the modified accrual basis of accounting. As of 6/30/23, the County Office reported combined fund balances of $132,678,242 in all governmental funds, which represents a net increase of $13,300,320 from the prior year resulting from increases to general County Office operations as follows: Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) revenue; LCFF System of Support funding; Covid Relief Funding; interest earned on County Office cash balances; and other miscellaneous funding sources.  

### Government-Wide Statement of Net Position  
The County Office’s Government-Wide Statement of Net Position includes the following information that the Governmental Funds Balance Sheet does not present: capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation; long-term liabilities, including Net Pension Liability and OPEB Liability; and Deferred Outflows and Inflows related to Net Pension Liability and OPEB. Further, amounts due to or from other County Office governmental funds are eliminated. Detail is provided in the supporting footnotes.  

The following table summarizes Governmental ending balances for the past two years:  

| Balance at          | June 30, 2023 | Balance at June 30, 2022 |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Total Assets        | $204,495,246   | $180,890,390              |
| Deferred Outflows   | $55,500,199    | $52,889,226               |
| Total Liabilities    | $152,095,157   | $88,983,894               |
| Deferred Inflows    | $34,772,472    | $59,221,697               |
| Total Net Position  | $73,127,816    | $85,664,025               |
<!-- Page 10 -->
# SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION  
## MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
### JUNE 30, 2023  

Net Position is significantly affected by Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) 68 and GASB 75, as explained below:  
- GASB 68 requires that the County Office calculate and report our proportionate share of Net Pension Liability, Deferred Outflow/Deferred Inflow of resources, and Pension Expenses related to our defined benefit pension plan. This increases the County Office’s proportionate share of the Net Pension Liability by $40,819,677. The increase in Net Pension Liability was the single most significant cause of the change in Net Position.  
- GASB 75 requires that the County Office calculate and report the full value of our Other Post-employment (Health) Benefit (OPEB) Liability and Deferred Outflow/Deferred Inflow of resources. This results in an increase to Net OPEB Liability of $12,165,527. As of 6/30/23, the County Office reports a Net OPEB Liability of $5,946,338.  
- The increase in Net Pension Liability and increase in Net OPEB Liability contributed to a net decrease in Total Liabilities and a decrease in Net Position, as reflected in the summary table.  
- Deferred Outflows and Deferred Inflows of resources pertaining to Net Pension and OPEB Liabilities represent expenses to be recognized in future years. All such activity reduced Net Position and ending balances are separately stated in the summary table.  

In addition to the effects of GASB 68 and GASB 75, Net Position was affected by adjustments to other long-term debt, net depreciation of fixed assets, and timing differences in the receipt of revenues and payment of expenditures that affect assets and liabilities. These combined factors result in a decrease in the County Office’s Net Position.  

### Government-Wide Statement of Activities  
The County Office’s Government-Wide Statement of Activities differs from the Governmental Funds Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance because the Statement of Activities reports all expenses by their function rather than the expense category. Each function combines related County Office operational activities. Further, the Statement of Activities is adjusted for debt repayment, payments of post-employment benefits to retirees, the difference between actuarially determined and actual Pension and OPEB costs, changes in compensated absences, and net capital outlay expenditures.  

The following table summarizes Governmental activity during the past two years:  

| For the Year Ended | June 30, 2023 | June 30, 2022 |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Program Revenues   | $120,240,813   | $112,132,793   |
| General Revenues   | $67,259,180    | $57,735,856    |
| Expenses           | ($200,036,202) | ($141,684,779) |
| Change in Net Position | ($12,536,209) | $28,183,870    |
| Net Position, beginning | $85,664,025    | $57,480,155    |
| Net Position, ending | $73,127,816    | $85,664,025    |
<!-- Page 11 -->
# SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION  
## MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
### JUNE 30, 2023  

The chart below summarizes the County Office’s expenditures by classification during fiscal year 2022-2023:

### Expenditures by Classification, FY 2022-23
- **Debt Service**: 0%
- **Certificated Salaries**: 15%
- **Classified Salaries**: 21%
- **Employee Benefits**: 16%
- **Services & Other Operating Expenditures**: 27%
- **Books and Supplies**: 2%
- **Capital Outlay**: 1%
- **Other Outgo & Transfers**: 18%

### Composition of Revenues
In the fiscal year 2022-23 budget, the composition of revenues was predominantly from restricted Federal, State, and Local sources, making up about 71% of the total, in contrast to the 29% that was unrestricted. Restricted revenues are funds that are designated for specific purposes by external sources, such as grants or specific government allocations, and cannot be used for general operating expenses. Unrestricted revenues are funds that the organization can use at its discretion for any lawful purpose. This distinction highlights the importance of maintaining significant unrestricted reserves. Such reserves are vital for continued financial stability and flexibility, allowing the County Office to manage unexpected expenses or revenue shortfalls effectively. Robust reserves are not just a matter of prudent financial management; they are critical for ensuring long-term operational sustainability, especially when restricted funds are bound by stringent regulations or commitments that limit their application to general or unforeseen needs.

## PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS  
The County Office provides direct instruction to students in the community through a variety of programs. These programs comprise approximately 21% of the County Office budget. The following represents the highlights of these programs:

### Special Education  
The Special Education Department offers a range of services to students with various disabilities, including physical, communicative, learning, and emotional challenges. These services encompass direct instruction, resource specialist support, and specialized assistance such as speech, vision, nursing, and mobility services. Our programs, spanning academics, daily living skills, transition skills, and career preparation, are distributed across numerous campuses in Sacramento County, including Juvenile Court and Community School sites. Additionally, the Infant Development Program provides comprehensive early intervention services to infants and toddlers, along with their families. These services integrate aspects like occupational therapy, social-emotional development, and coordinated service planning into the families’ daily routines, ensuring a holistic approach to each child’s development.

### Juvenile Court School  
The Juvenile Court School program provides academic, career technical educational, and academic intervention services to over 100 students who are detained at the Youth Detention Facility operated by the Sacramento County Probation Department. The Juvenile Court School program prepares students for transition back to their school of residence, employment, and/or post-secondary education.

### Community Schools: Community School, Senior Extension, and Community Action for Responsive Education (CARE)  
The Community School program provides educational alternatives for students who have been expelled or are not currently enrolled in local school districts, with programs located across three campuses in Sacramento County. This program focuses on academic instruction, career technical education, and behavior modification.

aiming to prepare students for their return to regular schools, graduation, HiSET (high school equivalency exam) completion, or further education.  
The County Office also operates a growing Senior Extension program within the Community School framework, targeting students at risk of dropping out or who have already left school. This program, mainly serving students aged 18 or older, offers personalized education plans across these campuses, allowing them to balance independent study with work and family commitments. This approach facilitates the earning of credits necessary for graduation or postsecondary transition.  

The CARE program, a collaboration between the County Office and local schools, offers customized education and behavioral support in small classes, covering core subjects, study skills, electives, and extracurriculars. It includes enrichment, parenting support, mentoring, and tutoring, helping students develop the academic, behavioral, and social skills necessary for success in traditional schooling. Participation in the CARE program equips students with essential academic, behavioral, and social skills to succeed in a traditional school environment.  

### Sly Park  
Sly Park Center, a residential outdoor science program, offers immersive educational experiences in environmental studies to elementary students from Sacramento and Northern California. The center provides a range of options, including multi-day residential programs and day trips during the school year, along with virtual lessons and single-day field trips to green spaces. Besides serving students, Sly Park also welcomes various student and adult conference groups in the summer. All its services align with the Next Generation Science Standards, California’s Environmental Principles and Concepts, and emphasize social-emotional learning.  

### Special Programs  
In addition to the above services and programs, the County Office administers over 200 special programs, services and grants that serve adults and students in Sacramento County, neighboring counties and, in some cases, throughout the state of California. Adults and students are served in many capacities, such as through technology support, training and evaluation services, pupil services and instructional support. These programs are often administered in cooperation with state and federal governments and must adhere to their fiscal requirements. These special programs, services and grants comprise approximately 79% of the County Office’s budget. These programs include, but are not limited to, the following:  

### School-Based Mental Health  
The School-Based Mental Health program aims to enhance student mental health and wellness through collaboration with school districts. By placing a County Office mental health professional in schools and fostering a comprehensive understanding of the school-community-care continuum among all adults, the County Office seeks to address students' mental health needs effectively. The vision is to unite education and health systems, forming a care continuum to prevent issues like the school-to-prison pipeline and mitigate mental health disorders' impact. This initiative involves collaboration with the Sacramento County Department of Health Services, Medi-Cal partners, schools, districts, students, and families, targeting shared goals for substantial, enduring change. The primary objectives include improved academic achievement, reduced suspensions and chronic absenteeism, decreased special education referrals, enhanced early intervention, and increased early identification of mental health issues, aiming for a proactive approach to student wellness.  

### Adult Education  
The California Adult Education Program (CAEP) and the Outreach and Technical Assistance Network

### School of Education  
The County Office’s School of Education Department, with its Teaching and Leading divisions, offers professional learning for teachers and leaders. The Teaching division includes programs like Teacher Intern, Teacher Induction, and Bilingual Teacher Professional Development, focusing on alternative teaching pathways and bilingual education.

### CAPITAL ASSETS  
The County Office accounts for the purchase value of capital assets and includes these values as part of the financial statements. In addition to purchasing equipment during the year, the County Office incurred the following construction-related costs: Security camera system upgrades; facility, safety, and infrastructure improvements at Sky Park; AV system upgrades at the David P. Meany Education Center; flooring and HVAC system upgrades at various sites; and pest exclusion for various sites. The County Office is reporting net capital assets of $32,089,049 as of 6/30/23, represented as follows: $59,190,488 in Land and Building components, $7,074,787 in Equipment and $34,176,226 in accumulated depreciation. Detailed balances by asset and depreciation expense category are provided in the supporting footnotes.  

### LONG-TERM DEBT

Detailed balances and future payment information are provided in the supporting footnotes.  

### COUNTY SCHOOL SERVICE FUND BUDGETARY HIGHLIGHTS  
The County Office’s budget is prepared in accordance with California law and is based on the modified accrual basis of accounting. As indicated earlier in this document, under “Financial Reports”, the original budget is adopted by July 1 and the County Office revises its budget at First and Second Interim and one more time in the Spring to establish beginning balances for the following year.  

### ECONOMIC FACTORS BEARING ON THE COUNTY OFFICE’S FUTURE  
- The County Office has always taken an entrepreneurial approach in pursuing grants and contracts for our agency. We work with various entities in our region and throughout the State of California to secure funding for programs that benefit our particular population.  
- At the same time, we follow a conservative budgeting approach. It is our practice to budget for and spend under a grant or contract after we receive confirmation of funding. Once funding is secured, we are prudent in our hiring and spending.  
- Each funding source is self-supporting, and most departments maintain adequate reserves for the future. In our general programs, we maintain a fund balance well in excess of the required minimum.  
- These sound budgeting practices keep the County Office financially healthy and allow us to be prepared for the next economic downturn.  

### CONTACTING THE COUNTY OFFICE’S FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

### GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS

### JUNE 30, 2023

Total net change in fund balances - governmental funds  $ 13,300,320

Unmatured interest owing at the end of the period, less matured interest paid during the period but owing from the prior period was:

- 3,733

**Pensions:** In governmental funds, pension costs are recognized when employer contributions are made, in the statement of activities pension costs are recognized on the accrual basis. This year, the difference between accrual-basis pension costs and actual employer contributions was:

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023  

1. **SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**  

   A. **HISTORY OF THE ORGANIZATION**  
   The Sacramento County Office of Education (the "County Office") is a public educational agency operating under the applicable laws and regulations of the State of California. It is governed by a seven-member Governing Board elected by registered voters of the County Office. Each Board member represents an “area”, which comprises several local communities within Sacramento County. The County Office is situated in one of the areas and serves students in kindergarten through grade twelve and adults, as well as infants in some Special Education programs.  

   B. **REPORTING ENTITY**  
   The County Superintendent of Schools and County Board of Education have governance responsibilities over the activities related to public school education conducted by the County Office. The Board is not included in any other governmental "reporting entity" as defined by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board since Board members have decision-making authority, the power to designate management, the responsibility to significantly influence operations and primary accountability for fiscal matters.  

   The County's Board of Education formed a non-profit public benefit corporation known as the Schools Projects Financing Corporation of Sacramento County ("Corporation"). The County Office and the Corporation have a financial and operational relationship which meet the reporting entity definition criteria of Codification of Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards, Section 2100, for inclusion of the Corporation as a blended component unit of the County Office. Therefore, the financial activities of the Corporation have been included in the financial statements of the County Office as a blended component unit.  

   The following are those aspects of the relationship between the County Office and the Corporation which satisfy Codification of Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards, Section 2100, as amended by criteria:  

   **Manifestations of Oversight**  
   The Corporation's Board of Directors is the County's Board of Education.  

   The Corporation has no employees. The County Office's Superintendent and Associate Superintendent, Business Services function as agents of the Corporation. The individuals did not receive additional compensation for work performed in this capacity.  

   The County Office exercises significant influence over operations of the Corporation as it is anticipated that the County Office will be the sole lessee of all facilities owned by the Corporation.  

   **Accounting for Fiscal Matters**  
   All major financing arrangements, contracts, and other transactions of the Corporation must have the consent of the County Office.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

---

### B. REPORTING ENTITY (CONTINUED)

**Accounting for Fiscal Matters (continued)**  
Any deficits incurred by the Corporation will be reflected in the lease payments of the County Office. Any surpluses of the Corporation revert to the County Office at the end of the lease period.

It is anticipated that the County Office's lease payments will be the sole revenue source of the Corporation.

The County Office has assumed a "moral obligation," and potentially a legal obligation, for any debt incurred by the Corporation.

**Scope of Public Service and Financial Presentation**  
The Corporation was created for the sole purpose of financially assisting the County Office.

The Corporation is a nonprofit, public benefit corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of California and recorded by the Secretary of State. The Corporation was formed to provide financing assistance to the County Office for construction and acquisition of major capital facilities. Upon completion, the County Office intends to occupy all Corporation facilities. When the Corporation's Refunding lease-purchase agreements have been paid, title to all Corporation property will pass to the County Office for no additional consideration.

The Corporation's financial activity is presented in the financial statements in the County School Service Fund. Refunding lease purchase agreements issued by the Corporation are included in the long-term liabilities.

### C. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The County Office accounts for its financial transactions in accordance with the policies and procedures of the California Department of Education's California School Accounting Manual. The accounting policies of the County Office conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. The following is a summary of the more significant policies:

### D. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

**Financial Statements**  
The basic financial statements include financial statements prepared using full accrual accounting for all of the County Office's activities, including infrastructure, and a focus on the major funds.

**Government-Wide Financial Statements**  
The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities displays information about the reporting government as a whole. Fiduciary funds are not included in the government-wide financial statements. Fiduciary funds are reported only in the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position at the fund financial statement level.

# SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION  
## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023  

D. BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED)  

The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities are prepared using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues, expenses, gains, losses, assets and liabilities resulting from exchange and exchange-like transactions are recognized when the exchange takes place. Revenues, expenses, gains, losses, assets and liabilities resulting from non-exchange transactions are recognized in accordance with the requirements of Governmental Accounting Standards Board Codification Section (GASB Cod. Sec.) N50.118-.121.  

**Program revenues:** Program revenues included in the Statement of Activities derive directly from the program itself or from parties outside the County Office's taxpayers or citizenry, as a whole; program revenues reduce the cost of the function to be financed from the County Office's general revenues.  

**Allocation of indirect expenses:** The County Office reports all direct expenses by function in the Statement of Activities. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a function. Depreciation expense is specifically identified by function and is included the direct expense of each function. Interest on long-term liabilities is considered an indirect expense and is reported separately on the Statement of Activities.  

The government-wide statement of activities presents a comparison between expenses, both direct and indirect, of the County Office and for each governmental function, and excludes fiduciary activity. Direct expenses are those that are specifically associated with a service, program, or department and are, therefore, clearly identifiable to a particular function. The County Office does not allocate indirect expenses to functions in the Statement of Activities. Program revenues include charges paid by the recipients of the goods or services offered by the programs and grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular program. Revenues that are not classified as program revenues are presented as general revenues. The comparison of program revenues and expenses identifies the extent to which each program or business segment is self-financing or draws from the general revenues of the County Office. Eliminations have been made to minimize the double counting of internal activities.  

Net position should be reported as restricted when constraints placed on net position use are either externally imposed by creditors (such as through debt covenants), grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments or imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. The net position restricted for other activities results from special revenue funds and the restrictions on their net asset use.  

**Fund Financial Statements**  
Fund financial statements report detailed information about the County Office. The focus of governmental and proprietary fund financial statements is on major funds rather than reporting funds by type. Each major fund is presented in a separate column. Non-major funds are aggregated and presented in a single column.

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

### FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023

#### D. BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED)

**Governmental Funds**

All governmental funds are accounted for using the flow of current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. With this measurement focus, only current assets and current liabilities generally are included on the balance sheet. The statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balance reports on the sources (revenues and other financing sources) and uses (expenditures and other financing uses) of current financial resources. This approach differs from the manner in which the governmental activities of the government-wide financial statements are prepared. Governmental fund financial statements, therefore, include reconciliations with brief explanations to better identify the relationship between the government-wide financial statements, prepared using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, and the governmental fund financial statements, prepared using the flow of current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting.

#### E. MEASUREMENT FOCUS AND BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures are recognized in the accounts and reported in the financial statements.

**Accrual**  
Government-wide financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred.

**Modified Accrual**  
The governmental fund financial statements are presented on the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under the modified accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recorded when susceptible to accrual; i.e., both measurable and available. "Available" means collectible within the current period or within 60 days after year-end. Expenditures are generally recognized under the modified accrual basis of accounting when the related liability is incurred. The exception to this general rule is that principal and interest on general obligation long-term liabilities, if any, is recognized when due.

**Revenues (Exchange and Non-Exchange Transactions)**  
Revenue resulting from exchange transactions, in which each party gives and receives essentially equal value, is recorded on the accrual basis when the exchange takes place. On a modified accrual basis, revenue is recorded in the fiscal year in which the resources are measurable and become available. Available means that the resources will be collected within the current fiscal year, or are expected to be collected soon enough thereafter, to be used to pay liabilities of the current fiscal year. Generally, available is defined as collectible within 45 to 60 days. However, to achieve comparability of reporting among California districts and so as not to distort normal revenue patterns, with specific respect to reimbursement grants and corrections to State-aid apportionments, the California Department of Education has defined available for districts as collectible within one year. The following revenue sources are considered to be both measurable and available at fiscal year-end: Local Control Funding Formula, interest, certain grants, and other local sources.

# SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

### FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023

### E. MEASUREMENT FOCUS AND BASIS OF ACCOUNTING (CONTINUED)

**Revenues (Exchange and Non-Exchange Transactions) (Continued)**  
Non-exchange transactions, in which the County Office receives value without directly giving equal value in return, include property taxes, certain grants, entitlements, and donations. Revenue from property taxes is recognized in the fiscal year in which the taxes are received. Revenue from certain grants, entitlements, and donations is recognized in the fiscal year in which all eligibility requirements have been satisfied. Eligibility requirements include time and purpose restrictions. On a modified accrual basis, revenue from non-exchange transactions must also be available before it can be recognized.

**Expenses/Expenditures**  
On the accrual basis of accounting, expenses are recognized at the time they are incurred. The measurement focus of governmental fund accounting is on decreases in net financial resources (expenditures) rather than expenses. Expenditures are generally recognized in the accounting period in which the related fund liability is incurred, if measurable. Principal and interest on long-term obligations, which has not matured, are recognized when paid in the governmental funds. Allocations of costs, such as depreciation and amortization, are not recognized in the governmental funds.

### F. FUND ACCOUNTING

The accounts of the County Office are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered to be a separate accounting entity. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a separate set of self-balancing accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund equity, revenues, and expenditures or expenses, as appropriate. The County Office resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the purpose for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled.

**Major Governmental Funds**

The County School Service Fund is the general operating fund of the County Office and accounts for all revenues and expenditures of the County Office not encompassed within other funds. All general tax revenues and other receipts that are not allocated by law or contractual agreement to some other fund are accounted for in this fund. General operating expenditures and the capital improvement expenditures that are not paid through other funds are paid from the County School Service Fund. For financial reporting purposes, the current year activity and year-end balances of the Special Reserve Fund for Other Than Capital Outlay Projects and the Special Reserve Fund for Postemployment Benefits Fund are combined with the County School Service Fund.

The Special Education Pass-Through Fund is used to account for pass-through of revenues to member Local Educational Agencies of the Special Education Local Plan Area.

The Adult Education Fund is used to account for revenues received and expenditures made to operate the County Office's adult education program.

### F. FUND ACCOUNTING (CONTINUED)

**Non-Major Governmental Funds**

The Child Development Fund is used to account for the proceeds of revenue sources that are legally restricted to expenditures related to early learning.

Capital Project Funds are used to account for resources used for the acquisition or construction of major capital facilities and equipment. This includes the Capital Facilities Fund.

- The Capital Facilities Fund is used to account for proceeds from various redevelopment projects that fund facility-related projects serving the needs of the community.
- The County School Facilities Fund is used to account for the proceeds of revenue sources that are legally restricted to expenditures related to school site modernization.

**Fiduciary Fund**

Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government. The County Office maintains two Custodial Funds and one Private-Purpose Trust Fund.

The Private-Purpose Trust Funds are used to account for assets held by the County Office as trustee. The County Office maintains a Student Scholarship and Loan Fund to assist students and graduates with post-secondary tuition, fees, and other expenses; and holds funds collected through donation in trust until they are disbursed to recipients pursuant to the rules and protocols established by the scholarship committee.

Custodial Funds generally should report fiduciary activities that are not held in a trust or equivalent arrangement that meets specific criteria. The County Office maintains a Payroll-Clearing Fund which is used primarily to account separately for amounts collected from employees for federal taxes, state taxes, credit unions, and other contributions, as well as funds held for commercial and other trust activities for all school districts in the county.

### G. BUDGETS AND BUDGETARY ACCOUNTING

### H. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The County Office’s cash and cash equivalents are considered to be cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Cash equivalents also include cash with county treasury balances for purposes of the statement of cash flows.

### I. RECEIVABLES

Receivables are made up principally of amounts due from the State of California for Local Control Funding Formula and Categorical programs. The County Office has determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts was needed as of June 30, 2023.

### J. PREPAID EXPENDITURES

The County Office has the option of reporting expenditures for prepaid items in governmental funds either when paid or during the benefiting period. The County Office has chosen to report the expenditures during the benefiting period.

### K. CAPITAL ASSETS AND DEPRECIATION

Capital assets purchased or acquired, with an original cost of $5,000 or more, are recorded at historical cost or estimated historical cost. Contributed assets are reported at fair market value as of the date received. Additions, improvements, and other capital outlay that significantly extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Other costs incurred for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Capital assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over 5 - 30 years depending on asset types.

### L. DEFERRED OUTFLOWS/INFLOWS OF RESOURCES

In addition to assets, the statement of net position includes a separate section for deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred outflows of resources, represents a consumption of net position that applies to a future period(s), and as such will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditures) until then.

In addition to liabilities, the statement of net position includes a separate section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred inflows of resources, represents an acquisition of net position that applies to a future period(s) and as such, will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time.

### M. INTERFUND BALANCES

Interfund activity is reported as either loans, services provided, reimbursements or transfers. Loans are reported as interfund receivables and payables as appropriate and are subject to elimination upon consolidation. Services provided, deemed to be at market or near market rates, are treated as revenues and expenditures/expenses. Reimbursements are when one fund incurs at cost, charges the appropriate benefiting fund and reduces its related cost as a reimbursement. All other interfund transactions are treated as transfers.

N. **COMPENSATED ABSENCES**  
Compensated absences benefits totaling $1,970,366 are recorded as a liability of the County Office. The liability is for earned but unused benefits.

O. **ACCUMULATED SICK LEAVE**  
Sick leave benefits are accumulated for each employee. The employees do not gain a vested right to accumulated sick leave. Accumulated employee sick leave benefits are not recognized as liabilities of the County Office since cash payment of such benefits is not probable. Therefore, sick leave benefits are recorded as expenditures in the period that sick leave is taken.

P. **ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS**  
All payables, accrued liabilities, and long-term obligations are reported in the government-wide and/or governmental fund financial statements. Governmental fund payables and accrued liabilities that will be paid form current financial resources are reported as liabilities in the governmental funds balance sheet. In addition to these payables and accrued liabilities, the debt associated with compensated absences, lease-purchase agreements and other long-term obligations are reported as liabilities on the government-wide statement of net position.

Q. **UNEARNED REVENUE**  
Revenue from federal, state and local special projects and programs is recognized when qualified expenditures have been incurred. Funds received but not earned are recorded as unearned revenue until earned.

R. **FUND BALANCE – GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS**  
Governmental Accounting Standards Board Codification Sections 1300 and 1800, Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions (GASB Cod. Sec. 1300 and 1800) implements a five-tier fund balance classification hierarchy that depicts the extent to which a government is bound by spending constraints imposed on the use of its resources. The five classifications, discussed in more detail below, are nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned and unassigned.

- **Nonspendable Fund Balance** reflects amounts that are not in spendable form, such as revolving fund cash and prepaid expenditures.

- **Restricted Fund Balance** reflects amounts subject to externally imposed and legally enforceable constraints. Such constraints may be imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments, or may be imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. These are the same restrictions used to determine restricted net position as reported in the government-wide and fiduciary trust fund statements.

# SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

### FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023

### R. FUND BALANCE – GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS (CONTINUED)

Committed Fund Balance classification reflects amounts subject to internal constraints self-imposed by formal action of the County Office. The constraints giving rise to committed fund balance must be imposed no later than the end of the reporting period. The actual amounts may be determined subsequent to that date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Formal action by the County Office is required to remove any commitment from any fund balance. At June 30, 2023, the County Office had no committed fund balances.

Assigned Fund Balance reflects amounts that the County Office has approved to be used for specific purposes, based on the County Office's intent related to those specific purposes. The County Office can designate personnel with the authority to assign fund balances. The Associate Superintendent Business Services has the authority to assign fund balances as of June 30, 2023.

Unassigned Fund Balance represents the residual classification for the government's general fund and includes all spendable amounts not contained in the other classifications.

In the County School Service Fund only, the unassigned fund balance classification reflects the residual balance that has not been assigned to other funds and that is not restricted, committed, or assigned to specific purposes.

In any fund other than the County School Service Fund, a positive unassigned fund balance is never reported because amounts in any other fund are assumed to have been assigned, at least, to the purpose of that fund. However, deficits in any fund, including the County School Service Fund that cannot be eliminated by reducing or eliminating amounts assigned to other purposes are reported as negative unassigned fund balance.

**Fund Balance Policy**

The County Office has an expenditure policy relating to fund balances. For purposes of fund balance classifications, expenditures are to be spent from restricted fund balances first, followed in order by committed fund balances (if any), assigned fund balances and lastly unassigned fund balances.

While GASB Cod. Sec. 1300 and 1800 do not require county offices of education to establish a minimum fund balance policy or a stabilization arrangement, GASB Cod. Sec. 1300 and 1800 do require the disclosure of a minimum fund balance policy and stabilization arrangements, if they have been adopted by the County Office. At June 30, 2023, the County Office has not established a minimum fund balance policy nor has it established a stabilization arrangement.

### S. NET POSITION

Net position represents the difference between assets and liabilities. Net position is reported as restricted when there are limitations imposed on their use either through enabling legislation adopted by the County Office or through external restrictions imposed by creditors, grantors, or laws and regulations of other governments. The County Office first applies restricted resources when an expense is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted net position are available.

# SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

### FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023

### S. NET POSITION (CONTINUED)

**Restricted Net Position**

Restrictions of the ending net position indicate the portions of net position not appropriable for expenditure or amounts legally segregated for a specific future use. The restriction for legally restricted program activities is restricted for expenditures only in those particular programs. These amounts are not available for appropriation and expenditure at the balance sheet date. The restrictions for capital projects represent the portions of net position the County Office plans to expend in the future on capital projects. The restriction for retiree benefits represents the portion of net position the County Office has set aside for future payment of retiree benefits. It is the County Office's policy to use restricted net position first when allowable expenditures are incurred.

### T. PROPERTY TAX

Secured property taxes are attached as an enforceable lien on property as of March 1. Taxes are due in two installments on or before December 10 and April 10. Unsecured property taxes are due in one installment on or before August 31. The County of Sacramento bills and collects taxes for the County Office. Tax revenues are recognized by the County Office when received.

### U. ELIMINATIONS AND RECLASSIFICATIONS

In the process of aggregating data for the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities, some amounts reported as interfund activity and balances in the funds were eliminated or reclassified. Interfund receivables and payables were eliminated to minimize the "grossing up" effect on assets and liabilities within the governmental activities column.

### V. ENCUMBRANCES

Encumbrance accounting is used in all budgeted funds to reserve portions of applicable appropriations for which commitments have been made. Encumbrances are recorded for purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments when they are written. Encumbrances are liquidated when the commitments are paid. All encumbrances are liquidated at June 30.

### W. USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results may differ from those estimates.

### X. PENSIONS  
For purposes of measuring the net pension liability and deferred outflows/inflows of resources related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the County Office’s California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) and California State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) plans (Plans) and additions to/deductions from the Plans’ fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by CalPERS and STRS, respectively. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value.  

### Y. POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS (OPEB)  
For purposes of measuring the County Office’s OPEB liability(asset), deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources, information about the fiduciary net position of the County Office’s OPEB Plan (Plan) and additions to/deductions from the Plan’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the Plan. For this purpose, the Plan recognizes benefit payments when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value, except for money market investments and participating interest earning investment contracts that have a maturity at the time of purchase of one year or less, which are reported at cost.  

### Z. FINANCING LEASES  
A lease is defined as a contract that conveys control of the right to use another entity’s nonfinancial asset as specified in the contract for a period of time in an exchange or exchange-like transaction. The long-term liability and corresponding asset for financial leases are recorded in the financial statements to the extent that the County Office’s lease capitalization threshold is met, $750,000. Amortization of related assets using the straight-line method over the life of the contract. As of June 30, 2023, the County Office did not have any financing leases that met the threshold.  

### AA. SUBSCRIPTION BASED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENTS (SBITA)  
A SBITA is defined as a contract that conveys control of the right to use another party’s (a SBITA vendor’s) IT software, alone or in combination with tangible capital assets (the underlying IT assets) as specified in the contract for a period of time in an exchange or exchange-like transaction. The long-term liability and corresponding asset for SBITAs are recorded in the financial statements to the extent that the County Office’s capitalization threshold is met, $700,000. Amortization of related assets using the straight-line method over the life of the contract. As of June 30, 2023, the County Office did not have any subscription based information technology agreements that met the threshold.

## 2. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and investments as of June 30, 2023 consist of the following:

|                          | Governmental Activities | Fiduciary Activities |
|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Pooled Funds:**        |                        |                      |
| Cash in County Treasury   | $ 110,620,517         | $ 1,683,237         |
| **Deposits:**            |                        |                      |
| Revolving cash fund      | 30,000                 |                      |
| Cash on hand and in banks| 162,841                |                      |
| **Total**                | $ 110,813,358         | $ 1,683,237         |

### Cash in County Treasury

In accordance with Education Code Section 41001, the County Office maintains substantially all of its cash in the Sacramento County Treasury. The Sacramento County Treasury pools these funds with those of other districts and agencies within the County in the interest-bearing Sacramento County Treasurer's Pooled Surplus Investment Fund. These pooled funds are recorded at cost which approximates fair value. Interest earned is deposited quarterly into participating funds. Any investment losses are proportionately shared by all funds in the pool.

Because the County Office's deposits are maintained in a recognized pooled investment fund under the care of a third party and the County Office's share of the pool does not consist of specific, identifiable investment securities owned by the County Office, no disclosure of the individual deposits and investments or related custodial credit risk classification is required.

In accordance with applicable state laws, the Sacramento County Treasurer may invest in derivative securities. However, at June 30, 2023, the Sacramento County Treasurer has indicated that the Treasurer's Pooled Surplus Investment Fund contained no derivatives or other investments with similar risk profiles.

The Adult Education and Child Development Funds ended the fiscal year with negative cash balances in the County Treasury due to the timing of the receipt of funding for the programs.

### Custodial Credit Risk

The County Office limits custodial credit risk by ensuring uninsured balances are collateralized by the respective financial institution. Cash balances held in banks are insured up to $250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and are collateralized by the respective financial institution. At June 30, 2023, the carrying amount and the bank balance of the County Office's accounts was $192,841, all of which was insured.

### Interest Rate Risk

It is the County Office’s policy to limit cash and investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. At June 30, 2023, the County Office had no significant interest rate risk related to cash and investments held.

#### Contributions  

**CalPERS**  
Section 20814(c) of the California Public Employees’ Retirement Law requires that the employer contribution rates for all public employers be determined on an annual basis by the actuary and shall be effective on the July 1 following notice of a change in the rate. Funding contributions for the Plan are determined annually on an actuarial basis as of June 30 by CalPERS. The actuarially determined rate is the estimated amount necessary to finance the costs of benefits earned by employees during the year, with an additional amount to finance any unfunded accrued liability. The County Office of Education is required to contribute the difference between the actuarially determined rate and the contribution rate of employees.  

**STRS**  
Required member, employer and state contribution rates are set by the California Legislature and Governor and detailed in Teachers’ Retirement Law. Contribution rates are expressed as a level percentage of payroll using the entry age normal actuarial cost method.  

For the year ended June 30, 2023, the contributions reported as deferred outflows of resources related to pensions recognized as part of pension expense for each Plan were as follows:  

|                | CalPERS      | STRS         | Total        |

6. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEMS (CONTINUED)

The County Office of Education’s net pension liability for each Plan is measured as the proportionate share of the net pension liability. The net pension liability of each of the Plans is measured as of June 30, 2022, and the total pension liability for each Plan used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2021 rolled forward to June 30, 2022 using standard update procedures. The County Office of Education’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on a projection of the County Office of Education’s long-term share of contributions to the pension plan relative to the projected contributions of all participating employers, actuarially determined. The County Office of Education’s proportionate share of the net pension liability for the Plan as of June 30, 2021 and 2022 was as follows:

| Measurement Dates | Fiscal Year | CalPERS   | STRS      |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| June 30, 2021     | 2021-22     | 0.217070% | 0.039774% |

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

### FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023

6. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEMS (CONTINUED)

The mortality table used was developed based on CalPERS-specific data. The rates incorporate Generational Mortality to capture ongoing morality improvement using 80% of Scale MP 2020 published by the Society of Actuaries. For more details, please refer to the 2021 experience study report that can be found on the CalPERS website.

STRS changed the mortality assumptions based on the July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2018, experience study adopted by the board in January 2020. STRS uses a generational mortality assumption, which involves the use of a base mortality table and projection scales to reflect expected annual reductions in mortality rates at each age, resulting in increases in life expectancies each year into the future. The base mortality rates are CalSTRS custom tables derived to best fit the patterns of mortality among our members. The projection scale was set equal to 110% of the ultimate improvement factor from the Mortality Improvement Scale (MP–2019) table issued by the Society of Actuaries.

### Discount Rate

**CalPERS**

The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability for the Plan was 6.90%. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that contributions from Plan members will be made at the current member contribution rates and that contributions from employers will be made at statutorily required rates, actuarially determined. Based on those assumptions, the Plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. These discount rates are equal to the long-term expected rate of return of the respective plan assets and are net of investment expense but not reduced for administrative expenses.

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class.

In determining the long-term expected rate of return, CalPERS took into account long-term market return expectations as well as the expected pension fund cash flows. Projected returns for all asset classes are estimated and, combined with risk estimates, are used to project compound (geometric) returns over the long term. The discount rate used to discount liabilities was informed by the long-term projected portfolio return. The expected rate of return was then set equal to the single equivalent rate calculated above and adjusted to account for assumed administrative expenses.

The expected real rates of return by asset class are on the following table:

(b) Figures are based on the 2021-22 Asset Liability Management Study.  

### Discount Rate  
**STRS**  

The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.10%, which was unchanged from prior fiscal year. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that contributions from plan members and employers are made at statutory contribution rates in accordance with the rate increases actuarially determined. Projected inflows from investment earnings were calculated using the long-term assumed investment rate of return of 7.10% and assume that contributions, benefit payments and administrative expenses occur midyear. Based on those assumptions, the Plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to meet all projected future benefit payments to current plan members. Therefore, the long-term assumed investment rate of return was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.  

The long-term investment rate of return assumption was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. The best-estimate ranges were developed using capital market assumptions from STRS investment staff and investment consultants as inputs to the process.  

The actuarial investment rate of return assumption was adopted by the board in January 2020 in conjunction with the most recent experience study. For each current and future valuation, STRS’ independent consulting actuary (Milliman) reviews the return assumption for reasonableness based on the most current capital market assumptions. Best estimates of expected 20-year geometrically linked real rates of return and the assumed asset allocation for each major asset class as of the June 30, 2022 measurement date, are summarized in the following table:

### 8. OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS  

#### General Information about the OPEB Plan  

**Plan description.** The County Office participates in California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust (CERBT), an agent multi-employer defined benefit other postemployment benefits plan administered by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). Currently the plan provides for monthly health benefits to eligible retirees. Benefit provisions are established by labor agreements and may be amended by such for current active employees. Benefit provisions are approved by the Sacramento County Superintendent of Schools. Separate financial statements are prepared for the Plan and may be obtained by contacting CalPERS.  

The CERBT was established by Chapter 331 of the 1988 California Statutes, and employers elect to participate in the CERBT to pre-fund health, dental, and other non-pension postemployment benefits for their retirees and survivors. The CERBT has pooled administrative and investment functions, while separate employer accounts are maintained to pre-fund and pay for health care or other postemployment benefits in accordance with the terms of the participating employers’ plans. There are three Board approved investment strategies for employers to choose from depending on their expected levels of return and volatility. Benefit provisions are established by participating employers.  

**Employees covered by benefit terms.** At June 30, 2021, the following employees were covered by the benefit terms:  
- Inactive employees or beneficiaries currently receiving benefit payments: 447  
- Inactive employees entitled to but not yet receiving benefit payments: -  
- Active employees: 1,055  

**Contributions.** For the year ended June 30, 2023, the County Office’s average contribution rate was 5.65 percent of covered-employee payroll. Employees are not required to contribute to the plan.  

**Net OPEB Liability(Asset)**  
The County Office’s net OPEB liability/(asset) was measured as of June 30, 2022, and the total OPEB liability used to calculate the net OPEB liability/(asset) was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2021.  

**Actuarial assumptions.** The total OPEB liability in the June 30, 2021 actuarial valuation was determined using the actuarial assumptions shown on the following page, applied to all periods included in the measurement, unless otherwise specified:

### FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023

### 8. OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS (CONTINUED)

- **Discount Rate**: 6.19%
- **General Inflation Rate**: 2.50% per year
- **Salary Increase**: 3.00% per year; since benefits do not depend on salary, this is used to allocate the cost of benefits between service years
- **Investment rate of return**: 6.19%, net of plan investment expenses
- **Healthcare trend rates**: 5.60% (effective January 2023) and grades down to 4.00% for years 2076 and thereafter
- **Medicare Eligibility**: Absent contrary data, all individuals are assumed to be eligible for Medicare Parts A and B at age 65.
- **Mortality Improvement**: MacLeod Watts Scale 2020 applied generationally from 2015

Demographic actuarial assumptions used in the valuation are based on the following two studies:

**For CalPERS members**: On the December 2017 experience study of the California Public Employees Retirement System using data from 1997 to 2015, except for a different basis used to project future mortality improvements.

**For CalSTRS members**: On the December 2020 CalSTRS experience study report. The representative mortality rates were those published by CalSTRS in the 2020 study before projection.

The long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future rates of return (expected returns, net of OPEB plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation.

In March 2022, CalPERS updated the projected future investment returns for CERBT Strategy 1. CalPERS determined its returns for each major asset class. The target allocation and best estimates of geometric real rates of return published by CalPERS for each major class are split for years 1-5 and years 1-20. The target allocation and best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class are summarized in the following table:

### CERBT Strategy 1

| Major Asset Classification | Target Allocation | General Inflation Rate | Expected Real Rate of Return | Compound Return |
|---------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| Global Equity             | 49%               | 2.40%                  | -4.40%                       | 6.80%            |

## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
### FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023

### 8. OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS (CONTINUED)

**Discount rate.** The discount rate used to measure the total OPEB liability was 6.19 percent. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that contributions from school districts and county offices will be made at rates equal to the actuarially determined contribution rates. Based on those assumptions, the OPEB plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected OPEB payments for current active and inactive employees. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total OPEB liability.

### Changes in the Net OPEB Liability/(Asset)

(1) Historical information is required only for measurement periods for which GASB 68 is applicable.  
(2) Employers are assumed to make contributions equal to the contractually required contributions. However, some employers may choose to make additional contributions towards their side fund or their unfunded liability. Employer contributions for such plans exceed the contractually required contributions. CalPERS has determined that employer obligations referred to as "side funds" do not conform to the circumstances described in paragraph 120 of GASB 68, therefore are not considered separately financed specific liabilities.  
(3) Covered payroll is the payroll on which contributions to a pension plan are based.

## NOTES TO REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION  
### FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023  

1. **PURPOSE OF SCHEDULES**  

   A - **Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance – Budget and Actual**  
   The County Office employs budget control by object codes and by individual appropriation accounts. Budgets are prepared on the modified accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. The budgets are revised during the year by the Board of Education to provide for revised priorities. Expenditures cannot legally exceed appropriations by major object code. The originally adopted and final revised budgets for the County School Service, Special Education Pass-Through, and Adult Education Funds are presented as Required Supplementary Information. The basis of budgeting is the same as GAAP.  

   B - **Schedule of Changes in the Net OPEB Liability/(Asset) and Related Ratios**  
   GASB 75 requires presentation of the 10-year history of changes in the Net OPEB Liability/(Asset). However, since June 30, 2018 was the first year of implementation, only six years are currently available.  

   C - **Schedule of OPEB Contributions**  
   Actuarial methods and assumptions used to set the actuarially determined contributions for fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 were from the June 30, 2021 valuation.  
   - Actuarial cost method: Entry Age Normal  
   - Amortization method: Level $ of pay  
   - Amortization period: Open 30 years  
   - Asset valuation method: Market value  
   - Inflation: 2.50%  
   - Healthcare cost trend rates: 5.70% in 2022, down to 4.00% by 2076  
   - Salary increases: 3.00%  
   - Investment rate of return: 6.19%  
   - Retirement age: Ages 50 to 75  
   - Mortality: CalPERS 2017 Study; CalSTRS 2020 Study

## NOTES TO REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

### FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023

1. **PURPOSE OF SCHEDULES (CONTINUED)**

   D - **Schedule of Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability**

   This schedule presents information on the County Office's proportionate share of the net pension liability (NPL), the Plans' fiduciary net position and, when applicable, the State's proportionate share of the NPL associated with the County Office. In the future, as data becomes available, ten years of information will be presented.

   **Changes in Assumptions**  
   The discount rate changed for CalPERS from 7.15% to 6.90%. The inflation rate for CalPERS changed from 2.50% to 2.30%. The payroll growth rate for CalPERS changed from 2.75% to 2.80%. There were no changes in assumptions for CalSTRS.

   **Changes in Benefit Terms**  
   There were no changes in benefit terms since the previous valuations for both CalPERS and CalSTRS.

   Fiscal year 2015 was the first year of implementation, therefore only nine years are shown.

   E - **Schedule of Pension Contributions**

   If an employer's contributions to the plans are actuarially determined or based on statutory or contractual requirements, the employer's actuarially determined contribution to the pension plans (or, if applicable, its statutorily or contractually required contribution), the employer's actual contributions, the difference between the actual and actuarially determined contributions (or statutorily or contractually required), and a ratio of the actual contributions divided by covered-employee payroll. In the future, as data becomes available, ten years of information will be presented.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON STATE COMPLIANCE

County Superintendent of Schools and  
Board of Education  
Sacramento County Office of Education  
Sacramento, California  

## Report on Compliance

### Opinion

We have audited the Sacramento County Office of Education (the “County Office”) compliance with the requirements specified in the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting applicable to the County Office’s state program requirements identified below for the year ended June 30, 2023.

In our opinion, Sacramento County Office of Education complied, in all material respects, with the laws and regulations of the state programs noted in the table below for the year ended June 30, 2023.

### Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS), the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.

We are required to be independent of the County Office and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the County Office’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.

### Responsibilities of Management for Compliance

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the County Office’s state programs.

### Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the County Office’s compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting will always detect a material noncompliance when it exists.

![Audit Procedures](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Audit+Procedures)

The risk of not detecting a material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the County Office’s compliance with the requirements of the state programs as a whole.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit;
- Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the County Office’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances;
- Obtain an understanding of the County Office’s internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the County Office’s internal controls over compliance. Accordingly, we express no such opinion; and

Select and test transactions and records to determine the County Office’s compliance with the state laws and regulations applicable to the following items:

We did not perform any procedures related to Instructional Time, Ratio of Administrative Employees to Teachers, Classroom Teacher Salaries, Middle or Early College High Schools, K-3 Grade Span Adjustment, and District of Choice because these compliance requirements do not apply to County Offices of Education.

We did not perform any procedures related to Transportation Maintenance of Effort because the County Office did not have expenditures as specified in Education Code Section 2575(k) in the 2012-13 fiscal year.

We did not perform any procedures related to California Clean Energy Jobs Act as the projects were completed in prior years.

We did not perform any procedures related to Continuation Education, Early Retirement Incentive, After/Before School Education and Safety Program, and Independent Study-Course Based because the County Office did not offer these programs.

We did not perform any procedures related to Career Technical Education Incentive Grant as the County Office did not receive any funding in the current year.

We did not perform any procedures related to Immunizations as none of the County Office of Education’s sites appeared on the lists of schools that did not submit immunization assessment reports to the California Department of Public Health or those that reported combined conditional admission and overdue rates greater than 10 percent in kindergarten and in 7th grade.

# REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

County Superintendent of Schools and  
Board of Education  
Sacramento County Office of Education  
Sacramento, California  

We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Sacramento County Office of Education (the “County Office”), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the County Office’s basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated March 27, 2024.

## Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered County Office's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of County Office’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the County Office’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, but important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified. We identified certain deficiencies in internal control, described in the accompanying Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs as item 2023-1 in Section II – Financial Statement Findings of finding as that we consider to be a material weakness.

![Compliance and Other Matters](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Compliance+and+Other+Matters)

**Compliance and Other Matters**

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Sacramento County Office of Education's financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

**The Sacramento County Office of Education's response**

Government Auditing Standards requires the auditor to perform limited procedures on the Sacramento County Office of Education's response to the findings identified in our audit and described in the accompanying Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs. The Sacramento County Office of Education's response was not subjected to the other auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response.

**Purpose of this Report**

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

# REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM; REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE; AND REPORT ON SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

County Superintendent of Schools and  
Board of Education  
Sacramento County Office of Education  
Sacramento, California  

### Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program

#### Opinion on Each Major Federal Program

We have audited Sacramento County Office of Education’s (the “County Office”) compliance with the types of compliance requirements identified as subject to audit in the May 2023 Edition of the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the County Office’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2023. The County Office’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.

In our opinion, the County Office complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2023.

#### Basis for Opinion on Each Major Federal Program

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS); the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (Government Auditing Standards); and the audit requirements of the May 2023 Edition of the Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Our responsibilities under those standards and the Uniform Guidance are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.

We are required to be independent of the County Office and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the County Office’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.

#### Responsibilities of Management for Compliance

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the County Office’s federal programs.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the County Office’s compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the Uniform Guidance will always detect material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material, if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the County Office’s compliance with the requirements of each major federal program as a whole.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the Uniform Guidance, we:
- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the County Office’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
- Obtain an understanding of the County Office’s internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the County Office’s internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identified during the audit.

## Report on Internal Control Over Compliance

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section above and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance may exist that were not identified.

Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

**Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by the Uniform Guidance**

We have audited the financial statements of Sacramento County Office of Education as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and have issued our report thereon dated March 27, 2024, which contained an unmodified opinion on those financial statements. Our audit was performed for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by the Uniform Guidance and is not a required part of the financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements as a whole.

## SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS  
### FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023  

## Section II – Financial Statement Findings  

### 2003-1 Payroll Clearing Fund  
### 30000 Internal Control  

**Criteria:**  
The Payroll Clearing fund is used to administer payroll for the districts in the county. The fund should net to zero, where administered funds transferred in equal payroll and related expenses paid out. There could be times where there are amounts due to and due from outside districts.  

**Condition:**  
As of June 30, 2023, the fund shows a deficit of $26,731,483 in aggregate.  

**Question Costs:**  
$26,731,483  

**Context:**  
The payroll clearing account should be used as a transactional account. Payroll runs and related liabilities should be posted for the transactional periods. The transactions in and out fund should balance with the payroll clearing fund as well as with the member districts.  

**Effect:**  
Fiduciary payroll clearing assets and obligations do not balanced.  

**Cause:**  
It appears that double entry accounting is not used to post payroll clearing transactions with respect to the member districts and the payroll clearing fund where payments on behalf of a district are recorded in the same period as amounts transferred in or due from the districts.  

**Recommendations:**  
The County Office business service management should work with the payroll staff to:  
1. Identify the differences in the payroll clearing fiduciary fund as of June 30, 2023, and to properly balance obligations and amounts that should be transferred in as of this date. The amounts should balance the fund to zero.  
2. Develop processes to ensure that double entry accounting is used in entering payroll activity with respect to the districts and the payroll clearing fund. Funds transferred in or due from districts for each transaction should posted and balanced for each period.  
3. Develop procedures for posting special transactions as of year-end where guidance is documented and training provided to staff to ensure these transactions are posted in the proper period and balanced to amounts due from districts.

## SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS

### FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023

**Corrective Action Plan:**  
SCOE recognizes the auditor’s findings of a ($26,731,483) net position in the Payroll Clearing fund (Fund 76) and will conduct a thorough reconciliation of the fund to resolve this imbalance. SCOE will review and revise its internal controls to implement processes that ensure the fund’s assets and liabilities are correctly stated in alignment with the requirements of GASB 84. Once procedural revisions have been determined, SCOE will monitor the effectiveness of the controls applied to the processes and ensure appropriate staff members receive training.
