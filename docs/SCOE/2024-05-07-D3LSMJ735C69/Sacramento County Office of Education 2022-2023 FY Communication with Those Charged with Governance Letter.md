**COMMUNICATION WITH THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE**  

March 27, 2024  

To the Board of Education  
Sacramento County Office of Education  
Mather, California  

We have audited the basic financial statements of Sacramento County Office of Education (the “County Office”) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and have issued our report thereon dated March 27, 2024. Professional standards require that we advise you of the following matters relating to our audit.  

**Our Responsibility in Relation to the Financial Statement Audit**  

As communicated in our engagement letter dated February 10, 2023, our responsibility, as described by professional standards, is to form and express an opinion(s) about whether the financial statements that have been prepared by management with your oversight are presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our audit of the financial statements does not relieve you or management of your respective responsibilities.  

Our responsibility, as prescribed by professional standards, is to plan and perform our audit to obtain reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, as part of our audit, we considered the internal control of the County Office solely for the purpose of determining our audit procedures and not to provide any assurance concerning such internal control.  

We are also responsible for communicating significant matters related to the audit that are, in our professional judgment, relevant to your responsibilities in overseeing the financial reporting process. However, we are not required to design procedures for the purpose of identifying other matters to communicate to you.  

**Planned Scope and Timing of the Audit**  

We conducted our audit consistent with the planned scope. The timing of the audit was delayed due to waiting on the P-2 revision as well as additional audit procedures that needed to be performed on Fund 76 due to the fund not being reconciled.  

**Compliance with All Ethics Requirements Regarding Independence**  

The engagement team, others in our firm, as appropriate, and our firm, have complied with all relevant ethical requirements regarding independence.

We follow the AICPA Ethics Standard Rule 201C, in conjunction with this, we annually review with all engagement staff potential conflicts and obtain a conflict certification. In addition, we inquire on each engagement about potential conflicts with staff. We have not identified any relationships or other matters that in the auditor’s judgment may be reasonably thought to bear on independence.

## Qualitative Aspects of the Entity’s Significant Accounting Practices

### Significant Accounting Policies

Management has the responsibility to select and use appropriate accounting policies. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the County Office is included in Note 1 to the financial statements. Other than the GASB 96 policy, there have been no other selection of accounting policies and no changes in significant accounting policies or their application during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. No matters have come to our attention that would require us, under professional standards, to inform you about (1) the methods used to account for significant unusual transactions and (2) the effect of significant accounting policies in controversial or emerging areas for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus. However, there are new Governmental Accounting Standards that may affect the County Office in future years. (See Attachment I)

### Significant Accounting Estimates

Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based on management’s current judgments. Those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management’s current judgments.

The most sensitive accounting estimates affecting the financial statements are the collectability of receivables, the County Office’s proportionate share of net pension liability, and the County Office’s net OPEB liability.

Management’s estimate of the collectability of receivables is based on past experience with collections from various entities. The estimates for the County Office’s proportionate share of net pension liabilities and the County Office’s net OPEB liability are based on actuarial studies. We evaluated key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates and determined that they are reasonable in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole and in relation to the applicable opinion units.

### Financial Statement Disclosures

Certain financial statement disclosures involve significant judgement and are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statement users. The pension and OPEB disclosures included in footnotes 6 and 8, respectively, required significant judgements to calculate the County Office’s proportionate share of the net pension liability for CalPERS and STRS, deferred outflows and inflows related to pensions, pension expense, the County Office’s net OPEB liability, deferred outflows and inflows related to OPEB, and OPEB expense.

**Significant Difficulties Encountered during the Audit**  
We encountered no significant difficulties in dealing with management relating to the performance of the audit.

**Uncorrected and Corrected Misstatements**  
For purposes of this communication, professional standards require us to accumulate all known and likely misstatements identified during the audit, other than those that we believe are trivial, and communicate them to the appropriate level of management. Further, professional standards require us to also communicate the effect of uncorrected misstatements related to prior periods on the relevant classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures, and the financial statements as a whole and each applicable opinion unit. As further described below under Other Significant Matters – we have issued an adverse opinion on the payroll clearing fund – we believe there are uncorrected misstatements.

In addition, professional standards require us to communicate to you all material, corrected misstatements that were brought to the attention of management as a result of our audit procedures. There were adjustments identified as a result of our audit procedures. (See Attachment II)

**Disagreements with Management**  
For purposes of this letter, professional standards define a disagreement with management as a matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction, concerning a financial accounting, reporting, or auditing matter, which could be significant to the County Office’s financial statements or the auditor’s report. No such disagreements arose during the course of the audit.

**Representations Requested from Management**  
We have requested certain written representations from management, which are included in the attached letter dated March 27, 2024. (See Attachment III)

**Management’s Consultations with Other Accountants**  
In some cases, management may decide to consult with other accountants about auditing and accounting matters. Management informed us that, and to our knowledge, there were no consultations with other accountants regarding auditing and accounting matters.

**Other Significant Matters, Findings, or Issues**  
In the normal course of our professional association with the County Office, we generally discuss a variety of matters, including the application of accounting principles and auditing standards, operating and regulatory conditions affecting the entity, and operational plans and strategies that may affect the risks of material misstatement. None of the matters discussed resulted in a condition to our retention as the County Office’s auditors.

**Adverse Opinion**  
The Payroll Clearing fund is used to administer payroll of county districts. The fund should balance to zero, where administered funds are transferred in equal payroll and related expenses paid out. There could be times where there are due to and due from outside districts. As of June 30, 2023, the fund shows a deficit of $26,731,483 in aggregate. This deficit indicates that there is significant doubt.

**Upcoming Changes in Accounting Standards**  

The following pronouncements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) have been released recently and may be applicable to the County Office in the near future. We encourage management to review the following information and determine which standard(s) may be applicable to the County Office. For the complete text of these and other GASB standards, visit www.gasb.org and click on the “Standards & Guidance” tab. If you have questions regarding the applicability, timing, or implementation approach for any of these standards, please contact your audit team.

**GASB Statement No. 99, Omnibus 2022**  
**Effective dates vary**

The objectives of this Statement are to enhance comparability in accounting and financial reporting and to improve the consistency of authoritative literature by addressing (1) practice issues that have been identified during implementation and application of certain GASB Statements and (2) accounting and financial reporting for financial guarantees. The practice issues addressed by this Statement are as follows:

- Classification and reporting of derivative instruments within the scope of Statement No. 53, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Derivative Instruments, that do not meet the definition of either an investment derivative instrument or a hedging derivative instrument – **Effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024**
- Clarification of provisions in Statement No. 87, Leases, as amended, related to the determination of the lease term, classification of a lease as a short-term lease, recognition and measurement of a lease liability and a lease asset, and identification of lease incentives – **Effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023**
- Clarification of provisions in Statement No. 94, Public-Private and Public-Public Partnerships and Availability Payment Arrangements, related to (a) the determination of the public-private and public-public partnership (PPP) term and (b) recognition and measurement of installment payments and the transfer of the underlying PPP asset – **Effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023**
- Clarification of provisions in Statement No. 96, Subscription-Based Information Technology Arrangements, related to the subscription-based information technology arrangement (SBITA) term, classification of a SBITA as a short-term SBITA, and recognition and measurement of a subscription liability – **Effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023**
- Extension of the period during which the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is considered an appropriate benchmark interest rate for the qualitative evaluation of the effectiveness of an interest rate swap that hedges the interest rate risk of taxable debt – **Effective immediately**
- Accounting for the distribution of benefits as part of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) – **Effective immediately**
- Disclosures related to nonmonetary transactions – **Effective immediately**
- Pledges of future revenues when resources are not received by the pledging government – **Effective immediately**
- Clarification of provisions in Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements—and Management’s Discussion and Analysis—for State and Local Governments, as amended, related to the focus of the government-wide financial statements – **Effective immediately**
- Terminology updates related to certain provisions of Statement No. 63, Financial Reporting of Deferred Outflows of Resources, Deferred Inflows of Resources, and Net Position – **Effective immediately**
- Terminology used in Statement 53 to refer to resource flows statements. – **Effective immediately**

We do not expect this standard to have any significant impact on the County Office.

**James Marta & Company LLP**  
**Certified Public Accountants**  
**Upcoming Changes in Accounting Standards**  

**GASB Statement No. 100, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections—an amendment of GASB Statement No. 62**  
**Effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024**  

The primary objective of this Statement is to enhance accounting and financial reporting requirements for accounting changes and error corrections to provide more understandable, reliable, relevant, consistent, and comparable information for making decisions or assessing accountability.

This Statement defines accounting changes as changes in accounting principles, changes in accounting estimates, and changes to or within the financial reporting entity and describes the transactions or other events that constitute those changes. As part of those descriptions, for (1) certain changes in accounting principles and (2) certain changes in accounting estimates that result from a change in measurement methodology, a new principle or methodology should be justified on the basis that it is preferable to the principle or methodology used before the change. That preferability should be based on the qualitative characteristics of financial reporting—understandability, reliability, relevance, timeliness, consistency, and comparability. This Statement also addresses corrections of errors in previously issued financial statements.

This Statement prescribes the accounting and financial reporting for (1) each type of accounting change and (2) error corrections. This Statement requires that (a) changes in accounting principles and error corrections be reported retroactively by restating prior periods, (b) changes to or within the financial reporting entity be reported by adjusting beginning balances of the current period, and (c) changes in accounting estimates be reported prospectively by recognizing the change in the current period. The requirements of this Statement for changes in accounting principles apply to the implementation of a new pronouncement in absence of specific transition provisions in the new pronouncement. This Statement also requires that the aggregate amount of adjustments to and restatements of beginning net position, fund balance, or fund net position, as applicable, be displayed by reporting unit in the financial statements.

We do not expect this standard to have any significant impact on the County Office.

---

**GASB Statement No. 101, Compensated Absences**  
**Effective for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025**  

The objective of this Statement is to better meet the information needs of financial statement users by updating the recognition and measurement guidance for compensated absences. That objective is achieved by aligning the recognition and measurement guidance under a unified model and by amending certain previously required disclosures.

We do not expect this standard to have any significant impact on the County Office.
