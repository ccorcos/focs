## 2022-2023 School Accountability Report Card
### (Published During the 2023-2024 School Year)

## General Information about the School Accountability Report Card (SARC)

### SARC Overview
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school-specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC.

- For more information about SARC requirements and access to prior year reports, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at [CDE SARC](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/).
  
- For more information about the LCFF or the LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at [CDE LCFF](https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/).
  
- For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or the district office.

### DataQuest
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at [DataQuest](https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/) that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).

### California School Dashboard
The California School Dashboard (Dashboard) [California School Dashboard](https://www.caschooldashboard.org/) reflects California’s new accountability and continuous improvement system and provides information about how LEAs and schools are meeting the needs of California’s diverse student population. The Dashboard contains reports that display the performance of LEAs, schools, and student groups on a set of state and local measures to assist in identifying strengths, challenges, and areas in need of improvement.

### 2023-24 School Description and Mission Statement
Leo A. Palmiter Jr./Sr. High School provides education to special education students with mental health and behavioral needs. Our program meets the unique educational, behavioral, and mental health needs of our students and offers a range of services that promote a positive learning environment. Students are referred directly from the local school districts of Sacramento County that are unable to provide a highly structured behavioral support program as well as vocational opportunities. During the 2022-2023 school year, school psychologists provided Educationally Related Mental Health Services (ERMHS). In addition, students were provided with a standards-based educational program that was supported by a strong career technical emphasis. The Leo A. Palmiter program is divided into pathways: Discovery Academy (pre-vocational skills for grades 7-8), Culinary Arts, and Sustainable Environments Academies (grades 9-12). Each pathway connects core academics with relevant experience within various fields. Coursework is coordinated with the Career Technical Education (CTE) programs, such as Culinary Arts and Hospitality, Horticulture, and Northern California Construction Training (NCCT).

**B. Pupil Outcomes**  
**State Priority: Pupil Achievement**  
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):

**Statewide Assessments**  
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.)

The CAASPP System encompasses the following assessments and student participation requirements:  
1. Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments and CAAs for ELA in grades three through eight and grade eleven.  
2. Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments and CAAs for mathematics in grades three through eight and grade eleven.  
3. California Science Test (CAST) and CAAs for Science in grades five, eight, and once in high school (i.e., grade ten, eleven, or twelve).

**College and Career Ready**  
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs of study.

**Percentage of Students Meeting or Exceeding the State Standard on CAASPP**  
This table displays CAASPP test results in ELA and mathematics for all students grades three through eight and grade eleven taking and completing a state-administered assessment.

Percentages are not calculated when the number of students tested is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.

ELA and mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment and the CAA. The “Percent Met or Exceeded” is calculated by taking the total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved Level 3-Alterate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.

**2022-23 CAASPP Test Results in Math by Student Group**

This table displays CAASPP test results in Math by student group for students grades three through eight and grade eleven taking and completing a state-administered assessment.

Mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment and the CAA. The “Percent Met or Exceeded” is calculated by taking the total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved Level 3-Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.

Double dashes (–) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.

The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.

## CAASPP Test Results in Science for All Students

This table displays the percentage of all students grades five, eight, and High School meeting or exceeding the State Standard.

Science test results include the CAST and the CAA. The “Percent Met or Exceeded” is calculated by taking the total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the CAST plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved Level 3-Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.

The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.

### 2023-24 School Safety Plan

A comprehensive school safety plan is in place at Palmiter Jr./Sr. High School. The elements of the plan include Fire Emergency Procedures, Lockdown Procedures, Emergency Contact Protocol, Earthquake Emergency, and Active Shooter Procedures. School-wide and classroom expectations are taught and reinforced through a Positive Interventions and Supports (PBIS). Students are supported with behavior interventions, mentoring, and group counseling depending on their level of need through the school's Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS). All classes adhere to the safety plan; staff and students review safety procedures quarterly. A connection to the Sacramento Sheriff Department's Crisis Intervention Team is contacted when there is an emergency crisis situation. A School Safety Committee meets on a regular basis to review safety procedures at Palmiter Jr./Sr. High School. Parents are informed of the campus Safety Plan through the School Site Council meetings and informational flyers.

### Fiscal Year 2022-23 Types of Services Funded
The Special Education Department SCOE offers special education services to students with emotional disabilities. These students' needs have been identified in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) plan developed by a school district or the County Office of Education program. Leo A. Palmiter is a separate school with five special day classrooms and three Career Technical Education classrooms. Each classroom has one teacher and one para-educator with no more than 12 students. SCOE works closely with the districts to provide students opportunities to be mainstreamed with their peers in general education classes. We create either part-time or full-time participation in the general education setting depending on each student's needs.
