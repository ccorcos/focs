![Key Guiding Questions](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Key+Guiding+Questions)  
**Key Guiding Questions**  
Capital College & Career Academy (CCCA) submitted its charter petition on February 25th, 2022. In that petition CCCA outlined its projected measurable pupil outcomes. Upon officially opening, CCCA developed an initial LCAP to actualize these projected goals. Now that the school has been in operation for a semester, CCCA has begun to identify next steps while simultaneously refining current instructional practices and on-campus supports to meet the needs of our student body. Through this process, CCCA has consistently been guided by the following questions:  
- Are students engaging in real-world learning while acquiring tangible skills that ensures graduates are career prepared and college accelerated?  
- Is Capital College & Career Academy fulfilling its instructional and programmatic vision to provide a one-of-a-kind academic program?  
- Are students provided the academic and social emotional supports necessary to foster a strong positive culture of community?

![Mission Statement, Vision Statement, and CCCA’s Five Pillars](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768)

## Mission
The mission of CCCA is: “All students will be enrolled in a postsecondary institution or employed within 6 months of graduation.”

## Vision
Our vision is to create an educational environment where students are college accelerated and job prepared. Students will transition into adulthood with the skills and experiences required to make a living wage. The curriculum at CCCA will provide a life-changing opportunity for students who, upon graduation, will have the real-world experience and tangible skills that will allow them to succeed, not just today, but for years down the road.

## CCCA’s Five Pillars
CCCA sets high academic and behavioral standards for its scholars. Students are expected to embody the five pillars: collaboration, responsibility, grit, critical thinking, and leadership. These pillars are carried out by both staff and students and articulated in our instructional vision document included in Appendix A.

![Review of Major Activities and Programs](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Review+of+Major+Activities+and+Programs)

**Review of Major Activities and Programs**  
*Overview of Major Activities and Programs Implemented in the First Semester*

While only a semester into the school year, CCCA has had 9 field trips, 16 different industry partners on campus, 2 college visits, launched CIF sports. Also students have completed nearly 400 cumulative volunteer hours. Academically, we have seen strong evidence that the CCCA model is in fact making a significant impact on student learning.

All students participate in core classes every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. On Tuesday and Thursdays, the schedule switches to a double block where students have only two periods. During these block periods, students take an elective class: either Culture and Community, English / Math Bridge, or Innovation Design and Implementation (IDI). Every student also completes a Career Exploration class. This unique schedule allows students to not only participate in traditional high school classes but also extend learning beyond the four walls of our school building.

At the start of the school year, all students completed their iReady math and reading assessments. The data was eye opening as over 80% of our enrolled student body was below grade level. Even more shocking was that 32% of students were below a 4th grade level in math and reading. This data was further verified by teacher generated assessments in these core classes. Using this data, we were able to provide more targeted differentiated instruction to our students in general education classes. To address these learning gaps, we offered a bridge class as articulated in the original charter petition.

Our bridge class, meant to provide foundational skills in math and reading, was specifically for students below a 4th grade level in math and reading. The class is taught by our Educational Specialist with the support of our Instructional Assistant and our Academic Enrichment Coordinator. Small group instruction and interactive learning activities are key components of the class. Students participate in several online curriculums which monitor student progress and growth while providing daily feedback to staff and students. Embedded within these learning platforms are adaptive academic games which focus on both repetition of foundational skills and student engagement to build and reinforce learning.

Innovation Design and Implementation (IDI) is a co-taught class that was largely funded via our SSP grant. This allowed us to experiment with what will ultimately become a manufacturing CTE pathway. In this course, the traditional student teacher relationship is flipped into a creator facilitator partnership. By the use of essential questions focused on what problem students wanted to solve, the course provided enough structure for students to stay focused on projects but not so restrictive that the learning became predictable and boring. Student projects ranged from 3-D printers, hydraulic cranes, to claymations, and sewing.

Culture and Community was another co-taught elective where students learned about and implemented the Design Thinking Process to tackle real-world challenges facing North Sacramento. Final projects included a presentation to the Sacramento City Council on vacant buildings in North Sacramento, supporting a local homeless shelter for single mothers and their children by running a winter movie night and donation fundraiser, and working collaboratively with various community stakeholders to put soccer goals in Woodland Park.

Right before winter break students completed their interim math and reading assessments and as a school, we averaged nearly an entire year’s worth of academic growth in only a semester! The most staggering multi-grade level jumps were for those students who had some of the largest academic deficits. We feel that a combination of designated supports such as the bridge class, the overall integrated curriculum, and the focus on making the curriculum relevant and engaging for young people are all key components contributing to this student growth. While this is only a single indicator, it’s incredibly validating and affirming that CCCA is in fact living up to its mission of serving those students most marginalized in our traditional school systems.

Our four-year career experience program is another key differentiator of our school and a CCCA graduation requirement. Over the four-year course of study students will develop a clear understanding of the world of work while building human capital and acquiring tangible industry-recognized certificates. This began in the student’s first semester where every Tuesday and Thursday during students’ 7th and 8th period classes, industry partners came to campus and engaged students in a hands-on learning activity meant to provide insight into a specific aspect of the partner’s company. Activities ranged from bridge building to Building Information Modeling (BIM). Students’ career experience class was strengthened through student participation in the Get Focus Stay Focused curriculum, career fairs, and two college tours. The Chico State tour also included a job site tour with Turner Construction. Half of the student body also participated in a mentorship program with Sacramento State’s Construction Management Program that allowed them to spend Thursdays on the college campus. To kick off semester 2, students will participate in a career fair where students will meet employers and complete a self-ranking tool to help identify potential job shadow partners for the spring.

Field trips throughout the fall included trips to the Sacramento Public Library, the Sacramento State Maker Lab, the Oak Park Maker Space, the aforementioned career fairs, and college campus tours. During the final 6 days of the semester, CCCA held its first ever intersession. Our goal with intersession was to build community and culture while allowing students to explore new and diverse activities that they otherwise would not be exposed to during the course of a school year. During intersession students participated in a wide-range of community centered activities that culminated in a whole school trip to the snow. Day one was a community service day where students were able to choose to work at either Iceland, the CCCA main campus, or on Del Paso Boulevard supporting the Del Paso Boulevard Partnership. Day two was “activity day” where students chose between activities at Pipeworks, Rebounderz, Street Soccer, Mini Golf / Batting Cages, a nature walk, or bowling at Country Club Lanes. For day three of intersession, we collaborated with Alliance for Education Solutions (AES) to run a whole school team building.

day. On day four of intersession, we brought community to CCCA to teach one-off lessons which included cooking, beautician / barbering, knitting, tinkering, and yoga. In the morning of day five we had advisory and staff competitions and then in the afternoon students were able to visit one of the following museums: Sacramento Auto Museum, Sacramento Railroad Museum, Museum of Curiosity or the California Museum. As mentioned above, for the final day, we had a whole school field trip to Boreal where students were provided ski and snowboard rentals, lessons, and lunch.

Throughout the semester but particularly during intersession, we took advantage of regional transit with students and staff travelling on busses and light rail to navigate throughout the city. We feel that being able to navigate public transportation is yet another vital life skill that students can carry with them well into the future. During semester two, we are eager for all that’s to come. We are set to kick off both dual enrollment college classes and our off-campus job shadows, both of which are key differentiators for our school.

While much progress was made academically, we recognize that the social aspects of school are also critical for the positive social emotional development of adolescents. To this end we held a number of student-led events. This included our first ever Trunk-or-Treat event for the North Sacramento community. Culture and Community students put on a winter movie night to benefit a local community organization. We also launched CIF sports which has included fielding a cross country team and a boys and a girls basketball team. We also created a student ambassador program where each advisory class nominated two students to represent their class at a weekly meeting with the principal. We also began holding “Club Fridays” at lunch where every student attended a club of their choosing.

External Support  
Throughout the first semester CCCA has been able to take full advantage of resources provided by a number of funders. For example, Silicon Schools provided additional capital for CCCA to utilize Instructional Partners. Instructional Partners conducted a robust needs assessment and is working with the CCCA instructional team to develop targeted instructional coaching tools to continue moving toward larger school wide strategic goals around teaching and learning. Silicon Schools also provided funding to support the implementation of our current English curriculum, Riveting Results. Additionally, both Silicon Schools and Charter School Growth Fund (CSGF) provided in depth site visit and leadership coaching. CCCA’s Executive Director also attended a multi-day professional development put on by CSGF. He also attended the annual CCEMC dual enrollment summit in the fall.

To support our world language program both the Executive Director and our Mandarin Teacher, Peggy Kao, have worked closely with the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco and other regional Mandarin language programs. Peggy has leveraged her various professional connections to further strengthen the world language program at CCCA. This includes her position as the

**President of the Sacramento Mandarin Chinese Teachers Association.** In December, our Executive Director traveled to Beijing, China to present at the Mandarin World Language Conference and laid the foundation for a Chinese sister school. We hope the sister school partnership will eventually include a cultural exchange program through our Mandarin class, study abroad opportunities for our students, and also foreign exchange students coming to our campus.

**Community Partnerships**

The leadership team at Capital College & Career Academy recognizes that it truly takes a village to raise a child. As such, the team has actively sought out and partnered with a wide range of community partners including: Health Education Council, Alliance for Education Solutions, Marisol Village, Strive Community Health, Street Soccer, Neighborhood Wellness, Roberts Family Development Center, SMUD, Girl Scouts Heart of Central California, the Boys and Girls Club, and Mutual Assistance.

During the first semester, street soccer put on a free after-school soccer program for our students twice a week at Woodlake Park across the street from the main campus. Strive Community Health utilized the facility for their counselor apprenticeship program and contracted with the school to provide a social-emotional counselor. We also repurposed the idea of campus monitors and partnered with Neighborhood Wellness who provided “campus mentors” during lunch time and passing periods.

In addition to formal partnerships, CCCA has sought out opportunities to activate the campus during off hours. We have hosted a SCOE CTE professional development and several community meetings. We are also a certified meeting venue for the Girl Scouts Heart of Central California. We hosted the Capitol Cup Chinese Language Competition and the first annual Middle School Trades Day with the Construction Industry Education Foundation (CIEF).

**LCAP Goals for the 2023 – 2024 School Year**

Capital College & Career Academy is a brand-new charter high school. To develop this initial LCAP, CCCA relied on a wide-range of stakeholders that were instrumental in getting the initial charter petition approved. Additionally, the plan provides a roadmap for us fulfilling the mission and vision of the school which relies heavily on student voice and choice, accountability, and putting educators in the driver’s seat to develop a curriculum that is relevant and engaging for the young people we will serve. Ultimately, the three CCCA LCAP goals and measures are:

1. **Access to robust courses to ensure all students are career prepared and college accelerated**
   - Annual review of credential/authorization status
   - Scope and sequence document includes listed curricular materials for each class
   - Annual ELPAC scores
   - CTE curriculum aligns with college and/or industry standards

**Capital College & Career Academy 2023 – 2024 Interim Board Report Page 9**
<!-- Page 10 -->
- Effective early interventions to support student learning
- College and career readiness
2.) Strong Culture of Innovation
   - Students will earn industry-recognized credentials
   - IEP goal progress
   - Annual school climate survey
   - Attendance data/ADA
3.) Students, parents, and community members will be partners in the educational process who feel welcomed and are afforded numerous opportunities to participate in on-campus and school-wide community events
   - Each family will be partners in the educational process
   - Establish and increase parent learning opportunities centered on student’s current high school plans and future educational and career goals
   - Students are equal partners in the learning process

We believe that these goals will help lay a strong positive foundation for future students and staff to come. We envision that these goals will also carry us into our first WASC study where we can diver deeper into our five-year strategic planning.

**Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) Accreditation Progress**

Capital College & Career Academy moved diligently to initiate our initial WASC visit which is scheduled to occur on March 8th. The leadership team has met with their WASC Chair and has a full agenda outlined for the visit. The CCCA leadership team has also begun engaging staff and has a number of planned meetings in the spring with parents and students to finalize the initial WASC report.

Upon receiving WASC Accreditation, which is a UCOP requirement, CCCA will immediately begin the process of getting its courses A-G accredited.

![Student Recruitment and Demographic Data](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Student+Recruitment+and+Demographic+Data)

**Student Recruitment and Demographic Data**  
**Marketing and Recruitment**  

The Board of Directors and the school site recognizes that the long-term viability of the program is not possible without meeting enrollment projections. To this end, the entire team has made a persistent and concentrated effort to highlight the unique programmatic offerings of the school to recruit current and future students.

CCCA has continued to retain a range of consultants to support our outreach efforts. This includes Jane Einhorn who has over 30 years of public relations experience representing a range of organizations. Thanks to her efforts, CCCA has been featured in all local news outlets. The team also continues to work with Rob Fong, the Former Sacramento City Council member and Sacramento City Unified School District board president. He has helped CCCA build strategic community relationships and share our messaging with a wide range of business and public officials. Jessica Walden has run the school’s social media pages for the last two and a half years and works collaboratively with Larsons Communication, Jane Einhorn, and Rob Fong to deliver CCCA’s strategic outreach plan.

Given the reduced initial enrollment, Silicon Schools provided additional funding to Larsons Communication so that they could provide additional pro bono support. This work has focused on Google ads and strengthening CCCA’s overall search profile via SEO and organic search terms. To support Larsons efforts CCCA’s leadership team has brought on Steadfasters Media to capture student and staff voice on campus, while producing rich visual content to tell further the CCCA story via our website and our social media channels.

With the campus now fully operational the CCCA leadership team continues to find ways to activate the campus by hosting a wide range of events. This, coupled with our after-school programming, has literally brought thousands of guests to the campus in just a few short months. We recognize that word of mouth is a critical piece of recruitment and therefore we have also sought opportunities via our parent committee to have our families present and tabling at as many community events as possible.

Now that recruitment season is underway for the 2024 – 2025 school year we have run campus tours, done phone banking, hung door hangers, and encouraged families to leave online reviews and ratings. We feel that the continued attention and intense focus will pay dividends as we seek to offset our initial enrollment deficit.

**Parental Engagement**  
The Capital College & Career Academy has engaged parents in a wide variety of ways through the first semester. The Executive Director held a “Coffee with the Director” event and a “dual enrollment parent lunch” in the fall. A parent committee was created and helped plan our Trunk-or-Treat event and Spring Formal. Additionally, smaller parent groups are being constructed to help plan and provide feedback for the school-wide WASC report and LCAP. A parent representative will also serve on the school safety committee.

In the first semester parents reported over 110 hours of community service. Parents have supported the community by serving as crossing guards, working community events, and donating materials. Parents have setup carpools assisted with classroom events and participated in campus wide activities. At the end of the first semester every single student led a parent advisor meeting by doing a presentation on their growth within one of CCCA’s five pillars.

Fiscal Updates  
Thanks to the diligence of the CCCA Board of Directors and SCOE staff we entered the school year with multiple financial models. While enrollment has not met initial projections, we have been supported by a strong initial cash balance and continued fundraising efforts. As of January 13th, 2024 CCCA has raised $523,221.75 as depicted in the table below. As shown in the 1st interim report included on page 20, our fundraising efforts are on top of projected and secured supplemental grants which have allowed the team to enhance and expand programming while simultaneously offsetting operational costs.

Some highlights of our current fundraising efforts include the following. In the fall, CCCA was again named a beneficiary for a number of local golf outings which resulted in over $50,000.00 in unrestricted funding. We held our first ever mini golf tournament which brought in an additional $15,000.00. We have also just kicked off our annual golf tournament which has historically been our largest fundraising event of the fiscal year. The school also received significant ARPA funding from the City of Sacramento. $150,000 of which has already been invoiced and another $150,000 has been promised.

The team will continue to aggressively pursue any and all applicable grant and fundraising dollars while simultaneously continuing its outreach and marketing efforts to offset the initial enrollment deficit.

**Borrowing**

Capital College & Career Academy’s leadership team and board of directors take seriously their fiduciary responsibility. The board has discussed finances at every board meeting since the school year began. As a brand-new start-up school, we have to balance the monthly cash flow demands with the risk of incurring additional debt. To this end, CCCA has only incurred one long term loan, the CSFA Revolving Loan which was described in all iterations of our charter petition. The Charter School Finance Authority (CSFA) offers this $250,000 revolving loan at favorable terms to essentially all start up schools. The revolving loan is tied to our principal apportionment and provides $62,500 each year for four years (years 2 – 5 of operation).

The remaining borrowing are actually cash advances tied to existing funding sources. The Five Star Bank cash advance is for pre-approved PCSGP costs. The loan is secured by the PCSGP claim and repayment is made as soon as the reimbursements take place which is typically a quarter after expenditures are made. CCCA only finalized this cash advance after it signed both the startup and implementation grant GANs. Communication has been ongoing with CDE since the start of the school year to ensure transparency around enrollment and long-term fiscal projections. While not expected based on our communications with CDE, in the event that there was a pause on repayment, there would be no impact on CCCA’s operational budget thanks to the cash advance and favorable repayment schedule provided by Five Star Bank. The second is a cash advance of $9,057 from the EDCOE SELPA for our year one special education costs. This allows us to have cash on hand as we provide services instead of waiting until after the school year when the funding normally arrives. It is also important to understand that because the cash advance is directly from the SELPA, they will collect this amount from CCCA’s special education payments in June in July.
