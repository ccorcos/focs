Lee Miller has been living in the Vineyard/Vintage Park area in Sacramento County for almost half a century. She and her husband have been married for more than 30 years. For the majority of her working years, Lee was involved in the tech industry, working for companies such as SAP and Oracle as a project manager and consultant. Beginning in 2000, she worked at Intel in Folsom as an IT project manager for 15 years before finally retiring in 2014. Overall, Lee spent most of her working years in the IT field.

Since retiring, Lee has found enjoyment in creating art. She works predominantly in the medium of fused glass but also experiments with gourds, and wet and nuno felting.

She also leads a group of 25 Intel employees and retirees who live in various states in the Intel PC Pal program. The school is a Title 1 school located in Sacramento County. PC Pals is an email mentoring program where Intel employees email a student twice a week. The mentors encourage, inspire, and guide young people throughout the school year to work hard and be successful in school. The program is a very worthwhile activity, providing the opportunity for students to gain computer experience with just a minimal time commitment from Intel employees. The school receives up to $15,000 per school year by participating.

Lee is also actively involved in the FIRST LEGO League for a middle school local school in Sacramento County. FIRST LEGO League introduces science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to children ages 4-16 through fun, exciting hands-on learning. Participants gain real-world problem-solving experiences through a guided, global robotics program, helping today's students and teachers build a better future together.
