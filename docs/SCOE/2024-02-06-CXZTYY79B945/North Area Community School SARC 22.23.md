# General Information about the School Accountability Report Card (SARC)

## SARC Overview
By February 1 of each year, every school in California is required by state law to publish a School Accountability Report Card (SARC). The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. Under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) all local educational agencies (LEAs) are required to prepare a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP), which describes how they intend to meet annual school-specific goals for all pupils, with specific activities to address state and local priorities. Additionally, data reported in an LCAP is to be consistent with data reported in the SARC.

- For more information about SARC requirements and access to prior year reports, see the California Department of Education (CDE) SARC web page at [CDE SARC](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/sa/).
- For more information about the LCFF or the LCAP, see the CDE LCFF web page at [CDE LCFF](https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/).
- For additional information about the school, parents/guardians and community members should contact the school principal or the district office.

## DataQuest
DataQuest is an online data tool located on the CDE DataQuest web page at [DataQuest](https://dq.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/) that contains additional information about this school and comparisons of the school to the district and the county. Specifically, DataQuest is a dynamic system that provides reports for accountability (e.g., test data, enrollment, high school graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, and data regarding English learners).

## California School Dashboard
The California School Dashboard (Dashboard) [California School Dashboard](https://www.caschooldashboard.org/) reflects California’s new accountability and continuous improvement system and provides information about how LEAs and schools are meeting the needs of California’s diverse student population. The Dashboard contains reports that display the performance of LEAs, schools, and student groups on a set of state and local measures to assist in identifying strengths, challenges, and areas in need of improvement.

## Internet Access
Internet access is available at public libraries and other locations that are publicly accessible (e.g., the California State Library). Access to the Internet at libraries and public locations is generally provided on a first-come, first-served basis. Other use restrictions may include the hours of operation, the length of time that a workstation may be used (depending on availability), the types of software programs available on a workstation, and the ability to print documents.

# 2023-24 School Description and Mission Statement

**Principal's Message:**  
North Area Community School is dedicated to helping youth reach their full potential academically, behaviorally, and socially. While the focus at North Area Community School is academic success, teachers and staff understand that before learning can occur, we must first address deeper issues that often impeded academic success. Once emotional needs are addressed, students can increase their academic competencies, earn credit, gain job skills, graduate from high school, develop self-efficacy, and transition into a post-secondary environment. In addition to providing strong social-emotional supports, the staff works with students to develop an individual success plan created to help set realistic goals they can accomplish while at our school. Our students engage in data-driven instruction designed to accelerate learning based on the student’s individual strengths. We provide a small campus setting with a modified schedule that allows staff and students to forge close, trusting relationships. Each student is encouraged to participate in mentoring and extracurricular activities. Guest speakers, assemblies, field trips, vocational goal setting, career exploration/readiness, and academic tutoring are all available for our students.

North Area Community School serves students in grades 7-12, who live within school districts in the north and northwest portions of Sacramento County and may be referred by school districts, the Probation Department, or School Attendance Review Boards (SARB). Our curriculum is aligned to California State Standards and is infused with career technical education to provide learning experiences for each student. Our goal is to address the needs of students who would benefit from a nontraditional school setting. We treat each student with dignity and respect and create an environment where students thrive. Students typically attend the school for two semesters before returning to their home district or completing their education with a high school diploma.

### School Facility Conditions and Planned Improvements

North Area Community High School consists of six student classroom areas, a multipurpose room and an administration building. A safe and clean environment is provided for students and staff by full-time SCOE maintenance and custodial personnel assigned to the site. All necessary repairs are addressed and completed promptly using a work order System. Cleaning schedules ensure proper cleaning of the site on a daily, weekly and quarterly basis. Ongoing inspections ensure the site meets or exceeds good repair standards.

**State Priority: Pupil Achievement**  
The SARC provides the following information relevant to the State priority: Pupil Achievement (Priority 4):

**Statewide Assessments**  
(i.e., California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress [CAASPP] System includes the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for students in the general education population and the California Alternate Assessments [CAAs] for English language arts/literacy [ELA] and mathematics given in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Only eligible students may participate in the administration of the CAAs. CAAs items are aligned with alternate achievement standards, which are linked with the Common Core State Standards [CCSS] for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities).

The CAASPP System encompasses the following assessments and student participation requirements:
1. Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments and CAAs for ELA in grades three through eight and grade eleven.
2. Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments and CAAs for mathematics in grades three through eight and grade eleven.
3. California Science Test (CAST) and CAAs for Science in grades five, eight, and once in high school (i.e., grade ten, eleven, or twelve).

**College and Career Ready**  
The percentage of students who have successfully completed courses that satisfy the requirements for entrance to the University of California and the California State University, or career technical education sequences or programs of study.

---

**Percentage of Students Meeting or Exceeding the State Standard on CAASPP**  
This table displays CAASPP test results in ELA and mathematics for all students grades three through eight and grade eleven taking and completing a state-administered assessment.

Percentages are not calculated when the number of students tested is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.

ELA and mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment and the CAA. The “Percent Met or Exceeded” is calculated by taking the total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved Level 3-Alterate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.

### 2022-23 CAASPP Test Results in Math by Student Group

This table displays CAASPP test results in Math by student group for students grades three through eight and grade eleven taking and completing a state-administered assessment.

Mathematics test results include the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment and the CAA. The “Percent Met or Exceeded” is calculated by taking the total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved Level 3-Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.

Double dashes (–) appear in the table when the number of students is ten or less, either because the number of students in this category is too small for statistical accuracy or to protect student privacy.

The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.

## CAASPP Test Results in Science for All Students

This table displays the percentage of all students grades five, eight, and High School meeting or exceeding the State Standard.

Science test results include the CAST and the CAA. The “Percent Met or Exceeded” is calculated by taking the total number of students who met or exceeded the standard on the CAST plus the total number of students who met the standard (i.e., achieved Level 3-Alternate) on the CAAs divided by the total number of students who participated in both assessments.

The number of students tested includes all students who participated in the test whether they received a score or not; however, the number of students tested is not the number that was used to calculate the achievement level percentages. The achievement level percentages are calculated using only students who received scores.
