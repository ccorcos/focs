At the July 11, 2023 Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE) Board Meeting, CCCA reported an expected 72 students enrolled for the first day of the 2023 – 2024 school year. Of the 72, 22 enrolled in other schools. Reasons students enrolled in other schools included transportation issues, families moving, and parent decision.

Since starting the school year with 50 students, CCCA has maintained an enrollment of 50 students, including two students who left to attend other schools, and two that transferred into CCCA mid semester in the Fall. Furthermore, all 50 students remained enrolled after the Winter Break to start their second semester at CCCA. Finally, the site reports an average daily attendance rate of 93% for the first semester for the 50 students.

### 2024 - 2025 Application Status

For the incoming ninth grade class, as of January 19, 2024, there are 24 students who have applied or are in the process of applying for the 2024 – 2025 school year. This is slightly more than this time last year.

From interviews of current students and families, all 50 of the current students plan to return to CCCA for the 2024 – 2025 school year. There are currently two students who are finalizing their enrollment paperwork to join CCCA this semester.

The goal is to enroll 165 students for the 2024 – 2025 school year.

### Program Recruitment and Outreach Status

CCCA has conducted over 100 recruitment and outreach events since before the school opened in August, through January of 2024. Kevin Dobson has provided a list of many of these events previously to the Board and will address this in his report. In addition to this, the school has also increased signage at the site, and is planning for targeted recruitment at new housing on Arden Way, and in the new Marisol Village Development in North Sacramento.

# Parent Outreach Status

CCCA has worked diligently to keep parents informed and to involve them in planning and implementation of their school program. The site has had multiple parent meetings, with upcoming meetings tied to WASC planned. Other opportunities for parents include Coffee with the Director, Lunch with the Director, and dual enrollment registration meetings. Many parents have also received personal tours of the site.

## Teacher Staffing

All CCCA teachers are appropriately credentialed at this time. Some continue in credential programs, earning their clear teaching credentials.

From interviews with staff, as of January 2024, all plan to return to CCCA for the 2024 – 2025 school year.

CCCA staff currently is sufficient enough to meet the growth of the ninth and tenth grade students next year. If they increase enrollment as projected, they plan to hire an additional Social Studies teacher.

## ACADEMIC PROGRAM

Prior to the opening of school, CCCA had completed all of the applicable items in Schedule A of the MOU. This includes the hiring of 6 credentialed teachers, an educational specialist, development of policy development, planning of professional development, and the purchasing of all equipment, furniture, and instructional materials. Currently there are 8 teachers offering instruction, including the 6 credentialed teachers, the education specialist, and the Academy Director.

The courses offered to 9th grade students include the following:

- English 9
- Applied Construction Math (Integrated Math equivalent)
- Getting to Zero Carbon (Science)
- Physical Education
- Mandarin (World Language)
- Introductory Craft Skills (Career Technical Education)
- English/Math Bridge (Intervention)
- Culture and Community
- Innovation, Design, and Implementation (IDI)

The student schedule is an alternating block schedule with students taking core classes on alternating days. Students take English, Math, Science, Physical Education, Mandarin, and Introductory Craft Skills on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. On Tuesday and Thursday, classes are scheduled for enrichment and intervention, including dual enrollment coursework for the second semester. Currently 32 students.

![CCCA Mid-Year Report Page 4](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=CCCA+Mid-Year+Report+Page+4)

are scheduled to attend an asynchronous Human Career Development dual enrollment class at American River College in Spring of 2024. CCCA has a fully executed dual enrollment Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Los Rios Community College District. The other 18 students are in academic intervention classes currently. Furthermore, all students have either obtained their OSHA Safety Training Certification or are in the process of finishing the certificate by the end of the semester.

There is also daily academic enrichment time before and after school that provides students time for academic support, including support by peer tutors. After the first semester, 38 students earned all 40 credits, 4 earned 35, 2 earned 30, and the remaining 6 between 5 and 20 credits. In addition, all 50 students have completed certifications in CPR and First Aid.

A copy of the CCCA Course Catalog is included in this report as Attachment A.

### Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC)

CCCA’s initial WASC visit is scheduled for March 8, 2024. John Pellman and Kevin Dobson have been trained and have been involving students and staff in the WASC process. Parents began their involvement in Fall, and will continue in February. The vision of the CCCA WASC self-study and plan is to align it as closely as possible to the school’s overall vision and charter.

### UC A – G Requirements

The site will submit courses for UC A – G approval, once they receive WASC accreditation. CCCA cannot submit any coursework for approval until they are accredited by WASC. These courses will be for multiple years, so once approved, all students will have A – G credit on their transcripts. So once CCCA receives its initial WASC accreditation, the school will be able to submit courses for A – G approval for ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade.

### Student Academic Support

Students are supported academically through the bridge program on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This course is offered for students who are significantly behind academically. During the first semester 96% of students saw growth in either English and/or Mathematics, as measured by iReady, and by teacher observation and assessment.

Other academic supports include daily academic enrichment time, and special programming during intersession, where students who struggled in classes were allowed extra time to complete tasks in order to pass classes.

![Social-Emotional Support](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
**Social-Emotional Support**  
CCCA has a variety of ways to meet the social emotional needs of its students. For example, CCCA contracts with Neighborhood Wellness who provide adult mentors at no cost to support students, including during lunch and passing periods. In a more traditional setting, this would be a campus monitor position, however Neighborhood Wellness staff involve themselves much more than security, mentoring students and getting to know CCCA students to support and encourage them behaviorally and academically in the smaller CCCA school setting.  

CCCA also works with STRIVE Community Health for counseling services through their interns. STRIVE interns can support students in academics and social-emotional matters, including Restorative Practices.  

**FACILITIES STATUS**  
The CCCA school site at 501 Arden Way has been up and running since the start of school on August 3, 2023. The site makes creative use of the commercial site to meet the needs of both the Career Technical Education and academic programs. For example, there is a shop where students have created CTE projects like birdhouses. There are also Science labs, technology spaces, and traditional classrooms that are currently in use. There is also enough space for future growth of grade levels.  

All County inspections and the certificate of occupancy were successfully completed prior to the school’s opening. SCOE staff also completed their site inspection. Some work is still pending. CCCA’s new heat and air conditioning units were set to be installed prior to the end of November. These site permits will be finalized after their switchgear arrives in late Spring of 2024. This equipment installation only impacts the unoccupied portable classrooms.  

Salvador Lorta, Facilities Coordinator for Sacramento County Office of Education, has inspected both CCCA’s main site at 501 Arden Way, Sacramento, and the satellite site they plan to open this semester in the Boys and Girls Club of America facility at 1117 G Street, Sacramento. Both facilities were inspected for safety and environmental comfort and were found to be clean, and the classrooms meet all the standards needed.

### Ending Fund Balance  
|                |           |            |             |  
|----------------|-----------|------------|-------------|  
|                | 530,572   | 215,554    | (315,018)   |  

The revised CCCA budget projects an ending fund balance of $215,554 for 2023-2024 which is significantly lower than the $530,572 ending fund balance projected in the budget presented at the July 11, 2023, Board meeting. This is primarily due to the following:  

---

CCCA Mid-Year Report Page 6
<!-- Page 7 -->
- General purpose Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) revenue being lower on account of enrollment being 35% lower than projected;
- The addition of capital outlay expenditures for facilities improvement, capital equipment and vans; and
- Increased staffing needs.

CCCA is able to maintain a positive fund balance through receipt of a one-time grant from the City of Sacramento and a combination of short and long-term loans. CCCA projects enrollment will more than triple in 2024-2025 and, as a result, it will have a $413,822 operating surplus that year. However, the ending fund balance will only increase to $262,347 due to the need to pay off short-term loans. More detail on these projections is provided in the following sections.

**Enrollment**

CCCA’s financial condition depends on its ability to meet enrollment and attendance projections. Enrollment and attendance are the driving factors underlying the charter’s largest single source of funding, the LCFF revenue. As noted above, CCCA’s enrollment for 2023-2024 is significantly lower than anticipated resulting in $401,748 less LCFF revenue.

For 2024-2025, CCCA projects enrollment to increase from 50 to 165 students due to adding a grade level and additional recruiting efforts. However, if enrollment only doubled to 100, LCFF revenue would be over $900,000 lower than projected for that year.

**Grants**

CCCA’s budget includes $519,197 ($386,649 in 2023-2024 and $132,548 in 2024-2025) in one-time funding from the Public Charter Schools Grant Program (PCSGP). However, the state placed most of the PCSGP funding on hold until CCCA can demonstrate its fiscal sustainability or increase its enrollment to 80 or more students.

**Fundraising**

CCCA’s budget continues to be heavily reliant on fundraising. The budget assumes $617,000 in donor contributions during 2023-2024. By mid-January, CCCA had raised a little over $523,000 in donor contributions for the year. For 2024-2025, CCCA reduces its projection of donor contributions to $370,000.

**Borrowing**

To date, CCCA has obtained several operating loans including:
- $250,000 from the California School Finance Authority which will be repaid from 2024-2025 through 2027-2028;

CCCA Mid-Year Report Page 7
<!-- Page 8 -->
- $9,057 from the El Dorado Charter Special Education Local Plan Area which will be repaid when CCCA receives its Special Education funding; and
- $368,631 from Five Star Bank which will be repaid when CCCA receives its PCSGP funding.

Summary  
CCCA’s budget includes considerable risk mainly related to its enrollment and the delay in receiving its full PCSGP award. If CCCA does not receive the remainder of its PCSGP funding or if enrollment is lower than anticipated in 2024-2025, CCCA will need to significantly reduce staffing and expenditures and increase donor contributions and grant revenues in order to pay its loans and remain solvent.

We advise CCCA to reduce its reliance on fundraising and refrain from additional borrowing to support ongoing operational expenses. We also request that CCCA prepare and submit a contingency budget for 2024-2025 that assumes much lower increases in enrollment and reduced donor contribution and grant revenues to ensure that it can remain solvent in that year.
