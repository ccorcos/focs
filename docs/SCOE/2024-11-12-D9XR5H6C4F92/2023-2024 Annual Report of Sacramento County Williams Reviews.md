# 2023-2024 Annual Report of Sacramento County Williams Reviews
**November 12, 2024**

## Williams Reviews

As a result of the Williams Settlement, Education Code section 1240 requires the county superintendent of schools to visit schools identified in the county, review information concerning the issue areas noted below, and report the results of the visits and reviews at a regularly scheduled November meeting. The information below summarizes the results of reviews SCOE conducted throughout the 2023-2024 school year.

Six SCOE staff and 19 exempt temporary employees visited 119 schools in 9 school districts within Sacramento County. They reviewed the sufficiency of standards-aligned instructional materials for 1,805 classrooms and facility conditions in 2,933 areas within the schools.

The results for these visits and reviews are as follows:

### Instructional Materials
All Williams Schools had sufficient instructional materials in 2023-2024.

### Facilities
Staff visited and evaluated 121 school sites (two of the schools on the list have split campuses). The overall facility conditions for the 121 sites visited were as follows:
- 97 schools were found to be in exemplary condition,
- 24 schools were found to be in good condition,
- 0 schools were found to be in fair condition,
- 0 schools were found to be in poor condition, and
- All Williams schools in the Center, Elk Grove, Folsom Cordova, Natomas, and River Delta school districts were in exemplary condition.

### School Accountability Report Cards
SCOE staff reviewed whether School Accountability Report Cards (SARCs) were accurate as to the sufficiency of instructional materials, and the safety, cleanliness, and adequacy of school facilities for the Williams schools. All SARCs were found to be reasonably accurate and generally complete with a few exceptions that were detailed in the Third Quarterly Reports to the districts.

### Teacher Vacancies and Misassignments
The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) provided final teacher misassignment and vacancy data for the 2022-2023 school year utilizing the monitoring system (CalSAAS). (Ed. Code, § 44258.9.) The monitoring window for review and correction of 2022-2023 data concluded October 31, 2023.

A misassignment is when a certificated employee is placed in a teaching or services position for which the employee does not hold a legally recognized certificate or credential or is otherwise not authorized to hold the position. CCTC recognizes “corrected misassignments” as teacher misassignments that are corrected prior to an exception report being generated in CalSAAS at the beginning of the monitoring period. While these are still considered misassignments, CCTC differentiates them in its reporting.

A vacancy is a position to which a single designated certificated employee has not been assigned at the time the data is being collected. For the reviewed Williams Schools, there were a total of 210 teacher misassignments, 52 corrected misassignments, and 173 teacher vacancies as follows:
