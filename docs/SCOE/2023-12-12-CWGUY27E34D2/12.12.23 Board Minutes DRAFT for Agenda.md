the California Policy Collaborative on behalf of, and in partnership with, the California County Superintendents. Attendees represented state senate and assembly members, committees, caucuses, and community partners. An article about the visit is posted online.

On December 4, a study authored by Sarah Novicoff and Thomas S. Dee from Stanford University was published, focused on the results of the Early Literacy Support Block Grant and highlighted the advancement students made. SCOE was noted in the study as the Expert Lead for the grant. Once published, the research paper received wide media attention from national, state, and local media outlets. Becky Sullivan, Director of K-12 English Language Arts, did a fabulous job as SCOE’s spokesperson. SCOE received prominent mention in the following media: The New York Times, Public TV (KQED), CalMatters, EdWeek, EdSource, The Hechinger Report, KCRA, and NPR.

At the 105th California Farm Bureau Annual Meeting last week, the California Foundation for Agriculture in the Classroom recognized last year’s SCOE Teacher of the Year Kevin Jordan with an “Outstanding Educator Award” for his dedicated work introducing students to agriculture. Kevin is our science and horticulture teacher at Leo A. Palmiter Jr./Sr. High School.

BUSINESS UPDATE  
SCOE was awarded $400M by the Department of Health Care Services to expand access to school-based behavioral health services at school sites throughout the state. We are working closely with the Santa Clara Office of Education to support the implementation of a Fee Schedule to bill Medi-Cal managed care plans and commercial health plans to expand mental health and wellness supports. This funding will be allocated to County Offices of Education (COEs) and school districts throughout the state to implement this work over the next two years.

Another exciting update has to do with the arts and Proposition 28. Dr. Steven Winlock, Executive Director of the School of Education, and Jackie White, Assistant Superintendent of SCOE Schools and Student Programs, led a recent California County Superintendents Region 3 Arts Convoking. SCOE partnered with the California County Superintendents and the Director of State Arts Initiatives, Letty Kraus, at a convening of COEs, districts, and arts organizations that focused on supporting the implementation of new arts funding through Prop 28.

EVENTS  
On December 6, Technology Services hosted a meeting for network administrators from our county and the surrounding region. More than 30 technical staff attended to learn about a new system that can help make their networks more secure and easier to manage. Additionally, Jerry Jones, Executive Director of Technology Services and Steve Monahan from the Butte County Office of Education, provided a hands-on disaster recovery training to more than 100 technology leaders from around the state at the California IT in Education Conference.

Today, Graciela-Garcia Torres, Curriculum Specialist of our English Learner and Seal of Biliteracy programs, led a statewide conference for more than 350 California educators focused on Effective Language Acquisition Programs and elevating instruction for multilingual English learner students. Mai Xi Lee, Director of Social Emotional Learning (SEL), will lead professional learning networks this December centered on SEL. More than 175 educators are expected to attend workshops that kick off on December 14 and 15 with the statewide CalHOPE CoP on December 19, which is typically attended by close to 100 county leaders.

At all levels, and together with many educational partners, a great deal of SEL learning and collaboration is happening. Over five hundred educators have completed the SEL Foundations graduate-level course at the University of California, Berkeley and the feedback has been positive. More than 3,500 California educators have signed up for the Greater Good Science Center SEL modules. Greater than 19,000 educator engagements have been in SEL Communities of Practice across the (4,358 unique educators). 103,270 students and 19,173 adults have completed an SEL Kelvin pulse.

Assistant Superintendent White and her team will celebrate another El Centro graduation on December 13 with three graduates. On December 14, we will honor 132 graduates at the Scottish Rite Temple for the Senior Extension Graduation. In January, El Centro plans to celebrate two graduates who will earn their AA in Sociology through Lake Tahoe Community College.

**SEASON OF GIVING**  
El Centro Jr./Sr. High School Library presents “Books Break Barriers” and seeks donations to the Youth Detention Facility, El Centro High School Library. The Season of Giving Holiday Meal Program in partnership with PRO Youth & Family Collective, and the College & Career Readiness Department are facilitating a holiday meal drive. Meals will be provided to families from El Centro, Elinor L. Hickey, Nathaniel S. Colley, Senior Extension, and the CARE program. The Adopt-a-Family Program through the SCOE Foundations Academy and Early Learning Department will supply holiday baskets to families in need who were nominated by teachers. We also have the Gary K. Hart Resiliency Scholarship, which is another giving opportunity. For our local community, SCOE employees are contributing to the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Toy Drive with donations of unwrapped new toys, clothing, hygiene items, shoes, and gift cards for children.

**CLOSING COMMENTS**  
SCOE will host Winter Wonderland 2023 on December 20 at the DPMEC. We start at 8:00 a.m. with a festive meet-n-greet, and various departments are hosting the Gingerbread Lane Tour throughout the day. At noon, join us for SCOE Team Time and the Ugly Sweater Contest in the Mather Room.

A beautiful and colorful display of Hmong New Year was arranged in the lobby by a group of Hmong staff inspired by Connie Lee, Director of Family and Community.
