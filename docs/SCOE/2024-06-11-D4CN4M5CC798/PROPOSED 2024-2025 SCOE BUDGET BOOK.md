# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## I. BACKGROUND

In January 2024, the Superintendent’s Cabinet and Program Managers began budget development activities for fiscal year 2024-2025. The development of the 2024-2025 budget will follow the single-budget adoption cycle. The process requires the County Board to hold a public hearing and adopt the 2024-2025 budget by July 1. The process also requires that no later than 45 days after the governor signs the annual Budget Act, the County Office of Education make available for public review any revisions in revenues and expenditures that it has made to its budget to reflect the funding made available by the Budget Act.

## II. 2024/25 ADOPTED BUDGET

The following pages contain the Superintendent’s financial proposal for the 2024-2025 fiscal year. A public hearing on the budget is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. on June 11, 2024 at the County Office. The budget adoption meeting is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. on June 25, 2024 at the County Office. Periodic revisions will be necessary during fiscal year 2024-2025 to keep the budget current with changing circumstances.

## III. BUDGET ASSUMPTIONS

Major budget adjustments are rounded approximations which include:

- **Beginning Balances:** 2024/25 beginning balances for programs and funds are from the 2023-2024 Budget Revision #3. Actual ending balances to be carried forward will be known when the 2023-2024 accounts are closed.

- **Decrease in Federal Revenue of $7 million**, with the following significant adjustments:
  - A decrease of $3.1 million to reflect that most of the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief grant funds have been received and spent.
  - A decrease of $2.5 million in School of Education Leadership Division grant funding.
  - A decrease of $620,000 in County Alcohol and Drug Prevention program funding.
  - A decrease of $401,000 in grant funding for the Student Mental Health and Wellness Support program.

- **Decrease in State Revenue of $10.1 million**, with the following significant adjustments:
  - A decrease of $4.8 million in Educator Workforce Investment Grant: Computer Science grant funds.
  - A decrease of $4.2 million in Curriculum Development Projects and Dyslexia Grant funding.
  - A decrease of $2.3 million in Local Control Funding Formula Equity Multiplier revenue for the Juvenile Court and the Community Schools. This funding will be added back in a future budget revision once data is available to estimate the amount that will be received in 2024-2025.
  - An increase of $1.2 million in funding to support the California Community Schools Partnership Program.

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

- Decrease in Local Revenue of $35.7 million, with the following significant adjustments:
  - A decrease of $34.7 million to reflect that most of the Project CalHOPE Student Support grant funds have been received and spent.
  - A decrease of $976,000 due to an anticipated reduction in interest revenue.

- Increase of $2.2 million in Certificated Salaries and an increase of $3.1 million in Classified Salaries due to compensation increases agreed to in last year’s collective bargaining agreements and filling of vacancies.

- Increase of $2.7 million in Employee Benefits due to increases in pension rates and increases in health premiums.

- Decrease of $765,000 in Books and Supplies primarily due to the federal Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief grants being mostly spent in prior years and a reduction in General Support Services purchases.

- Decrease of $42.7 million in Services and Other Operating Expenses, with the following significant adjustments:
  - A decrease of $34.5 million due to the decrease in Project CalHOPE Student Support grant funds available to be passed on to other County Offices of Education.
  - A decrease of $5.0 million in career technical education services funded by Educator Workforce Investment Grants.
  - A decrease of $1.5 million in services funded by Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief grants.
  - A decrease of $1.5 million in services provided by the School of Education Leadership Division.
  - A decrease of $895,000 for System of Support for Expanded Learning program services.
  - A decrease of $737,000 for System of Support Geographic Lead Agency services. These costs will be added back in a future budget revision when the amount of grant funding for this program in the coming year’s is known.
  - A decrease of $656,000 in County Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention services.
  - An increase of $2.2 million in services funded by the Literacy Coaches and Reading Specialist Grant.

- Decrease of $1.8 million in Capital Outlay due to the completion of projects at Sly Park and school infrastructure improvements funded by Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief grants.

The indirect rate for 2024/25 remains at 8.90% and the estimated total is $9.3 million.

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## IV. GOVERNOR’S MAY REVISION / OTHER ITEMS TO BE CONSIDERED

In May 2024, Governor Gavin Newsom released the 2024-2025 May Revision to the Governor’s Budget. As a result of lower than anticipated state revenues, the May Revision projects a state budget deficit which is addressed through drawing down reserves, spending reductions, new revenue proposals, internal borrowing, funding delays, fund shifts, and deferrals. Even though the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee is reduced due to the lower state revenues, the May Revision does not include significant reductions to education programs but does fund a small cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for schools. The reduction in the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee is offset and the COLA is funded by accounting shifts from 2022-2023 to future fiscal years and Proposition 98 reserve withdrawals.

The Local Control Funding Formula, Special Education, Child Nutrition, Adult Education Block Grant, Mandate Block Grant, Foster Youth Programs, and other categorical programs will receive a 1.07% COLA. There are no other significant funding adjustments proposed at this time. However, the state budget has not yet been approved by the state legislature, which may choose to adopt alternatives to the budget solutions included in the May Revision, such as reductions to education programs. The impact on the Sacramento County Office of Education’s budget of any such actions will be included in a future budget revision.

The County Office also expects to receive significant additional state funding to continue its support of mental health and wellness in schools statewide. In addition, several major facilities maintenance projects are anticipated in 2024-2025, but the expenditure of these funds for specific projects is not yet reflected in the budget. These anticipated additional revenues and associated expenditures, along with facilities maintenance expenditures, will also be included in a future budget revision when they are known.

## SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING  

**BRENT MALICOTE, ASSOCIATE SUPERINTENDENT**  

**PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:**  
Social–emotional learning (SEL) is foundational to education and critical to any organization’s health, wellbeing, and climate/culture. Equitable conditions that promote SEL skills development are crucial for academic success, engagement, and connected relationships. In addition, advancing equity and social justice through SEL instruction—a practice known as transformative SEL—promotes key constructs of identity, curiosity, collaboration, and more.  

SCOE is creating pathways that help incorporate SEL and transformative SEL into everyday practices, policies, and procedures, including professional learning opportunities and communities of practice. Curated tools and resources supporting SEL implementation are also being made available.  

SCOE leads the CalHOPE SEL partnership and supports a statewide community of practice for all 58 county offices of education. In collaboration with the California Department of Health Services, Orange County Department of Education, The Center for Implementation, and the University of California, Berkeley. The partnership is working to support SEL implementation across all counties in California through shared resources, professional development, collaborative networking, and more.

## CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY (CARES) ACT

### NANCY HEROTA, Ed.D., DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT

### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:

In response to the Coronavirus Disease/COVID-19, the U.S. Congress passed the CARES Act. This relief package provided the County Office with emergency relief funds to address the impact COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, on our students and staff. The two main funding sources are Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Funds and Learning Loss Mitigation Funds (LLMF). The LLMF is further comprised of three funding sources, Governor’s Emergency Education Relief (GEER), Coronavirus Relief (CR) and the State’s General Fund (GF). The County Office’s CARES Act funds are being used as follows: support pupil academic achievement and learning loss mitigation through the purchase of technology hardware and software; professional development; comprehensive support for students; compliance with local health ordinances; and maintain operations, continuity of services and continued employment of County Office staff.

Accelerating Collect Transition (ACT): SCOE provides a week-long Counselor Summer Institute for community college and high school counselors. A Career Technical Education pathway mapping website informs counselors, students, parents, teachers, and the community about high school pathways, adult education programs, and college guided pathways.

Information Communications Technologies (ICT) Hub: SCOE created an ICT Hub that will support the development of ICT pathways by providing professional development for ICT teachers and students, create ICT Communities of Practice, and form a technical assistance network. The ICT Hub staff will focus on assisting school districts throughout Northern California in creating ICT classes and pathways for all students.

## RE-ENTRY PROGRAMS

**CHRISTI FEE, DIRECTOR**

### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:

The Sacramento County Office of Education Re-Entry Programs are specifically designed for men and women re-entering the community from state prison, jail, or those currently on probation. The primary purpose of the Re-Entry Programs is to address the causes of offending behavior and assist clients in developing a successful re-entry plan. Staff provides participants with comprehensive services based on an individual’s unique needs in the areas of life skills, academics, job readiness and treatment areas. Services are available to both clients and their families during the often overwhelming transition from prison to home. We work in partnership with clients to promote productive experiences and help them overcome barriers.

### PROGRAM SITES:
- Sacramento Community Based Coalition
- Woodland Day Reporting Center

Priority service delivery focuses on children with an Individual Family Service Plan, families experiencing homelessness in Sacramento County, and communities of Sacramento County where transportation issues, limited services, and community resources pose a challenge for families.
