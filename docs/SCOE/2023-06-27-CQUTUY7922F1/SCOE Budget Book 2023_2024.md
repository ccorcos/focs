![EXECUTIVE SUMMARY](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=EXECUTIVE+SUMMARY)

**BACKGROUND**  
In January 2023, the Superintendent’s Cabinet and Program Managers began budget development activities for fiscal year 2023/24. The development of the 2023/24 budget will follow the single-budget adoption cycle. The process requires the County Board to hold a public hearing and adopt the 2023/24 budget by July 1. The process also requires that no later than 45 days after the governor signs the annual Budget Act, the County Office of Education make available for public review any revisions in revenues and expenditures that it has made to its budget to reflect the funding made available by the Budget Act.

**2023/24 ADOPTED BUDGET**  
The following pages contain the Superintendent’s financial proposal for the 2023/24 fiscal year. A public hearing on the budget is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. on June 13, 2023 at the County Office. The budget adoption meeting is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. on June 27, 2023 at the County Office. Periodic revisions will be necessary during fiscal year 2023/24 to keep the budget current with changing circumstances.

**BUDGET ASSUMPTIONS**  
- **Beginning Balances:** 2023/24 beginning balances for programs and funds are from the 2022/23 Budget Revision #3. Actual ending balances to be carried forward will be known when the 2022/23 accounts are closed.
  
- **Decrease in Federal Revenue of $698,000, with the following significant adjustments:**
  - An increase of $1.9 million in Title II A grant funding for the School of Education.
  - A decrease of $1.3 million in School-Based Student Mental Health and Wellness Program grant funds.
  - A decrease of $654,000 in County Alcohol and Drug Prevention program grant funds.
  - A decrease of $658,000 in ESSA School Improvement support grant funds.

- **Decrease in State Revenue of $5.4 million, with the following significant adjustments:**
  - A decrease of $1.6 million for Community Schools to delay budgeting the Learning Recovery Block Grant until after the federal ESSER III grant funds have been fully spent and to reflect that most of the California Community Schools Partnership Program Planning Grant funds have been received and spent.
  - A decrease of $1.3 million due to the expiration of the Geographic Lead Agency grant.
  - A decrease of $887,000 due to the expiration of the contract to administer the California High School Proficiency Exam.
  - A decrease of $665,000 due to the expiration of the Safe Zone Squad grant.
  - A decrease of $498,000 due to a reduction in Curriculum Development Projects program grant funds.
  - A decrease of $457,000 due to the expiration of the K12 Strong Workforce Program grant funds.

  - An increase of $7.4 million in Educator Workforce Investment Grant funding.

- Increase of $2.2 million in Certificated Salaries and an increase of $3.4 million in Classified Salaries due to compensation increases, normal step/column increases and filling of vacancies.

- Increase of $1.8 million in Employee Benefits due to the 2023/24 increase in PERS/ STRS rates and increase in health premiums.

- Decrease of $1.1 million in Books and Supplies primarily due to the federal ESSER II grant being fully spent in prior years and a reduction in General Support Services purchases.

- Decrease of $8.6 million in Services and Other Operating Expenses, with the following significant adjustments:

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## GOVERNOR’S MAY REVISION / OTHER ITEMS TO BE CONSIDERED

In May 2023, Governor Gavin Newsom released the 2023/24 May Revision to the Governor’s Budget. Highlights of the proposal include:

- A 8.22% statutory cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) to the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), as well as a 8.22% COLA to special education, child nutrition, Adult Education Block Grant, Mandate Block Grant, foster youth programs, and other categorical programs.

- $80 million (ongoing) increase for juvenile court and community schools operated by county offices of education.

- A 50% (ongoing) increase to the base grant allocation that county offices of education receive to support districts to improve student outcomes and address disparities in opportunities and outcomes.

- $2.6 billion reduction to the Learning Recovery Emergency Block Grant in 2022/23. This would reduce funding for this program from the $7.9 billion included in the Budget Act of 2022 to $5.4 billion.

- $1.8 billion reduction to the Arts, Music and Instructional Materials Discretionary Block Grant in 2022/23. This would reduce the funding for this program from the $3.6 billion included in the Budget Act of 2022 to $1.8 billion.

- $933 million (ongoing) increase for Proposition 28 which the voters approved in November 2022 to provide funding for arts and music instruction in schools.

- $300 million (ongoing) increase to create an LCFF Equity Multiplier for allocation to high-poverty schools to close opportunity gaps.

- $250 million (one-time) increase to expand the number of high-poverty schools participating in the Literacy Coaches and Reading Specialist Grant Program.

- $119.6 million (one-time) increase to implement the Stronger Connections Program which provides grants to high-needs schools to support school climate and safety.

- $100 million (one-time) for LEAs to provide high school seniors with cultural enrichment experiences.

- $20 million (one-time) increase for the Bilingual Teacher Professional Development Program which provides competitive grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to increase the number of teachers with a bilingual authorization.

- $7 million (one-time) increase to provide competitive grants for LEAs to implement restorative justice best practices.

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

- $3.5 million (ongoing) increase for all middle and high schools to maintain at least two doses of naloxone hydrochloride, or another medication to reverse an opioid overdose, on campus for emergency aid.

The proposals above have not yet been approved by the state legislature, nor is it known what impact they will have on the Sacramento County Office of Education budget. The County Office also expects to receive significant additional state funding to continue its support of social emotional learning and mental health and wellness in schools statewide.

The SCOE has recently entered into a three-year collective bargaining agreement with representatives of its certificated employees (the Sacramento County Office of Education Teachers Association) to provide ongoing salary increases of 8% in 2023/24, 4% in 2024/25 and 2% in 2025/26, along with a one-time 3% increase in 2023/24 and significant increases to the employer contribution for health, dental and vision benefits. These increases will be extended to all management employees. SCOE has not yet concluded negotiations with representatives of its classified employees (California School Employees Association).

Finally, several major facilities maintenance projects are anticipated in 2023/24, but the expenditure of these funds for specific projects is not yet reflected in the budget.

The anticipated additional revenues and associated expenditures, along with the employee compensation increases and deferred facilities maintenance expenditures, will be included in a future budget revision when they are known.

**PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:**  
Sly Park is a residential outdoor science school that has operated since 1970. This program provides overnight educational experiences in outdoor science and environmental education to elementary students in grades 5 and 6 from Sacramento and surrounding counties. Students attend a five-day program, a four-day program, or a three-day program. Additionally, Sly Park offers one-day field trips for grades 4 through 7.

Starting in the 2020-2021 school year, two virtual programs were created and offered by Sly Park. In the fall of 2020 Sly Park piloted and implemented science “Distance Learning Lessons” virtually to schools. In January 2021, Sly Park grew its virtual program to offer a 5-day “Virtual Science Camp” program. In 2021-2022 school year, Sly Park continued to grow its virtual services and also extended its reach to schools across the state. Various conference groups also rent the facility during the summer months and on weekends.

## CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY (CARES) ACT

**NANCY HEROTA, Ed.D., DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT**

### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:

In response to the Coronavirus Disease/COVID-19, the U.S. Congress passed the CARES Act. This relief package provided the County Office with emergency relief funds to address the impact COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, on our students and staff. The two main funding sources are Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Funds and Learning Loss Mitigation Funds (LLMF). The LLMF is further comprised of three funding sources, Governor’s Emergency Education Relief (GEER), Coronavirus Relief (CR) and the State’s General Fund (GF).  
The County Office’s CARES Act funds are being used as follows: support pupil academic achievement and learning loss mitigation through the purchase of technology hardware and software; professional development; comprehensive support for students; compliance with local health ordinances; and maintain operations, continuity of services and continued employment of County Office staff.

## STUDENT EVENTS
**RACHEL PERRY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR**

### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
The Sacramento County Office of Education’s (SCOE) Center for Student Assessment and Program Accountability coordinates the following student events:

- **Academic Decathlon:** An annual event where Sacramento County high school teams compete for the honor to represent the county at the annual state and ultimately, national competitions.
  
- **Gordon D. Schaber Mock Trial/Moot Court Competition:** A trial-level proceeding where students portray the roles of pre-trial counsel, attorneys, witnesses, court clerks, bailiffs, and jurors before a single presiding judge and two scoring judges. The Moot Court Competition simulates an appellate-level proceeding in which students prepare and argue a case before a panel of three judges.
  
- **History Day:** An annual event in which students from Sacramento County schools participate as either individuals or in groups for the honor to represent the county at the annual state and ultimately, national competitions.
  
- **National History Day - California:** A year-long program working with teachers to implement project-based learning tied to social science and Common Core State Standards. SCOE coordinates county-level competitions, offers professional development opportunities, and promotes National History Day statewide.

## RE-ENTRY PROGRAMS
**CHRISTI FEE, DIRECTOR**

### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
The Sacramento County Office of Education Re-Entry Programs are specifically designed for men and women re-entering the community from state prison, jail, or those currently on probation. The primary purpose of the Re-Entry Programs is to address the causes of offending behavior and assist clients in developing a successful re-entry plan. Staff provides participants with comprehensive services based on an individual’s unique needs in the areas of life skills, academics, job readiness and treatment areas. Services are available to both clients and their families during the often overwhelming transition from prison to home. We work in partnership with clients to promote productive experiences and help them overcome barriers.

# SPECIAL EDUCATION

## SPECIAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT  
### MICHAEL KAST, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
The Special Education Department provides direct instructional programs and services to approximately 1,100 students (ranging in age from 3 to 22 years) who have physical, communicative, learning and/or severe disabilities. The Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE) serves students from each of the 11 school districts.

Special Education service needs are identified in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) and provided within general education classrooms, special day classes, resource specialist services or designated instructional services (vision, speech/language, nurse services, orientation and mobility, and vocational specialist services).

Special Education programs and services are located on 20 school district campuses throughout Sacramento County that house special day class students, one SCOE school campus, and one class at California State University, Sacramento. Special education services for preschool students are at district or agency locations (five sites). In addition, Special Education staff serves students with identified special needs that are in the Juvenile Court and Community School programs. Vision specialists, speech therapists, psychologists, and orientation and mobility specialists also serve students fully included in school districts' programs on those district campuses throughout the county.
