**Maintaining access to credit markets is a core value of SMUD.**

Therefore:

a) For SMUD’s annual budgets, the Board establishes a minimum target of cash coverage of all debt service payments (fixed charge ratio) of 1.50 times.

b) When making resource decisions, SMUD shall weigh the impacts of long-term revenue requirements, debt, financial risk and flexibility.

c) SMUD’s goal is to maintain at least an “A” rating with credit rating agencies.

# Why Do Credit Ratings Matter?

**Higher credit ratings = lower borrowing cost**
- If SMUD’s ratings were to decrease from AA to A, the increase (at today’s rates) would be approximately $373,000 per year, for every $100 million borrowed.
- Impact grows in higher rate environments

**Events over the past four years make access to credit and financial risk mitigation imperative**
- SMUD reserves and commercial paper program provide liquidity
- Business interruption insurance provides recovery from higher unplanned costs
- Both support and enhance SMUD financial strength and our AA ratings

**Enhances SMUD’s position as strong counterparty**
- Lower costs for commodity procurement function
- Higher collateral thresholds allow for headroom with volatile commodity pricing

# Credit Concerns

- Legal and financial risks from Inverse Condemnation statute interpretation as it relates to potential wildfire liability
- Increased capital forecast and heavier reliance on cash could put pressure on key metrics leading to higher borrowing
- Lower demand growth due to energy efficiency, distributed generation and potential for battery storage
- Prioritizing environmental goals or rate affordability over preservation of the financial profile
- Ongoing net pension liability obligation
