**Requested Action:**  
Approval and adoption of a staff-prepared 2024-2028 Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP).  

**Summary:**  
Staff conducted an enterprise-wide process to prepare an updated Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP) for SMUD. The HMP is a five-year pre-disaster risk mitigation plan covering all areas where SMUD owns or operates electric infrastructure. SMUD adopted its 2018 HMP by Board Resolution No. 19-06-06. The 2018 HMP will expire in June 2024. The HMP allows SMUD to qualify for California Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants financing risk mitigation projects.  

The U.S. Congress passed the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) emphasizing the need for pre-disaster mitigation of potential hazards since hazard mitigation is most effective when a long-term plan is developed before a disaster occurs. DMA 2000 made hazard mitigation grants available to state and local governments. An HMP is required as a condition of future funding for mitigation projects under multiple FEMA pre- and post-disaster mitigation grant programs.  

DMA 2000 outlines a process that cities, counties, and special districts may follow to develop an HMP. Staff followed this outline to prepare the 2024-2028 HMP, which includes an assessment of the most significant hazards SMUD plans for including, but not limited to, flood, dam failure, wildfire, earthquake, drought, climate change, severe weather, cyber threats, and terrorism. The public and stakeholders were invited to participate in the HMP preparation process and to provide input on the draft 2024-2028 HMP during the period December 1, 2023, through January 2, 2024.  

The draft 2024-2028 HMP, once approved and adopted by the Board, will be submitted to CalOES and FEMA for their review and approval. Changes that CalOES and FEMA may require during their review phase will be incorporated into the approved HMP; if significant revisions are required, staff will present the revised HMP to the Board.  

**Board Policy:**  
**(Number & Title)**  
Strategic Direction SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management  

**Benefits:**  
Adoption of the HMP will increase SMUD’s access to FEMA grants to help fund hazard mitigation efforts; and supports SMUD’s commitment to reduce and eliminate, where possible, the potential risks and impacts of natural and human-caused hazards to SMUD’s communities, systems and/or operations.  

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
SMUD received a grant from FEMA to draft the plan; SMUD’s cost share is 10%. These amounts were included in the 2023 Budget.  

**Alternatives:**  
1) Do not adopt the plan and forgo FEMA pre-mitigation grant funding opportunities, default on grant obligations. 2) Direct staff to update draft.  

**Affected Parties:**  
SMUD Board of Directors and organization.  

**Coordination:**  
All Executives and Business Unit Leadership and Teams across SMUD.

![Executive Summary](https://example.com/image.png)

**Executive Summary**  
Natural and human-caused hazards have potential immediate and long-lasting impacts on the lives of people and their communities, financially, economically, and psychologically. Such hazards have the potential to disrupt entire communities. Nationwide, taxpayers pay billions of dollars annually to help communities, organizations, businesses, and individuals recover from disasters. This Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP) represents the Sacramento Municipal Utility District’s (SMUD’s) commitment to reduce and eliminate, where possible, the potential risks and impacts of natural and human-created hazards. The HMP serves to help protect SMUD’s assets, customers, and communities by improving disaster preparedness and increasing resiliency. It also serves as a guide for SMUD decisionmakers as they commit resources to reducing the effects of potential hazards on SMUD’s energy infrastructure and workforce.

SMUD’s HMP is a single-jurisdiction plan that geographically covers all areas where SMUD owns, partially owns, or operates critical infrastructure (hereinafter referred to as the Plan Area).

The HMP represents SMUD’s commitment to reduce and eliminate, where possible, the risks and impacts of natural and human-caused hazards. The HMP serves to help protect SMUD’s assets, customers, and communities by coordinating our broad-based disaster preparedness and resiliency efforts.  
The HMP:  
1. Identifies potential hazards faced by communities where SMUD maintains assets or operations,  
2. Assesses the vulnerability of those assets and operations to such hazards, and  
3. Identifies specific actions that can be taken to reduce the risk from identified hazards.  

**Plan Update**  
This plan is a comprehensive update of the 2019 SMUD Hazard Mitigation Plan approved by FEMA on July 11, 2019, and is set to expire July 11, 2024.

SMUD’s 2024-2028 HMP update meets federal requirements for updating hazard mitigation plans on a five-year cycle. It represents the third iteration of SMUD’s hazard mitigation plan, which was initially part of El Dorado County’s HMP. The scope of this HMP update covers 22 counties where SMUD owns, partially owns, or operates critical infrastructure.

![Plan Update Approach](https://smud.org)

**Plan Update Approach**  
A governance structure was developed to coordinate the update of the HMP. It included Executive oversight, a director level steering committee, a planning committee, and core team, each with its own roles and responsibilities. The communications team implemented a multi-media public involvement strategy based on past experience, utilizing a number of outreach capabilities including posting public notices in local newspapers, community outreach events, sharing information with public agency partners, local non-profits and supporting agencies, as well as via email.

A draft of this plan was posted on smud.org for public comments in advance of the **(date) SMUD (name) Committee Meeting** and will be considered for approval by the SMUD Board of Directors within eight weeks of receipt of pre-approval from California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

# 1.0 Introduction

## 1.1 Background

FEMA defines “hazard” as “any event or physical condition that has the potential to cause fatalities, injuries, property damage, infrastructure damage, agricultural losses, damage to the environment, interruption of business, or other types of harm or loss.” Additionally, hazard mitigation is “any sustained action taken to reduce or eliminate the long-term risk to human life and property from a hazard event” (44 CFR §201.2). The purpose of hazard mitigation is to reduce potential losses from future disasters. Hazard mitigation planning is essential in helping to reduce or alleviate the loss of life, personal injury, and property damage that can result from a disaster. A hazard mitigation plan forms the foundation of a community's long-term strategy to reduce disaster losses and break the cycle of disaster damage, reconstruction, and repetitive damage. The “purpose of mitigation planning is for state, local and Indian tribal governments to identify the natural hazards that impact them, to identify actions and activities to reduce any losses from those hazards, and to establish a coordinated process to implement the plan, taking advantage of a wide range of resources” (44 CFR § 201.1(b)).

The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) is federal legislation that establishes a pre-disaster hazard mitigation program and new requirements for the national post-disaster Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). DMA 2000 sets as a condition for receiving federal disaster grant assistance, that state and local government agencies need to have a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved hazard mitigation. DMA 2000 outlines the process that cities, counties, and special districts follow to develop a Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP).

FEMA supports local hazard mitigation planning and the achievement of the following principles:
- Plan and invest for the future;
- Collaborate and engage early; and
- Integrate community planning.

## 1.2 Mitigation Plan Update

SMUD has prepared this update to the 2019 Hazard Mitigation Plan in accordance with the requirements under DMA 2000. The HMP update was prepared pursuant to the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-390) and the implementing regulations set forth by the Interim Final Rule published in the Federal Register on February 26, 2002, (44 CFR §201.6) and finalized on October 31, 2007. The regulations established the requirements that local hazard mitigation plans must meet in order for a local jurisdiction to be eligible for funding from certain Stafford Act grant programs such as FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Assistance (PDM) Program, the Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) Program, the Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG), and Public Assistance (PA). This planning effort follows FEMA’s 2023 Local Mitigation Planning Policy Guide (FP 206-21-0002).
<!-- Page 21 -->
# 1.3 Purpose
This HMP represents SMUD’s commitment to reduce the potential risks and impacts of natural and human-caused hazards and serves to help protect SMUD’s, customers, and communities by improving disaster preparedness and increased resiliency. It also serves as a guide for SMUD decision-makers as they commit resources to reducing the effects of potential hazards on SMUD’s energy infrastructure and workforce. The scope of this HMP is limited to the geographic areas of Sacramento, El Dorado, Placer, Solano, Colusa, Yolo, Sutter, Alameda, Contra Costa, Glenn, Kings, Kern, Fresno, Merced, Modoc, San Joaquin, Santa Clara, San Bernardino, San Benito, Shasta, Siskiyou, Stanislaus, and Tehama counties where SMUD owns, partially owns, or operates critical infrastructure facilities. These facilities include, but are not limited to, commercial property, real estate, dams, powerhouses, transmission lines, distribution lines, roads, wind turbines, solar arrays, batteries, and gas pipelines. Each of these facilities is critical to maintaining the flow of power from generating facilities through the transmission lines into Sacramento County. The proper maintenance of these assets helps protect the communities from impacts as a result of natural and man-made hazards such as wildfires, severe storms, dam failure, blackouts, and road closures to name a few.

SMUD’s resiliency can be improved through the proper identification, analysis, planning, and evaluation of proper risk response or mitigation and monitoring of the hazards to which SMUD is most vulnerable. This HMP provides a framework to conduct such an assessment.

This SMUD 2024-2028 HMP Update (is as a single-jurisdiction plan that geographically covers all areas where SMUD directly owns and/or has an ownership and/or operational share of critical infrastructure (hereinafter referred to as the Plan Area). Several stakeholders, including public and private agencies, participated in the planning process.

Information in this plan will be used to help guide and coordinate mitigation activities for SMUD. Proactive mitigation planning will help reduce the cost of disaster response and recovery to communities and their residents by protecting critical facilities, reducing liability exposure, and minimizing overall customer and community impacts and disruptions.

# 1.4 Contents of Updated Plan
This HMP is organized into four primary parts:
- Part 1 – Planning Process and Community Profile
- Part 2 – Risk Assessment
- Part 3 – Mitigation Strategy
- Part 4 – Plan Maintenance

Each part includes elements required Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section 201.6, Local Mitigation Plans. Compliance section requirements are cited at the beginning of subsections where appropriate to demonstrate compliance.

## 2.0 Updates to Plan

### 2.1 Previous Plans
On September 21, 2017, through SMUD Board Resolution 17-09-09, SMUD’s Board of Directors adopted the El Dorado County Local HMP Annex (Annexation Plan). The Annexation Plan focused on SMUD’s assets located in El Dorado County and addressed wildland fire, severe storms, and dam/levee failure hazards.

In June 2018, SMUD received grant funding from FEMA under Disaster Recovery (DR) number 4308 to develop its first single-jurisdiction HMP which included additionally identified hazards and a greater planning area. This plan was adopted by SMUD’s board on June 24, 2019, by Board Resolution 19-06-06. The plan was approved by FEMA on July 11, 2019 and expires July 11, 2024.

### 2.2 Update

#### 2.2.1 Grant Funding
On August 21, 2023, SMUD received grant funding from FEMA under DR-4619-469-007P to update its HMP in accordance with DMA 2000 requirements. The funding was used in the development of this 2024-2028 HMP.

#### 2.2.2 Federal Eligibility
Part 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) stipulates that a jurisdiction covered by a plan that has expired is not able to pursue federal funding for which a current hazard mitigation plan is a prerequisite. SMUD anticipates continuing to pursue FEMA grant funding for various hazard mitigations where a Plan is a prerequisite.

#### 2.2.3 Changes in Development
SMUD continually identifies and assesses changes and developments that could impact or change the levels of risks associated with hazards prone to our planning area. This helps to ensure that mitigation strategies continue to address the risks and vulnerabilities of potential development and takes into consideration possible future conditions that could impact the hazard risk profiles allowing SMUD to allocate resources more efficiently to address SMUD’s highest areas of vulnerabilities.

### 2.3 What Has Changed
SMUD’s 2024-2028 HMP includes several changes including format changes for readability and citation of requirements to demonstrate compliance with CFR Part 44. The following are some highlights of additional changes:
- Enhanced risk assessment,
- Enhanced integrated risk and enterprise business planning,
- Updated and enhanced public outreach,
- Incorporation of SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan,
- Enhance communications to address vulnerable communities,
- Identification of high hazard dams, and
- Enhanced section on climate change.

## 3.0 Planning Process
This section describes the first step of the HMP planning process - organize resources. Organizing resources includes building the core planning team, determining the outreach plan, and documenting review.

The planning process accomplished several critical HMP requirements, including identifying the Plan Area, defining general priorities, reviewing the capabilities of the communities within SMUD’s Plan Area, and establishing stakeholder and community outreach and input process. Strategies in developing the continuity of public participation in plan maintenance were also established, as well as means of properly documenting all future changes and updates to the HMP.

### 3.1 Governance and Planning Team
SMUD’s Enterprise Risk Management Office is responsible for updating the HMP, its Enterprise Risk Manager assumed the role of lead planner and leveraged SMUD’s existing risk governance structure to assist in the update of this HMP. This governance structure includes Executive oversight, senior management steering committee, a core team, and a planning committee.

#### 3.1.1 Executive Risk Oversight Committee (EROC)
The Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee (EROC) is made up of SMUD Executives and is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer who is responsible for enterprise-wide risk oversight. During the HMP process, the EROC is responsible for the oversight, direction.

**3.2 Defining Planning Area**  
The Planning Team met to review the 2019 identified Plan Area and to determine changes appropriate to reflect the intent of this plan. SMUD’s Plan Area geographically covers all areas where SMUD directly owns and/or has an ownership and/or operational share of critical infrastructure (hereinafter referred to as the Plan Area). These territories are mostly located in Sacramento, El Dorado, Placer, and Solano counties. However, other areas

![Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Hazard+Mitigation+Plan+2024+-+2028)

where SMUD owns, is partial owner, or operates critical infrastructure includes small portions of Alameda, Colusa, Contra Costa, Fresno, Glenn, Kern, Kings, Merced, Modoc, San Benito, San Bernardino, San Joaquin, Santa Clara, Shasta, Siskiyou, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama, and Yolo counties. Current development does not impact SMUD’s plan, SMUD will continue to assess any potential impacts from future developments.

### 3.3 Stakeholder and Agency Coordination
The Plan must provide an opportunity for neighboring communities, local and regional agencies involved in hazard mitigation activities, and agencies that have the authority to regulate development as well as business, academia, and other private and non-profit interests to be involved in the planning process (44 CFR § 201.6(b)(2)).

Stakeholders (table 7) were invited to participate in the plan development via an email invitation on October 25, 2023. Throughout the year, SMUD staff works closely with local jurisdictions bodies in which infrastructure critical to SMUD’s operations exist and with regulatory bodies having authority over such infrastructure. Stakeholders received an email invitation to also participate in the review of SMUD’s HMP.

A copy of the draft HMP was posted online during a public comment period. The public was invited to review and provide their input. The public comment period was from December 1, 2023, to January 2, 2024. Additionally, the public was given opportunities to provide comment at two duly noticed public meetings, the Board (name) Committee Meeting and Board Meeting on (dates).

## 3.4 Regional Participation

SMUD regularly participates in regional and local forums to collaborate on shared interest in various risks, emergency response and mitigation planning, and information sharing. These meetings are generally open meetings that include public input. Information from these meetings was used to inform, identify, and prioritize risks in this HMP. Table 8 summarizes examples of this participation.

SMUD’s government affairs team is engaged in several efforts with regional stakeholders to discuss various hazards and climate resilience. These meetings are not public meetings. SMUD government affairs have also participated in discussions about regional climate resiliency with a group comprised of SACOG, AQMD, SacRT, SAFCA, RWA and El Dorado County Fire Council over the last year. These are not public meetings.

The SMUD Emergency Operation Center (EOC) may participate in planning exercises with other EOCs and first responders; those exercises are not a public forum.

| Organization | SMUD’s Role | Description |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) fire threat map | Member of the Peer Development Panel (PDP) | - The CPUC initiated a proceeding to develop a statewide map depicting areas of elevated and extreme fire risk in California—the “High Fire Threat District.”<br>- A multistep process was used to develop the statewide CPUC High Fire Threat District, including input from investor owned and publicly owned electric utilities, communications infrastructure providers, public interest groups, and local public safety agencies, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire), and other stakeholders. The maps were available to the public for review and comment prior to approval. Primary responsibility for the development of the CPUC Fire Threat Map was delegated to PDP, a group of utility fire planning experts, and the Independent Review Team led by CalFire. |

### 3.5 Public Involvement
The public must have had an opportunity to be involved in the current planning process during the drafting stage and prior to plan approval. The plan must document what the participation entailed, including how under-resourced communities and vulnerable populations within the planning area were provided an opportunity to be involved. The plan must document how public feedback was included throughout the planning process (44 CFR § 201.6(b)(1)).

#### 3.5.1 Strategy
The Planning Team reviewed SMUD’s 2019 public involvement and identified a strategic approach to public involvement for the 2024-2028 HMP. This strategic approach was focused on:
- information sharing with the public on HMP planning and drafting process,
- having materials available at public outreach events for the general public with a focus on vulnerable communities, and
- updating SMUD’s HMP to reflect public outreach activities and participation.

#### 3.5.2 Public Notice
SMUD provided notice in local newspapers during the planning stage and the draft review stage to welcome public input regarding the HMP update. These notices were published in the Sacramento Bee and the Mountain Democrat on the following dates: October 16, 2023, and December 1, 2023.

### 3.5.4 Hazard Mitigation Plan Website and E-mail
During the development of SMUD’s 2019 HMP, SMUD staff established a dedicated webpage and email to share information on SMUD’s HMP. This webpage will continue to serve as a central location to keep the public apprised of upcoming outreach events, meeting dates and times, and the plan update process (see table 11). The webpage address is: [smud.org/HazardMitigation](http://smud.org/HazardMitigation) and the email address is: ERM@smud.org. The webpage and email were included in all public notifications, public presentations, and outreach materials.

### 3.5.5 Public Comments on Draft Plan
In addition to the listed organizations in table 7, a draft copy of the HMP was made available to the public for review. The public was given opportunity to comment on the draft HMP.
- The draft HMP was made available on SMUD's website ([smud.org](http://smud.org)) for public review from December 1, 2023, to January 2, 2024. Public comments are addressed in the final HMP.
- SMUD also provided an opportunity for public comments on the draft HMP at a regularly scheduled Finance and Audit Committee Board Meeting¹.
- There were no comments received through the public review period.

SMUD Board Committee meetings are open and accessible to the public. Meeting notices and agendas are posted, at minimum, 72 hours in advance at the SMUD office and on SMUD’s website. Those who are unable to attend the meeting in-person can livestream the meeting or view a recording on SMUD’s website.

SMUD is committed to public participation. In accordance with California open meeting laws (California Government Code Sections 54960 et. seq.) SMUD Board meetings are open to the public and the public is invited to comment at these meetings. The public will continue to be involved in future HMP updates. Prior to adoption of formal updates, SMUD will provide the opportunity for the public to comment on the updates. A public notice will be posted prior to the meeting to announce the comment period and meeting logistics.

### 3.6 Existing Documents and Programs
The plan should describe the review and incorporation of existing plans, studies, reports, and technical information (44 CFR § 201.6(b)(3)). Linking existing plans and policies to the HMP helps to identify which resources already exist that can be used to implement the action items identified in the plan.

SMUD’s plan includes a range of recommended action items that, when implemented, could reduce the Plan Area’s vulnerability to natural hazards. Many of these recommendations are consistent with the goals and objectives of SMUD’s existing plans and policies. Table 10 accounts for the plans and policies already in place in SMUD’s Plan Area that were reviewed for or incorporated as a part of the HMP planning process:

**4.5 SMUD Priorities**  
Multiple risks and hazards have the potential to impact SMUD’s operations. SMUD addresses these risks and hazards as a part of its ongoing Enterprise Risk Management and Insurance Programs activities and includes them in the capital investment prioritization process. Historical data indicates that wildfire, storms, floods, and earthquakes account for the greatest losses incurred by SMUD and should be designated as priority threats. In addition, climate change has the potential to increase the impacts of these hazards as well as others.

**4.6 The Electric System**  
SMUD owns and operates an integrated electric system that includes generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. SMUD delivers energy to its customers from a variety of sources. The sources include large hydropower, natural-gas-fired generators, renewable energy (solar, wind, small hydro, geothermal, and biomass), and power it purchases on the wholesale market. The largest single source of power for SMUD is the Cosumnes Power Plant (described below). SMUD’s UARP is its cleanest and most economical power source.

**4.6.1 The Distribution and Transmission System, Sacramento County**  
SMUD supplies power to its bulk power substations through 230 kilovolt (kV) and 115 kV transmissions systems. This system transmits power from SMUD’s generation plants, and interconnects with Pacific Gas & Electric (“PG&E”) and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Power is distributed throughout Sacramento County via a 69 kV sub-transmission system except for the Sacramento downtown area, which is served from the 115 kV transmission systems. The downtown area is served from 115/12 kV and 115/21 kV substations. The distribution system serving the remainder of SMUD’s service territory is comprised of 69/12 kV and 69 kV substations with overhead and underground distribution circuits.

**4.6.2 Hydroelectric System**  
SMUD’s hydroelectric system includes nine SMUD-owned and operated hydroelectric powerhouses rated at approximately 700MW in the Western Sierra Nevada Mountain region. The hydroelectric systems span approximately 50 miles with the highest elevation reservoir at Rubicon Reservoir and descends to the mountain range terminating at Chili Bar Powerhouse. All total there are nine hydroelectric powerhouses with seven of them interconnected with dedicated 69kV and 230kV transmission lines. The remaining two hydroelectric powerhouses South Fork and Chili Bar are interconnected directly into PG&E’s 12kV and 21kV local distribution systems. Approximately twenty linear miles of overhead 230kV transmission lines connect the hydroelectric system to SMUD’s service area near Folsom. The hydroelectric powerhouses are fed from the various dam-formed reservoirs.

![Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028](https://example.com/image.png)

4.6.6 Transmission  
The transmission system carries electricity from generation to the distribution system over long distances at high voltages. SMUD supplies power to its bulk power substations through a 230 kV and 115 kV transmission systems. This system transmits power from SMUD’s generation plants, other than the Solano Wind Project, and interconnects with Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Power is distributed throughout Sacramento County via a 69 kV sub-transmission system except for the Sacramento downtown area, which is served from the 115 kV transmission systems. The downtown area is served from 115/12 kV and 115/21 kV substations.

4.6.7 Distribution  
Distribution systems move power from transmission to end use customers. The distribution assets consist of thousands of unique parts that are customary and usual for the operation of electric distribution systems. The distribution system serving the remainder of SMUD’s service territory is comprised of 69/12 kV and 69/4 kV substations with overhead and undergrounds distribution circuits.

4.7 Gas Pipeline  
SMUD owns a transmission gas pipeline, has an equity interest in two PG&E backbone gas transmission lines, and contracts with existing interstate natural gas transmission lines to deliver natural gas to its power plants.

SMUD’s diversified portfolio of gas transmission arrangements allow for the purchase of gas from a variety of suppliers and locations, and the opportunity to capitalize on regional price differentials where possible. SMUD’s ownership interest in the SMUD/PG&E backbone and Local Pipeline enhances the reliability of SMUD’s gas supply.

4.7.1 The Gas Pipeline  
SMUD constructed and owns a 20 inch (in.), 50- mile natural gas pipeline in the greater Sacramento area (the “Local Pipeline”) that transports gas to all the Local Gas-Fired Plants except SPA McClellan (See Figure 6). The Local Pipeline is interconnected with PG&E’s major California gas transmission lines 400 and 401 at the Winters intertie. Additionally, it may be interconnected with one or more private gas gathering pipelines located in the area, and/or other FERC approved pipelines that may be built in the local area. In conjunction with the construction of the SFA Project, SMUD extended the Local Pipeline to the plant site. The 26-mile extension was completed in 2004. The extension is 24 in. in diameter and was designed to serve both the SFA Project and an additional second phase, if constructed.

![Figure 6: SMUD Local Pipeline](https://example.com/path/to/image)

4.7.2 PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 400 and 401  
In 1996, SMUD purchased an equity interest in PG&E's backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 (referred to as the PG&E backbone). The total capacity acquired is currently approximately 86,700 Dth/day. It consists of approximately 47,572 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, Oregon and 39,193 Dth/day from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD's interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California. This purchase made SMUD a co-owner of the PG&E backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401. It obligated SMUD to pay PG&E to operate the pipelines on its behalf, subject to the terms of the purchase agreement and operating protocols.

4.7.3 Gas Storage  
SMUD also employs gas storage as part of its overall fuel supply strategy. Gas storage is useful in helping to balance gas supply, mitigate market price volatility, and provide a reliable supply to meet peak day delivery requirements.

4.8 TANC California-Oregon Transmission Project  
The California-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP) is one part of a three-part 500 kV-line coordinated system known as the California-Oregon Intertie (COI). The COTP is allocated one-third of the 4,800 MW capability of the COI system. It can help increase awareness of business risks across an entire organization, instill confidence in strategic objectives, improve compliance with regulatory and internal mandates, and enhance operational efficiency through more consistent applications of processes and controls. The Transmission Agency of Northern California (TANC) is entitled to use 1,390 MW. SMUD is a member of TANC and is entitled to 378 MW of the COTP capacity. SMUD is entitled to approximately 528 MW of TANC’s transfer capability. SMUD relies on its COTP rights to purchase power and obtain renewable resources to supplement its own resources to serve its load.  

4.9 SMUD Capital Projects  
SMUD’s annual budget provides funding for capital programs necessary to meet the Board’s Strategic Directives over the year and to ensure continuity into the future.  

SMUD’s 2024 enterprise portfolio includes investments across our five strategic pillars – safety and reliability, environmental leadership, community vitality, affordability, and organizational agility. The proposed capital investment budget for 2024 is $555 million for planned investment in generation, transmission, distribution, buildings, vehicles, technology, and other assets critical to meeting the energy needs of our customers and community. Proposed capital expenditures go through a rigorous evaluation and prioritization process, based on strategic alignment, risk, criticality, and financials to ensure SMUD prioritizes work that has the highest contribution to the Board’s Strategic Directions and our 2030 Zero Carbon vision.

# 6.0 Physical Setting
SMUD’s service territory is within Sacramento County; any impacts as a result of a hazard event to SMUD’s Plan Area would have the greatest impact to the Sacramento Region. As such, the assessment provided in section 6.0 will be focused on Sacramento County.

## 6.1 Geography
Sacramento County lies just north of the center of California’s Central Valley. The confluence of two of the state’s major rivers, the Sacramento and the American, lies within the County. The southwestern portion of the County extends far into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, to the point just north of Antioch, where nearly all waters of the Central Valley converge. To the south, San Joaquin County is primarily agricultural. The wooded foothills of the Sierra Nevada rise to the east in Amador and El Dorado Counties.5

In general, Sacramento County’s topography can be characterized by a broad band of very flat valley floor land in the western sector, a transition zone of gently sloping alluvial plains in the central sector, and a low foothill region in the eastern sector. Elevations range from below sea level in the delta island area in the Southwest corner of the County to approximately 800 feet in the foothill region.6

## 6.2 Climate
Sacramento County is characterized by a mild climate, with year-round sunshine. The summers are warm, with dry days and mild nights. “Rainy season” historically occurs from November through February. Mountains surround the Sacramento Valley to the west, north and east.

Torrential rain and heavy snow frequently fall on the western Sierra Nevada slopes, the southern Cascades, and to a lesser extent, the Coast Range. As a result, flood conditions occasionally occur along the Sacramento River and its tributaries.7

# 7.0 Demographics
SMUD’s service territory is within Sacramento County; any impacts as a result of a hazard event to SMUD’s Plan Area would have the greatest impact to the Sacramento Region. As such, the assessment provided in section 7.0 will be focused on Sacramento County.

## 7.1 Population Estimates

### 7.1.1 Current and Historical Population
The California Department of Finance 2020 estimates for population of the County by cities are shown in table 13.

**Table 13: Sacramento County Population Data by City**  
| City               | Population |
|--------------------|------------|
| Citrus Heights      | 86,367     |
| Elk Grove           | 176,972    |
| Folsom              | 84,592     |
| Galt                | 25,239     |
| Isleton             | 780        |
| Rancho Cordova      | 80,359     |
| Sacramento          | 518,037    |
| Unincorporated      | 604,272    |

### 7.1.2 Projected Future Population
The California Department of Finance, Demographic Research Unit is responsible by statute for maintaining postcensal population projections which are calculated using the demographic balancing equation. This method calculates the population in the target year by starting with the population from the previous year, adding nature increase (births minus deaths) and net migration that occurred during the time period between the two years.

**Table 14: Sacramento County Projected Population by Year**  
| Year | Projected Population | Year | Projected Population |
|------|----------------------|------|----------------------|
| 2024 | 1,569,050            | 2025 | 1,571,917            |

# 7.2 Indicators for Social Vulnerability

SMUD understands that some populations are at a greater risk from the impacts of hazard events because of physical abilities or limited resources. The vulnerable populations may vary from the general population in risk perception, living conditions, access to information and services, and capabilities to address hazard impacts.

## 7.2.1 Customer Opt-In Program
SMUD has implemented an opt-in program on smud.org that allows for vulnerable populations to enroll and receive additional information or notifications in the event of a hazard occurrence in SMUD service territory. Among SMUD’s vulnerable customers are those enrolled in the Medical Equipment Discount Rate program (MED rate), Energy Assistance Program rate, 3rd Party & Senior ID and those that have self-identified and are enrolled in the vulnerable customer program. These include customers who may rely on specialized medical equipment.

## 7.2.2 Sustainable Communities
In addition to its Opt-In Program, SMUD has a Sustainable Communities Team which oversees a community-focused program to enhance the quality of life for all SMUD customers through innovative energy solutions. The program helps bring environmental equity and economic vitality to all communities in SMUD’s service area, with special attention given to historically underserved neighborhoods.

In order to deploy comprehensive resources to the communities most in need, SMUD has developed an interactive map to help analyze current data to indicate the local areas most likely to be underserved or in distress by lack of community development, income, housing, employment opportunities, transportation, medical treatment, nutrition, education and clean environment. This map will be leveraged to support the identification of vulnerable communities during hazard events. SMUD’s interactive sustainability map can be found here: Sustainable Communities Resource Priorities Map (smud.org). Figure 7 shows a stationary view of SMUD’s Sustainable Communities Resource Priorities Map.

![Figure 7: Sustainable Communities Resource Priorities Map](https://usage.smud.org/SustainableCommunities/)

A number of factors were considered when developing the interactive map. The factors considered in developing the map include:

- **Opportunity Zones**  
  Opportunity zones are a new tool for community development. Established in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Opportunity Zones provide tax incentives for investment in designated census tracts. California Opportunity Zones will support new investments in environmental justice, sustainability, climate change, and affordable housing.

<!-- Page 60 -->
- **Sacramento Promise Zone**  
Sacramento's designation in 2015 as a “promise zone” by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development is the catalyst for service expansion in Sacramento’s most economically distressed neighborhoods. Through the Promise Zone Initiative, the federal government works with local leaders and organizations to improve the quality of life for residents in underserved neighborhoods.  

As one of 16 urban promise zones in the nation, Sacramento’s promise zone encompasses 22 square miles from Del Paso Heights in the north to The Avenues in the south. Among the 127,000 residents within the promise zone, 34% are living in poverty, 19% are unemployed and 63% of third graders are reading below grade level.  

- **SB 535 Disadvantaged Communities**  
Areas designated as Disadvantaged Communities by state Senate Bill 535 are specifically targeted for investment of proceeds from the State’s cap-and-trade program. These investments are aimed at improving public health, quality of life and economic opportunity in California’s most burdened communities, while at the same time reducing pollution that causes climate change.  

- **Sacramento Poverty, by Zip Code**  
The US Census Bureau determines the Federal Poverty Level each year. The poverty level is based on the size of the household and the ages of family members. If a person or family’s total income before taxes is less than the poverty level, the person or family are considered in poverty. The areas shown within this data set represent those zip codes within Sacramento County where 25% of the population are considered to be below the poverty line.  

- **Medically Underserved Areas**  
Medically underserved areas or populations are areas designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) as having too few primary care providers, high infant mortality, high poverty or a high elderly population. Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) are designated by HRSA as having shortages of primary medical care, dental or mental health providers and may be geographic (a county or service area), a population (e.g., low income or Medicaid eligible) or facilities (e.g., federally qualified health center or other state or federal prisons).  

- **Healthy Sacramento Coalition – Health Equity**  
The Healthy Coalition’s goal is to reduce tobacco use, obesity, death, and disability due to chronic disease, as well as reduce health disparities, build a safe and healthy physical environment, and improve the social and emotional well-being of Sacramento County residents. The coalition conducted an assessment identifying 15 zip codes that had consistently high rates of poor health outcomes.

<!-- Page 61 -->
- **Social Vulnerability to Climate Change Impacts in California**  
  The social vulnerability index shows social vulnerability to climate change related impacts, such as natural disasters or increased heat stress. Vulnerability is defined as the susceptibility of a population to harm from exposure to a hazard and its ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from hazards.

- **Environmental Justices: CalEnviroScreen 3.0**  
  CalEnviroScreen identifies California communities by census tract that are disproportionately burdened by, and vulnerable to, multiple sources of pollution.

### 7.3 Economy

#### 7.3.1 Industry, Businesses, and Institutions  
SMUD provides electrical power to the Sacramento Region powering the state capital, technology industries, critical infrastructure, support services, businesses, agriculture, and other critical services essential to this region. An impact to SMUD’s critical infrastructure could potentially have catastrophic impacts to the operations and viability of the entire region. These potential events are discussed in the hazards sections below.

#### 7.3.2 Employment Trends and Occupations  
As of May 2023, the unemployment rate in the Sacramento region remained below 5 percent. The rate has improved compared to California, but higher as compared to US unemployment rates seen in figure 8. The health care service and the education sector experienced significant job gains with nearly 13,000 jobs in the last 12 months and the construction sector performed the worst seeing a decline of more than 3,000 jobs during the same timeframe.

8.0 Hazards  
A number of different data points were used in identifying the hazards that are most likely to impact SMUD’s Plan Area. These data points included past disasters within California, types of disasters, what identified disasters are in California’s Hazard Mitigation Plan, as well as past disaster declarations impacting the Plan Area. Additional details on these data points will be discussed below.

8.1 Disaster Declaration  
A study conducted by Moneygeek cited California as one of the most disaster-prone states with 282 disasters from 2003 to July 2023. The breakdown of the disaster count for California can be viewed in table 15. The breakdown of the declared disaster category for SMUD’s Plan Area is outlined in figure 10.

# 10.0 Risk Assessment Methodology
Hazard risk assessment is the process of measuring the potential impact to life or property, as well as economic impacts, resulting from the hazard. Its intent is to identify from available data, the vulnerabilities of a community. The results provide a foundation on which to develop and prioritize mitigation actions to reduce damage from hazards by improving preparedness and response times and allocating resources to areas with the greatest vulnerability.

## 10.1 Risk Assessment Tools
### 10.1.1 Results and Methodology
SMUD maintains an ERM program which provides a framework and repeatable and consistent methodologies to identify, assess, manage, plan, and respond to risks and hazards to which SMUD is most vulnerable. The ERM program methodology takes into consideration impacts to six different areas (financial, legal, regulatory and compliance, workforce, reputation, operations, and strategy), as well as the likelihood and velocity of the risk occurrence. Implementing this framework and methodology, SMUD has identified the hazards listed in Table 24 that will be addressed in this HMP.

### 10.1.2 Mapping
Maps were produced using geographic information system (GIS) software to show the spatial extent and location of hazards when such datasets were available. SMUD has its own internal GIS function that leverages national, state, county, and city databases as well as its own to locate available spatially based data relevant to this planning effort. The maps are included in the hazard profile chapters.

### 10.1.3 Modeling
SMUD leveraged FEMA’s GIS-based software program Hazards U.S. (Hazus) as well as past events in SMUD’s Plan Area to estimate the risk impacts in the Plan Area. Hazus is used to support risk assessments, mitigation planning, and emergency planning, and response. It provides a wide range of data to estimate potential losses from natural disasters.

## 10.2 Risk Assessment Approach
### 10.2.1 Enterprise Risk Management Framework
SMUD uses its existing ERM framework to identify and assess the various hazards and a summary of these assessments is included in table 21 below. SMUD’s ERM framework takes into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors to determine the level of inherent and residual risk of a particular hazard. An inherent risk level refers to the risk before any mitigations or controls are in place while the residual risk level refers to the risk after all mitigations and effective controls are considered.

All identified risks in the ERM portfolio are owned by an Executive and managed at the Director level. During a risk evaluation, the Director, manager, stakeholders, and subject matter experts are consulted. ERM staff gathers pertinent information to conduct the

evaluation which includes a root cause analysis. Information gathered includes key risk drivers, key risk impacts, mitigations, processes, procedures, controls, and internal/external risk trend.

SMUD’s ERM process is integrated with internal audit processes. This integrated approach works to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies and controls implemented by management to reduce risks. ERM reviews the audit results to determine if the controls are effective strategies or are found to be ineffective. ERM staff will reassess any residual enterprise risk and work with the business areas to identify what else, if anything, needs to be done to further manage the risk to be within management’s objectives.

SMUD has reviewed the hazards and determined the likelihood of occurrence, extent, severity, and significance that the hazards would have on SMUD infrastructure and business operations if they occurred.

# 11.0 Fire Hazards

## 11.1 Wildfire

### 11.1.1 General Background
A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire in a natural setting that is associated with combustible vegetation, and/or fuel. FEMA defines a wildfire as an unplanned fire burning in natural or wildland areas such as forests, shrub lands, grasslands, or prairies. Wildfires are most prevalent in conditions with high temperatures, low moisture content in the air, increased fuel accumulation, and high winds.

Climate change has the potential to exacerbate conditions ripe for wildfires. Jason Funk, senior climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) says “there is very well documented scientific evidence that climate change is increasing the length of the fire season, the size of the area burned each year and the number of wildfires.” The severity of wildland fires is generally a function of a terrain’s combustible vegetation material and weather conditions. Tree stress and mortality, including damage due to insect infestations such as the bark beetle, exacerbate fire hazards.

### 11.1.2 Hazard Profile
Wildfires in the State of California have become increasingly common and destructive. Frequent drought conditions and unseasonably warm temperatures have increased, and further increase, the possibility of wildfires occurring in areas where SMUD maintains generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. The number of diseased and dead trees has increased and could further increase this possibility. As a result, SMUD faces an increased risk that it may be required to pay for wildfire related property damage or personal injuries, fines, and penalties, some of which may not be covered by insurance, or may be disputed by insurers and could be material. In addition, a significant fire, or fires in SMUD’s facilities, result in a temporary or permanent loss of energy load or otherwise materially increase SMUD’s costs or materially adversely affect SMUD’s ability to operate its Electrical System or generate revenues.

In SMUD’s Plan Area, fire season generally extends from early spring through late fall, due to the dry and hot nature of these months. If a fire occurs along an urban or rural interface, there is a high potential the fire could destroy structures, damage critical infrastructure, injure people and could result in the loss of lives.

There are a multitude of factors contributing to the increased quantity and size of wildfires plaguing the state. These factors include increased fuel loading, an increase in human-caused ignition capabilities, increased winds, climate change which is influencing drought, longer, hotter stretches of weather and increased tree mortality. Steep slopes also contribute to fire hazards by intensifying the effects of wind, making fire suppression difficult.

**Location**  
SMUD directly participated in the development of the CPUC’s Fire-Threat Map, which defines the statewide High Fire Threat District (HFTD). As a territory lead in the HFTD map development process, SMUD collaborated with utility staff, local fire, and government officials to identify areas within its service territory that may be at an elevated or extreme risk of powerline ignited wildfires. Through peer reviews and assessments by an independent team of nationwide experts led by CAL FIRE, it was determined that SMUD’s service area is appropriately situated outside the HFTD. However, some of SMUD's UARP facilities are located within both Tier 2 and Tier 3 of the HFTD, outside its service area. Despite not being regulated by the CPUC, SMUD has integrated the HFTD map into its construction, inspection, maintenance, repair, and clearance practices where applicable. SMUD believes that the HFTD map accurately identifies the level of wildfire risk within its service territory and UARP.

The CPUC Fire-Threat map identifies Tier 3, extreme fire risk, Tier 2, elevated fire risk and areas outside of the HFTD. Figure 11 depicts the CPUC Fire-Threat Map and SMUD’s service area location within the map.

![SMUD's Plan Area and Wildfire Susceptibility](https://example.com/image-url)

SMUD’s Plan Area within the HFTD has a higher susceptibility to wildfires specifically due to the Mediterranean climate which facilitates regular drought conditions as well as the natural plant communities that produce excess fuel, and the natural and anthropogenic ignition sources. SMUD’s greatest fire threat risk is in the Western Sierra Nevada Mountain range, where the hydroelectric project known as the “UARP” is located. Within the UARP, vegetation adjacent to electrical infrastructure (powerhouses, transmission lines, switchyards, etc.) is a source of fuel. Extended periods of warm temperatures as well as greater numbers of diseased and dead trees may increase the possibility of wildfires occurring in SMUD’s generation and service territories.

SMUD imports a large portion of the energy needed to serve its customers from out of its service area through the Western Area Power Authority transmission lines. These lines traverse many areas susceptible to wildfires. Actual destruction of such lines does happen, but this is not the most common threat. When a fire threatens long distance transmission lines, grid operators will derate the line. This means that less than the scheduled amount of power will be allowed to be carried by the line. This is done to reduce the amount of power which would be suddenly lost if the line were to be damaged. During heavy load periods, SMUD may not be able to obtain enough power from other sources to make up for the power lost from the derated line. Figure 12 below shows the area of the CPUC Fire Threat Map specific to SMUD’s UARP.

In addition to the UARP, open lands where SMUD’s assets lie also pose a risk related to grass fires. Grass fires can travel very fast and threaten nearby residential areas as well as critical infrastructure.

**Frequency & Severity**  
SMUD electric systems include several energized features that inherently possess the risk of wildland fire hazard, with the potential to affect other infrastructure as well as structures in the surrounding areas. Even with little change in their frequency, the wildfires that California sees on an annual basis can still pose a threat to electricity infrastructure for SMUD. Physical infrastructure in the direct path of a fire can see extensive damage, especially smaller lines, often fitted with wooden poles. Soot collecting on equipment and ionized particulate matter in the air can cause leakage currents or arcing. Firefighting measures can foul lines, requiring extensive cleanup or repair after the fire is cleared. Transmission lines are affected by high heat, smoke, and particulate matter of the fire; therefore, lines may be shut down as a safety measure.

Much of SMUD’s electricity is imported using transmission lines through wildfire-prone lands. Due to multiple climate factors, critical transmission lines will be operating near their limits in the future. Wildfire events will further strain the system and its ability to deliver reliable power to SMUD customers.

Rural communities within El Dorado County that are situated in heavily forested areas are particularly vulnerable to wildfire. Fire can also impact the general community by damaging infrastructure such as roads, telecommunication systems, and community buildings.

**Past Events**  
SMUD has never experienced a catastrophic wildfire involving its facilities. SMUD’s service area in Sacramento County has a much lower wildfire risk profile than other areas in the State that have suffered destructive wildfires in recent years. When ignition events occur, they have historically been limited in scope. This is largely due to SMUD’s more urban environment, flatter accessible terrain, low grasslands and other fuel sources outside forested areas and fewer wind events.

According to CalFire’s website, the five-year average between January – July time period is 3,067 fires and 28,875 acres burned. In 2022, the state endured 7,477 fires covering 331,360 acres. For the periods from January 1, 2023, to July 1, 2023, California endured 2,251 fires spanning 7,601 acres. This number continues to grow.

Large fires have been a part of the landscape history of the State of California, specifically, El Dorado County for centuries. Table 22 lists the most significant fires that have occurred near the Plan Area.

*Near TANC Transmission Lines

It is known from 1900, and earlier, that large fires occurred in this part of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and frequent fire return intervals (2-20 years in lower montane zone areas around Camino, Placerville, and Pollock Pines). Foothill regions of such, as where the UARP is located, burn frequently with mixed severity.

The most notable recent wildfires are the Caldor and Dixie fires in 2021, the King Fire in 2014, the Fred’s Fire in 2004, and the Cleveland Fire in 1992. Historically, areas above 5,000 feet were less likely to see a major fire (between Robbs Peak and Loon Lake), with one major fire, Bottle Hill, in 1917 near Gerle Creek Reservoir. Several large fires have periodically burned in the lower elevation canyon areas near White Rock Powerhouse, the most recent being the Chili Bar Fire in 1979.

Although the Caldor and King fires did not substantially damage hydroelectric infrastructure, they did do major damage to the forest and watersheds around the UARP.
<!-- Page 84 -->
According to the U.S. Forest Service in El Dorado County, it is unlikely for any treatments or post fire timber harvesting to be conducted in the steep canyons where much of the hydroelectric infrastructure is located. A recent study indicates that without post fire logging or surface fuel treatments, woody fuels accumulate at a rate that exceeds the decomposition rate. As fuel accumulates, so does the fire hazard in the UARP area.

11.1.3 Secondary Impacts  
The aftermath of wildfires can see increases in debris runoff as infiltration capacity of soil is reduced in the wildfire area, especially during rain events within the two years following a significant fire. Heavy rain events following a fire may also allow water to infiltrate the loose ground soil, increasing the potential for landslides. Large swings in rainfall from season to season can encourage vegetation growth in rainy periods, leaving more fire feedstock during subsequent dry seasons and priming conditions for the spread of wildfires.

Runoff from heavy rain events also affects the production of hydropower systems that are downstream from fire prone areas, as wildfire soot and residue collect in the waterways which feed the plant. This silt and particulate matter can reduce production or even damage the turbines. As precipitation patterns change in the coming decades, the aftereffects of wildfires could increase concerns for the impact on SMUD infrastructure from runoff, vegetation growth, and landslides.

11.1.4 Exposure and Vulnerability  
Fire also can damage the UARP infrastructure, which includes transmission lines, powerhouses, project roads, and penstocks. Recreationalists at UARP campgrounds are particularly vulnerable if access routes are destroyed or blocked during fires. Fuel reduction treatments, including thinning, brushing, removal of forest slash and mastication along the project corridors and around powerhouses can reduce such risks. Fire also creates indirect impacts on UARP operations. Land erosion associated with denuded hillslopes, for example, can increase sedimentation of reservoirs and degrade water quality.

Recreation facilities associated with the UARP can be damaged directly by the fire, requiring lengthy periods of reconstruction. The loss of the aesthetic value of surrounding forests can also depress recreation during the long process of forest regeneration, which can have a negative effect on the economy for several years.

11.1.5 Current Mitigation Efforts  
As a condition of the FERC fifty-year license authorizing SMUD to operate the UARP, SMUD is required to file with FERC, a Fire Prevention and Response Plan (FPRP) developed in consultation with appropriate State and local fire agencies and approved by the USFS. SMUD’s FPRP filed with FERC was developed in consultation with the USFS, BLM and CalFire.

The FPRP provides in depth fire risk analysis of SMUD’s most fire vulnerable regions as well as historical data, roles and responsibilities and prevention/preparedness activities.

SMUD regularly coordinates with local fire agencies and other first response agencies. It also participates with emergency operations activities in its system areas. SMUD has robust Vegetation Management (VM) programs with accelerated and targeted VM work (pruning & removal) cycles and is using enhanced technologies including LiDAR and Ortho Imagery (these technologies can help identify diseased trees and trees that are a risk to SMUD facilities). It also has robust asset inspection and maintenance programs that include traditional aerial patrols with helicopters, IR inspections using helicopters (which can detect heat from power equipment before an event occurs) and regular ground inspections of all facilities (including core testing of the wood poles).

SMUD maintains a Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP) that is reviewed and updated on an annual basis. The plan identifies the risks, SMUD’s wildfire management programs/process, and additional mitigations where necessary. In addition, it also outlines SMUD’s customer, community and stakeholder outreach and communications during de-energization events.

Table 23 depicts the activities SMUD utilizes to address specific wildfire risk factors.

SMUD continues to meet or exceed vegetation clearance requirements and other industry standards. SMUD has also identified a series of measures for its entire electric system intended to prevent wildfires from occurring, minimize the spread of any fire that does occur, and improve the resiliency of its system. These measures include the installation of Cal-Fire approved exempt material to reduce the risk of sparking; the strengthening of equipment exposed to strong wind conditions; and the increased monitoring of, and identified response to, fire conditions.

SMUD uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping of wildfire hazard areas to analyze and plan infrastructure development. It also addresses and continuously reevaluates its assets for the density and quantity of developments, emergency access, landscaping, and water supply. SMUD performs regular patrols of vegetation and obstruction around SMUD facilities in areas that are specifically designated by CalFire as hazardous. SMUD has cyclical weed clearing and tree-trimming programs for all its equipment, regardless of the area’s fire risk.

SMUD practices fuel management activities that are essential in establishing the desired levels of fire protection, while also minimizing the detrimental impacts of vegetation removal on the local terrain. Fuel management activities include grazing, prescribed burns, firewood collection of hazardous fuels, mechanical vegetation removal, and limited chemical vegetation control. SMUD has special approval from local agencies to remove vegetation with increased “fuel ladder” potential that exist outside SMUD’s right of way. A “fuel ladder” is any vegetation that would allow fire to climb into the tree canopy. In addition, SMUD works with property owners to identify and perform tree pruning and removal on private property. SMUD works with the property owners to ensure they understand the work needed to ensure public safety and reliability. See Figure 13 below for examples of vegetation management clearing of distribution right of ways.

The identified responses include operational procedures for the de-energization of lines during high fire threat conditions, and operational protocols for disabling the use of reclosing functionality on our transmission lines within the high fire threat areas and on our distribution lines during fire season in areas of high vegetation.

| Wildfire Mitigation Plan          | SMUD maintains a Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP) that is reviewed and updated on an annual basis. The plan identifies the risks, SMUD's wildfire management programs/process, and additional mitigations where necessary. In addition, it also outlines SMUD’s customer, community and stakeholder outreach and communications during de-energization events. |
| Vegetation Management Program      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Supplier joint response coordination | Since much of SMUD's critical assets and replacement parts are unique or made to order and the lead-time for manufacturing and delivery of these materials could take up to a year. It is important for the continued operation of the power grid to                                                                 |

|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Substation transformer oil testing      | SMUD performs oil sampling and testing on substation class transformers on a fixed interval to monitor gasses and other contaminants. Monitoring the gasses has allowed us to prevent failures that could result in oil expulsion and spills. The intervals are shortened where certain thresholds are met. |
| Visual and Infrared (IR) inspections on substation equipment | SMUD performs Visual and IR inspections on substation equipment on a fixed interval. The inspections allow crews to identify potential hazards and problems. Issues found are corrected based on severity of the problem and nature of the equipment. |
| Automatic reclosing                     | All Valley 115 kV, 230 kV and UARP 69 kV, 230 kV transmission auto reclosers are disabled and will remain disabled to mitigate wildfire risks. SMUD disables automatic reclosing on certain substation and line reclosers that extend into the Pole Clearing Area (PCA) during fire season. |
| De-energization                         | De-energization of lines based on pre-determined conditions.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Purchase larger substation plots        | Land for new substations is purchased large enough to allow transformers to be installed with adequate space around them to allow for fire breaks. The extra space also allows the transformers to be installed far enough away from potential structures on adjacent property to minimize the risk of urban structure fires. |
| System enhancement capital projects     | Install non-expulsion devices in PCA. Replace #6 copper conductors with heavier gauge aluminum. Upgrade existing 12kV feeders to SCADA reclosers in PCA. Strengthen fire break valve via UARP Fuels Reduction.                          |

### 11.2 Wildland-Urban Interfaced Structural Fires

#### 11.2.1 General Background

Wildland-urban interfaced structural fires refer to the fire potential of development interspersed within, or adjacent to, landscapes that support wildland fire. Urban is defined as an area with greater than one housing unit per acre.

Wildland-urban interfaced structural fires have become an increasing concern especially in the aftermath of the Maui fire where a fast-moving fire roared down the west side of the island. A combination of drought, abundant vegetation and high winds could increase the experience of urban land fires.

![Hazard Profile](https://example.com/image-url)

## 11.2.2 Hazard Profile

### Location
Wildland-urban interfaced fires have the greatest effect in locations where development has expanded into rural areas. Urban fires pose an increased threat to that of standard wildfires, as they can spread quickly between structures that are placed within close vicinity of one another. The community, critical infrastructure, and public safety are each affected by wildland-urban interfaced fire damages. SMUD owns, partially owns or operates infrastructure in wildland-urban interfaced areas at potential risk of impacts resulting from wildland-urban interfaced fires.

### Frequency and Severity
The severity of wildland-urban interfaced fires is influenced by a multitude of components, including the vegetative fuel in the area of the fire, the weather conditions, and the slope of the land. California and local agencies have adopted building codes that reduce the risk of fire embers igniting buildings. Building codes assist with reducing the frequency and severity of wildland-urban interfaced fires. However, climate change increases the risk of wildland-urban interfaced occurrence and the potential for higher rates and severity of fires increase as people move closer to fire-susceptible wildland areas.

### Past Events
SMUD has not experienced an impact to its infrastructure as a result of a wildland-urban interfaced fire.

## 11.2.3 Secondary Impacts
Potential secondary effects of a wildland-urban interfaced fire include utility failure, poor air quality, and hazardous materials spill.

## 11.2.4 Exposure and Vulnerability
A wildland-urban interfaced fire affecting a SMUD owned and operated structure could result in much more than structural damage. Communication systems, energy delivery systems, critical medical services, transportation infrastructure, and all other crucial societal functions powered by energy have potential to be damaged by urban structural fires.

The State Fire Marshal is mandated to classify lands within State Responsibility Areas into Fire Hazard Severity Zones.

The Fire Hazard Severity Zone maps are developed using a
<!-- Page 91 -->
Sacramento County is not at high risk, relative to other counties in California, of urban fire hazard (See Figure 14). However, the surrounding counties of Yolo, Solano, San Joaquin, Costa, Placer, and Sutter are all “high” ranked wildfire hazard areas. A wind event combined with a wildfire event in a bordering county would put SMUD at an increased risk for a wildland-urban interfaced fire hazard event.

Figure 14 depicts the map developed by the State Fire Marshal’s office illustrating the Fire Hazard Severity Zones for Sacramento County.

## 11.2.5 Current Mitigation

Table 25 depicts the current wildland-urban interface structural fire mitigation efforts SMUD utilizes.

### Table 25: Current Wildland Urban Interface Structural Fire Hazards Mitigation

| Mitigation Description |
|------------------------|
| **New SMUD construction follows California’s Building Code** | California’s Wildland-Urban Interface Code serves to establish minimum standards for the protection of life and property by increasing the ability of a building located in any Fire Hazard Severity Zone within State Responsibility Areas or any Wildland-Urban Interface Fire Area to resist the intrusion of flames or burning embers projected by a vegetation fire and contributes to a systematic reduction in conflagration losses. SMUD complies with the California Building Code and Wildland-Urban Interface Code for all of its structures located within State Responsibility Areas and Urban Wildland Areas regardless of the areas’ fire risk. |
| **Establishing defensible space** | SMUD also implements the creation of defensible space, or the removal of fuel bearing vegetation within 100 feet of a structure. |
| **Prescribed burning** | At times, SMUD will support prescribed burning to reduce fuel loads that threaten public safety and property. |
| **Management and maintenance of existing structure** | Continually monitor and update facilities and infrastructure to comply with regulatory requirements and fire safety standards. |
| **Survey areas** | Spray areas already cleared to maintain vegetation around facilities. Survey areas for potential vegetation removal. |

## 12.0 Water Rise Hazards

This section will cover flood and other water rise hazards collectively. These water rise hazards include:
- Flood and flash floods
- Riverine, stream and alluvial flood hazards
- Sea level rise, coastal flooding, and erosion hazards
- Tsunami and seiche hazards
- Levee failure
- Dam failure

### 12.1 Flood and Flashflood

#### 12.1.1 General Background

Flooding occurs when a body of water rises and overflows onto “normally” dry land. Floods are the most common of all weather-related natural hazards and can happen during heavy rains, when ocean waves come on shore, when snow melts quickly, or when dams and levees break. Flooding can result in significant damage to structures, landscapes, utilities, and human life.

---

88 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 95 -->
# 12.1.2 Hazard Profile

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Severe Storms Laboratory, “damaging flooding may happen with only a few inches of water, or it may cover a house to the rooftop. Floods can occur within minutes or over a long period, and may last days, weeks, or longer. Floods are the most common and widespread of all weather-related natural disasters.”

Flash floods are the most dangerous kind of floods because they combine the destructive power of a flood with incredible speed. Flash floods occur when heavy rainfall exceeds the ability of the ground to absorb it. They also occur when water fills normally dry creeks or streams or enough water accumulates for streams to overtop their banks, causing rapid rises of water in a short amount of time. They can happen within minutes of the causative rainfall, limiting the time available to warn and protect the public.

## Location

Flooding occurs in every part of the United States (U.S.) and is a catastrophe around the world. In the U.S. floods kill more people each year than tornadoes, hurricanes, or lightning.

Densely populated areas are at a higher risk for flash floods as roadways, buildings and other structures increase runoff by reducing the amount of rain absorbed by the ground.

Most of SMUD’s transmission and power generation infrastructure and equipment are located in areas that are less populated. Most of SMUD’s distribution infrastructure and equipment are located within more densely populated areas. However, SMUD does own transmission in Sacramento County in very urban areas. SMUD’s infrastructure is susceptible to both floods and flash floods.

In addition, Sacramento, where SMUD’s Headquarters Campus and East Campus Operation Center are located, is located by many rivers, lakes, levees, and dams, which have the potential of flooding.

## Frequency and Severity

According to the State of California’s Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan, flooding is widespread and the second most frequent disaster source in the State. Flooding is the most frequent and costly natural hazard in the United States, a hazard that has caused more than 10,000 deaths since 1900. Approximately 90 percent of presidentially declared disasters result from natural hazard events with flooding as a major component. The Plan Area, specifically Sacramento, has the greatest risk of flooding of any major city in the country.

**12.1.3 Exposure and Vulnerability**  
If flooding were to occur in the Plan Area, impacts could include loss of life, reduction of grid reliability, damage to infrastructure and increased safety risks. Within 6 hours of heavy rain, area rivers and tributaries become swollen and can even begin to overspill their banks in a few places, especially in historically vulnerable locations: small streams, creeks, canals, and drainage ditches tend to overflow. Normally dry gullies or dry creek-beds become alive. In flatter terrain, expanded areas of inundation occur around low-lying spots covering several secondary roads. In urban places, expanded areas of inundation occur at several underpasses or poor drainage spots, with some streets and parking lots taking on moving water. Storm drains and retention ponds overflow. In mountain areas, considerable run-off moving fast down the valley washes out some roads, especially in river valleys. Hillsides vulnerable to erosion become a concern for mudslides. Overall, flash flooding impacts buildings and roads with several evacuations necessary; damage is moderate.

![Flooding, erosion, and debris flows commonly occur in California during periods following large, hot fires. Wildfires greatly reduce the amount of vegetation and affect the soils, which in turn reduces the capabilities for the terrain to absorb rainwater. This effect allows for excessive water runoff that will often carry large amounts of debris. Structures located near a major burn area are most susceptible to flooding. SMUD’s Plan Area has experienced flooding periodically during and following major storms. This is a natural incident, given that the City of Sacramento is located at the confluence of two major rivers. It was commonly believed prior to 1986 that the levees containing the Sacramento River and the American River were of sufficient height and stability to protect the City of Sacramento from 100-year or greater storms. However, the storms that occurred in February 1986 demonstrated that those levees are not sufficient. Not only was the City of Sacramento at risk from the water flowing through the Sacramento and American Rivers, but also from the tributaries and streams that flow into those rivers, particularly Natomas East Main Drainage Canal, Arcade, and Magpie Creeks in the north and Morrison Creek stream group in the south that eventually flows into Beach Lake and returns to the Cosumnes watershed. As a result, the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency (SAFCA) was formed to work with State and Federal authorities to identify and construct levee improvements and other facilities to provide 200-year level of protection for the City of Sacramento on the American River system. This work is still ongoing. SMUD will likely encounter direct and indirect impacts from sea level rise and flooding in the next several decades. While sea level rise and flooding are each a concern of climate change, the impacts compound in the Sacramento region due to the interconnected nature of snowmelt from the Sierras and ocean access from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (the Delta). SAFCA suggests that Sacramento has the greatest risk of flooding when compared to all other cities in the United States. Future Trends in Development Sea level along California’s coast has risen approximately 7 in. in the last century, and this rate is expected to accelerate south of Cape Mendocino 5 – 24 inches (5 in – 2 ft.) by 2050 and 17 – 66 inches (1.4 - 5.5 ft.) by 2100 relative to a 2000 baseline dependent on specific carbon emissions scenarios. With current sea-level rise conditions, the Risk Business Project predicts that roughly $8-$10 billions of existing property in California could be flooded by 2050 with an additional $6-$10 billion susceptible to flooding at high tides.**

![Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028](https://example.com/image.jpg)

Combined with Sacramento’s particular vulnerability to flooding, sea level rise could have major implications to assets and infrastructure on which SMUD depends.

## 12.2 Riverine, Stream and Alluvial Flood Hazards
According to Sacramento County, numerous parcels and roads throughout the County not included in FEMA-100 and 500-year floodplains are subject to flooding in heavy rains. In addition to flooding, damage to these areas during heavy storms includes pavement deterioration, washouts, mudslides, debris areas, and downed trees. SMUD’s Plan Area is vulnerable to flood (riverine, stream and alluvial), sea-level rise, erosion, tsunami, landslides, severe thunderstorms, and tree mortality. There are many vulnerable public and private assets, crops, vulnerable communities (elderly, children, disabled, etc.), SMUD power assets, water facilities, etc. within SMUD’s Plan Area. If any of the above events were to occur, it could adversely impact first response services provided.

Riverine flooding happens when a watercourse exceeds its “bank-full” capacity. The event is generally a result of prolonged rainfall, or a combination of rainfall and snowmelt. In SMUD’s Plan Area, riverine flooding will occur most often between the months of November and April. The intense storms that happen during these months can overwhelm local waterways and compromise the integrity of flood control structures.

## 12.3 Sea Level Rise, Coastal Flooding and Erosion Hazards
Coastal erosion is a natural geomorphic process. Coastal erosion is accelerated by factors such as winter storms, tidal action, wind-generated high surf, wave action, and rising sea levels. Periods of heavy rain have resulted in the highest sea level readings along California’s coast. Climate change plays a significant role in rising sea levels and may increase the frequency of severe weather and winter storms.

Sea level rising has a significant impact on the environment. If coastal habitats are unable to migrate inland due to rising sea levels, they may become inundated by salt-water intrusion. This will result in land subsidence, a loss of habitat for fish and wildlife, and loss of aesthetic, recreational, and commercial uses.

SMUD has not been impacted by any instances of sea level rise, coastal flooding, or erosion hazards. It is anticipated that with climate change, SMUD could potentially be impacted by this in the future.

## 12.4 Tsunami and Seiche Hazards
A tsunami is a wave triggered by any form of land displacement along the edge or bottom of an ocean or lake. Tsunamis are rare and can quickly put the lives of coastal residents, business, and visitors in jeopardy. California is vulnerable to local and distant tsunamis, but tsunamis are typically more disastrous and threatening because they afford at-risk populations only a few minutes to reach safety.

A seiche is a standing wave in an enclosed or partially enclosed body of water. Seiches have been observed on lakes, reservoirs, bays, harbors and at sea. Seiches could cause damage to

**12.5 Levee Failure**  
A levee failure or breach is classified where a levee partially or completely releases the previously contained water to flood the land behind the levee. The two main reasons for levee breaches are erosion and overtopping. Erosion can be caused by natural elements such as the wind and water, which can create new or worsen existing damage of the levee. A majority of the urban center of Sacramento is dependent on the presence of levees (See Figure 17). A levee failure would be detrimental to SMUD’s Plan Area.

Folsom Dam provides primary flood management for much of Sacramento County. The dam is operated in concert with other major dams on the Yuba, Bear, Feather, and smaller rivers to protect various areas from flooding. Levees protecting Sacramento could fail if water were released from Folsom Dam or other dams which could cause the American River or Sacramento River to rise above the top of the levees. The release capacity of Folsom Dam substantially exceeds the capacity of American River levees, and Sacramento could be flooded to protect the safety of Folsom Dam or other areas. This flood operation decision is the responsibility of the US Army Corps of Engineers.

A major flooding of downtown Sacramento would present great challenges for SMUD. Much of the California government would be without electrical power for many weeks, potentially even longer (months) due to supply chain impacts, first while floodwaters receded and then later while repairing the damage to the underground distribution system and other area assets. Many thousands of downtown employees would not be able to work and would suffer economic hardship. SMUD revenues would be impacted since key business and government customers would be unable to purchase electricity. Damage to highways such as Interstate-5, Interstate-80, State Route 99, US 50, and railroads could prevent shipment of necessary replacement parts like switchgear and transformers as well as preventing telecom companies from repairing their facilities to enable telecommuting.

<!-- Page 100 -->
![Figure 17: 2021 Sacramento County Flood Protection Zones](https://example.com/image-url)

Approximately 150 years ago, the levees of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta were raised to prevent flooding on some of the most fertile farmland in the nation. Levee failure is a high risk to SMUD due to SMUD’s Plan Area being surrounded by a network of 518 miles of levees.

<!-- Page 101 -->
Areas subject to flooding because of a levee breach in SMUD’s service area are adjacent to the Sacramento, Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and American Rivers. In addition, various sloughs, creeks, and other drainage vehicles are subject to flooding. Other areas that flood periodically are low lying. The Sutter and Yolo bypasses afford an appreciable level of flood protection from Sacramento River overflows during the winter and spring months, leaving the American and Cosumnes River as the major slow-rise flood threat. Water from the Sacramento River overflows into these bypasses over the Tisdale, Fremont, and Sacramento Weirs.

The potential of a major, catastrophic levee failure on a major watercourse is like that of a levee overtopping on a secondary stream. The State/Federal River Forecast Center in Sacramento monitors the Sacramento, Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and American Rivers through a series of stations located along the rivers. The system affords a degree of advance flood warning for emergency responders.

### 12.6 Dam Failure
Since the 1850's, hundreds of dams and reservoirs have been built in California. They have been built to provide water for populations and agriculture, to allow for flood control, as a source of hydroelectric power, and for recreation. The storage capacity of these reservoirs ranges from a few hundred acre-feet to 5,000,000 ac-ft. The water from these reservoirs eventually makes its way to the Pacific Ocean through several river systems.

Dam failure is defined as any uncontrolled release of water, and it does not need to be a complete and catastrophic failure of a dam. Depending on the nature of the failure, it can result in a small release of water, or it can lead to catastrophic flooding. Dam failure can be the result of a variety of natural or human-induced factors such as structural failure of the materials constituting the dam and/or spillways, dam overtopping due to flood conditions, earthquakes, sabotage, and inadequate maintenance and monitoring. In the event of a dam failure, the energy of the water stored behind the dam can cause rapid and unexpected flooding downstream, affecting multiple communities and river landscapes, resulting in loss of life and property damage. Secondary effects include loss of water supply or power generation.

SMUD owns the following dams:

| **Table 27: SMUD Owned Dams** |
|-------------------------------|
| Brush Creek Dam               | Loon Lake Dam                |
| Buck Island Dam               | Rancho Seco Dam             |
| Camino Dam                    | Robbs Peak Dam              |

| Ice House Dam                 | Union Valley Dam             |

95 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 102 -->
There are several other dams not owned by SMUD, both within and outside SMUD’s plan area, where a catastrophic dam failure would impact SMUD electrical system infrastructure and affect SMUD customers in myriad other ways.

## 12.6.1 Hazard Profile
SMUD’s Plan Area has historically been subject to periodic flooding. Much of the flood risk in SMUD’s Plan Area is a result of heavy rainfall and resulting stream and drainage canal overflows. Figure 18 below is the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) of SMUD’s Plan Area, which shows special hazard areas and risk premium zones, as delineated by FEMA. There have not been any flooding related hazards because of SMUD’s operations.

Flooding resulting from a dam failure can also result from any one or a combination of the following causes:
- Earthquake;
- Inadequate spillway capacity resulting in excess overtopping flows;
- Internal erosion caused by embankment or foundation leakage, piping or rodent activity;
- Improper design;
- Negligent operation; and/or
- Failure of upstream dams on the same waterway to name a few.

The California Department of Water Resources (CA DWR) Division of Safety of Dams (DSOD) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Division of Dam Safety and Inspections (D2SI) have dam safety regulatory oversight of SMUD’s dams. They also assign hazard classifications to dams. Existing land use and land use controls (zoning) downstream of the dam are two factors considered in assigning hazard ratings. CA DWR DSOD uses four hazard classification categories:
- Extremely high hazard potential – expected to cause considerable loss of human life or would result in an inundation area with a population of 1,000 or more;
- High hazard potential – expected to cause loss of at least one human life;
- Significant hazard potential – no probable loss of human life but can cause economic loss, environmental damage, impacts to critical facilities, or other significant impacts;
- Low hazard potential – no probable loss of human life and low economic and environmental losses. Losses are expected to be principally limited to the owner’s property.

SMUD owns 6 dams that are designated by CA DWR DSOD as high or extremely high hazard potential dams. They are the Loon Lake, Ice House, Union Valley, Slab Creek, Chili Bar and Rancho Seco Dams. The locations of all SMUD dams can be found in figure 18 below.

<!-- Page 103 -->
![Figure 18: FEMA 100- & 500-Year Flood Plains around SMUD Service Area](https://example.com/image-url)

In addition, dam failures have the potential to cause loss of life, damage to property, and other ensuing hazards, as well as the displacement of persons residing in or near the inundation path. Damage to electric generating facilities and transmission lines could also affect life support systems in communities outside the immediate hazard areas.

**High Hazard Dam Assessment**  
A failure of one or more of SMUD’s high-hazard potential dams would impact communities downstream. Since 2014, all of SMUD’s high-hazard potential dams have had emergency action plans, EAPs. All EAPs and subsequent updates have been approved by the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services as required by Senate Bill 92.

SMUD’s EAPs were developed through collaborative meetings and consultation with local emergency response agencies: the Sacramento County Office of Emergency Services, Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department Herald Fire Protection District, Cosumnes Fire Department, El Dorado County Office of Emergency Services, El Dorado County Sheriff’s Office, Placer County Office of Emergency Services, Placer County Sheriff’s Office and CalFIRE. In addition, California DWR Division of Safety of Dams, FERC D2SI, the National Weather Service, and the California DWR Division of Flood Management were consulted.

97 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 104 -->
![Rancho Seco Inundation Map](https://example.com/path/to/image)  
The EAP development process is extensive; it includes the development of technical reports and inundation maps. Figure 19 is an example shown of an inundation map of one of SMUD's high hazard dams, Rancho Seco Dam.

**Figure 19: Rancho Seco Inundation Map**

**Frequency and Severity**  
A catastrophic dam failure could exceed the capability of affected emergency response agencies. Damage control and disaster relief support would be required from other local governmental and private organizations, state and federal governments, and other utilities.

While some of SMUD’s dams are located upstream from unpopulated areas and large reservoirs, most are not. Failure of Union Valley Dam, for example, could result in widespread flooding of large parts of Sacramento and cause over 1,000 deaths.  

SMUD continues to minimize the impact of dam failure on the local community by complying with the FERC and Cal OES requirements to engage in EAP activities associated with dam failure. An EAP process is a formal procedure that identifies potential emergency conditions at a dam and results in a series of coordinated actions to be taken by a variety of parties to minimize loss of life and property damage in the event of a dam failure. SMUD’s EAPs include:  

35 SMUD, 2022, Dam Failure Analysis and Inundation Map, Union Valley Dam, available from DWR website  
98 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 105 -->
- A set of procedures SMUD follows to notify downstream emergency management agencies. The sheriff’s office with jurisdiction of the downstream area is responsible for the emergency response. They are aware of the potential for dam failure in their area. Every five years emergency response agencies participate in a dam failure response exercise led by SMUD.
- A set of inundation maps recognize high priority dams to aid emergency management agencies in identification of critical infrastructure and/or communities at risk for warning and evacuation planning.
- A detailed plan of coordination and communication between SMUD and emergency management agencies that will apply in the event of emergencies related to actual dam failure at SMUD’s dams.
- EAPs are routinely reviewed and must be approved by Cal OES, Department of Water Resources Division of Safety of Dams, and FERC Division of Dam Safety and Inspections.

**Past Events**  
None of SMUD’s dams have failed. Table 28 lists recent dam incidents in the Plan Area.

**Table 28: Failure of Spillways and Related Facilities Since 1990**

| Year | Name        | Extent of damage                                      |
|------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1995 | Folsom Dam  | Spillway gate failure. Flooding confined to American River Parkway. |
| 1997 | Folsom Dam  | Holes in floor of the conduit. No flooding occurred. |
| 2017 | Oroville Dam | Evacuation of 180,000 people. $870 MM in damages.   |

**12.7 Current Mitigation Efforts for Water Rise Hazards**  
The DWR Division of Safety of Dams assigns condition assessment ratings to California dams; all SMUD dams were assessed as satisfactory. Satisfactory is the highest rating indicating no existing or potential dam safety deficiencies are recognized. SMUD’s dam safety program continues to monitor, assess, and identify ways to mitigate any future potential impacts from a breach of our dams. For high hazard dams, additional dam performance monitoring and surveillance is performed that is required under licensed requirements.

Table 29 depicts the current water rise mitigation efforts SMUD employs.

### 13.0 Earthquakes and Geological Hazards

SMUD’s Plan Area is susceptible to liquefaction, subsidence, landslides, earthquakes, and volcanic activity. Volcanic activity is a potential predecessor/cause of earthquakes whereas subsidence, liquefaction, and landslides can be products of earthquakes. Northern California is at high risk of earthquake and other geological occurrences due to the proximity of the San Andreas Fault system and several nearby volcanoes.

The loss of electric power due to earthquake can occur from many related effects of a violent ground shake. Landslides can damage power line structures (poles/towers), substations, and switchyards. Liquefaction can cause misalignment of the power train of electric plants. Other SMUD assets vulnerable to earthquake damage include natural gas pipelines, liquid storage facilities, water supply systems, dams, communication systems, transportation systems, and disposal systems. Most of these assets rely on electric power. A disruption in the supply of electric power could have extremely detrimental impacts to SMUD and the community. Damages to gas pipelines and excessive flooding could lead to loss of life and economic impact. 

100 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 107 -->
For example, a major earthquake could cause damage and possible failure of Nimbus and/or Folsom Dam. Evacuation of persons in the inundation area would be necessary. The damage and/or possible failure of either dam could severely damage SMUD’s energy system. It is not feasible to accurately forecast the severity of such an incident.

Power outages or power reductions can be expected throughout SMUD’s service area. Downed power lines are a potential hazard and could complicate emergency response efforts. Substations and other portions of the infrastructure, especially the underground equipment, may be particularly susceptible to damage. Administrative facilities may be subject to damage. In addition, transmission facilities outside the service area may be damaged and limit the import capabilities, thus limiting the total amount of energy available for distribution and other operations. Generation facilities may experience interruptions or may be taken offline due to shaking or loss of load.

The immediate physical, emotional, and social impact on the population would be varied and complex. In the hardest hit areas, there could be deaths and many injuries. Many could have their homes destroyed, others driven from their homes by the lack of water and/or power, leaking gas, flooding and so on.

### 13.1 Earthquake
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) describes an earthquake as both the sudden slip on an active fault and the resulting shaking and radiated seismic energy caused by the slip. Liquefaction can be a secondary effect of seismic activity on specific types of soil. This could result in differential settlement, dam failures, landslides, tsunamis, and loss of critical infrastructure. Human life is also at high risk during an earthquake event. Earthquakes represent the most destructive source of hazards, risk, and vulnerability, in terms of both recent state history and the probability of future destruction of greater magnitudes than previously recorded.

### 13.1.1 Hazard Profile
**Location**  
California is vulnerable to earthquakes because the state sits atop the boundary between two of the earth’s tectonic plates, the Pacific Plate, and the North American Plate. These two plates are constantly moving at a relative rate of two inches per year. The primary boundary between these two plates is the San Andreas Fault, which is more than 650 miles long and extends to depths of at least 10 miles. Many other small faults such as the Hayward and Calaveras faults branch from and join the San Andreas Fault zone. According to the most recent information provided by the California Earthquake Authority, there is greater than a 99% chance that a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake capable of causing extensive damage and loss of life will occur in California within the next 30 years. Moreover, minor earthquakes not associated with faults occur weekly.

**Frequency and Severity**  
There are several faults known to exist within or near SMUD’s Plan Area that could affect SMUD’s energy system. In the eastern part of Sacramento County, the Bear Mountain and

Melones Faults are found. They are believed to have been inactive for the past 150 million years. The Bear Mountain Fault passes beneath the west end of Folsom Lake.

No faults are currently known to exist within the City of Sacramento portion of the County. It should be noted that significant earthquakes have occurred on previously undetected faults. Although no faults exist there, Sacramento does feel residue from ground shaking because of radiated seismic energy.

The threat of earthquake damage in SMUD’s Plan Area comes from earthquakes along Northern California's major faults, which are the Green Valley, San Andreas, Calaveras, and Hayward faults. A major earthquake on any of these faults could cause shaking within the Plan Area to an intensity of V to VIII on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, which means damage might be expected only in poorly built structures. Assets closer to the fault will experience stronger intensity than those further away.

SMUD’s operations depend on infrastructure which is owned and/or operated within the regions of the Delta, Sierra Nevada and Greater Sacramento areas, Greater Bay Area, and the Shasta Cascade as defined by the California Earthquake Authority.

The Plan Area has a high risk of a major earthquake (7.0 magnitude or higher) occurring within 50km in the next 30 years, approximately 77%37.

A major earthquake that impacts SMUD’s Plan Area could cause a great many casualties, extensive property damage, fires, flooding, and other types of hazards. The effects of an earthquake could be aggravated by aftershocks and by the secondary effects of fire, landslides, and dam failure. The time of day and season of the year could potentially also have a profound impact on the number of fatalities and/or injuries and the amount of damage sustained. Such an earthquake could be catastrophic in its effect on the population and could exceed the response capability of the state and local communities. Damage control and disaster relief support would be required from other local governmental and private organizations, state and federal governments, and other utilities.

Extensive research and rescue operations may be required to assist trapped or injured persons. Emergency medical care, food, and temporary shelter would be required for injured or displaced persons. Following an earthquake, mass evacuation may be essential to save lives, particularly in areas below dams. Emergency operations could be seriously hampered by the loss of communications and damage to transportation routes within, and to and from, the disaster area(s) and by the disruption of public utilities and services. Figure 20 shows the relative intensity of ground shaking potential in SMUD’s Plan Area from anticipated future earthquakes.

A fault rupture occurs when one segment of the earth’s crust slides past another and a store of elastic energy is released as an earthquake. The resulting fracture is referred to as a fault. The sliding of the segments of earth on either side of the fault is referred to as the rupture. The fault rupture, aside from releasing an earthquake, can damage any structures or utility infrastructure around it, as the earth’s surface becomes displaced.

**Frequency and Severity**

No major, active faults traverse SMUD’s Plan Area. However, there is a multitude of subsurface faults in the Delta. Additionally, active faults do exist near SMUD’s Plan Area that could have a detrimental impact on SMUD’s infrastructure if a high intensity earthquake event were to take place (see Table 31). Table 32 shows the active faults by county.

A fault rupture, causing an earthquake event, can lead to many detrimental residual hazards. Relative to the rest of the state of California, SMUD is at a low risk for the likelihood of a fault rupture and its residual effects (See Figure 22). Nonetheless, SMUD still has assets that remain vulnerable to shaking from fault ruptures among active faults in California and Nevada, as well as earthquakes not associated with fault rupture. Failure of these assets could lead to loss of both life and crucial infrastructure in SMUD’s Plan Area.

# 13.3 Liquefaction
Liquefaction is one of the potential hazards that is a secondary effect of an earthquake. Liquefaction occurs when seismic ground shaking suddenly temporarily causes saturated soil to lose strength and firmness. Material that is normally solid begins to behave as a dense liquid. The effect is similar to a structure on quicksand. If the liquefied layer is on the subsurface, structures upon it will begin to move laterally.

Liquefaction is most likely to occur in areas where the groundwater level is shallow.

## 13.3.1 Hazard Profile
### Location
Conditions such as liquefaction are most common in areas where alluvial soil is present. Alluvial soil is most prevalent in places where sandy sediments have been deposited by rivers, in moderate to large canyons, and areas in which wave action has deposited sediment along a beach. Bridges, wharves, piers, and underwater utility lines are most susceptible to the negative impacts of liquefaction.

In SMUD’s Plan Area, the Delta and downtown Sacramento are at the greatest risk to liquefaction. Though SMUD’s Plan Area has not endured any major earthquake events in recent history, there are at least five faults that lie near the Delta that can generate peak ground acceleration. The 1,100 miles of levees that surround the Delta may become unstable under seismic loading. The presence of sand and silt in the levees make liquefaction a very high possibility.

# 13.4 Subsidence
Subsidence is a sinking of the ground. More specifically, it is deemed as “movement in which there is no free side and surface material is displaced vertically downward with little or no horizontal component.”

## 13.4.1 Hazard Profile
### Location
SMUD’s Plan Area is affected by some unique types of subsidence. The types of subsidence include:
- Earthquake-induced subsidence. This type of subsidence occurs when earthquake shaking causes the compaction of unconsolidated soils.
- Subsidence due to compaction by heavy structures. The Delta levees subside, in part, because of their own weight.
- Subsidence due to wind erosion of peat soils in the Delta.
- Subsidence due to fluid withdrawal. The removal of oil and gas in the Delta has caused some slight subsidence of soils in the Delta. Water withdrawal has been a much more important problem in Sacramento County.
- Subsidence due to peat oxidation in the Delta.

---

107 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 114 -->
![Figure 23: Known and Potential Subsidence Areas in Sacramento County](https://example.com/image-url)

**Frequency and Severity**  
Subsidence due to peat oxidation occurs in the Delta. Farmers drain the surface of the soil to plant and plow. When the peat dries out, aerobic bacteria can feed on the peat and convert it to carbon dioxide and other gaseous substances in a process called peat oxidation. Gradually, the peat is disappearing to the bacteria.

The subsidence in the Delta has caused problems for flood control because it places increasing pressure on the levees. These levees keep the surrounding water from inundating lower areas. The increasing hydrostatic pressure caused by the subsidence weakens the levees, necessitating periodic rebuilding. In terms of economic costs, subsidence makes flood protection increasingly expensive.

![Past Events](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
**Past Events**  
SMUD anticipates that within its Plan Area, if there continues to be drier climates, which removes water from the ground, making it dry, there will be increased risk of subsidence. To date, SMUD has not been impacted by subsidence.  

There are no SMUD administrative facilities known to be in areas of existing, ongoing, or potential subsidence. Earth movement and sinking has developed at some substation sites. These conditions have been corrected.  

### 13.5 Landslides  
The Plan Area is susceptible to landslides. Landslide refers to a variety of slope instabilities that result in the downward and outward movement of slope-forming materials including rocks, soil, and artificial fill.  

#### 13.5.1 Hazard Profile  
**Location**  
Most landslides occur during rainy months when soil is saturated with water. Winter storms with intense rainfalls are the most common trigger for landslides. Masses of rock and soils can become detached from steep slopes or cliffs because of earthquakes, flooding, and/or drought and is strongly influenced by gravity, weathering, undercutting, or erosion. Rotational slides caused by the earth movements create a concaved upward movement of soil. This usually results in a bulging “toe” made of the slid material at the bottom of the slide. These types of land movement could cause significant damage to roads, leaving them unsafe to travel on.  

Landslide impacts are geographically limited to the area where the slide occurs and are primarily associated with mountainous regions. The potential for larger slides in SMUD’s Plan Area exists in the UARP and other mountainous regions. The primary factors that could cause or increase the likelihood of landslides for SMUD are:  
- Naturally occurring geological movement including rainfall, water action, seismic, and volcanic activities.  
- Excavation and grading on sloping ground for homes, roads, and other structures.  
- Drainage and groundwater alterations or breaches.  
- Change or removal of vegetation located on steep slopes.  

**Frequency and Severity**  
Landslides can occur throughout the Plan Area, though more tend to occur in areas with steeper slopes, weaker geology, and high annual precipitation. Landslides may result from several things including natural and human-caused changes in the environment such as heavy rain, rapid snow melt, steepening of slopes due to construction or erosion, earthquakes, changes in groundwater levels and deforestation caused by wildfires. There have been incidents of landslides and general slope failure in isolated portions of El Dorado County, but it is an uncommon occurrence with no defined history of significant damages.  

109 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 116 -->
![Hazard Mitigation Plan](https://example.com/image.png)

A more detailed landslide hazard assessment requires a site-specific analysis of the slope, soil, rock, vegetation, and groundwater characteristics. Such assessments are often conducted prior to major development projects in areas with moderate to high landslide potential, to evaluate the specific hazard at the development site. SMUD does not have sufficient information to determine the extent of landslides in its Plan Area. It has not been impacted by such an event.

## 13.6 Volcanoes

Volcanic eruptions are one of Earth's most dramatic and violent agents of change. Not only can powerful explosive eruptions drastically alter land and water for tens of kilometers around a volcano, but tiny liquid droplets of sulfuric acid erupted into the stratosphere can change our planet's climate temporarily.

### 13.6.1 Hazard Profile

**Frequency and Severity**  
The principal hazards to people in the Pacific Northwest are from lahars and ash fall. Lahars (volcanic mudflows) can destroy buildings and infrastructure. Eruptions that include volcanic ash can be especially dangerous for aircraft, even at long distances from the volcano because volcanic ash can clog and shut down their engines. Explosive eruptions of volcanic particles are followed by effusion of lava flows. High-speed avalanches of hot rock and gas can accompany columns of tephra collapse or the fronts of lava flows, both of which can send pyroclastics flowing down the volcano's flanks. Finally, when the erupted material mixes with river water or melts snow and ice, volcanic mudflows sweep down valleys and can devastate areas more than 50 miles downstream. Rivers can continue to carry volcanic sediment downstream and force flooding for decades to hundreds of years. The most significant threats are from volcanic ash and from the slurry of mud and debris within lahars. Even in the absence of eruption, the flanks of Cascade volcanoes can collapse, which result in landslides and debris avalanches that can destroy areas downslope from the collapse location.

Volcanoes pose multiple types of hazards, and the initiation and duration of eruptions is relatively uncertain. Therefore, authorities and populations at risk, both close to and far from the volcano, must be knowledgeable about volcanic hazards so that they can be flexible and prepared in their response.

Eruptions often force people living near volcanoes to abandon their land and homes, sometimes forever. Those living farther away are likely to avoid complete destruction, but their cities and towns, crops, industrial plants, transportation systems, and electrical grids can still be damaged by tephra, ash, lahars, and flooding.

Fortunately, volcanoes exhibit precursory unrest that, when detected and analyzed in time, allows eruptions to be anticipated and communities at risk to be forewarned. The warning time preceding volcanic events typically allows sufficient time for affected communities to implement response plans and mitigation measures.

111 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 118 -->
Hazard response and coordination plans are multi-agency efforts that define the responsibilities and actions to take in the event of a restless or active volcano. Scientists from the five regional volcanic observatories of the USGS Volcano Hazards Program participate in developing these plans with state and local governments of at-risk areas. If volcanic unrest or an eruption occurs, scientists from the observatories will keep state and local officials informed of potential hazards so that coordination and response plans can be updated as needed.

## 13.7 Current Mitigation Efforts for Geological Hazards

SMUD’s mitigation efforts for earthquake and geological hazards events are uniform with the requirements of the State of California. A list of current mitigation activities is depicted in table 34 below.

### Table 34: Current Geological Hazards Mitigation

| Mitigation                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mapping                             | SMUD has identified all site-specific earthquake hazards and has created an identification map with operational emergency processes for the recognized seismic events that could occur, could trigger reinsection of certain assets as appropriate. |
| Adhering to codes                   | SMUD follows all current building codes and makes regular structural improvements to its facilities. Critical facilities are subject to more scrutinizing and innovative regulations and mitigation measures.                       |
| Vulnerability assessment             | SMUD regularly assesses its water supply, oil, and natural gas pipelines for potential failure during an earthquake event. SMUD’s high hazard potential and significant hazard potential dams in the UARP are inspected annually with FERC and DSOD. All dams were found to not fail according to the guidelines. |
| EOC                                 | SMUD maintains an EOC to help coordinate real-time incident command, response, and recovery from all emergencies, including those resulting from hazards.                                                                          |
| Supplier joint-response agreement    | Since much of SMUD’s critical assets and replacement parts are unique or made to order and the lead-time for manufacturing and delivery of these materials could take up to a year, it is important for the continued operation of the power grid to maintain the health and safety of our community, to participate in a supplier joint response coordination. The coordination allows SMUD to borrow from participating utilities and suppliers, key assets for immediate use. |
| Gap analysis                        | SMUD actively practices identification of gaps in current response plans for earthquake events and revises them regularly.                                                                                                      |
| Proper equipment                    | SMUD utilizes flexible piping, flexible couplings, and above ground fault crossings.                                                                                                                                           |

# 14.0 Severe Weather and Storms

Severe weather is a weather event that is beyond the range of commonly observed weather patterns in a geographic area. In the SMUD Plan Area, the usual events could include extreme heat, heavy rain, hail, lightning, and strong winds. The full possibility of weather events includes rainfall events, heat waves, storms, unusually cold temperatures, and wind events. California is projected to endure an increase in severe weather events due to climate change.

Severe weather can be viewed in four phases (see table 35) to communicate and coordinate with local agencies, mobilize necessary resources, and support local agencies in recovery efforts.

| IV    | Severe weather emergency      | Extreme weather conditions that could potentially have a life-threatening impact on the population, animals, and agriculture | Heat: heat index of over 105°F with credible weather forecasts of excessively hot weather for more than three days accompanied by night temps of 75°F or more. <br> Cold: extreme cold/freeze warnings or wind chill warnings indicating weather conditions that endanger human life with credible weather forecasts of extremely cold/freezing weather for more than three days accompanied by night temps of 32°F or less. |

## 14.1 Extreme Heat

In the Plan Area, an extreme heat day is defined as a day between April and October in which the maximum temperature exceeds the historical 98th percentile of maximum temperatures for that given day. Cal-Adapt, a web-based climate adaptation planning tool developed by the California Energy Commission defines an extreme heat day, specific to SMUD’s plan region as one that exceeds 100°F. SMUD’s concern is the impact of extreme heat.

**Frequency and Severity**  
Extreme heat has always been a characteristic of the Sacramento region and the surrounding areas. However, extreme heat events are now projected to increase in regularity throughout the state of California because of climate change. The heat events are projected to be of a greater intensity, longer duration, and influence a broader geographic area. Average night-time temperatures, especially important for public health and infrastructure, are projected to increase even faster than daytime averages.

Extreme heat can also be accompanied by increased humidity. Extreme heat combined with increased humidity can pose a serious threat to human life and the longevity of infrastructure in SMUD’s Plan Area. A series of extreme heat days occurring consecutively is referred to as an extreme heat event. As climate change continues to affect SMUD’s Plan Area, heat events are becoming more prevalent.

The National Weather Service has implemented Impact-Based Decision Support Services (IDSS) which provides improved reporting of heat risk in the SMUD Plan Area. IDSS

**Classification** | **Heat Index** | **Effect on the body**
--- | --- | ---
Caution | 80°F - 90°F | Fatigue possible with prolonged exposure and/or physical activity
Extreme Caution | 90°F - 103°F | Heat stroke, heat cramps, or heat exhaustion possible with prolonged exposure and/or physical activity
Danger | 103°F - 124°F | Heat cramps or heat exhaustion likely, and heat stroke possible with prolonged exposure and/or physical activity
Extreme Danger | 125°F or higher | Heat stroke highly likely

Extreme heat ranks as among the deadliest of all natural hazards. Humidity and extreme heat can provoke a quantity of natural hazards such as dust storms and drought. High temperatures usually coincide with low humidity. High temperatures generally contribute to the evaporation of surface water and moisture from the soil causing the soil to become loose and easier to be carried away by wind. As temperatures increase, it may overload demands for electricity to run air conditioners in homes and businesses.

![Extreme Heat and Freeze Information](https://www.nrdc.org/climate-change-and-health-extreme-heat#/map/detail/CA)

Extreme heat tends to not affect infrastructure, as heat events are generally limited in length. Infrastructure gets relief between hot and cool temperature cycles. SMUD’s biggest points of vulnerability are, given an extreme heat event, an overload demand for electricity to run air conditioners in homes and businesses and the safety of its employees in the field.

Extreme heat is harmful to the population and employees in SMUD’s Plan Area. In California, heat-related events annually send 4,300 people to the emergency room and hospitalize an additional 600 for stays longer than one day. In 2006, during one of California’s worst heatwaves, 203 deaths were attributed to heat-related events.

The populations that are most vulnerable to heat-related events include the homeless, infants and children under age five, the elderly, individuals with disabilities, individual’s dependent on medical equipment, and individuals with impaired mobility.

**Past Events**  
The Plan Area temperatures could range from moderate to extremely high heat. The warmest times of the year are typically the late summer and early fall. The Plan Area has suffered occasional heat events. The sudden spike in temperature has a great impact on residents inside and outside the Plan Area and could affect the electric grid. Table 37 depicts available data found for the most recent excess heat events in the NCDC database for the Plan Area.

**14.2 Freeze**  
Extreme cold and freeze is most likely to occur during the winter months, and often accompanies a winter storm. Sustained freezes can cause life loss and health risks to vulnerable populations. Economically, freezes can severely affect agriculture in SMUD’s Plan Area, which affects farmers, farm workers, packers, and shippers of agricultural products. Freezes can also cause significant increases in food prices to the consumer due to shortages.

117 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 124 -->
The NCDC has recorded 22 freeze incidents in SMUD’s Plan Area since 1993, resulting in $200,000 in property damage and $5MM in crop damage. In 2013, a six-day freeze event caused more than $440MM in damage to citrus crops throughout the state. Freezes are likely to become less frequent in California as climate change increases average temperatures.

**Exposure and Vulnerability**  
Exposure to extreme cold and freeze may be life threatening since it can cause frostbite or hypothermia. The populations most susceptible to the dangers of freeze are infants and the elderly. Regarding infrastructure, pipes may freeze and burst in homes or businesses that have poor insulation; ice can also form on power lines which could weigh powerlines down, stressing and damaging it. In the most extreme of conditions, freezes can impair communication facilities in SMUD’s Plan Area. If freeze is intermixed with warm weather cycles, it may result in an increase in avalanche risk.

**14.3 Fog**  
Fog is formed when ice crystals and/or water droplets collect, suspended in the air at the earth’s surface. This occurs when the air is cooled to the point that it can no longer contain all the water vapor it has accumulated. In Sacramento, fog season occurs in the late fall and winter. Fog typically forms in the early morning hours, and it can and will last several days at a time.

It is currently unclear if climate change will have a future effect on fog in the Sacramento area. However, decreasing emissions in the air in response to climate change has resulted in a decline in winter fog events over recent decades. 

Fog in the Sacramento area can reduce visibility to mere feet. This can lead to multi-car accidents and have devastating effects on transportation corridors. Severe fog can close roads, cause accidents, and impair the effectiveness of emergency responders. Electric infrastructure along roadways is at risk of accident-related damage. In addition, SMUD’s employees are required to drive heavy equipment to conduct work. Increased fog increases risks for drivers and electric workers by limiting visibility. Considering that most of SMUD’s Plan Area sits within a valley, it is at risk for dense fog. There is not enough data to determine specific potential extent of fog in SMUD’s Plan Area.

### 14.4 Severe Storms, Hail and Lightning
A thunderstorm is considered severe when it either contains three-quarters of an in-sized hail or winds more than 57.5 miles per hour (mph) - this includes tornadoes. Severe storm events are most prominent during the fall, winter, and spring. Sacramento County averages 18.14 in. of rainfall per year.

Hail is created when water droplets are carried upwards, above the freezing level. The droplets freeze, becoming too heavy for the updraft to carry, and fall to the ground. Hail is usually less than two in. in diameter, but it can fall at speeds of 120 mph.

Lightning is a visible electrical discharge caused by a thunderstorm. Lightning can strike as far as five to ten miles from the storm, in areas authorities may not consider to be a direct threat.

| **Table 39: Severe Weather Events in Sacramento County Since 1950** |
|----------------|--------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Event Type** | **Number of Events** | **Deaths** | **Injuries** | **Property Damage** | **Crop Damage** |
| Hail           | 9      | 0      | 0              | $111,030     | $0           |
| Heavy rain     | 28     | 0      | 1              | $365,000     | $50,000      |
| Lightning      | 1      | 0      | 0              | $150,000     | $0           |

### Exposure and Vulnerability
Severe storms can cause flooding as well as drainage issues in the Sacramento area. Severe storms also put many assets at risk, as flooding combined with strong winds can result in the failure of very mature trees and other geological hazards.

Hailstorms can destroy roofs, buildings, automobiles, vegetation, and SMUD assets.

Lighting can kill or injure employees and people in SMUD’s Plan Area. Assets and infrastructure can also be struck directly. These strikes could result in a burn, explosion, or destruction. Lightning can also lead to wildfire if it strikes the surface in a dry region with vegetation high in fuel.

## 14.5 High Winds and Tornadoes

The National Weather Service (NWS) defines high winds as sustained wind speeds of 40 mph or greater lasting for one hour or longer, or winds of 58 mph or greater for any duration.

High winds can lead to funnel clouds and tornadoes during severe storms. Damages from tornadoes are a result of high wind velocity and wind-blown debris accompanied by lightning or large hail. Each year, an average of 800 tornadoes occurs nationwide, resulting in an average of 80 deaths and 1,500 injuries.57

### 14.5.1 Hazard Profile
Wind speeds during a tornado can reach 300 mph. Unlike hurricanes, which can also produce such wind speeds over great geographic areas, tornadoes are confined to much smaller areas over short distances. SMUD’s Plan Area is at a low risk for tornadoes, relative to the rest of the United States. When tornadoes have occurred historically, they have done so at low intensity on the Fujita Tornado Scale58. However, if a tornado were to affect the area, it would most likely be in the late fall or early spring.

### Exposure and Vulnerability
SMUD’s Plan Area is at a low risk of hazardous levels of high winds, relative to other areas of the country (see figure 27). However, high winds are a seasonal occurrence that will continue to occur annually in the Plan Area.

**Past Events**  
Fallen trees from high winds in SMUD’s Plan Area can damage buildings as well as critical structures, including electrical overhead lines, leading to secondary impacts from fire and power outage as well as serious injury to staff or the public and potential death. The most recent high wind and storm events occurred from late December 2022 to January 2023 causing fallen trees and power outages in SMUD service territory. A selection of recorded high wind events can be found in table 40 below.

High winds, particularly those accompanying severe storms, can result in significant property and crop damage. Most hazardous to SMUD’s Plan Area, high winds can exacerbate existing weather conditions and increase the speed at which wildfire travels. Through the damage of roofs and structures, or residual damage caused by fire, winds can have a serious impact on the functional operation of SMUD assets.

High winds can result in power loss and business closures. Winds can also affect fog, dust, and snowstorms. Wind events have caused greater than $14MM in damage in SMUD’s Plan Area since 1955 (see Table 41).

Tornadoes have similar damaging potential to that of high winds. A tornado is likely to damage buildings, cause trees to fall, damage power lines, break gas lines, break sewer and water mains, and cause fires. Access to hazard recovery might also become impaired due to a tornado, as roads can be destroyed or blocked by debris.

While there are incidents of tornadoes in SMUD’s Plan Area, it poses a relatively low risk for most of the area compared to states located in the Midwest and South of the nation. The Plan Area is subject to strong winds associated with powerful winter cold fronts. Strong winds because of tornadoes could have an impact on reliability, could cause increased risk of fires and cause damages to SMUD infrastructure.

**14.6 Current Mitigation Efforts**

SMUD mitigates extreme heat by protecting its outdoor workers. SMUD provides adequate water, shade, rest breaks, training, and emergency procedures to ensure the safety of its employees. Employees are constantly evaluated for signs and symptoms of heat illness, especially in temperatures greater than 95°F. SMUD also has load flexibility and demand response programs in place to address peak load during extreme heat events and the increased use of air conditioning.

SMUD mitigates freeze with warning systems and demand response programs to handle peak load during an increase in the use of electric heating systems. SMUD mitigates high wind events through wind engineering design and construction of its assets, according to state, federal, and industry standards. To prevent the fall of trees to electrical lines, SMUD’s vegetation management program seeks to proactively identify trees at risk of falling for removal. In terms of storms and fog-related accident risk, SMUD power lines are marked and inspected for visibility and integrity. SMUD employees are trained to...

To mitigate severe weather and storm events, SMUD crews assist in maintaining clear channels, canals, and creeks by removing weeds and debris that can halt water flow during severe weather incidents. SMUD holds drills to rehearse floodgate closures to ensure a rapid response during an emergency.

### 14.7 Tree Mortality
Tree mortality refers to the death of trees due to factors such as drought-induced water stress, insect attacks, and high tree density.
<!-- Page 132 -->
![14.7.1 Hazard Profile](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=14.7.1+Hazard+Profile)

**Frequency and Severity**  
Increased tree mortality elevates fuel loads, creates hazardous conditions for firefighting personnel, decreases production rates of fire line construction, poses risk of injury and damage from falling branches, and financially impacts property owners. From 2010-2022, 208.6 million trees have died in California. This frequency is expected to increase due to continued climate change. A growth in the rate of tree mortality can affect local, regional, and global carbon budgets. Table 44 below depicts the estimated number of trees that have died each year since 2010.

**Past Events**

**14.7.2 Exposure and Vulnerability**  
Increased wildfire risk associated with tree mortality has resulted in a major reorganization of the forest’s ecosystem. SMUD’s Plan Area is expected to see a decline in forest productivity, a change in species composition, a shift to smaller sized trees, and a reduction in forest extent in some regions. There is no data to show how many trees in SMUD’s Plan Area are dead and/or dying. SMUD does not record the number of trees that it removes as a result of tree mortality. Its vegetation management program removes trees under and adjacent to transmission and distribution lines to increase safety, reliability, and decrease wildfire risks.

15.0 Energy Shortage  
15.1 Background  
15.1.1 Hazard Profile  
Delivery of electricity service in SMUD’s Plan Area has been consistently and highly reliable for most of the century-long development, expansion, and continuous operation of grids across all regions of the Nation. The traditional definition of reliability—based on the frequency, duration, and extent of power outages—may be insufficient to ensure system integrity and available electric power in the face of climate change, natural hazards, physical attacks, cyber threats, and other intentional or accidental damage; the security of the system, particularly cybersecurity, is a growing concern.

Resilience is the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions, as well as the ability to withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions, whether deliberate, accidental, or naturally occurring. While resilience is related to aspects of both reliability and security, it incorporates a dynamic response capability to reduce the magnitude and duration of energy service disruptions under stressful conditions. Infrastructure planning and investment strategies that account for resilience typically broaden the range of risk-

15.1.2 Exposure and Vulnerability  
Changes in the climate are expected to bring more frequent and extreme weather conditions. Extreme weather conditions have the potential to decrease the efficiency of thermal power plants and substations, decrease the capacity of transmission lines, render hydropower less reliable, spur an increase in electricity demand, and put energy infrastructure at risk of flooding and fire. Similarly, during cold spells, heating demands increase, further stressing the energy infrastructure.

The Sacramento area faced historic storms from New Year’s Eve to the early weeks of January 2023, with severe rain, 70-mph winds, and lightning, leading to significant damage and unprecedented power outages. Over 599,000 customers experienced power outages during that period. Additionally, there were 300+ power poles that fell, 1,800 wires down, and 650 downed and broken trees.

15.1.3 Current Mitigation Efforts  
SMUD considers several natural hazards during the planning, construction and maintenance stages of its equipment and infrastructure. This may result in new equipment standards, environmental reviews, and risk assessments to help reduce the impacts of the natural hazards on new or existing infrastructure locations. SMUD periodically reviews and revises its projections of long-term energy demand against State requirements as a part of plan for expansion of electric power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities.

# 16.0 Climate Change

## 16.1 Background
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) defines climate change as the change in the usual weather conditions and patterns found in a region. More specifically, it is a change in the average weather conditions such as temperature, rainfall, snow, ocean, and atmospheric circulation, or in the distribution of weather around the globe. According to NASA, scientists think that the Earth’s temperature will keep increasing for the next 100 years. “This would cause more snow and ice to melt. Oceans would rise higher. Some places would get hotter. Other places might have colder winters with more snow. Some places might get more rain. Other places might get less rain.” 

California has already been experiencing the impacts of climate change including prolonged droughts, increased coastal flooding and erosion and tree mortality. The state has also seen increased average temperatures, more extreme heat days,
<!-- Page 137 -->
![Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028](https://www.bmz.de/en/publications/type_of_publication/weitere_materialien/Implications_for_Energy_Briefing_WEB_EN.pdf)

**Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028**

hazards include the loss of life and injury, damaged infrastructure, long-term health effects, loss of agricultural crops, disrupted transport, and freight, and much more.

From an operations perspective, climate change means rising energy demand and falling generation and distribution efficiency for the energy sector. Higher ambient temperatures will increase energy demand during the peak summer months by driving use of air conditioning. Rising temperatures will also decrease the efficiency of thermal conversions, meaning that more resources will be required to produce the same amount of energy. In addition to higher temperatures, climate change may bring increased frequency and severity of major weather events, which pose a threat to infrastructure. Changing weather patterns may also affect solar-, wind-, and hydropower generation.

SMUD is an industry leader in innovation and progress in California’s effort to reduce greenhouse gases and prepare for climate changes. In 2012, SMUD produced its first targeted climate readiness study and adaptation strategy. The review included a “state of the science” assessment to update scientific findings and incorporate lessons from the California Climate Adaptation Strategy, Adaptation Policy Guide, and numerous other resources. The climate readiness study and adaptation strategy are an integrated plan for addressing climate change. The analysis gives SMUD an opportunity to critically assess climate change risks and strategy and improve its readiness efforts, while providing a venue for sharing and learning best practices, providing transparency to the community, and building on local efforts with other public and private organizations. The study was updated in 2016 to include a Readiness Action Plan that addresses community engagement, enterprise programs, capital projects, and operational initiatives. In 2021, SMUD took a step further by releasing its 2030 Zero Carbon Plan. The plan details the goal of eliminating carbon emissions from power generation by 2030. SMUD has many programs supporting the equitable transformation to clean energy, including building and transportation electrification incentives, electric vehicle test drives, and partnerships to develop new technologies and strengthen the renewable energy grid.

SMUD’s forward-looking mitigation strategies include:
- Leveraging the best available climate science to make decisions, updating the “state of the science” assessment every four years.
- Continuing to collaborate with multiple local agencies on flood data analysis and preparedness planning.
- Taking proactive measures to make SMUD more resilient.
- Conducting research into the impacts of sustainable forest management techniques on wildfire risk reduction and stream flows.
- Identifying systematic opportunities to integrate climate change projections in internal program planning and capital budget development and approval.
- Investigating opportunities to employ resiliency bonds to finance further readiness measures.
- Supporting and participating in the Capital Region Climate Readiness Collaborative to assist public and private partners in the region improve overall climate readiness.
- Continuing implementation of the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.

### 17.0 Threat and Social Disturbance Hazards
Threat and disturbance address a symptom of and a form of protest against unfavored decisions. The severity of these actions coincides with the level of public outrage; it could range from blocking or impeding access to a building and disrupting normal activities by generating noise and intimidating people to a full-scale riot that destroys property and terrorizes individuals.

132 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 139 -->
# 17.1 Terrorism

The Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) defines terrorism as “the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives (28 C.F.R. Section 0.85). Terrorism refers to human-caused hazards and their use of weapons of mass destruction: biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological weapons, arson, incendiary, explosive and armed attacks, or any devices or vehicles that can be used to cause destruction and/or casualties. Terrorism also includes industrial sabotage, intentional hazardous materials releases, and cyber terrorism. Terrorists have a desired objective to target large public gatherings, water and food supplies, utilities and corporate centers, and communication capabilities.

The three key elements to defining a terrorist event are as follows:
- Activities involve the use of illegal force,
- Actions are intended to intimidate or coerce, and
- Actions are committed in support of political or social objectives.

## 17.1.1 Hazard Profile

The following (see Table 48) are potential methods used by terrorists that could directly or indirectly impact SMUD’s Plan Area:

### Table 48: Potential Methods of Terrorist Attacks

| Active Shooter               | Arson                       |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Explosive detonation         | Biological agent release     |
| Chemical agent release       | Cyber terrorism              |
| Kidnapping/Hostage-Taking    | Nuclear Detonation           |
| Radiological incident        | Vehicle Ramming Attack       |

### Frequency and Severity

SMUD owns critical infrastructures as defined by the Department of Homeland Security. These critical infrastructures are more vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Since September 11, 2001, the number of threats involving the use of chemical, nuclear, or biological agents by individuals and terrorist groups wishing to instill fear and disrupt communities within the United States has escalated. However, to date, SMUD has not experienced a known high-profile attack by groups or individuals associated with international terrorist organizations. Nor has SMUD experienced an incident involving a biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear weapon. Nevertheless, domestic terrorist incidents such as the December 3, 2022, Moore County NC Substation Ballistic Attack have led to heightened security efforts for the Plan Area.

An explosive or electromagnetic pulse detonation occurring anywhere in California could have a critical impact on SMUD’s energy system and/or its ability to maintain continuity in electric service. A targeted attack on SMUD could result in catastrophic damages to its energy infrastructure.

### 17.2 Cyber Threats
Cyber threats are attempts by criminals to attack a government, organization, or private party by damaging or disrupting a computer or computer network, or by gaining unauthorized access to information on a computer or computer network for malicious use.

#### 17.2.1 Hazard Profile
**Exposure and Vulnerability**  
Cyber based attacks gain access to or intrude on critical infrastructure systems, such as financial services, communications systems, energy, or transportation systems, with the potential to alter their reliable functioning. Disruption to such SMUD’s systems could pose a critical threat to local and national security. Over the past years, the threat from cyber terror has grown exponentially in part due to the rapid growth in the use of the Internet and the rapid growth of technology in general. SMUD collects employee, customer, and vendor information on a continuous basis (e.g., job applications, new customer applications, loan forms) for business operations. As SMUD’s electric grid and computer systems become more and more interconnected, and with the increased adoption of new technology (including cloud computing, big data, and mobile device usage), the risk for cyber breaches increases.

**Past Events**  
According to Statista, in 2022, there were 1,802 cases of data compromises in the United States where 422 million individuals were affected in the same year by data compromises, including data breaches, leakage, and exposure. California was the top of the US states according to the CMS OCR breach list for 2022, experiencing 1,338 breaches. As technology begins to advance and become more prominent, users are increasingly more vulnerable to cyber threats.

2022 started with Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine which, in addition to human toll, threatened order and put many organizations at risk of spillover cyberattacks. At the same time, China state-nexus adversaries increased their cyber espionage campaigns, and Iranian actors launched destructive “lock and leak” operations using ransomware.74

Cyberattacks are on the increase in the electricity sector. Cyberattacks on utilities have been growing rapidly since 2018, reaching alarmingly high levels in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. More recent attacks in the electricity sector have disabled remote controls for wind farms, disrupted prepaid meters due to unavailable IT systems, and led to recurrent data breaches involving client personally identifiable information. In 2022, the cost of data breach was 4.72 million in the energy sector.75 Figure 30 below shows the average number of weekly cyberattacks by industry for the period 2020-2022.

In May 2021 a ransomware attack on a major petroleum product pipeline’s IT network resulted in major prescriptive measures directing U.S. government agencies to take a series of proactive steps to bolster cybersecurity. The International Energy Authority (IEA) is an international energy forum, its responsibilities include tracking and analyzing global key energy trends, promoting sound energy policy, and fostering multinational energy technology cooperation. It states in one of its articles that there is little public information available on significant cybersecurity incidents due to under-reporting and the lack of detection. That being said, there is evidence that cyberattacks on utilities have been growing rapidly since 2018, reaching alarmingly high levels in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. They anticipate that this trend will only continue. 

### 17.2.2 Current Mitigation Efforts

SMUD participates in several cross-collaborative cyber threat prevention initiatives (see Table 50).

**17.3 Physical Threats**

Physical security is the protection of personnel, facilities, information, equipment, operations and activities from physical actions and events that could cause serious loss or damage to an enterprise, agency, or institution. This includes protection from fire, flood, natural disasters, burglary, theft, vandalism, and terrorism.78

**17.3.1 Hazard Profile**

**Asset Profile and Security Personnel**  
SMUD has assets spread over a wide geographical area that differ in criticality, type, and vulnerability. The largest set of assets vulnerable to physical attack are our 300+ substations, which vary in size and protection levels applied to mitigate risk or comply with regulatory requirements. SMUD also maintains a turbine farm in the East San Francisco Bay area covering approximately 5000+ acres. There are two large campus-type environments housing the majority of SMUD’s workforce personnel and operational assets. SMUD also has a smaller campus east of the Sacramento area that houses both personnel and equipment that operate and maintain SMUD’s hydropower assets, consisting of several complexes of dams, powerhouses, and switchyards. The approximate total service territory is 900+ square miles.

miles and approximate total asset footprint (not counting gas pipeline) of 3000 square miles. This vast area is serviced by a full-time internal security force.

**Current and Past Incidents**  
SMUD has experienced a wide range of physical security incidents over the past 5 years. SMUD facilities have been subject to unauthorized intrusions, ballistic attack, theft, burglary, vandalism, and other various petty crimes.

**17.3.2 Vulnerability Assessment**  
SMUD is a publicly owned electric utility that owns and operates infrastructure that delivers reliable power to the public and is part of the U.S. Bulk Electric System. Like many utilities, SMUD’s infrastructure, if not underground is above ground or overhead and is generally visible to the public. As such, it makes it an easy target for bad actors to exploit.

SMUD maintains processes and documents to protect the physical security of its properties.

**17.3.3 Current Mitigation Efforts**

**18.0 Other Hazards**

**18.1 Air Pollution**

Air pollution is defined as the air containing any substance that poses harmful or poisonous effects. Air pollution is hazardous to the health of many citizens residing in SMUD’s Plan Area. Sources of air pollution are grouped into four major categories: stationary, mobile, area-wide and natural sources.

**18.1.1 Hazard Profile**

Stationary sources of air pollution include small and large fixed facilities such as power plants, dry cleaners, gasoline stations, and landfills. Mobile sources of pollution include cars, trucks, ships, and airplanes. Area-wide sources of pollution may result from agriculture, consumer products, construction grading or unpaved roads. Natural sources include plant pollens, biological decay, windblown dust, and wildfires. The pollutants from these sources and activities are typically broken up into three major pollutant categories: Criteria (affecting people's respiratory health and/or leading to the creation of ground level Ozone and particulate matter), hazardous (known or suspected to cause cancer and/or other serious health effects), and greenhouse gas (contributing to global warming and climate change).

The American Lung Association’s 24th annual air report, *The State of Air*, utilized the most recent criteria air pollution data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and ranked California the most polluted state to live in. The report also ranked the Sacramento-

As part of its general monitoring process, SMUD leverages a number of different publicly available resources to monitor and forecast air quality within its service territory as well as areas where SMUD employees work. Figures 31 and 32 below are sample maps and data showing in real time, the air quality in the Sacramento area. This data helps air quality agencies forecast and report the “Air Quality Index” (AQI) to the public based on the prevalent pollutants of an applicable weather season. AirNow defines the AQI “as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.” In the summer, the AQI provides ambient levels of ozone and/or particulate, while in the fall and winter seasons, these monitors identify days with high particulate levels. As described.

18.2 Avalanches  
An avalanche is a weather-related threat that occurs when a mass of snow mixed with ice and debris travels down a mountainside. Avalanches occur in steep mountainous areas of California that receive significant amounts of snow. Avalanches can occur from one or a combination of these components: overloading, temperature, slope angle, snowpack conditions, and vibrations. The most at risk are mountainous areas that have a slope of 25° to 60°.

Avalanches have caused property damage and loss of life in California. Significant events have damaged or destroyed ski resorts at Mt. Shasta and Lake Tahoe. Avalanches have also blocked and damaged roadways. The Plan Area lay amongst the highest regions of avalanche risk in the State of California. Avalanches can pose a major threat to the communities and SMUD’s or WAPA transmission lines, powerhouses, reservoirs, roads, and other infrastructure in the UARP. Secondary impacts may impact SMUD’s customers residing outside of the regions susceptible to avalanches.

Because SMUD has not experienced avalanches, there is not sufficient data to describe the extent of damages.

18.3 Drought and Water Shortage  
Drought is a gradual phenomenon, occurring slowly over a period of time, caused by a rainfall deficit, and often combined with other predisposing factors. It is difficult to quantify the beginning and ending of a drought. There are four different categories in which a drought can be categorized based on its effects (see table 54).

18.3.1 Hazard Profile  
**Table 54: Drought Categories**

| Type                     | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Meteorological drought    | Having below average water supply.                                                              |
| Agricultural drought      | Overdraft of groundwater to meet the state's crops and agricultural needs because of insufficient water supplies. |
| Hydrological drought      | Lacking surface and subsurface water supplies such as snowpack, streamflow, or lakes.          |
| Socioeconomic drought     | Having adverse economic or health impact on a region.                                          |

SMUD’s Plan Area has a Mediterranean climate. The summers are dry and warm, and the winters are wet and cool. Its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and major mountain ranges defines most of the State’s precipitation and runoff. A majority of the water vapor that provides the State’s precipitation comes from the ocean. The snowpack in the Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada contributes to the runoff in the rivers and groundwater.  

145 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 152 -->

basins. Approximately 75% of the state's annual precipitation occurs between November and March. Many California’s droughts stem from an absence, or reduction, of winter precipitation.

**Exposure and Vulnerability**  
California experienced one of the worst droughts in history from 2012 to 2017: 102 million trees died during that time period. This has increased SMUD’s vulnerability for tree mortality. In 2014, 100% of the State was experiencing a drought ranked “severe” or worse. During the period of 2012 to 2015, Lake Tahoe warmed 15 times faster than it had historically. The drought became so severe that Governor Jerry Brown instituted a mandatory 25% water restriction in 2015. The drought exacerbated wildfires during those years.

California’s most significant historical statewide droughts were 1929-34, 1976-77, 1987-92, 2007-09, 2012-17 and 2020-2022 (see table 55).

**Table 55: Historical Droughts in California**

| Year     | Duration (years) | Description                                                                                     |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1929-34  | 6                | Occurred when the state’s urban and agricultural developments were minimal, therefore the impacts to the economy and community were substantial. |
| 1976-77  | 2                | Brief but severe due to the low amounts of precipitation and runoff.                           |

**Drought Impacts**  
Drought impacts are felt first by people most dependent on annual rainfall—such as ranchers using dryland range or rural residents relying on wells in low-yield rock formations. Drought impacts increase with the length of a drought, as carry-over supplies in reservoirs are depleted and water levels in groundwater basins decline. The most common secondary effects of drought that are realized by SMUD and occupants in its Plan Area are the environmental impacts such as wildfire hazard, increased tree mortality, the reduced availability of surface water, and the loss of biodiversity in the animal and plant species in the area.

**Past Events**  
The Plan Area has experienced prior drought conditions in recent years with drought periods recorded 2020-2022, 2012-2017, 2007-09, 2000-04, 1987-92, 1975-77 and 195961. Table 59 shows the available data found for most recent drought events available in the NCDC database for the Plan Area.

Most detrimental to SMUD’s operations and its ability to serve its customers during a drought, is the reduced ability to generate hydroelectric power. A reduction of hydropower generation and water quality deterioration are potential hazards that could affect SMUD during an extended drought period. Droughts have the capacity to affect the following:
- **Hydropower**: lower water levels impact production capacity in hydroelectric plants.
- **Biomass**: changes in seasonal precipitation patterns can impact vegetation growth, altering the availability of feedstock for biomass generators.

### 18.3.2 Current Mitigation Efforts
Based on the results of SMUD’s Climate Readiness Action Plan assessment, SMUD continues to monitor how drought impacts energy generation and commodity costs. SMUD has several initiatives that reduce the risk of water shortages in drought conditions, including the hydro rate stabilization fund that accrues money to purchase replacement power in years with lost hydropower generation. Additionally, SMUD is in cooperation of the SPA with the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (Regional San) to deliver recycled water from Regional San treatment facilities to be used for cooling and fire protection at the SPA power plant. The table below depicts mitigation efforts for drought hazards.

**18.4 Hazardous Material Release**

Hazardous materials have properties that make them potentially dangerous and harmful both to human health and the environment. The Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) regulates hazardous materials in California. DTSC defines hazardous materials as materials with properties that make it potentially dangerous or harmful to human health or the environment. The universe of hazardous materials is large and diverse. Hazardous materials can be liquids, solids, or contained gases.91

**18.4.1 Hazard Profile**

An accidental hazardous material release can occur wherever hazardous materials are manufactured, stored, transported, or used. There could also be incidents of intentional hazardous release either from terrorist or provocateur activities. Depending on the material involved, the release may affect nearby population and/or contaminate critical or sensitive environmental areas within the Plan Area.

The release of hazardous materials to the environment could damage the environment, property, or human health. The extent of damages is dependent on the type, location, quantity, concentration, physical, chemical and/or infectiousness of the material released. Although hazardous material incidents can happen almost anywhere, certain areas of the state are at higher risk. These include areas: near roadways (frequently used for transporting hazardous materials), adjacent to industrial facilities (that use, store, or dispose hazardous materials), and crossed by certain railways, waterways, airways, and pipelines (that transport hazardous materials).

Releases of explosive and highly flammable materials have been known to cause fatalities and injuries, necessitate large-scale evacuations, and destroy millions of dollars' worth of property.
<!-- Page 157 -->
![Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028](https://example.com/image.jpg)

property. Toxic chemicals in gaseous form have been known to cause injuries and fatalities among emergency response teams and passersby. Serious health effects have been known to result when toxic materials enter surface or ground water supplies. Releases of hazardous chemicals have been especially damaging when they have occurred in highly populated areas or along heavily traveled transportation routes.

## 18.4.2 Exposure and Vulnerability
SMUD’s Plan Area is a mix of urban, suburban, and rural areas. Military and former military installations located in SMUD’s Plan Area must be considered as potential sources for hazardous material releases. When a hazardous material emergency occurs, multiple resources are available with the local fire departments typically leading response activities. SMUD’s Plan Area contains major transportation arteries, such as interstates, highways, railroads, and airports, each facilitating the transport of hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous materials through and into SMUD’s Plan Area each year. SMUD is highly exposed to the effects of a major catastrophic hazardous material emergency due to the proximity of the transportation routes to densely populated areas. Additionally, SMUD must be concerned with the Port of West Sacramento and the various bulk gasoline terminals located along the Yolo County side of the Sacramento River front because prevailing winds come from the southwest. Considerations must be made also for the numerous agriculturally related businesses located within the response/mutual aid area.

SMUD’s Plan Area contains major oil and gasoline terminals, drinking and wastewater pumping facilities, and numerous large diameter underground pipelines. Agriculture uses large quantities of pesticides and chemicals that are stored at numerous sites. Fixed facilities are limited to small industrial parks within or near the incorporated cities. Air transportation of hazardous materials involves the smallest quantities but still poses a potential hazard.

There are also numerous underground and aboveground storage tank facilities for flammable liquids throughout SMUD’s Plan Area.

## 18.4.3 Current Mitigation Efforts
SMUD owns and/or operates several potential sources of hazardous materials releases. SMUD follows all federal, state, and local regulations relating to the use, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials. All hazardous material Safety Data Sheets specific to an asset or location are kept on site and also available online. Field and support staffs are trained to respond to leaks, spills, and discharges. All SMUD facilities above regulatory mandated quantity thresholds operate under Hazardous Materials Business Plans (HMBPs) prepared by the Environmental Services Department. These plans are updated annually and certified as accurate with the applicable local governing agency.

## 18.5 Oil Spill
### 18.5.1 Hazard Profile
An oil spill is a release of liquid petroleum into the environment due to human activity or technological error that results in the pollution of land, water, or air. Oil spills can also
<!-- Page 158 -->
![Page 152](https://example.com/image-url)

**18.5.2 Exposure and Vulnerability**  
Some of SMUD’s electric and mechanical equipment utilize oils to operate. This equipment and affected facilities are located on land near stormwater systems and waterways. However, SMUD is at very low risk for the likelihood of an oil spill event because of existing mitigations (see table 61: Current Hazardous Materials and Oil Spill Hazards Mitigation).

SMUD’s Plan Area is land-locked and is not susceptible to underwater seeps or disasters related to offshore oil drilling. The most likely oil spill hazards threatening SMUD’s Plan Area is the release of oil from either third-party vehicle accidents (involving SMUD’s oil-containing equipment) or the malfunction/failure of the oil-containing equipment.

Today, our five natural gas plants provide low-cost, reliable power 24/7. Eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from our power plants is essential to reach our zero-carbon goal by 2030. We’re focused on reimagining our existing generation portfolio to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions through replacement, re-tooling and using renewable fuels. To drastically reduce SMUD’s fossil fuel related greenhouse gas emissions, we currently plan to adjust the utilization of the generation fleet by placing at least 2 power plants while exploring retrofit technologies such as alternative fuels and/or post-combustion controls. Maintaining reliable electric service is critical, so we will conduct more detailed reliability assessments before finalizing plans for our natural gas power plants.

We will expand the use of our existing carbon-free energy technologies like wind, solar, hydro, biomass, geothermal energy, battery storage and demand response. While these proven carbon-free technologies aren’t fully capable of achieving our 2030 zero carbon goal, they can help get us about 90% of the way there. Today, SMUD’s power supply is about 50% carbon-free. Our plan includes adding ~3,000 Megawatts of new renewable energy and storage, which is equivalent to the energy needs of more than 600,000 homes per year. This includes growing rooftop and battery storage adoption.

We will explore new and emerging technologies—like power-to-gas technology, hydrogen and methane, long-duration batteries, and carbon sequestration—that are either currently unknown or are not ready for large scale adoption due to price, reliability or other factors. This work will help us identify potential partnerships and business models like virtual power plants, and launch pilot projects and programs to test and prove new and emerging technologies and develop paths for prioritizing technology adoption and scaling.

Our road map to zero carbon identifies cost ranges and rate impacts associated with expanding our existing proven clean technologies and for researching and piloting new technologies and business models. We’re focused on making sure achieving our zero-

## 18.5.3 Current Mitigation Efforts

The table below depicts the mitigation activities for hazardous materials and oil spills.

### Table 58: Current Hazardous Materials and Oil Spill Hazards Mitigation

| Mitigation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Spill Prevention Control and Counter Measure (SPCC) Program | The SPCC program provides mitigation control to prevent discharges of oil, and properly respond to discharges of oil, if it does occur. Facilities with equipment over mandated storage volumes (either individually or cumulatively) are part of a SPCC plan. The plan outlines equipment requirements and engineering controls, inspection criteria and frequencies, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. <br><br> For example, Appendix B of SMUD’s Substation Specific SPCC Plan contains the “Substation Maintenance Oil Spill Cleanup for SMUD Substation Facilities” and the “Environmental Services Oil Spill Response for SMUD Substation Facilities” procedures. These oil spill cleanup and contingency procedures contain guidelines for performing the necessary oil spill cleanup, notifications, and reporting. The Substation Maintenance procedure identifies the actions that shall be taken by Substation Maintenance personnel upon discovering and responding to an oil spill. The Environmental Services procedure identifies the actions that shall be performed by HazMat Services and Environmental Services personnel when responding to an oil spill at a SMUD substation facility. These procedures were written to ensure that any oil spill at a substation facility is cleaned up as expeditiously as possible in an environmentally responsible manner. <br><br> In addition to the information included in the above procedures, the SPCC plans also outline that SMUD maintains: 1) HazMat Services, Substation Maintenance, and Environmental Services personnel on-call at all times to ensure that an oil spill is cleaned up as soon as reasonably possible; 2) an Emergency Contact List which lists local, state, and federal regulatory agencies as well as key SMUD personnel; 3) guidelines for performing the necessary oil spill notifications and reporting requirements. |

![Table 58: Current Hazardous Materials and Oil Spill Hazards Mitigation](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Table+58:+Current+Hazardous+Materials+and+Oil+Spill+Hazards+Mitigation)

| Hazardous Material | Business Plan (HMBP) |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| HMBP Emergency Response Plan | The Emergency Response Plan is a subset of the HMBP. It is site specific and details the procedures in the event of a release (or threatened release of a hazardous material), including, but not limited to: 1) immediate notification contacts to the appropriate local emergency response personnel and to the CUPA; 2) mitigation of a release (or threatened release) for each hazardous material to minimize any potential harm or damage to persons, property, or the environment; and 3) evacuation plans and procedures. |
| Training |  |
| Engineering Controls and Best Management Practices | SMUD uses a mixture of engineering controls and best management practices (BMPs) to design and operate the facilities and their respective equipment in a manner that reduces the likelihood of a spill or release. Engineering controls include emergency sumps large enough to capture spilled oil within a facility, visual and/or audible alarms to manage storage tank volumes and prevent storage tank overfill, and “oil minder pumps” that prevent the pumping of oil impacted water out of catch basins. BMPs include establishing equipment inspection frequencies, using standard inspection forms, installation of additional signage, and training specific to a site or asset. |

**Mitigation** | **Description**  
--- | ---  
Contractor and Vendor Support | SMUD maintains contracts with qualified emergency response environmental contractors and waste vendors. These vendors ensure that SMUD can mitigate releases, remediate an affected site to its original pre-spill condition, and ensure that hazardous materials are handled, transported, and disposed of in accordance with all state and federal requirements.

### 18.6 Natural Gas Pipeline Hazards

#### 18.6.1 Hazard Profile
SMUD owns and operates 76 linear miles of natural gas pipelines. Natural gas from these pipelines is required to operate SMUD’s thermal power plants and to help SMUD meet its load serving capability. SMUD’s pipelines are in and near communities where people work and live. In operating the pipelines, safety is SMUD’s top priority. SMUD is committed in protecting the people, environment, and communities along these pipelines.

#### 18.6.2 Exposure and Vulnerability
SMUD’s gas pipelines are fewer and newer as compared with other utilities. However, in the event of a gas pipeline breach, impacts could result in total loss of assets and damage to surrounds up to and including loss of life.  
Increasing population growth in urban areas is resulting in a greater number of people living and working closer to existing gas transmission pipelines. The aging of SMUD’s gas transmission system also slightly increases the risk of potential disaster. Causes of and contributors to pipeline failures include third party damage, construction defects, material defects, internal and external corrosion, operational errors, control system malfunctions, outside force damage, subsidence, and seismicity.

#### 18.6.3 Current Mitigation Efforts
The Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is the primary safety regulator of the pipeline system. Its regulations and safety standards address a variety of issues affecting pipeline safety, including pipe and component manufacture, how pipelines are built, operated, maintained, and inspected, how personnel are trained, and how companies respond to emergencies.  
SMUD meets and exceeds all regulatory requirements through SMUD Gas Pipeline Operations integrity management program which includes, detective controls through line patrols and leak detection systems, process controls, participation in the USA North 811 system (call before you dig) and engineering controls such as remote operating valves with LineBreak systems to respond to gas leaks. These controls are implemented to ensure public safety and prevent compromise to SMUD’s gas transmission systems.  
SMUD is a member of USA North, which provides a free damage prevention service to protect citizens, the community, the environment, essential public services, and underground facilities in Central and Northern California and all of Nevada. USA North.

### 18.7 Nuclear Hazards
Nuclear hazard is referred to as the risk or danger to any living species or environment posed by radiation emanating from the atomic nuclei of a given substance.

#### 18.7.1 Hazard Profile
There are no natural nuclear hazards in the Plan Area. There is a very low probability of accidental exposure of solid material managed by local businesses, including SMUD. Close up, unprotected exposure to radioactive materials can have negative long-term health effects.

#### 18.7.2 Exposure and Vulnerability
SMUD owns the decommissioned Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station. Spent fuel is stored onsite in the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) awaiting the DOE direction to move it to an appropriate facility. Rancho Seco is in Sacramento County, 25 miles southeast of the City of Sacramento and 26 miles northeast of the City of Stockton, the two largest cities within a 50-mile radius of the site. The site occupies approximately 14 of the 2480 SMUD-owned acres at the Rancho Seco site, which is flat to rolling terrain. The nearest population center of 25,000 or more is the City of Galt, which is about 10 miles northwest of the site. State Route 104 runs north of the site in an east-west direction. Route 104 connects with U.S. Route 99 and Interstate 5 to the west and State Routes 88 and 12 to the east.

The area near Rancho Seco is sparsely populated and is used primarily as grazing land and grape vineyards. The only public use facility within a 5-mile radius of the site is the Rancho Seco Reservoir and Recreation Area, which is located approximately 1 mile southeast of the site and is within the land owned by SMUD. There is no indication of geological faulting at the site.

The risk that radiation exposure because of long-term storage of nuclear spent fuel at Rancho Seco may result in environmental, health and safety risks is extremely low. Incidents that lead to a breach of spent fuel canister integrity are unlikely to occur.

The ISFSI Safety Analysis Report (SAR) discusses the design criteria and accident analysis criteria for the spent fuel storage system. It identifies potential incidents such as fires associated with combustible materials, loss of contamination control, natural phenomena, and external human caused events such as terrorism. The ISFSI SAR provides an analysis of 

157 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 164 -->
![Hazard Mitigation Plan](https://example.com/image.png)

the following incidents: human caused events, earthquake, fire, tornado, flood, lightning, and snow loads. The result of these analysis state that there are no credible events that would result in the exposure of the public, outside of the ISFSI licensed area, above the limits stated in the regulation.

## 18.7.3 Current Mitigation Efforts
The table below depicts mitigation actions for radiological hazards.

### Table 60: Current Radiological Hazards Mitigation

| Mitigation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Rancho Seco site-specific Emergency Plan approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission | In the event of an emergency occurring at Rancho Seco, the site-specific Emergency Plan will be implemented. Response includes activating emergency response facilities; making formal notifications to SMUD’s management, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and Sacramento County Office of Emergency Operations; response and recovery activities. |
| Exercises |  |
| Physical barriers and monitoring | Fence surrounds emergency planning zone with controlled access and various monitoring devices. |
| Law and regulations | SMUD continues to follow and apply rules and regulations under 10 C.F.R. §72.32 and any future updates as required. |
| State and Sacramento County Offices of Emergency Services | Periodic meetings to update agencies on emergency plan changes, share emergency response telephone directory (ERTD), and conduct semi-annual communication testing. |
| Radiation monitoring | Continuous monitoring of radiation badges quarterly. |
| Site specific physical security plan approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission | Site specific plan outlining specific physical security requirements and actions. |
| Monitoring Federal actions | SMUD is monitoring Federal actions for moving spent nuclear fuel. |

## 18.8 Bird Strike
Bird strikes are defined as avian/power line interactions including electrocutions, collisions and nesting, avian/wind turbine collisions and avian/aircraft interactions.

### 18.8.1 Exposure and Vulnerability
SMUD owns and operates several wind turbine facilities located in Solano County. Collisions between wildlife and turbines often occur, causing detriment to the wildlife as well as damages to SMUD facilities. In addition to damages, collisions between wildlife and 

158 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 165 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

infrastructure can also create a threat of power disruption. SMUD’s infrastructure traverses the Pacific flyway for migratory birds. SMUD operates aircraft around the service area and UARP, which are also at risk from bird strikes. For SMUD, the most common bird strikes occur between birds and its overhead power lines which result in approximately 150 bird-focused outages per year. In addition, when there are bird collisions, 2-3 birds per year may get electrocuted and have the potential to start a grass fire. Grass fires are usually small and easy to control.

## 18.8.2 Current Mitigation Efforts
Basic mitigation strategies for bird strike are broken into three strategies: Increase resistance to bird strike, remove birds from an area, or move the infrastructure away from the birds (see Table 61).

### Table 61: Current Bird Strike Hazards Mitigation

| Mitigation        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Design            | SMUD has an Avian Protection Plan which requires SMUD to implement mortality reduce measures in response to bird-caused outages and the use of avian safe standards where it’s required to maximize phase separation and phase-to-ground clearance to minimize the risk of electrocution or to prevent perching where sufficient clearances cannot be achieved. |
| Wildlife management| SMUD has a bird and bat protection plan and an eagle take permit for the Solano Wind project which requires mitigation measures to be implemented when bird mortalities including eagle occur including curtailment of wind turbines to minimize bird mortality. |
| Relocation        | If infrastructure is prone to bird strike, an investment might be made to relocate assets to reduce the likelihood of a hazardous event.                                                                 |

## 18.9 Pandemic

### 18.9.1 Hazard Profile
The World Health Organization defines a pandemic as an epidemic occurring over a wide area, usually affecting a large number of people. Pandemics typically occur when a new virus appears, toward which the human population has not built immunity. Historically, SMUD’s Plan Area has seen the influenza pandemics of 1918, 1957, and 1968, the Swine Flu pandemic, and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic. 

### 18.9.2 Assessment of Vulnerability
Pandemics are unpredictable and have the potential to adversely impact SMUD’s operations. SMUD’s aptness to predict and meet load demand is challenged heavily during a pandemic. Load demands may be hampered by consumers reacting to social distance.

### 18.9.3 Current Mitigation Efforts
By necessity of the COVID-19 pandemic, SMUD developed extensive pandemic mitigations (see Table 62). SMUD continued reliably delivering power to customers by utilizing the Emergency Operations Center, coordinating with local and state emergency management structures, and utilizing internal workforce health protections.

#### Table 62: Current Pandemic Hazards Mitigation

### 18.10 Supply Chain Hazards
#### 18.10.1 Hazard Profile
Many disruptors are driving supply chain gridlock and impacting end-to-end operations. Pre-pandemic supply chain vulnerability as a result of geographic concentration continue to be compounded by the effects of the pandemic and increased geopolitical tensions. As such, supply chain disruptions have affected operations across most industries, including.

the electric power sector. Unavailable materials, project delays, inflation, eroded capital budgets, prolonged labor shortages and strained operations are a few of the potential drivers of supply chain risk.

## 18.10.2 Assessment of Vulnerability
A number of factors make it challenging for SMUD’s supply chains to operate efficiently and at full value. Material shortage and scarcity of crucial items, such as electric steel, electronic components, and cable, are disrupting supply. SMUD has been impacted by the lack of available transformers, many of which are manufactured overseas. Delivery times in many cases more than doubled, taking years to procure certain critical equipment such as transformers. These challenges continue to be exacerbated by the rise of geopolitical tensions. A recent Kearny article sited that “suppliers recognize the gap between demand and their supply of transformers, but even if they can increase production or bring it onshore, new facilities take time to build. Many shortages show no sign of letting up, with manufacturers struggling to fill orders during emergencies or canceling them altogether”94. Figure 35 is a chart resulting from Kearny’s client interviews.

In addition, supply chain shortages increase demand and prices continue to rise. Figure 35 shows the change in price for transformer cost showing largely unchanged prices through 2020 and a rise in 134 percent since then. The Kearny study noted a similar trend for electric wires and cable costs.

Transformer prices were largely unchanged in first year of pandemic...  
...but rose sharply in 2021 and have continued to remain elevated.  

Cost drivers and trends:  
- Raw materials (for example, copper, steel, aluminum): highly sensitive to commodity cost increases (comprise ~60% of total transformer cost)  
- Labor: post-pandemic rate increases applied to a shrinking labor pool hinders production  
- Technology and overhead costs

Supply chain disruptions result in increased operational costs, project delays, the loss of productivity, increased lead times and customer impact.

For SMUD, this means potential delays in achievement of our goals, specifically the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan. Meeting a 100 percent clean electricity goal by 2030 requires increasing SMUD’s clean energy resource capacities. This means building new renewable energy projects, requiring more materials, many of which are imported. With high reliance on certain materials and competing demand from various industries, SMUD and other utilities are faced with potential delays or increased costs to achieve decarbonization. In addition, increasing customer capacity due to new construction and electrification in some instances requires new facilities be built to meet these demands.

### 18.10.3 Current Mitigation Efforts

The following table depicts mitigation activities for supply chain hazards.

| Mitigation                          | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mutual aid agreements                | SMUD has mutual aid agreements with various agencies which establish protocols for sharing resources.                                                            |
| Emergency contracts                  | Emergency contracts with vendors to support the purchase of materials or services under emergency situations.                                                  |
| Establish and maintain safety stock  | SMUD has identified safety stock limits and periodically reviews these levels in meetings to ensure that they are still appropriate. This provides guidelines for SMUD’s Warehouse Operations and Procurement for purchasing requirements. |
| Regular risk review                  | SMUD has an established supply chain risk management framework which allows staff to identify and prioritize various categories of stock purchases and monitors those periodically to detect early warnings of potential current or future supply chain constraints. |
| Internal coordination                 | SMUD’s Procurement Team works closely with operational areas to plan and manage supply and demand forecasts.                                                   |
| Qualifying suppliers                 | SMUD has a process that qualifies suppliers to ensure that they are responsible and can deliver materials and services in a timely manner.                     |
| Evaluate supply and logistics        | SMUD conducts regular evaluation of supplier landscape, logistics, and the external workforce.                                                                   |
| Diversifying suppliers               | SMUD generally sources primary and secondary suppliers from various national and global locations to reduce risk from geographic concentration.                  |
| Project prioritization               | SMUD has a system in place to identify and prioritize projects so that critical equipment is not used on a project not ready to go online.                     |

# 19.0 Goals and Objectives

## 19.1 Authorities, Policies, Programs and Resources

SMUD’s mitigation strategy is made up of three components required by Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.). These components are goals, actions, and action plan.

SMUD is owned by its customers, who elect a seven-member Board of Directors. Each director represents a different geographic region within SMUD’s service territory. The job of the SMUD Board is to establish policies and values about how SMUD serves its customers and to set the long-term direction in the form of strategic directives. All important decisions made by SMUD staff must support one or more of the strategic directives.

The development of SMUD’s planning process, risk assessment, goal setting and identification of mitigation actions by SMUD’s PC led to the mitigation strategy and mitigation action plans for the HMP. As part of the development process, a comprehensive review of the mitigation efforts and strategies were conducted by SMUD’s PC, internal and external stakeholders, and subject matter experts (SMEs). The result was the HMP for SMUD with reorganized risk assessments and priorities. The mitigation actions from the 2018 HMP were refined and reaffirmed, and goals were added and deleted, as appropriate.

Throughout the process of planning for the HMP, the PC reviewed the results of the hazard identification, vulnerability assessment, and capability assessment. The analysis of the risk assessment allowed the PC to recognize areas in which improvements could be made and provided a framework for the PC to create goals and objectives to develop new mitigation strategies for SMUD’s Plan Area.

Daily operations and decision-making are delegated by SMUD’s Board of Directors to the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer, who along with other members of the Executive Team establish guidelines for SMUD activities. The most prominent guideline set by the Executive Team is SMUD’s 2023-2026 Strategy. The top priority area is to Be Safe Always, which has a direct relationship to hazard mitigation. This commitment at the Executive level to safety is critical for SMUD whose primary activity is the generation and delivery of electricity. Not only is the generation and transmission of electricity an inherently hazardous activity but using stored water in mountainous terrain under pressure as the means of electrical generation expands the hazard.

SMUD management, departments, and employees recognize, value, and support projects that ensure a well-planned, coordinated, efficient, and rapid response in the event of an emergency to protect the lives, environment, and property of the citizens in communities where our assets and operations reside.

## 19.2 Risk Prioritization

SMUD’s HMP leverages its existing ERM framework to identify and determine the hazards that SMUD is most vulnerable to. The ERM framework takes into consideration impacts to

![SMUD Hazard Mitigation Plan](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**19.3 Existing Mitigation Strategies**

To identify and select mitigation actions that need to have additional practices implemented, or changed, the PC began by prioritizing hazards that were of high risk to SMUD’s Plan Area. Hazards of high risk were those in which current mitigation actions needed to be re-analyzed, and it needed to be decided if additional mitigation actions could be implemented using SMUD’s current technological capabilities. Low-priority hazard risks are often mitigated using mitigation actions of less specificity than those of high-priority hazards.

Once priority was determined, the PC analyzed additional actions that supported the identified goals and objectives of the HMP. The PC utilized examples of potential mitigation actions from a variety of other agencies. Preventative mitigation alternatives were discussed for each hazard, and additions were made to the existing strategies as deemed necessary.

Mitigation actions are listed with the associated hazards.

**19.4 Mitigation Action Plans**

Planning and prioritization of projects at SMUD is performed through a variety of mechanisms. High-level guidance is provided in SMUD’s 5-Year Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan), which represents a balance between the strategies, projects, programs, and other initiatives aimed at ensuring SMUD’s success in an evolving energy industry. Goals and initiatives referenced in the Strategic Plan translate into more specific, action-oriented policies or projects and thus serve as a framework for achieving the intent of the Strategic Plan.

From this and other forms of guidance, individual asset managers, such as the UARP Asset Manager, must prepare a 3-Year Budget Plan that identifies operations and maintenance (O&M) and capital projects that are anticipated over the course of the next three years. The 3-Year Budget Plan is reviewed by the respective business area Directors and is recommended to the Executives, then the Board for final approval.

The priority associated with each project during each budget cycle is dependent on several factors that affect the relative importance of a project in any given year. Projects are either mandatory or discretionary and their inclusion in any given year’s plan is based on regulatory requirements or their relationship to SMUD’s guiding principles.

SMUD also evaluates projects across the organization to ensure Operational Excellence. This essentially translates into our Project Portfolio Management, which seeks to coordinate and align SMUD-wide resource allocation and operations over a 2-3-year planning horizon. A group of leaders from across SMUD, called the Operational Alignment.

**166 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028**
<!-- Page 173 -->
![Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Hazard+Mitigation+Plan+2024+-+2028)

**Team (OAT)**, meets regularly to select the overall portfolio of projects, both mandatory and discretionary, track progress throughout the year, and approve significant changes.

Each of these activities (OAT meetings, departmental planning, and project reviews) employ the same prioritization process that results in the general project classifications of high, medium, and low priority projects. The criterion for the three priority categories includes the following:

### High Priority Project Criteria
- Needed to promote safety and protect the lives of SMUD workers and the public,
- Needed to protect SMUD infrastructure and public property,
- Risks are tied to recent disasters and expected to worsen under climate change,
- Strong public support,
- Viewed favorably or required by regulatory agencies,
- Strongly tied to the maintenance of electric stability and reliability,
- Clear and concrete long-term and lasting benefits,
- Highly favorable benefit/cost ratio, and/or
- Supported by pilot projects and/or other successful applications.

### Medium Priority Project Criteria
- Enhancements to safety and protection of lives, but not absolutely needed,
- Enhancements to the protection of SMUD infrastructure and public property,
- Risks are not strongly tied to recent disasters and climate change,
- Moderate public support,
- Viewed as neutral by regulatory agencies,
- Uncertain and theoretical duration of benefits,
- Neutral benefit/cost ratio, and/or
- No pilot projects or other successful applications.

### Low Priority Project Criteria
- Limited relationship to safety and the protection of SMUD workers and the public,
- Limited value in the protection of SMUD infrastructure and public property,
- Minimal to no public support,
- Risk(s) is/are not associated with historical disasters and not affected by climate change,
- No regulatory requirement, and/or
- Cost does not justify the benefits achieved from project deployment.

### 19.5 Plan Integration
An important project implementation mechanism is to incorporate the recommendation into existing business processes. The hazards outlined in this HMP will be one factor in risk assessments and review of projects and initiatives for SMUD and will be integrated into the project planning, budget, and risk assessment process.

167 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 174 -->
# 20.0 Mitigation Best Practices and Adaptive Capacity
SMUD carries the primary responsibility for implementing and updating hazard mitigation strategies. The HMP is a living document that will be revised and improved over time to increase its effectiveness in implementing and properly tracking mitigation strategies. Staff will leverage SMUD’s existing planning process in the implementation of this HMP.

## 20.1 Progress of Mitigation Efforts
SMUD’s ERM Office (ERMO) (along with various associated business units) will monitor the implementation of each hazard mitigation, and the progress made towards the goals of the evolving, HMP. The PC will review and update the status of the implementation of mitigation actions on an annual basis. To standardize the monitoring of the HMP goals, status updates of its specific goals will be integrated into the existing ERM program activities.

SMUD’s ERM program will consider the following to evaluate the effectiveness of the HMP:
- Has the risk environment changed?
- Are there other new and emerging risks that have the potential to impact the Plan Area?
- Do the identified goals and actions address the current and expected conditions?
- Have the mitigation actions been implemented or completed?
- Has the implementation of identified mitigation actions resulted in expected outcomes?
- Are current resources adequate to implement the mitigation plans?
- Should additional resources be committed to address the identified risks?
- What needs to be changed in order to achieve the expected outcome?

The ERMO is responsible for coordinating periodic discussions with stakeholders to perform a review of mitigations and consider whether mitigations need to be reestablished and/or are still relevant to the corresponding potential hazards.

It is important to note that addressing potential hazards requires viewing hazard mitigation strategies as long-term practices. However, these hazard mitigation strategies have a necessity to constantly evolve and become enhanced due to the growing threat of climate change and the speed of technological advances. Climate change is expected to increase the rate of and exacerbate hazards. This may require the adoption of new technology and the innovation of new mitigation techniques.

SMUD will need to constantly integrate the growing impacts of climate change into the HMP’s hazard mitigation strategies. It is possible that efforts to reduce risk in the short-term may increase risk in the long-term.

## 20.2 Change in Priorities
SMUD’s Executive Team reviews changes and proposed additions to the Enterprise Portfolio on a monthly basis to account for changes in commodity markets, work

progression, and adjustments to our priorities. The monthly Enterprise Portfolio Review meeting kicks off with our “Strategic Pulse Check” to ensure staff are focused on key projects and updates are made to the 6 Month Look Ahead. Both financial and performance snapshots are then reviewed for year-to-date progress towards our financial and operational goals. Project starts, stops, and changes impacting the portfolio are discussed for decision by the Executive team. New work presented to this team goes through the same process and scoring methodology as our annual planning process to review business case and resource availability. This information and approvals of new work enables SMUD to continually review and optimize our Enterprise Portfolio.

### 21.1.2 Status of Plan Incorporation Actions

SMUD’s Enterprise Prioritization process helps to ensure alignment across SMUD, focused on delivering the things that are most important to the organization, customers, and community. This includes the evaluation, assessment, and prioritization of work to meet SMUD’s key strategic and operational business goals, strategic portfolio management, and facilitation of Executive investment decisions.

# 21.2 Plan Prioritization

## 21.2.1 Benefit/Cost Review
Initiatives within the action plan must be prioritized according to a benefit/cost analysis (44 C.F.R. § 201.6(c)(3)(iii)). Projects and initiatives that address hazard mitigation will follow SMUD’s current Enterprise Prioritization Process.

SMUD’s Enterprise Prioritization scoring methodology consists of 4 components – Strategic Alignment, Risk, Business Unit Criticality, and Financials. Our Strategic Alignment component encompasses the benefit to the organization and strategy of completing the work. SMUD leverages a weighted scoring methodology, with the individual weighting of each component to be determined annually based on the current environment SMUD is facing for the upcoming year. Typically, the strategic alignment and risk components are more heavily weighted than the other components.

The financial score will only consider costs and financial savings or revenue that will be reflected in SMUD’s budget. Cost savings to customers or risk-based cost calculations are not included. The score requires a calculation of net present value, which is today’s value of expected cash flows minus today’s value of invested cash. Present value of lifetime cost minus present value of lifetime benefit.

## 21.2.2 Grant Pursuit Priority
The priority for pursuing funding for each action was assigned based on the following criteria:

- **High priority** – An action that
  - meets identified grant eligibility requirements,
  - has high benefits,
  - is prioritized via Enterprise Prioritization, and
  - local funding options are unavailable, limited, or available local funds could be used instead for actions that are not eligible for grant funding.

- **Medium priority** – An action that
  - meets identified grant eligibility requirements,
  - has medium or low benefits,
  - is prioritized via Enterprise Prioritization, and
  - local funding options are unavailable, limited, or available local funds could be used instead for actions that are not eligible for grant funding.

- **Low priority** – An action that
  - has not been identified as meeting any grant eligibility requirements.

<!-- Page 185 -->
# 22.0 Plan Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance

## 22.1 Plan Adoption
SMUD operates under the oversight and guidance of its Board of Directors. SMUD’s 2018 HMP was adopted by SMUD’s Board of Directors on June 24, 2019. As part of the process of updating and implementing the 2024-2028 HMP Update, a preliminary version of this plan was presented to the Board of Directors on (Date) at the (Name of Committee Meeting). Following input from the Board, the HMP was then submitted to Cal OES and ultimately to FEMA for review and acceptance.

Within approximately eight weeks of FEMA’s pre-approval of the HMP, the final plan will be presented to SMUD’s Board of Directors during a regularly scheduled meeting for formal adoption.

## 22.2 Plan Implementation
The effectiveness of the HMP depends on the implementation and incorporation of its action items into existing planning processes. This HMP will serve to support SMUD’s decision-making process in the next 5-years. The mitigation activities will be prioritized according to SMUD’s budget and planning process.

## 22.3 Plan Maintenance
### 22.3.1 Integration with Other Planning Processes
The mitigation activities within the HMP will follow SMUD’s Enterprise Prioritization process as outlined in section 21.3.1. Benefits/Cost Review.

### 22.3.2 Plan Evaluation and Monitoring
Evaluation of progress will be recognized by monitoring changes in the hazard risk-potentials that have been identified previously in the HMP. Changes in risk-potential can be denoted as:
- Increased hazard risk-potential because of a new development. 
- Increased hazard risk-potential because of a changed mitigation strategy.
- Decreased hazard risk-potential because of the success of a mitigation strategy.

Updates to the HMP will include the above changes in risk-potential as well as:
- Recognizing new hazards that arise in SMUD’s Plan Area.
- Utilizing new data or studies on current and/or future hazards.
- Incorporating new capabilities in mitigating specific hazards.
- Incorporating newly acquired assets and all growth and development of current infrastructure.

97 Be it naturally occurring, or human caused.  
179 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 186 -->
Updates to the HMP will also be made to accommodate actions that have failed or are not considered feasible after a review of their consistency with the established progress markers.

### 22.3.3 Plan Update Method and Schedule
SMUD will update the HMP, formally, every five years. The update process will begin in the 3–4-year period to give sufficient time for stakeholder engagement and evaluation of actions. Additionally, SMUD will be tracking the mitigation efforts through its existing business processes. Mitigations will be reviewed during the annual prioritization process and periodic enterprise risk reviews. Progress of any hazard mitigation projects will be tracked through the existing project management reporting process. Updates during these processes will be integrated into the plan as appropriate. The updates will be reviewed by the PC periodically and finalized during the 3–4-year review period. Maintenance of the HMP will be conducted in accordance with DMA 2000.

The ERMO is responsible for initiating plan maintenance, and tracking status updates of installed mitigation efforts and changing threats in SMUD’s Plan Area. Following a hazard event triggering SMUD’s Emergency Operation Center (EOC), the ERMO will revisit the plan to ensure mitigation strategies are being implemented as stated and to discuss possible future changes to the HMP. The next formal plan update for the SMUD HMP will occur five years from the date that this HMP is approved by Cal OES and FEMA.

### 22.4 Continuing Public Involvement
The draft HMP and final approved HMP will remain available to the public on the HMP website. The public can continue to provide comments on the HMP directly to ERM@smud.org and during public Board and Committee meetings. Any public input will be incorporated into the next formal HMP update process.
