# Board Monitoring Report 2023
## SD-2, Competitive Rates

### 1. Background

Strategic Direction 2, Competitive Rates states that:

Maintaining competitive rates is a core value of SMUD.

Therefore:

a) The Board establishes a rate target of 18 percent below Pacific Gas & Electric Company’s published rates on a system average basis. In addition, the Board establishes a rate target of at least 10 percent below PG&E’s published rates for each customer class.

b) SMUD’s rates shall be competitive with other local utilities on a system average basis.

c) In addition, SMUD’s rates shall be designed to balance and achieve the following goals:

   i) Reflect the cost of energy when it is used or exported to the SMUD grid;  
   ii) Reduce consumption during periods of high system demand;  
   iii) Encourage energy efficiency, conservation, and carbon reduction;  
   iv) Encourage cost effective and environmentally beneficial Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) (examples of DERs include but are not limited to rooftop solar, battery storage, and energy reduction applications);  
   v) Minimize the rate of change in the transition from one rate design to another;  
   vi) Provide customers flexibility and choices;  
   vii) Be as simple and easy to understand as possible;  
   viii) Address the needs of people with low incomes and severe medical conditions; and  
   ix) Equitably allocate costs across and within customer classes.  

### 2. Executive summary

a) SMUD is in compliance with SD-2, Competitive Rates.

As of December 31, 2023, SMUD’s rates remain among the lowest in the state and on a system average rate basis are 50.1% below Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) Company’s, which is better than the SD-2 target of at least 18% below on a system average rate basis. Residential average rates are at least 46.8% below PG&E’s residential average rates. See Figure 1 below for details.

There was one rate increase to SMUD’s rates in 2023. Rates for all customers were increased by 2% on January 1, 2023, as adopted by the Board on September 16, 2021. The overall rate advantage between SMUD and PG&E remains well above the SD-2 target of at least 18% on a system average basis.

|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| System average rates 18% below PG&E rates | 50.1% below PG&E on a system average rate basis | 45.5% below PG&E on a system average rate basis | 40.9% below PG&E on a system average rate basis |

2023 marked the continuation of several rate developments that balance the SD-2 requirements and help SMUD maintain our critical financial performance and metrics. In September, the Board approved Rate Resolution 23-09-09 which will allow SMUD to continue to meet California mandates, while addressing the impacts of the current economy and inflation. Despite these rate changes SMUD anticipates continuing to meet SD2 requirements in the future.

In September 2023 the board approved four 2.75% rate increases through 2025 with the first rate increase going into effect on January 1, 2024. These approved increases are, on average, lower than those of other electric utilities in the state of California. These increases are driven by commodity price increases, compliance requirements and inflation, among other things as described in Section 4 below.

The Time-of-Day (TOD) rate continues to encourage residential customers to shift usage out of the 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. peak time-period. On average, TOD rates deliver approximately 86-126MW of reduced load during SMUD’s system peak.

### 3) Additional supporting information
- The Board establishes a rate target of 18% below PG&E’s published rates on a system average basis. In addition, the Board establishes a rate target of at least 10% below PG&E’s published rates for each customer class.

SMUD continues to maintain average rates that are lower than PG&E’s, both at a system level and by rate class. Figure 1 provides a detailed picture of the difference between SMUD’s and PG&E’s average rates by class in 2023 as well as the difference between rates in 2022.

Notes  
* Projected 2023 average prices for SMUD with rates effective 1-1-23. PG&E average prices in 2023 reflect rates effective 9-1-23, per Advice Letter 7009-E. The rate difference in year 2022 reflects PG&E average rates as of 6-1-22, per Advice Letter 6603-C dated 5-20-22, and SMUD rates effective 3-1-22.  
** CARE vs EAPR includes EAPR & EARMED customers.  
*** There is no indication from PG&E that their CARE rates include customers who have a medical allowance only.  
**** Commercial rates include WAPA credits.  

As seen in Figure 1, the rate competitiveness by class varies for the different customer classes and is at least 46.8% below comparable PG&E class average rates. Since the creation of this annual monitoring report, SMUD has consistently maintained rates that were more than 18% below PG&E. See Appendix A for more details.  

b) SMUD’s rates shall be competitive with other local utilities on a system average basis.  

SMUD’s system average rate is competitive with other local utilities as shown in detail in Appendix B. In general, we are seeing large rate increases across the other local utilities. Even with our approved rate increases in 2024 and 2025, SMUD’s rates remain competitive. For example, Modesto recently approved a two-year rate increase of approximately 13% for 2024 and 2025; that’s in addition to an already adopted cumulative rate increase of 10.5% for 2023 and 2024. Roseville Electric is in the middle of proposing 2 rate increases of 9% each for 2024 and 2025. PG&E rates went up by 13% in 2023 alone, with a separate 17% rate increase effective January 2024.  

c) Reflect the cost of energy when it is used or exported to the SMUD grid  

SMUD’s TOD and restructured commercial rates were designed to more closely reflect the cost of energy when it is used, with prices highest during the peak times periods when the cost of energy is highest. We continually assess our rates as markets and our costs change to determine if any structural changes are needed. For example, we implemented TOD rates in 2018 and restructured our commercial rates in 2021.  

d) Reduce consumption during periods of high system demand  

Both the residential and commercial TOD rates send signals to customers to reduce their on-peak usage. The Peak time for residential customers is 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. while the Peak time for commercial customers under the restructured rates is 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. These Peak time periods reflect the highest $/kWh to encourage customers to shift their energy usage outside of the Peak time-period to reduce system load and help with carbon reduction goals.  

The optional residential Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) rate charges a premium on energy delivered during those few critical times during the summer with highest demand, which is expected to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions when the grid is most stressed. Additionally, customers on the CPP rate receive a discount on energy delivered during the summer Off-Peak and Mid-Peak time periods, encouraging them to shift their energy use to times when the grid is less stressed and clean energy is more abundant.  

e) Encourage energy efficiency, conservation, and carbon reduction  

SMUD continues to encourage energy efficiency, conservation and carbon reduction through the residential and non-residential TOD rates and a variety of programs, such as incentives to install storage, and offering a variety of rebates for energy-efficient appliances, heating and cooling systems, and energy-efficient LED lighting. TOD rates encourage  

GM 24-017  
Board Monitoring Report - SD-2, Competitive Rates  
Page 3 of 12  
<!-- Page 10 -->
![Board Monitoring Report – SD-2, Competitive Rates](https://example.com/image.png)

customers to shift energy use from peak times when energy is more costly and is produced by a larger portion of carbon-emitting generation plants to off-peak times, when there is often excess carbon-free solar generation on our system. By shifting usage to times when non-carbon emitting resources are plentiful, customers not only save money, but they also contribute to reducing carbon emissions and help SMUD achieve our carbon reduction goals. The residential and restructured commercial TOD rates were designed to be revenue neutral, so customers can save money if they shift or reduce their usage from peak hours. More detailed information about rebates and savings tips can be found on smud.org.

f) Encourage cost effective and environmentally beneficial Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) (examples of DERs include but are not limited to rooftop solar, battery storage, and energy reduction applications)

The Solar and Storage Rate (SSR) was designed to work with a series of programs and incentives to help SMUD reach its 2030 Zero Carbon Plan. SMUD started the My Energy Optimizer (MEO) incentives and expanded storage incentives to encourage customers to invest in storage, which could enable the customer to gain additional value from their investment. In addition to the storage incentives, the CPP rate provides customers with solar and storage even more of an opportunity to increase the value of their system, by providing a significantly larger incentive to send power to the grid during critical events. The CPP rate also encourage customers to adopt smart thermostats, as they may be able to save money the CPP rate if they use the thermostats to adjust their energy usage.

Customers that live in low-income, multi-family affordable housing will be able to receive the benefits of solar through the Virtual Solar Option. In the Virtual Solar Option, the building owner may install solar, and the benefits of that solar will be allocated to the residents, providing an avenue for customers to adopt solar even though they do not own their own home.

g) Minimize the rate of change in the transition from one rate design to another

SMUD follows this principle through gradualism and balance between rate implementation and customer satisfaction when making rate structure changes in combination with rate increases. For example, the Commercial Rate Restructure will be phased in over an 8-year period to mitigate bill impacts.

h) Provide customers flexibility and choices

SMUD provides flexibility and rate options to its customers. Residential customers may select custom due dates, budget billing, and net energy metering customers can choose between monthly or annual settlement options. Residential customers are placed on TOD, but they may select the fixed rate or the CPP rate. All customers may make online payments and set up billing alerts. In addition, qualified commercial customers moving to SMUD’s service area may choose between two different Economic Development Rate discount structures, selecting the option that best suits their needs.

SMUD is offering three levels of incentives for customers to install storage. The amount of the incentive increases depending on which programs the customers decide to participate in. The smallest incentive, MEO Starter, is for customers that do not wish to participate in a program, the next highest level, MEO Partner, is for customers that want to participate in the CPP rate, and the highest incentive, MEO Partner+, is for customers that want to participate.

![Board Monitoring Report – SD-2, Competitive Rates](https://smud.org)  
in the Virtual Power Plant program. Detailed information about storage incentives can be found on smud.org.  

i) Be as simple and easy to understand as possible  
SMUD works to make sure its many programs and rates are simple and easy to understand. For example, staff designed the TOD rate and restructured commercial rates to balance simplicity while still reflecting the cost of energy when it is used. Ongoing customer outreach and education assists customers in understanding new rate designs, pilots and programs.  

j) Address the needs of people with low incomes and severe medical conditions  
SMUD continues to address low-income customers and those with medical conditions. The Energy Assistance Program Rate (EAPR) and our Medical Equipment Discount Rate (MED Rate) offer customers a discount on their monthly energy costs for those that qualify. The discount for EAPR is determined by Federal Poverty Level (FPL) with the largest discount going to those that need the most assistance. In September 2023, the Board approved the EAPR Rate Stabilization Fund which gives an additional discount to those customers with the greatest need, using discretionary, non-retail funds.  

Additionally, through the EAPR and MED Rate discount program we have assisted nearly 2,000 customers with energy education, energy efficient improvements and repairs, and moved them towards our Clean Energy Vision with building and transportation electrification improvements. These programs improve/reduce their overall burden and increase the comfort of their homes.  

k) Equitably allocate costs across and within customer classes  
To ensure costs are equitably allocated across and within customer classes, staff updates SMUD’s marginal cost study and performs rate costing studies and value of solar studies prior to recommending rate structure changes, such as with TOD, the Commercial Rate Restructure and SSR.  

4) Challenges  
Rate Pressures  
SMUD continues to face cost pressures for compliance and risk mitigation requirements, as well as technology and grid investments to support the safe and reliable operation of the grid. Commodity costs to meet our reliability Renewable Portfolio Standards requirements are increased by $87 million in 2024, along with an increase of $370 million of capital spending to fund new generation, storage projects, substation and line capacity projects in 2024 and 2025. In addition, increased costs for wildfire management, reliability of our hydro facilities, customer programs to support our clean energy vision, and inflation all added pressure to maintaining SMUD’s bottom line. These rate pressures were the drivers and detailed in the 2023 GM Report.  

5) Recommendation  
It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD 2, Competitive Rates.

## Appendix B: Local Utility Rates

- **Modesto Irrigation District (MID)**: On November 15, 2022, MID approved rate increases of 7.4% effective January 2023 and an additional 3.5% for 2024. On November 14, 2023, the MID Board of Directors approved another round of rate increases of 7.5% for January 2024, and a subsequent 5.5% increase for 2025 to cover costs and power supply cost pressure. A Power Cost Adjustment designed to reflect fluctuating power supply costs was also adopted and will be calculated and applied monthly to customer bills in 2025.

- **Turlock Irrigation District (TID)**: TID has not had a base rate increase since 2015 and there is no indication the utility plans to modify its base rates in 2024. There is no change planned to the Power Supply Adjustment at the moment.

- **Roseville Electric**: Roseville Electric has scheduled three public rate workshops in January 2024 to explain the need of additional rate increases for 2024 and 2025, however they will continue their 8% energy surcharge through December 31, 2024. The utility states that the need for new rate increases is due to several factors, including

skyrocketing fuel prices, increased operating costs including materials and labor, renewable energy compliance regulations, and a loss of revenue from the state. The proposal includes two rate increases of 9% each for 2024 and 2025 and adds the 8% energy surcharge to the base rates to make it permanent.

- **Lodi Electric**: On June 7, 2023, the Lodi City Council adopted a rate increase of 2% effective August 2023 for fiscal year 2023-24 and 2% effective July 2024 for fiscal year 2024-25. The staff report describes that the additional needed revenue is being collected through an increase to the monthly customer charge which is intended to cover the fixed costs of the utility – those costs that do not change based on the amount of energy. Lodi also has a monthly energy cost adjustment that adjusts as power costs increase or decrease. The range of the energy cost adjustment for 2023 was -$0.0377/kWh to $0.0671/kWh.

- **Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP)**: LADWP did not have a base rate increase in fiscal year 2022-2023. LADWP does have a pass-through rate mechanism that adjusts quarterly with costs, outside of any base rate increases. This Energy Cost Adjustment (ECA) ranged between $0.10213 and $0.10369 for 2023.

SMUD’s system average rate remains competitive, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 uses 2022 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), which is the most recent actual yearly data available. 2023 values are based on averaged monthly figures through October 2023. Roseville and Lodi do not participate in the reporting of monthly data. System average rates in dollars per kWh is a typical benchmark used in the industry to compare rates and are calculated by taking total electric revenue and dividing it by total kWh retail sales.

Including pass-through mechanisms in rates is a common utility practice, allowing utilities to collect enough revenue to cover their costs without having to increase rates in a formal rate proceeding. SMUD has the Hydro Generation Adjustment, which allows for a small additional charge.

# Appendix C: PG&E Updates

## Overview of PG&E’s recent rate proceedings

In 2023 PG&E had five rate changes, increasing the system average rate in $/kWh from $0.2803 in 2022 to $0.3133 in 2023 as shown in Figure 6.

## Figure 6 – PG&E 2022-2023 Rate Changes

| PG&E Rate Changes in 2022 | Annual | PG&E Rate Changes in 2023 | Annual |
|----------------------------|--------|----------------------------|--------|

| Rate Change (%)            | 7.50%  | 10.50%                     | 1.00%  | 19.98%  | 3.30%  | 4.40%  | -1.80% | 5.30%    | 1.50%  | 13.19% |
| System Rate ($/kWh)*      | $0.2514| $0.2776                    | $0.2803| $0.2858 | $0.2983| $0.2931| $0.3087| $0.3133  |

*Includes California Climate Credit

## PG&E Rate Increase Process

Every three to four years PG&E files a request with California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) with their proposed rate increases. Per the most recent filing dated 12/29/2023, which reflects the true-up and General Rate Case (GRC), PG&E will increase its rates by 17.1% on average effective January 1, 2024.

For 2024, most of the increase is driven by the GRC which supports the continued implementation of the utility’s wildfire mitigation plan, a large portion of which is “undergrounding” 1,230+ miles of lines where wildfire risk is high. Other driving factors include the need to meet growing energy demand and the addition of more renewables.

PG&E is awaiting a decision from the CPUC on their proposed Income-Graduated Fixed Charge, expected sometime in 2024.

Figures 7 and 8 show the comparison to PG&E rates for each step of SMUD’s rate increases in 2024. The charts show that even with the increases, the difference between PG&E's and SMUD's rates still far exceed the directive of SD-2.

**TO:** Board of Directors  
**DATE:** January 24, 2024  

**FROM:** Claire Rogers CR 11/24/21  

**SUBJECT:** Audit Report No. 28007741  
Board Monitoring Report; SD-03: Access to Credit Markets  

Internal Audit Services (IAS) received the SD-3 Access to Credit Markets 2023 Annual Board Monitoring Report and performed the following:  

- Selected a sample of statements and assertions in the report for review.  
- Interviewed report contributors and verified the methodology used to prepare the statements in our sample.  
- Validated the reasonableness of the statements in our sample based on the data or other support provided to us.  

During the review, nothing came to IAS’ attention that would suggest the items sampled within the SD Board Monitoring report did not fairly represent the source data available at the time of the review.

# Board Monitoring Report 2023  
## SD-3 Board Strategic Direction on Access to Credit Markets  

1. **Background**  
   Strategic Direction 3 on Access to Credit Markets states that:  
   Maintaining access to credit is a core value of SMUD.  
   Therefore:  
   a. For SMUD’s annual budgets, the Board establishes a minimum target of cash coverage of all debt service payments (fixed charge ratio) of 1.50 times.  
   b. When making resource decisions, SMUD shall weigh the impacts on long-term revenue requirements, debt, financial risk and flexibility.  
   c. SMUD’s goal is to maintain at least an “A” rating with credit rating agencies.  

2. **Executive summary**  
   SMUD relies on the use of borrowed funds to pay for a portion of its capital needs on an ongoing basis. The Board adopted SD-3, Access to Credit Markets, to help ensure that SMUD maintains the ability to raise new money at competitive rates in the bond market as needed. Making prudent use of borrowed funds to finance capital improvements can help SMUD to mitigate major rate adjustments in periods of intensive capital expansion, and allows SMUD to allocate the costs of those improvements over their useful lives to the customers who benefit from them. Maintaining access to credit markets supports our objective to be financially flexible to make necessary and timely investment and take advantage of opportunities while remaining competitive.  
   One of the most important indicators of an organization’s ability to access credit markets is the independent assessment made by credit rating agencies. SMUD is rated by the three major rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Moody’s, and Fitch, which review SMUD’s credit on approximately an annual basis. The credit ratings assigned are intended to give investors the rating agency’s view of the likelihood that SMUD will repay principal and pay interest on bonds when due. They utilize financial metrics in assessing creditworthiness such as the Fixed Charge Ratio that measures revenue sufficiency to meet obligations, and Days Cash on Hand, a measure of liquidity. They also measure leverage and the capacity to finance future capital projects without placing undue burden on customers, either through borrowing or within our rate structure. SMUD’s overall governance and risk

management practices are also important to the agencies, along with the ability and willingness to raise rates when necessary while maintaining competitive low-cost energy for our customers.

As indicated in the attached ratings agency reports, SMUD demonstrates robust metrics, and, thanks to well-managed cash flow, has the flexibility to target a more conservative fixed charge ratio. The most recent SMUD credit reports from both S&P and Fitch also specifically cite the Board’s demonstrated willingness to raise rates to support financial performance.

Credit ratings heavily impact an organization’s ability to borrow money in the municipal markets, as well as the interest rates they will be required to pay. Higher credit ratings translate into lower borrowing costs. For example, if SMUD’s credit ratings were to fall into a lower category, from AA to A, the impact at today’s rates would be approximately $373k/year for every $100 million borrowed. During a period of financial turmoil, as experienced in early 2020, higher credit ratings allowed SMUD to access credit markets sooner, more easily, and at a lower interest rate than lower rated utilities.

Credit ratings also impact an organization’s ability to conduct general business transactions. Trading partners utilize credit ratings as a factor in assessing their willingness to transact with SMUD, and to determine commercial terms. Stronger credit ratings enable SMUD to negotiate better terms and conditions for contracts, including power purchase agreements, and commercial insurance policies. For example, SMUD’s healthy credit ratings minimize the amount of collateral posting required under many of its commodity contracts to hedge natural gas and power. Likewise, if SMUD’s ratings were to drop from current levels, collateral posting requirements would increase accordingly. In some cases, a reduction in SMUD’s credit ratings below a certain threshold gives our counterparty the right to terminate the contract.

In addition to cash on hand, SMUD maintains a liquidity program consisting of a commercial paper program and a line of credit. The commercial paper program enables SMUD the ability to issue up to $300 million of commercial paper notes to obtain funding quickly, when it’s necessary to maintain our liquidity levels. Similarly the line of credit allows SMUD access to up to $100 million on short notice but has the advantage that it isn’t dependent on investor demand. The commercial paper program and line of credit are instrumental in providing comprehensive liquidity support for its operations and capital initiatives. The liquidity program helps to maintain our credit ratings and mitigate many enterprise risks that are otherwise difficult or financially prohibitive to mitigate through standard means. The commercial paper program and line of credit are structured with agreements from three separate banks, further reducing concentration risk and enhancing overall execution.

f. Successfully mitigated interest rate risk in a volatile market environment by strategically refunding $200 million worth of Commercial Paper through the issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt. This transaction, which also was SMUD’s first ever Climate Bond certified Green Bond issuance, also ensured that the entire $400 million capacity remains available to meet our future borrowing requirements to support our capital improvement program and Zero Carbon Plan.

g. Accessed credit markets with multiple issuances and rollovers of commercial paper totaling $150 million outstanding by the end of 2023. The commercial paper issuances were to support SMUD’s liquidity needs and capital improvement program.

h. Additional supplemental contributions of $44 million were made to CalPERS. This was part of a 10-year pension funding strategy to eliminate our unfunded pension liability, which is an obligation rating agencies are increasingly focusing on in their reviews. Addressing the unfunded liability sooner will help control rate increases. These costs would continue to grow into the future since paying only the required minimum payments may not fully mitigate the compounding nature of the outstanding liability adequately. SMUD’s most current valuations show the Pension funded status at 88% as of June 30, 2022, and the funded status of Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) at 92% as of June 30, 2023.

i. Continued to successfully manage the property and casualty insurance programs amidst a historically challenging market, renewing most programs within expiring terms and conditions. Obtaining wildfire coverage remains a challenge, but even in this tumultuous market SMUD successfully increased the program limit by $25 million, and reduced the self-insured portion of the first $100 million layer by $12.5 million.

j. Negotiated a $50 million advance payment on the anticipated claim recovery for the Cosumnes Power Plant (CPP) steam turbine failure insurance claim. SMUD also settled the property damage claim for the CPP steam turbine failure which resulted in SMUD receiving a $13.6 million payment.
