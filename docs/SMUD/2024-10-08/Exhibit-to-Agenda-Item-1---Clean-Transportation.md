![Impacts of Proposed Amendments to the CARB LCFS Rule](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=Impacts+of+Proposed+Amendments+to+the+CARB+LCFS+Rule)

**Challenges:**
- LCFS credit values currently at historic lows (~$50)
- Wide variability in forecasts & potential budget impacts – forecasts range from $50 to ~$200 post enactment

**Proposed CARB Changes**
- Reduces SMUD’s contribution to CFR program from 45% to 25%
- Authorizes use of holdback funds for upstream infrastructure
- Introduces 9% step-down in carbon intensity & auto-acceleration feature to bolster and re-stabilize credit prices

---

**If enacted,** SMUD would realize an immediate 20% bump from increased holdback to current $10M clean transportation budget plus upside from higher credit values

**CARB:** California Air Resources Board  
**CFR:** Clean Fuel Rewards  
**LCFS:** Low Carbon Fuel Standard  
**MHD:** Medium & Heavy Duty (vehicles)

![Existing & Future Challenges](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=Existing+%26+Future+Challenges)

### Existing & Future Challenges

#### Residential
- **Public & multifamily charging gaps**
  - Public charging is unavailable or unreliable (non-Tesla), & is concentrated in more affluent locations.
  - Convenient @home charging is largely unavailable to MFH residents.
  - At home MFH & public charging costs as much as 5x what SFHs pay*.
  - MFH & workplace charging is not scaling with the market.

#### System
- **Challenges to Sustaining Rapid Electrification**
  - Proving out & deploying managed charging to defer costly grid upgrades.
  - Managing risks of building out grid ahead of demand.

#### Commercial
- **New or upgraded service costs & timelines**
  - Lengthy & unclear timelines for site capacity upgrades hinder adoption & impact fleets’ ability to meet mandates.
  
- **Technology adoption**
  - New MHD EVs & charging infrastructure is 2-3x the cost of conventional vehicles.
  - Customers are unfamiliar with V2G landscape & new utility relationships.
  - EVs are not yet suitable for all MHD fleet applications; FCEVs may fill gap.

---

*Strategy aims to improve customer experience & mitigate future grid impacts:*
- To meet mass market LDV adoption in line with CA State goals (ACCII).
- To support early MHD adopters & proactively plan for ACF mandates.

# Hydrogen & FCEV: What we know today

## Cost Trends
- H2 fuel cost must decrease ~82% to <$6/kg-delivered to reach BEV cost parity

## Technology Trends
- FCEV end-to-end efficiency is ~3x lower than BEV
- High CAPEX & immature H2 production & transport network may impede widespread adoption

## Market Trends
- NREL studies estimate MHD EV sales 20x greater than FCEV in 2030, 5x in 2050
- FCEV most suitable for 500+ mile applications

**BEV:** Battery Electric Vehicle  
**FCEV:** Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle  
**NREL:** National Renewable Energy Laboratory  
**MHD:** Medium-Heavy Duty

**To meet these challenges, we will focus on:**
- End-to-End “Whole Solutions” that deliver convenient, affordable, & grid-friendly charging to underserved customers and MHD fleets
- Early customer engagement, increased transparency, & streamlined processes
- Proactive planning & investment for mass market LD ZEV adoption & MHD ZEV growth
- Innovating to secure external funds that magnify impact & solve for key segments
