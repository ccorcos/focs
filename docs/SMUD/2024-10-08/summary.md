### Improved Summary of SMUD's Clean Transportation Strategy Documents

**Key Policy Milestones:**
- **By 2027:** 100% of state, local, and agency fleet vehicle purchases must be Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) under the Advanced Clean Fleets Rule.
- **By 2030:** 
  - Increase light-duty Electric Vehicles (EVs) from approximately 25,000 to 150,000 (6x increase).
  - Increase medium and heavy-duty Electric Vehicles (MHD EVs) from approximately 1,000 to 30,000 (30x increase).
- **By 2035:** All new purchases of light-duty vehicles must be zero emission.
- **By 2042:** All new purchases of medium and heavy-duty vehicles must be zero emission.

**Current Market State:**
- **Light-Duty EV Adoption:**
  - Innovators: 2.5%
  - Early Adopters: 13.5%
  - Early Majority: 34%
  - Late Majority: 34%
  - Laggards: 16%
- **Customer Experience:** Over 90% of charging occurs at home; charging remains the primary concern for new buyers.

**Progress Against California Energy Commission 2030 Goal:**
- **Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC):** 38% complete.
- **Public & Workplace Charging:** 18% complete.
- **Multifamily Housing (MFH):** 2% complete.

**Challenges:**
- Current Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credit values are at historic lows (~$50), impacting funding for clean transportation initiatives.
- Proposed changes by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) could reduce SMUD’s contribution to the Clean Fuel Rewards program from 45% to 25%, affecting the utility's clean transportation budget.

**Potential Benefits of Proposed CARB Changes:**
- If enacted, SMUD could see a 20% increase in its current $10 million clean transportation budget, enhancing investment in infrastructure and programs.

---

**Fleet Load Forecast:**
- By 2035, cumulative EV fleet charging load could reach:
  - 528 MW under managed peak charging scenarios.
  - 685 MW under on-peak charging conditions.

**SMUD’s Enterprise EV Strategy:**
1. **Grid & Charging Infrastructure:** Align infrastructure to meet 2030 EV goals.
2. **Customer Education & Experience:** Position SMUD as a trusted advisor for electric mobility.
3. **New Technology/Innovation:** Embrace innovations like managed charging and Vehicle-to-Anything (V2X) technologies.
4. **Equitable Access:** Ensure affordable clean mobility for all community members, especially underserved populations.
5. **Workforce Readiness:** Develop a workforce that supports equitable job creation in the clean transportation sector.
6. **Regional Collaboration & Investment:** Partner with regional entities for investments and grants.

**Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs):**
- Hydrogen fuel costs must decrease by approximately 82% to below $6/kg to achieve cost parity with Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs).
- Current market trends indicate that medium and heavy-duty vehicles will primarily be Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs).

---

**Public Comment:**
- Community members expressed concerns regarding:
  - **Charging Infrastructure:** Many residents highlighted the lack of public and multifamily charging options, emphasizing that public charging is often unavailable or unreliable, particularly in less affluent areas.
  - **Cost of Charging:** Comments were made about the high costs associated with charging for multifamily housing residents, which can be up to five times higher than single-family homeowners.
  - **Equity in Access:** Several speakers urged SMUD to prioritize equitable access to charging infrastructure, particularly for low-income and multifamily residents.

---

**Important Decisions Made:**
- The Board recognized the need for a comprehensive strategy to address charging availability and affordability for multifamily housing residents.
- The committee agreed to prioritize the development of a SMUD-branded public EV charging network and to launch a network eRoaming platform for easier access to charging stations.

---

**Conclusion:**
The meeting emphasized SMUD's commitment to advancing its Clean Transportation Strategy, focusing on increasing electric vehicle adoption, enhancing infrastructure, and ensuring equitable access for all community members. Community oversight is crucial in shaping utility operations and addressing resident needs during the transition to clean transportation.
