# Specific pace to be determined by balance of headwinds and tailwinds

### Headwinds
- Pace of infrastructure deployment
- Mass market vs. early adoption
  - Cost and range
  - Charging availability (MFH, depots)
  - Fitness for diverse duty cycles (MHDV)
- Political uncertainty

### Tailwinds
- CA continues as zero emission vehicle leader
- Strong policy undergirds transition
  - CA: Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks; Advanced Clean Fleets
  - Federal: EPA GHG standards; incentives
- Federal investments
  - Beginning to produce steel in the ground

![Battery electric and fuel cell electric vehicles will play distinct roles](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=Battery+electric+and+fuel+cell+electric+vehicles+will+play+distinct+roles)

**Light-duty Vehicles**
- LD ZEVs likely to be dominated by BEVs and PHEVs
- Unlikely there will be meaningful role for FCEVs
- Sales data strongly supports this perspective

**Medium- and Heavy-duty Vehicles**
- MD ZEV also likely to be primarily BEV
- HD powertrain shares ~ an open question; FCEV may play larger role for long-haul

1. Fully battery-electric: Cars or other vehicles that are powered entirely by an electric motor and battery, instead of an internal combustion engine.
2. Plug-in hybrid: Cars or other vehicles that have a rechargeable battery and electric motor, and an internal combustion engine. The battery in plug-in hybrids is smaller and has a shorter range than battery-electric cars, so over longer distances, the car starts running on gasoline once the battery has run out.

**Key Questions**
1. What do we need?  
   How much infrastructure, and where?  
   - Plan against long-term EV market expectations.  
   - Improve load forecasting practices.  

2. How can we meet that need most efficiently?  
   - Prioritize efficient, cost-effective use of distribution infrastructure.  

3. How do we get there?  
   What changes are required to efficiently meet the need?  
   - Improve risk sharing and mitigation.  
   - Align grid connection with customer needs.  
   - Enable accountable, longer-term utility capital investments.

![EV load growth will impact all levels of grid infrastructure](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=EV+load+growth+will+impact+all+levels+of+grid+infrastructure)

**EV load growth will impact all levels of grid infrastructure**

The equipment providing this charging will require a range of power availability, from the low kilowatt-scale power supplied by Level 1&2 chargers in residences to 25+ Megawatts at truck charging depots that are currently being developed. This range of power demand corresponds to a variety of impacted grid infrastructure equipment. Utilities will need to manage investment and upgrades to all types of equipment on their system as EV loads grow.

| Power Range         | Examples                                   | Physical System Constraints                     |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1 kW - 15 kW        | Residential EV charging                    | Electric panel capacity                         |
| 15 kW - 1 MW       | Public and fleet EV charging               | Distribution transformer and feeder capacity    |
| 1 MW - 20 MW       | Larger EV fleets and depots                | Substation capacity                             |
| 20 MW - 1 GW       | Heavy-duty transport charging hubs          | Aggregating smaller loads impacts the bulk system |
| > 1 GW              | Gigaplug                                   | Bulk generation and transmission capacity       |

Transportation electrification will occur alongside growth in electricity demand in several other sectors of the economy – notably data centers and building electrification. While utility’s plan investments should consider all these loads, EV loads have distinct characteristics which must be considered. They will peak at different times, with large overnight peaks for most home and depot-based charging and day-time peaks for fast chargers. They have some potential for flexibility and can serve as distributed resources in Virtual Power Plant (VPP) or Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) programs. It is notable that, even within the EV charging category, different types of vehicles and charging equipment will likely present different load characteristics that must be considered when planning.

# Fleets and Industry Grapple with Grid Constraints

## California’s backlogged grid is holding up its electric truck dreams
Electric truck-charging projects face years of waiting to get the power they need. Clean-transport advocates say regulators must push utilities harder to speed up.

**By Jeff St. John**  
23 September 2024

- “No one has said infrastructure will be able to meet the targets at this point” – Matt Schrap, Harbor Trucking Association regarding Advanced Clean Fleet regulation
- “Fleets preparing for Class 8 EV tractors, obtaining permits and installing suitable high-power grid interconnections can take from two to four years” – Society of Automotive Engineers
- “The US’s largest heavy-duty electric trick microgrid is powered by… natural gas”. 96 E-truck depot in California relies predominately on generators due to insufficient grid capacity. May 24th, 2024
