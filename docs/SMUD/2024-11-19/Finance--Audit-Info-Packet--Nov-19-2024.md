**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and award contracts to Utility Tree Service LLC, Mountain F. Enterprises Inc., Community Tree Service LLC, Rancho Tree Service, Greentek Services LLC, and Asmone Environmental Restoration Industry LLC for Vegetation Management – Utility Line Clearance Services for a contract term of three years from November 22, 2024, to November 21, 2027, with two optional one-year extensions, for a total aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount of $250 million.

**Summary:**  
Request for Proposals No. Doc4621886315 (RFP) was issued in June 2024 to solicit qualified firms to provide all supervision, labor, materials, equipment, and incidentals necessary to perform right-of-way vegetation maintenance work on SMUD’s Transmission and Distribution Systems on a task order basis. A pre-proposal conference was held on June 27, 2024, of which 28 contractors attended. On July 26, 2024, SMUD received 22 proposals of which 19 were responsive and three were non-responsive.

SMUD engaged in multiple rounds of negotiations with the top 13 proposers to arrive at the recommendation to award contracts to the six highest evaluated responsive proposers. Staff plans to utilize the two highest evaluated proposers, Utility Tree Service LLC, and Mountain F. Enterprises Inc., as the primary contractors performing the full scope of vegetation management utility line clearance maintenance work and storm restoration. Staff expects to utilize the proposers ranked there through six as secondary contractors on an as-needed basis should SMUD need additional resources. Any adjustments to primary and secondary contractor utilization made by staff over the term of the contract will be based on factors such as alignment with SMUD’s operational needs and/or contract availability and performance.

**Primary Contractors**  
1. Utility Tree Service, LLC  
   1623 S Main St  
   Milpitas, CA 95035  
2. Mountain F. Enterprises, Inc.

   Folsom, CA 95630  

**Secondary Contractors**

   416 Salinas Rd  
   Royal Oaks, CA 95706

**TO:** Distribution  
**FROM:** Kathy Ketchum / Lisa Limcaco  
**DATE:** November 1, 2024  
**ACC:** 24-017  

**SUBJECT:** SEPTEMBER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OPERATIONS DATA  

We are attaching the financial and operating reports for the nine months of 2024. They include sales and generation statistics and other selected data.

The change in net position is an increase of $379.6 million compared to a budgeted increase of $160.9 million, resulting in a favorable variance of $218.7 million.

We prepared these statements on the accrual basis of accounting, and they conform to generally accepted accounting principles. The bases for the budget amounts are:

1) Budgeted electric revenues are based on the Forecast of Revenues by the Pricing Department, adjusted for unbilled revenues; and  

2) Budgeted operating expenses reflect the 2024 Budget approved by the Board of Directors on December 14, 2023.

**Net Position**
- The change in net position is an increase of $379.6 million compared to a budgeted increase of $160.9 million, resulting in a favorable variance of $218.7 million.

**Revenues**
- Revenues from sales to customers were $1,412.5 million, which was $51.7 million higher than planned. The increase is primarily due to:
  - Higher residential sales of $36.1 million primarily due to higher customer usage.
  - Higher commercial sales of $13.0 million primarily due to higher customer usage.
  - No actual provision for uncollectible accounts compared to a budget of $2.3 million. The current balance of the accumulated provision is sufficient to cover write-offs of arrears.
  
- Revenues under the California Global Warming Solutions Act (Assembly Bill [AB] – 32) were $27.3 million. This is due to carbon allowances sold through the state sanctioned quarterly auctions.
  - Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) revenues were $5.0 million due to LCFS credit sales.
  - Other electric revenues were $8.4 million higher due to higher unplanned interconnection fees, transmission revenue, and Sacramento Power Academy revenue.
  - Non-cash revenues transferred to the rate stabilization fund were $44.2 million, of which $29.8 million was for AB-32, $9.3 million was for the annual WAPA Hydro Generation Adjustment and $5.0 million was for LCFS. AB-32 and LCFS funds are deferred until SMUD has qualified program expenses (projects that reduce carbon emissions or electric vehicle programs) to recognize revenue.
  - Non-cash revenues transferred from the rate stabilization fund were $38.9 million, of which $21.4 million was for revenue recognized for AB-32, $9.1 million was for LCFS and Community Impact Plan, and $8.3 million was for revenue recognized for the annual Hydro Generation Adjustment.

**Commodities, Purchased Power, and Production**
- SMUD’s generation was lower by 979 GWh (14.9 percent); JPA and other generation was lower by 767 GWh (15.0 percent); and Hydro generation was lower by 212 GWh (14.5 percent).
- Purchased power expense of $322.9 million, less surplus power sales of $102.5 million was $220.4 million, which was $44.6 million higher than planned. This increase is due to lower thermal generation that led to increased market purchases at favorable market prices.
- Production operations cost of $248.5 million, less surplus gas sales of $62.9 million, was $185.6 million, which was $75.2 million lower than planned.
  - Fuel costs of $148.4 million less surplus gas sales of $62.9 million, was $85.5 million, which was $55.2 million lower than planned. Fuel costs were lower due to decrease in thermal generation from unplanned major overhauls costs at the Carson and Procter & Gamble plants and it was more economical to replace thermal generation with market purchases.
- The “power margin”, or sales to customers less cost of purchased power, production operations costs and gas hedges included in investment revenue was $1,002.7 million, which was $78.5 million higher than planned. The power margin as a percentage of sales to customers was 71.0 percent, which was 3.1 percent higher than planned. This is primarily due to lower production costs due to lower fuel costs and higher customer sales.

**Other Operating Expenses**
- All other operating expenses were $766.9 million, which was $17.2 million lower than planned.
  - Transmission and distribution operations expenses were down $8.4 million primarily due to lower cost of transmission fees than planned.
  - Customer accounts expenses were up $1.2 million primarily due to higher labor due to new customer representative class in contact center operations.
  - Customer service and information expenses were down $8.5 million due to lower participation in EV equity incentive programs, My Energy Optimizer Partner, and Peak Conserve programs.
  - Public Good expenses were $3.6 million higher than planned primarily due to more participation in energy efficiency programs and low income building electrification program initiatives.
<!-- Page 13 -->
- Production maintenance expenses were $4.0 million lower than planned. This is primarily due to lower hydro maintenance costs offset by higher power plant overhaul expenses.
- Transmission and distribution maintenance expenses were $5.6 million lower than planned. This is primarily due to the recent operational changes in the vegetation maintenance of transmission and distribution lines.
- Non-cash depreciation and amortization is higher by $3.7 million primarily due to the unplanned amortization of software subscription assets.

Non-operating Revenues and Expenses
- Other revenue, net, was $111.6 million higher than planned primarily due to a business interruption insurance recovery payment of $88.9 million related to the Cosumnes Power Plant outage claim, a settlement payment of $7.5 million related to Substation A fire claim, $5.8 million related to the Rancho Seco annual spent fuel settlement, and higher interest income.
- Interest charges were $1.3 million lower than planned due to lower commercial paper interest expense due to early repayment in May.

**DATE SENT**  
11/5/2024  

**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize SMUD’s Accountant to defer recognition of $121 million of 2024 operating revenues to offset the following 1) $20 million future Community Impact Plan expenditures through 2028, 2) $60 million for future unexpected increases in Commodity expenditures through 2030 and 3) $41 million for future one-time specific expenditures in order to match such expenditures in the appropriate accounting period for rate-making purposes.

**Summary:**  
Pursuant to Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) official section Re10 Regulated Operations, staff is recommending that the Board authorize a total deferral of $121.0 million of 2024 operating revenues as a regulatory liability for recognition in future years for the following expenditures:

1) A $20 million of deferred operating revenues will be utilized to offset future Community Impact Plan expenditures through 2028. This utilization of deferred revenues is in line with the plan to offset additional 2030 Zero Carbon plan spending for pilots and programs.

2) A $60 million of deferred operating revenues will be utilized for future unplanned increases in Commodity expenditures through 2030 that will have a negative impact to net income. This deferral will provide reserves to cover large fluctuations in the commodity market that may have a significant financial impact on SMUD.

3) A $41 million of deferred operating revenues will help offset one-time expenditures that were not identified during the annual budget process. SMUD will be able to mitigate risks that may occur from unforeseen or one-time events which may have a significant financial impact on SMUD, such as, but not limited to, catastrophic events, wildfire costs and additional 2030 Zero Carbon Plan expenditures. This deferral will provide reserves to cover large contingencies while limiting or leveling out the impact of cost increases to rate payers.

These deferrals will allow for appropriate matching of revenue with expense recognition for rate-making purposes.

**Board Policy**  
(Number & Title)  
SD-2, Competitive Rates - allows SMUD to limit or level the impact of increases in rates.

**Benefits:**  
This accounting treatment will offset any negative significant financial impacts of unforeseen or one-time events which could have an impact on rate payers.

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
N/A

**Alternatives:**  
Recognize as operating revenues when received. When unforeseen expenditures occur in the future, the additional costs could lead to increases to SMUD rate payers.

TO: Board of Directors  
FROM: Claire Rogers  
DATE: October 29, 2024  
SUBJECT: California Energy Commission’s (CEC’s) Power Source Disclosure Program (PSD) and Power Content Label (PCL)  

Internal Audit Services (IAS) has performed the CEC’s Agreed-Upon Procedures required by California Code of Regulations, Title 20, Section 1394, as amended.

California law requires retail suppliers of electricity to disclose to consumers accurate, reliable, and simple-to-understand information on the sources of energy used to generate the electricity being used. This is done annually via the Power Source Disclosure (PSD) annual reports, which are detailed listings of power purchases and resales, and the Power Content Label (PCL). The PCL in Attachment 1 shows the sources of power SMUD discloses to its customers.

IAS reviewed the 2023 Annual PSD and PCL reports for the calendar year ending December 31, 2023, and verified, on a sample basis, the actual MWh procured by generating facilities. The source documentation reviewed included internal generation reports from SMUD’s Energy Management System (EMS), Western Renewable Energy Generation Information System (WREGIS) database, internally prepared supporting spreadsheets, and external invoices.

The engagement to apply the agreed-upon procedures was performed in accordance with the standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. IAS was not engaged to, and did not perform an audit, the objective of which would be the expression of an opinion on the annual reporting related to the 2023 PSD and PCL reports. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to you.

**TO:** Board of Directors  
**DATE:** October 25, 2024  
**Audit Report # 28007821**  

**FROM:** Claire Rogers  

**SUBJECT:** The California Independent System Operator Corporation (CAISO) Self-Audit of Settlement Quality Meter Data (SQMD) for SMUD’s Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) Participating resources, and Balancing Authority of Northern California (BANC) EIM Load Resource  

Internal Audit Service (IAS) has performed a biennial self-audit as set forth in CAISO Tariff Section 10.3.10.1 for SMUD EIM Participating Resources and BANC EIM Load Resource for the period beginning June 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024.

SMUD submits meter data to the CAISO for 33 internal SMUD generators, 2 interties and one load resource as required for our participation in CAISO EIM.

IAS reviewed SMUD’s data submittal and validation procedures for the EIM participating meters. IAS also selected a sample of meter data during the audit period and traced the meter data from the Market Results Interface – Settlements (MRI-S) system to SMUD’s Energy Management System (EMS) and Itron Enterprise Edition (IEE), SMUD’s meter data acquisition system.

Based on the procedures performed, IAS determined the procedures followed to report generation from EIM Generators and Interties were completed and accurately reported to the CAISO.

IAS did not audit all source data used to prepare this report. During the course of the audit, nothing came to the auditor’s attention that would suggest the report did not fairly represent the source data available at the time of the review.

**TO:** Board of Directors  
**DATE:** October 25, 2024  
**FROM:** Claire Rogers  
**SUBJECT:** The California Independent System Operator Corporation (CAISO) Self-Audit of Settlement Quality Meter Data (SQMD) for Valley Clean Energy Alliance and Ava Community Energy, formerly East Bay Community Energy, (Community Choice Aggregators)

Internal Audit Services (IAS) has performed a biennial self-audit as set forth in CAISO Tariff Section 10.3.10.1 for SQMD for Valley Clean Energy Alliance and Ava Community Energy, Community Choice Aggregators, for the period beginning June 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024.

SMUD receives meter data from PG&E, the Utility Distribution Company (UDC), aggregates the data, adjusts the data for distribution losses and submits SQMD to the CAISO for wholesale load settlement. Collection and validation of meter data received from the UDC is not included in this audit.

IAS reviewed the processes associated with the submission of SQMD to the CAISO. IAS selected a sample of billing data, and traced data through the application of the load shape, application of the loss factor and the submittal to the CAISO. In addition, IAS reviewed and tested SQMD monitoring controls implemented by SMUD.

Based on the procedures performed, IAS determined the procedures followed to process meter data and submit SQMD to the CAISO were followed and that the total load billed is consistent with the total load settled for the days sampled.

IAS did not audit all source data used to prepare this report. During the course of the audit, nothing came to the auditor’s attention that would suggest the report did not fairly represent the source data available at the time of the review.
