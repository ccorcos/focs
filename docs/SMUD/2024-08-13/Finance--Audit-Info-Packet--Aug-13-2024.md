**DEPARTMENT**

**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and award contracts to Stella-Jones Corporation and Conrad Forest Products for supply of wood utility poles during the five-year period from August 21, 2024, through August 21, 2029, for an aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount of $18 million.  

**Summary:**  
Request for Proposals No. Doc4512407737 (RFP) was issued on April 8, 2024, for new strategic alliance contracts for wood utility poles with one or more reputable suppliers. A pre-proposal meeting was held on April 17, 2024, which was attended by one proposer. On May 24, 2024, SMUD received three responsive proposals. SMUD negotiated with all proposers and achieved reduced pricing from all proposers. Although Bell Lumber & Pole Company reduced their pricing by $1 million, it was not enough to warrant a third contract. The results of the evaluation are shown below.  

**Recommendation:**  
Award to the highest evaluated responsive proposers.  

**Award to:**  
Stella-Jones Corporation  
1640 Marc Ave  
Tacoma, WA 98421-2939  
&  
Conrad Forest Products

<!-- Page 10 -->
![Supplier Diversity Program](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Supplier Diversity Program:** Stella-Jones Corporation is self-performing 97% of the work and subcontracting 3% to a Supplier Education & Economic Development (SEED) verified vendor (Maydwell & Hartzell).

**Board Policy:**  
**(Number & Title)**  
Board-Staff Linkage BL-8, Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Procurement; Strategic Direction SD-13, Economic Development; Strategic Direction SD-7, Environmental Leadership

**Benefits:**  
Awarding multiple contracts will mitigate SMUD's risks of operational disruptions associated with wood utility pole supply. Additionally, the competitive tension between the suppliers should drive high performance from both suppliers.

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
$18,000,000 Budgeted for 2024 - 2029 by Warehouse, Legal, Government Affairs & Contracts

**Alternatives:**  
Negotiate contract extensions on current contracts. This would not be in SMUD’s best interest as we received improved pricing and improved terms and conditions.

**Affected Parties:**  
Warehouse, Line Assets, Supply Chain Services, and Supplier.

**DATE SENT**  
7/1/2024  

**NARRATIVE:**  
**Requested Action:**  
Approve Contract Change No. 2 to Contract Nos. 4600001697 with CLARKE & RUSH MECHANICAL, INC. and 4600001698 with EAGLE SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. dba SYNERGY COMPANIES for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Plus Building and Transportation Electrification Services to extend the contract expiration date from February 19, 2025, to December 31, 2025, and increase the aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount by $15 million, from $13.2 million to $28.2 million.

**Summary:**  
This contract was awarded on a competitive basis to Clarke & Rush Mechanical, Inc., and Synergy Companies in February 2023 (Resolution 2023-02-06). The original contract was awarded for the period from February 20, 2023, to February 19, 2025, for an aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount of $12 million. These contracts are provisioned for Clarke & Rush and Synergy Companies to furnish all supervision, labor, materials, equipment, and incidentals necessary to perform heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) plus building and transportation electrification services on a task order basis.

Contract Change No. 1 was executed in May 2023, and modified the rate schedule by removing items that were obsolete and increase certain rate schedule items. The rate increases were due to the change in the Department of Energy (DOE) Standard Ratings for Western States. The pricing submitted for the Request for Proposal (RFP) pricing matrix was provided based on 2022 DOE Standards which was difficult for the Contractors to estimate with any degree of certainty as equipment and associated ancillaries had risen year over year at 10%-30% since COVID-19 and supply line issues disrupted the availability, sourcing and ultimately, pricing.

In May 2024, Management requested approval of the addition of 10% or $1.2 million GM Contingency funds due to rising costs of electrification and an increase in electrification measures issued in 2023. Funds budgeted for the contract term were depleted faster than anticipated. Customer Assistance uses these contracts to complete electrification work for special assistance customers, including neighborhood electrification used for the Gardenland and Meadowview communities. The contingency funds allowed project continuity to remain on schedule, but funds are rapidly depleted. The Customer Assistance team require additional funds for both contracts to continue to support Neighborhood Electrification efforts in low-income areas. The contract's remaining balance is lower than initially planned for several reasons. The team positively impacted 119 more special assistance customers with electrification than planned in 2023. This resulted in more building electrification projects channeled through this contract. Additionally, cost of materials increased, so projects costed more than initially planned for. However, for 2024, spend is on target. The contingency funds will cover most of the work until the end of Q3 2024. CED is estimating approximately $15 million worth of work between Q4 2024 and Q2 2025. SMUD staff plans to start developing an RFP to ensure replacement contracts are in place as soon as possible.

![Contract Change No. 2 - HVAC Plus Building and Transportation Electrification Services](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Contract+Change+No.+2+-+HVAC+Plus+Building+and+Transportation+Electrification+Services)

The current rates have been reviewed and are in line with the industry fluctuations and determined to be fair and reasonable. Staff included market research which is attached.

Currently, the contract balance is approximately $1,521,110.

**Board Policy:** Board-Staff Linkage BL-8, Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Procurement; Strategic Direction SD-13, Economic Development.

**Benefits:** Provides HVAC building and transportation electrification services to low-income customers.

**Cost/Budgeted:** $28,200,000; Budgeted for 2024 - 2025 by Customer Experience Delivery.

**Alternatives:** Postpone current projects and/or transition projects over into other existing contracts to maintain project continuity if possible until new contracts have been solicited and awarded, although not moving forward with this requested change will create a major impact to SMUD’s most vulnerable and marginalized communities.

**Affected Parties:** Customer Experience Delivery, Supply Chain Services and Contractor.

**Coordination:** Customer Experience Delivery and Supply Chain Services.

**Presenter:** Casey Fallon, Director, Procurement, Warehouse & Fleet.

TO: Distribution  
FROM: Kathy Ketchum / Lisa Limcaco  
DATE: July 31, 2024  
ACC 24-015  

SUBJECT: JUNE 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OPERATIONS DATA  

We are attaching the financial and operating reports for the six months of 2024. They include sales and generation statistics and other selected data.  

The change in net position is an increase of $114.4 million compared to a budgeted increase of $0.2 million, resulting in a favorable variance of $114.2 million.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
### For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024  

**Net Position**  
- The change in net position is an increase of $114.4 million compared to a budgeted increase of $0.2 million, resulting in a favorable variance of $114.2 million.  

**Revenues**  
- Revenues from sales to customers were $772.9 million, which was $17.5 million higher than planned. The increase is primarily due to:  
  - Higher residential sales of $15.5 million primarily due to higher customer usage.  
  - Higher commercial sales of $0.3 million primarily due to higher customer usage.  
  - No actual provision for uncollectible accounts compared to a budget of $1.5 million. The current balance of the accumulated provision is sufficient to cover write-offs of arrears.  
- Revenues under the California Global Warming Solutions Act (Assembly Bill [AB] – 32) were $19.7 million. This is due to carbon allowances sold through the state sanctioned quarterly auctions.  
- Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) revenues were $3.4 million due to LCFS credit sales.  
- Other electric revenues were $4.7 million higher due to higher unplanned interconnection fees, transmission revenue, and Sacramento Power Academy revenue.  
- Non-cash revenues transferred to the rate stabilization fund were $35.0 million, of which $22.3 million was for AB-32, $9.3 million was for the annual WAPA Hydro Generation Adjustment and $3.4 million was for LCFS. Funds are deferred until SMUD has qualified program expenses (projects that reduce carbon emissions or electric vehicle programs) to recognize revenue.  
- Non-cash revenues transferred from the rate stabilization fund were $35.4 million, of which $21.0 million was for revenue recognized for AB-32, $8.3 million was for revenue recognized for the annual Hydro Generation Adjustment, and $6.6 million was for LCFS and Community Impact Plan.  

**Commodities, Purchased Power, and Production**  
- SMUD’s generation was lower by 347 GWh (9.0 percent); JPA and other generation was lower by 333 GWh (11.5 percent); and Hydro generation was lower by 14 GWh (1.4 percent).  
- Purchased power expense of $163.6 million, less surplus power sales of $58.7 million was $104.9 million, which was $11.3 million higher than planned. This increase is due to lower thermal generation that led to increased market purchases at favorable market prices.  
- Production operations cost of $169.1 million, less surplus gas sales of $43.4 million, was $126.5 million, which was $31.5 million lower than planned.  
  - Fuel costs of $105.6 million less surplus gas sales of $43.4 million, was $62.2 million, which was $22.6 million lower than planned. Fuel costs were lower due to decrease in thermal generation from an unplanned major overhaul of section of the combustion turbine at the Procter & Gamble plant and it was more economical to replace the thermal generation with market purchases.  
- The “power margin”, or sales to customers less cost of purchased power, production operations costs and gas hedges included in investment revenue was $540.0 million, which was $36.2 million higher than planned. The power margin as a percentage of sales to customers was 69.9 percent, which was 3.2 percent higher than planned. This is primarily due to lower production costs due to lower fuel costs and higher customer sales.  

**Other Operating Expenses**  
- All other operating expenses were $518.3 million, which was $3.0 million lower than planned.  
  - Transmission and distribution operations expenses were down $7.5 million primarily due to lower cost of transmission fees than planned.  
  - Customer service and information expenses were down $6.1 million due to lower participation in My Energy Optimizer Partner and Peak Conserve programs and lower participation in the Commercial and Residential Greenery programs.  
  - Administrative & General expenses were up $4.4 million primarily due to bond issuance costs, costs related to the February storm and uncollectible non-electric billings.  
  - Public Good expenses were $2.5 million higher than planned primarily due to increased HVAC and rebate volume in the Advanced Homes Solutions program. Also, higher than planned project.  
<!-- Page 20 -->
Non-operating Revenues and Expenses  
- Other revenue, net, was $67.8 million higher than planned primarily due to a business interruption insurance recovery payment of $51.4 million related to the Cosumnes Power Plant, a settlement payment of $5.8 million related to the Rancho Seco annual spent fuel settlement, a settlement payment of $7.5 million related to Substation A fire claim, and higher interest income.

# Workforce Planning
## Executive Summary

Internal Audit Services (IAS) has completed a review of Workforce Planning. The purpose of this audit was to evaluate the processes in place to ensure SMUD has the resources it needs to accomplish its strategies and goals. This audit was included in the 2024 IAS Audit Plan.

Workforce planning is one of SMUD’s organizational strategies to attract, develop, and retain staff to deliver on the 2030 Clean Energy Vision. In 2022, SMUD’s Enterprise Change and Organizational Effectiveness (Culture and Enterprise Change) team developed a workforce planning goal to mitigate risk of future workforce gaps through enterprise-wide talent analysis, action planning, and monitoring. Specifically, strategic workforce planning includes identifying key roles that are vital to the 2030 Clean Energy Vision.

We confirmed that the current workforce planning strategy aligns with SMUD’s enterprise strategy and goals and is supported by SMUD’s executive team. Additionally, the workforce planning strategy clearly identifies desired outcomes and has been clearly communicated to senior leaders and stakeholders. We also confirmed that key roles were identified across all of SMUD’s business units. Although rationale or other notes supporting the key role determination was only documented for about half of the 59 identified key roles, Enterprise Culture and Change staff confirmed that they have incorporated the documentation of rationale notes into the current key role identification process.

Finally, we confirmed that business partners worked with senior leaders to review and analyze data related to SMUD’s current workforce and to identify any gaps resulting from those analyses. Our review found that gaps were identified and documented for all key roles, and that action plans were developed to address the identified gaps. We also confirmed that implementation of the action plans associated with key roles were monitored; business partners meet quarterly with senior leaders to discuss the status of the action plans; the status of the action plans are tracked, and metrics related to action plan status were communicated to senior leaders.

We would like to thank Culture and Enterprise Change staff for their cooperation and support during this audit.

# Workforce Planning
**Internal Audit Services Report**

**Background:**  
Internal Audit Services (IAS) has completed a review of Workforce Planning. The purpose of this audit was to evaluate the processes in place to ensure SMUD has the resources it needs to accomplish its strategies and goals. This audit was included in the 2024 IAS Audit Plan.

Workforce planning is one of SMUD’s organizational strategies to attract, develop, and retain staff to deliver on the 2030 Clean Energy Vision. In 2022, SMUD’s Enterprise Change and Organizational Effectiveness (Culture and Enterprise Change) team developed a workforce planning goal to mitigate risk of future workforce gaps through enterprise-wide talent analysis, action planning, and monitoring. Specifically, strategic workforce planning includes identifying key roles that are vital to the 2030 Clean Energy Vision; deciding on the strategy and action plan for key roles and working with stakeholders to develop and deliver on action plans; and conducting quarterly check-ins with directors and stakeholders to monitor the action plans.

**Scope:**  
The scope of this audit included all information related to SMUD’s current workforce planning strategy, including all documentation related to succession planning, the identification of key roles, and related action or development plans, as well as any workforce data and analyses. As the focus of this audit was strategic workforce planning, we did not review resource or operational workforce planning processes.

**Objectives:**  
The objectives of this audit were to:  
1. Confirm that SMUD has developed a workforce planning strategy that supports its mission and goals;  
2. Determine whether appropriate data and analyses were effectively used to assess SMUD’s workforce; and  
3. Evaluate SMUD’s plan to implement and monitor the workforce planning strategy.

**Summary:**  
We interviewed Culture and Enterprise Change staff to learn about the processes related to SMUD’s workforce planning strategy. We reviewed related documentation including workforce planning strategy presentations and communications, job aids and templates, and other guidance. We also reviewed completed key role identification and action planning documents, as well as tracking spreadsheets.

We confirmed that the current workforce planning strategy—first implemented in 2022—aligns with SMUD’s enterprise strategy and goals and is supported by SMUD’s

executive team. Additionally, the workforce planning strategy clearly identifies desired outcomes and has been clearly communicated to senior leaders and stakeholders.

We reviewed key role spreadsheets completed for each business unit in 2022 and confirmed that all SMUD’s business units participated in the key role identification process, and that key roles were identified and documented where applicable; however, rationale or other notes supporting the key role determination was only documented for about half of the 59 identified key roles. Enterprise Culture and Change staff explained that recording the rationale for key role determinations was made optional in an effort to streamline the process. They confirmed that they have incorporated the documentation of rationale notes into the current key role identification process.

Business partners worked with senior leaders to review and analyze data related to SMUD’s current workforce and to identify any gaps resulting from those analyses. Our review found that gaps were identified and documented for all key roles, and that action plans were developed to address the identified gaps.

Finally, we confirmed that implementation of the action plans associated with key roles were monitored. We reviewed action planning spreadsheets and found that business partners meet quarterly with senior leaders to discuss the status of the action plans; the status of the action plans are tracked, and metrics related to action plan status were communicated to senior leaders.

**Conclusion:**  
Culture and Enterprise Change have developed a workforce planning strategy that supports SMUD’s missions and goals. SMUD’s key roles have been identified, and Culture and Enterprise Change staff have worked with senior leaders to analyze workforce data and discuss related gaps, and to develop action plans. Finally, the status of these action plans were monitored and reported to appropriate stakeholders.

IAS would like to thank Culture and Enterprise Change staff for their cooperation and support during this audit.

## OFFICE MEMORANDUM  

**TO:** Board of Directors  
**FROM:** Claire Rogers  
**DATE:** July 19, 2024  
**SUBJECT:** Greenergy® Partner Plus Program Verification — Agreed-Upon Procedures  
**Audit Report #28007800**  

Internal Audit Services (IQS) has performed the procedures enumerated below, which were agreed to by SMUD and the Center for Resource Solutions (CRS), to verify SMUD’s compliance with annual reporting requirements of the CRS’ Greenergy® Partner Plus Program Verification for the year ended December 31, 2023. SMUD’s management is responsible for compliance with the annual reporting requirements of the CRS’ Greenergy® Partner Plus Program Verification.  

The sufficiency of these procedures is solely the responsibility of the specified users of the report. Consequently, we make no representation regarding the sufficiency of the procedures described below either for the purpose for which this report has been requested or for any other purpose.  

The procedures include, but are not limited to:  
- Validation and recalculation of Partner Plus retail sales;  
- Validation and recalculation of Partner Plus Product resource supply, or renewable energy credits (RECs), retired in the Western Electric Coordinating Council (WECC) WREGIS tracking system database;  
- Validation and recalculation of Partner Plus Product Content Labels.  

Based on the Verification Audit Protocol for Greenergy® Partner Plus Program Verification and the results of the Agreed-Upon Procedures, IAS asserts that SMUD has no exceptions with regard to its compliance of the verification reporting requirements put forth in the Verification Audit Protocol.  

The agreed-upon procedures engagement was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. IAS was not engaged to and did not conduct an examination or review, the objective of which would be the expression of an opinion or conclusion, respectively, on SMUD’s compliance to the annual reporting requirements of the CRS’ Greenergy® Partner Plus Program Verification. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion or conclusion. Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to SMUD and CRS.
