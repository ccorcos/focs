**Recent Accomplishments & Contract Impacts**

Since 2023, when the contracts were awarded, staff has delivered over 2,100 bundles, including over 700 Homeowner bundles.
- Over 12,600 electrification measures installed
- 549 EV Circuits and 341 EVSE (chargers) installed
- 4 installations included Battery Storage
- 1 Neighborhood Electrification completed
  - TECH Quick Start Grant with City of Sacramento
- 3 Neighborhood Electrification
  - Strawberry Manor, North Highlands, and Meadowview Neighborhood (Matsui earmark grant)

Funds budgeted were depleted faster than anticipated resulting in an exhaustion of funds earlier than planned:
- Positively impacted more income eligible customers with Homeowner bundles.
- Cost of materials increased, causing project costs to increase.
