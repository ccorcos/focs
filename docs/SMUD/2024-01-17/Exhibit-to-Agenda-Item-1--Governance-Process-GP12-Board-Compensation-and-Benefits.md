# Statutory Requirements

# Options for Consideration

- The Board may increase its compensation in an amount no greater than 5% following the operative date of the last adjustment, amounting to a maximum of $332.85 per day of service (not to exceed 10 days of service).

- The Board compensation would be $326.83 per day of service if the Board’s current compensation were adjusted to reflect the changes in the Consumer Price Index (capped at five percent) over the past year.

- Any changes to Board compensation would not be effective until July 1, 2024 (one year following the operative date of the last adjustment).

- The Board may decide to maintain the existing per day of service compensation of $317.00 and move the annual review to December. This would allow changes to Board compensation to be effective every January.
