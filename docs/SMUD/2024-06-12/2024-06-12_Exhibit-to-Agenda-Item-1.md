**SD-4, Reliability Policy**

Meeting customer energy requirements is a core value of SMUD.  
Therefore:  
SMUD will assure all customer energy requirements are met. This will be accomplished through the use of: (i) its generation resources and purchase power portfolio 100 percent of the time; and (ii) its transmission assets to assure an overall availability of at least 99.99 percent.  

SMUD will achieve distribution system reliability by:  
Limiting the average frequency of outage per customer per year to:  
- With major event: 0.99 – 1.33  
- Excluding major event: 0.85 – 1.14  

Limiting the average duration of outages per customer per year to:  
- With major event: 67.5 – 93.3 minutes  
- Excluding major event: 49.7 – 68.7 minutes  

Ensuring that no individual circuits exceed these targets for more than two consecutive years. For circuits that exceed these targets for two consecutive years, a remedial action plan will be issued and completed within eighteen months.  

SMUD will maintain the electric system in good repair and make the necessary upgrades to maintain load serving capability and meet regulatory standards.

# SD-4, 2023 Reliability Results

## Generation and Transmission System
Met customers’ energy supply needs 100% of the time through a combination of SMUD generation and purchase power supplies

- **Generation Asset and Gas Pipeline Availability**
  - Thermal Generation – 80.83%
  - Hydro Generation – 86.41%
  - Thermal Generation June through September – 96.55%
  - Hydro Generation June through September – 88.11%
  - At system peak, 53% of the generation was provided by internal resources and 47% was provided by purchased power

- **Overall availability of transmission system was 100%**

# SD-4, 2023 Reliability Results

SMUD was in compliance for SAIFI (excluding major events). Reliability targets were exceeded for SAIDI excluding major events (75.6 minutes), as well as SAIFI (1.42) and SAIDI (318.2 minutes) including major events.
