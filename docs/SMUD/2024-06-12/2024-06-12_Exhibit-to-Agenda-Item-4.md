**Drivers for a refresh to our Enterprise Risk Management approach**

**Examples of recent events that demonstrate a need for enhanced risk activities:**
- Consumnes Power Plant (CPP) outage
- Commodity cost volatility
- Unprecedented storms

**In addition, SMUD will need to manage emerging areas of change such as:**
- Load growth due to electrification
- Energy supply characteristics as we advance our 2030 Clean Energy Vision

**According to the 2023 The State of Risk Oversight Report from North Carolina State University, 65% of respondents surveyed from over 454 organizations said that the volume and complexity of risks have increased over the past 5 years.**

# KPMG Enterprise Risk Management Maturity Assessment

- Internal Audit Services, with the expert assistance of KPMG, completed a maturity assessment of SMUD’s Enterprise Risk Management program in April 2024 to identify potential areas for improvement.
- KPMG recommended four key focus areas:

  **Opportunity to establish a common risk language, taxonomy, and reporting across the organization**  
  *(Standardization)*

  **Opportunity to better align strategic goals with existing enterprise risk management efforts and align views of Executives and Directors**  
  *(Prioritization)*

  **Opportunity to connect top-down with bottom-up views and establish risk metrics to understand risk exposure**  
  *(Aggregation and Simplification)*

  **Opportunity to connect risk insights across risk owners through expanded coverage and identification of interdependencies**  
  *(Interconnectedness)*
