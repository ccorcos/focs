In 2023, I think several members engaged in what were operations issues delegated to the CEO and we should be careful not to cross that line.

d) The CEO shall use prudent judgment in the exercise of the delegations and in a manner that is operationally and economically sound, serves the best interests of SMUD’s customers and the community, comports with prudent business practices, balances the risks and benefits of the actions, and does not expose SMUD to unreasonable risk. If the CEO reasonably determines that an activity related to the delegations presents, regardless of the size of the financial commitment: (i) a unique and significant operational risk to SMUD; (ii) a significant impact to customers; (iii) a significant impact to community relations; (iv) a significant impact to SMUD’s reputation; or (v) materially compromises the policies and goals established by the Board, the CEO shall timely inform the Board and may request the Board to take appropriate actions.

e) The Board may change its delegation to the CEO at any time, subject to the conditions of the Board’s contract with the CEO, thereby expanding or limiting the authority of the CEO.

# BL-8 Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Procurement

a) **Competition:** SMUD’s procurement activities shall be competitive whenever practical.

b) **Direct Procurement:** Direct procurement may be utilized when it is in SMUD’s best interest. Direct procurement is the purchase of goods or services without competition when multiple sources of supply are available.

**Comments:**

Is this specific enough? “in SMUD’s best interest” might describe a lot of situations in which we would still prefer competitive bidding.

**j)** Leveraged Procurement Agreement (LPA): SMUD may procure goods and services where another lead public agency or organization competitively procures the same goods or services under applicable state and federal laws to streamline procurement processes and leverage collective buying power of multiple agencies to achieve cost savings and other benefits to SMUD. Leveraged procurement agreements are generally referred to by other public agencies as “Cooperative Purchasing Agreements.”

**k)** Strategic Alliances: SMUD may enter into strategic alliance contracts for the procurement of goods or services. A Strategic Alliance is a competitively bid multi-year contract for goods and/or services in which the Supplier and SMUD work collaboratively over the life of the contract to improve quality, and to explore design and process improvements to reduce the cost of production, service delivery, and the total cost of ownership. These benefits are shared both by SMUD and the Supplier.
