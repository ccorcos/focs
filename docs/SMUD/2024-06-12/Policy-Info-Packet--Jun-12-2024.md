# Board Monitoring Report 2023
## SD-4 Reliability

1) **Background**

Strategic Direction SD-4 Reliability states that:

Meeting customer energy requirements is a core value of SMUD.

Therefore:

a) SMUD will assure all customer energy requirements are met. This will be accomplished through the use of: (i) its generation resources and purchase power portfolio 100 percent of the time; and (ii) its transmission assets to assure an overall availability of at least 99.99 percent.

b) SMUD will achieve distribution system reliability by:

- Limiting the average frequency of outage per customer per year to:
  - With major event: 0.99 – 1.33
  - Excluding major event: 0.85 – 1.14

- Limiting the average duration of outages per customer per year to:
  - With major event: 67.5 – 93.3 minutes
  - Excluding major event: 49.7 – 68.7 minutes

Ensuring that no individual circuits exceed these targets for more than two consecutive years. For circuits that exceed these targets for two consecutive years, a remedial action plan will be issued and completed within eighteen months.

c) SMUD will maintain the electric system in good repair and make the necessary upgrades to maintain load serving capability and meet regulatory standards.

2) **Executive summary**

Improving reliability is essential to meeting customer energy requirements and drives customer loyalty.

SMUD was in compliance for both generation and transmission availability. SMUD met all energy supply requirements 100% of the time through its generation resources and purchased power. At a peak load of 3,092 megawatts (MW) (which occurred on

August 16, 53% of the generation was provided by internal resources and 47% was provided by purchased power. The transmission availability was at 100% for the year.

**SMUD was in compliance for System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) (excluding major events).** Reliability targets were exceeded for System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) excluding major events (75.6 minutes), as well as SAIFI (1.42) and SAIDI (318.2 minutes) including major events. The 2023 distribution system reliability performance is summarized in Table 1 below.

**Table 1: 2023 Distribution System Reliability Performance**

| Including Major Events | Excluding Major Events |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| SD-4 Limit             | 2023 Results           | SD-4 Limit             | 2023 Results           |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| SAIFI                  | 1.33                   | 1.42                   | 1.14                   | 1.01                   |
| SAIDI (minutes)       | 93.3                   | 318.2                  | 68.7                   | 75.6                   |

Major events are defined as events caused by earthquake, fire, or storms of sufficient intensity which result in a state of emergency being declared by the government. Absent the declaration of a state of emergency, any other natural disaster may be excluded only if it affects more than 15% of the system facilities or 10% of the customers, whichever is less.

There are 763 distribution circuits of which 98.7%, or 753 circuits, met the SD-4 reliability criteria. Twenty projects (primarily cable replacement) were issued to improve reliability, of which eleven have been completed. The remaining nine projects are on schedule to be completed within the eighteen-month requirement. These projects include cable replacement, avian mitigation, tripsaver installations and other work.

**3) Additional supporting information**

**Generation**

**Hydro Generation Facilities**

The availability rate for SMUD’s hydro generation system in 2023 was 86.41% and for the June 1st through September 30th period, hydro generation availability was 88.11%. SMUD’s Upper American River Project (UARP) hydro system generated 2,375 gigawatt hours (GWh). The budgeted generation was 1,635 GWh.

The lower hydro availability rate was due to an unscheduled outage at Camino resulting from a transformer failure (T1). This outage began in June and extended through the end of the year. The failed transformer was replaced in March 2024.

Gas Pipeline Operations  
SMUD’s gas pipeline had a 100% availability rating in 2023 and provided a constant flow of gas to SMUD’s thermal generation facilities. All necessary maintenance activities were successfully completed in accordance with our operations and maintenance plans and procedures.

Thermal Generation Facilities  
The overall availability rate for SMUD’s thermal generation facilities in 2023 was 80.83% and for the June 1st through September 30th period, thermal plant availability was 96.55%. SMUD’s thermal generation facilities generated a net total of 4,442 GWh against the budgeted generation of 5,156 GWh.

Transmission and Distribution  
SMUD has approximately 488 miles of transmission lines and 10,882 miles of distribution lines including 69 kilovolt (kV). Approximately 40% of the distribution lines are installed overhead and 60% are installed underground. The transmission system is predominately overhead except for 19 miles of underground lines located in the Carmichael and downtown areas.

Staff monitors circuit reliability regularly to assess circuits that could potentially exceed the reliability limits. Outage causes, trends, and reliability impacts are analyzed to identify corrective actions that will bring the reliability of these circuits within the acceptable range.

Challenges  
On the evening of December 31, 2022, the first of nine atmospheric river storms hit northern California. The impact of these storms started in 2022 and carried over into 2023 causing significant damage to the grid, affecting approximately 264,000 customers, a SAIDI contribution of 242.6 minutes, and a SAIFI contribution of 0.41 in 2023. The unexpected storms brought over 60 miles per hour (mph) wind gusts, with 48 mph sustained winds, coupled with almost two inches of rain. With the ground saturated by heavy rains combined with high winds, over 1000 trees over several days were uprooted all over the Sacramento region with many trees falling onto SMUD’s overhead lines. These types of tree related outages take longer to resolve since the trees must be removed from the tangled powerlines prior to the start of rebuilding the lines.

# Drivers for Reliability Performance

The main drivers for the distribution system performance excluding major events, along with the mitigation measures for each, are summarized below.

## Non-Preventable Tree Outages

The leading cause of outages in 2023 was non-preventable tree outages. Overall, there was a 143% increase in the number of non-preventable tree outages, with a 609% increase in SAIDI minutes and a 285% increase in SAIFI, when comparing with 2022. This dramatic increase in non-preventable tree outages was caused by the numerous storm days in the first quarter of 2023 that did not qualify as major event days.

To further improve on the impact of non-preventable tree outages on the grid, SMUD’s vegetation management department continues to be proactive in our maintenance activities. This will improve the reduction of non-preventable tree outages.

## Equipment Failures

Equipment failures are associated with a wide variety of distribution line components, such as fuses, poles, wire hardware, broken connectors, broken jumpers, failed transformers, broken cutouts and more. Outages due to failed equipment continue to be evaluated to locate and address any systemic deficiencies.

Failed equipment was the second leading cause of outages in 2023. When compared to 2022, outages due to equipment failures increased by 17%, SAIDI minutes increased by 37% and SAIFI decreased by 12%. This decrease in SAIFI was caused by a reduction in the number of customers experiencing equipment related outages from 107,206 customers in 2022 to 95,915 customers in 2023.

Multiple inspection and maintenance programs are in place to identify and correct deficiencies before they result in failure. We have annual line patrols to detect obvious deficiencies. In addition, we perform detailed line inspections (DLI) every five years. During a DLI, the inspector examines every attachment on the pole and documents deficiencies found. The deficiencies are prioritized and repaired based upon predetermined schedules.

## Underground Cable Failures

In 2023, underground cable failures were the third leading driver to quantity of outage events. The number of outages due to cable failures decreased by 12% compared to 2022. Additionally, SAIDI and SAIFI values decreased by 1% and 7% respectively. Improved performance in this area is primarily driven by targeted selection of cables.

Board Monitoring Report – SD 4, Reliability  
Page 4 of 8
<!-- Page 12 -->
Furthermore, there has been a 15% reduction in number of single-phase circuit failures in 2023 compared to 2022, which has led to the reduction of overall cable outages. Additionally, cable injection work in 2024, will target 69kV circuits, which impact a large number of customers. Injection is expected to improve reliability of those lines for up to 25 additional years.

5) Recommendation

It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD-4 Reliability.

## Appendix 3: Reliability Comparison

Table 3 below provides a comparison between SMUD’s average distribution system performance compared to that of Pacific Gas and Electric’s (PG&E’s) distribution system. PG&E defines its distribution system as operating voltages less than 60kV and uses the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1366 standards to define major event days, while SMUD includes the 69kV operating voltage as part of the distribution system and uses an alternate method to determine major event days. The information regarding PG&E’s system average performance was obtained from the 2022 reliability report posted on the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) website. PG&E’s 2023 Reliability Report is not posted on the CPUC website yet.

### Table 3: Distribution System Reliability Comparison (excluding major events)

| Year | SAIDI (minutes) | SAIFI |
|------|------------------|-------|
|      | SMUD | PG&E | SMUD | PG&E |
| 2019 | 66.0 | 103.1 | 1.04 | 0.88 |
| 2020 | 47.6 | 111.2 | 0.90 | 0.93 |
| 2021 | 60.4 | 160 | 1.04 | 1.03 |

**SMUD BOARD POLICY**  
**Category:** Board-Staff Linkage  
**Policy No.:** BL-7  
**Title:** Delegation to the CEO  

The Board will instruct the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager (CEO) through written policies that define the results that the organization is to achieve, and which describe the delegation of authority to the CEO.

Specifically:

a) The Board shall identify and define those results or conditions of SMUD that are acceptable and not acceptable to the Board and communicate them in the form of policy.

b) The Board shall develop policies that define the delegation to the CEO with regard to the CEO’s authority.

c) The CEO is authorized to establish all further policies, make all decisions, take all actions, establish all practices, and develop all activities related to the operations or business affairs of SMUD.

d) The CEO shall use prudent judgment in the exercise of the delegations and in a manner that is operationally and economically sound, serves the best interests of SMUD’s customers and the community, comports with prudent business practices, balances the risks and benefits of the actions, and does not expose SMUD to unreasonable risk. If the CEO reasonably determines that an activity related to the delegations presents, regardless of the size of the financial commitment: (i) a unique and significant operational risk to SMUD; (ii) a significant impact to customers; (iii) a significant impact to community relations; (iv) a significant impact to SMUD’s reputation; or (v) materially compromises the policies and goals established by the Board, the CEO shall timely inform the Board and may request the Board to take appropriate actions.

e) The Board may change its delegation to the CEO at any time, subject to the conditions of the Board’s contract with the CEO, thereby expanding or limiting the authority of the CEO. But as long as any particular delegation is in place, the Board will abide by the CEO’s decisions in those areas that are delegated to him or her.

# SMUD BOARD POLICY
**Category:** Board-Staff Linkage  
**Policy No.:** BL-8  
**Title:** Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Procurement  

The procurement of goods and services is an integral part of SMUD operations. SMUD’s procurement activities shall take place in accordance with the following principles:

a) **Competition:** SMUD’s procurement activities shall be competitive whenever practical.

b) **Direct Procurement:** Direct procurement may be utilized when it is in SMUD’s best interest. Direct procurement is the purchase of goods or services without competition when multiple sources of supply are available.

c) **Sole Source Procurement:** Sole source procurement shall be performed only in the case of emergency or when a competitive process would be an idle act.

d) **Inclusiveness:** SMUD’s procurement practices shall promote inclusiveness of the entire supplier community in its contracting opportunities.

e) **Economic Development:** SMUD’s procurement practices shall promote the economic development of the community we serve.

f) **Environmental Procurement:** SMUD shall minimize the impact on the environment through its procurement practices. In making procurement decisions, staff shall consider the environmental impacts in assessing total cost and benefits.

g) **Responsible Bidder:** SMUD shall only do business with reputable and responsible suppliers. A Responsible Bidder demonstrates trustworthiness, quality, capacity, financial capability, fair labor practices, and experience to satisfactorily perform SMUD work through the bidding and evaluation process. In addition, SMUD will determine Responsible Bidders by considering a supplier’s social, environmental ethical, and safety accountability where applicable.

h) **Supplier Code of Conduct:** SMUD shall set minimum expectations or standards for all suppliers to follow in the course of doing business with SMUD (in some cases by submitting data and reporting annually) including but not limited to, labor and human rights, environmental, social, governance (ESG), health and safety accountability, ethics and compliance, and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging practices.

i) **Best Value Procurement:** SMUD may procure goods and services by the best value at the lowest cost methodology, where cost and other factors are used to obtain the maximum value while ensuring a fair and equitable process.
<!-- Page 54 -->
![Board-Staff Linkage BL-8](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Board-Staff+Linkage+BL-8)

j) **Leveraged Procurement Agreement (LPA):** SMUD may procure goods and services where another lead public agency or organization competitively procures the same goods or services under applicable state and federal laws to streamline procurement processes and leverage collective buying power of multiple agencies to achieve cost savings and other benefits to SMUD. Leveraged procurement agreements are generally referred to by other public agencies as “Cooperative Purchasing Agreements.”

k) **Strategic Alliances:** SMUD may enter into strategic alliance contracts for the procurement of goods or services. A Strategic Alliance is a competitively bid multi-year contract for goods and/or services in which the Supplier and SMUD work collaboratively over the life of the contract to improve quality, and to explore design and process improvements to reduce the cost of production, service delivery, and the total cost of ownership. These benefits are shared both by SMUD and the Supplier.

l) **Supply Chain Risk:** SMUD’s procurement activities shall identify, manage, and mitigate supply chain risks through a coordinated effort across the enterprise.

m) **Protest Policy:** SMUD shall ensure that suppliers are afforded the opportunity to have their grievances heard through a fair protest process.

n) **Delegation of Authority to the CEO:** The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager (CEO) is delegated authority to perform and approve the procurement activities in accordance with the below matrix. This delegation includes the authority to amend contracts for time extensions or other changes that create no additional cost to SMUD.
