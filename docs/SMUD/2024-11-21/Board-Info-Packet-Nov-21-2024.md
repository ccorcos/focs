![Sacramento Municipal Utility District Office Memorandum](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SACRAMENTO+MUNICIPAL+UTILITY+DISTRICT+OFFICE+MEMORANDUM)

TO: Board of Directors  
DATE: September 25, 2024  

FROM: Claire Rogers CR 9/25/24  

SUBJECT: Audit Report No. 28007752  
Board Monitoring Report; SD-6: Safety Leadership  

Internal Audit Services (IAS) received the SD-6 Safety Leadership first-half 2024 Biannual Board Monitoring Report and performed the following:

- Selected a sample of statements and assertions in the report for review.
- Interviewed report contributors and verified the methodology used to prepare the statements in our sample.
- Validated the reasonableness of the statements in our sample based on the data or other support provided to us.

During the review, nothing came to IAS’ attention that would suggest the items sampled within the SD Board Monitoring report did not fairly represent the source data available at the time of the review.

1. Background  
   Strategic Direction SD-6, Safety Leadership states that:  
   Creating a safe environment for employees and the public is a core value of SMUD.  

   Through best practice methods and continuous improvement, SMUD will be recognized as a leader in employee safety while also assuring the safety of the public related to SMUD operations and facilities. SMUD commits to a proactive approach, including the active involvement of SMUD leadership, employees, contractors, and the community, as well as comprehensive monitoring of organizational and public safety performance.  

   Therefore, SMUD will continue to improve safety results to:  

   a) Workplace Safety  
   i. Reduce SMUD’s injury severity incidents to 13 or less than by 2025, as measured by OSHA’s Days Away Restricted Time (DART), a rate that demonstrates top quartile safety performance for similar size utilities using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) work-related safety data.  
   ii. Provide timely, quality health care for injured employees that aids their recovery while maintaining positive financial performance of the workers’ compensation program.  

   b) Contractor Safety  
   i. Support contractors to reduce and eliminate potential hazards for Serious Injuries and/or Fatality (SIF) when conducting high risk work.  

   c) Public Safety  
   i. Track and report injuries to the public related to SMUD operations or facilities.  
   ii. Implement measures to protect the public from injuries related to SMUD operations or facilities.

![Executive Summary](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Executive+Summary)

2. Executive Summary

SMUD is in compliance with the SD-6 direction and is in alignment with SMUD’s new 5-year strategy of working toward a zero-incident culture.

**Workplace Safety**  
SMUD has recorded 11 OSHA Recordables injuries in the first half of 2024. This is a 48% decrease from this time last year (21 OSHA Recordables). Of the 11 injuries, 5 (3 Lost Time & 2 Modified Duty injuries) resulted in a 0.45 DART rate. This represents a continued decrease in injuries which is trending downward to meet our 2025 Target. (See Appendix A.)

Quality care of injured employees is measured through the Workers’ Compensation program’s performance, which is assessed annually by an independent actuary. SMUD continues to have a reduction in indemnity benefits over the past three years as presented below. However, the number of claims and injury frequency rates have increased.

| Fiscal Year | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| No. of Claims (Medical & Indemnity) | 89 | 59 | 54 | 46 | 63* |
| Incident rate per 100 employees | 2.3 | 2.4 | 2.2 | 1.8 | 2* |
| Rates per $100 payroll | .94 | .85 | .67 | .58 | .50* |

*2024 data provided is a projection at the time the Actuary Report was prepared and may change.

**Contractor Safety**  
SMUD continues to use ISN to evaluate safety records and performance for high-risk contractors. This evaluation focuses on Contractor Fatality History, OSHA Citation History, DART and Total Recordable Incident Rates (TRIR), Insurance Experience Ratio, Safety Culture Questions, and Safety Program Review. Currently SMUD has 136 contractors in the ISN system.

This year we have increased the number of site safety evaluations for high-risk contractors to validate safety performance on the jobsites. Safety has completed 214 site safety visits through the 1st half of 2024 and are well on our way to meet the 2024 goal of 250 evaluations. These visits focus on SMUD contractors who work with Power Generation, Environmental Services, Line, Substation, Facilities and Vegetation Management on projects where high-risk work is performed. This work includes high voltage work, working at heights, vegetation management, confined spaces, excavations, etc. Additionally, we have fully integrated the use of the SMS system for inspections, incident tracking, reporting and investigations of SMUD contractors. This allows SMUD to verify safe working practices by our contractors to reduce the potential for serious injuries or property damage. Contractor reported incidents require an investigation to be completed, and typically will warrant additional site safety visits to verify corrective measures have been put into place to reduce further occurrences.

The Contractor Safety Team is working with ISN to pilot a safety training qualifications tool. This tool will allow a more efficient method of verifying Contractor Employee qualification. An example of this would be the SMUD Specific Vegetation Safety Orientation that will allow SMUD to communicate safe work practice expectation to our contractors. The Contractor Safety Team also partnered with the Vegetation Management Team for the 2024 Contractor Safety Day.

event is aimed to set expectations to our Vegetation Contractors doing high risk work. This event is an effective way of reaching Vegetation Contractor employees.

In addition, SMUD Procurement and Safety have partnered to enhance contract language as it relates to contractor safety requirements, Request for Proposal (RFP) templates for high-risk work and incorporating contractor safety as part of the onboarding process. The Contractor Safety Team is currently working closely with Procurement on the RFP Reviews for high stake Contracts such as the PCC, Substation Builds, Vegetation Management Line Clearance, Line Pole Replacement, and Cable Replacement RFP’s.

## Public and Community Safety

### Public Safety Statistics
SMUD tracks public and community incidents in the Safety Incident Tracking System (SITS) involving car-pole, electrical contacts, dig-in incidents, and injuries to the public that are related to SMUD’s operations or facilities. The following statistics are reported for the 1st half 2024:
- There have been 143 incidents where the public struck a SMUD asset with a vehicle, with two fatalities from such events.
- Three electrical contact incidents were reported and have become personal injury claims pending further investigation.
- There have been 28 dig-in incidents reported with no injuries. In response to these dig-ins, SMUD’s public safety team has sent out 15 notification letters to contractors and customer’s responsible for the dig-in occurrence as a proactive effort to provide further awareness and education on best practices to avoid future occurrences. This is a new practice that was started to support this program.

### Public Safety Events
SMUD’s Health & Safety and Line department personnel attended the Elk Grove Regional Safety Day event to provide educational outreach and resources to the Elk Grove and Galt community members in attendance. The resources provided were in promotion of digging safely around our underground lines and the USA 811 process. Approximately 2500 attendees were noted in 2024. This event was also a way for SMUD to support local area first responders for the Consumers Services District (CSD).

SMUD’s Health & Safety supported the Jackson Laboratory’s Safety Awareness week by hosting a booth in support of public safety around SMUD equipment and infrastructure. Specifically, SMUD health and safety provided handouts, giveaways, prizes, and informational resources on how to remain safe around downed lines and the USA 811 process with an emphasis on the “Call Before You Dig” campaign.

SMUD’s Public Safety team participated in a joint training and awareness effort with PG&E for Sacramento City Fire Department’s (SFD) Officer’s training class. SMUD provided knowledge on high-voltage equipment identification, SMUD’s unique assets, and discussed future collaboration efforts with their leadership teams over the course of three days.

### New Public Safety Initiatives
The public safety team has partnered with Culver Communications to upgrade the smudsafety.com website geared toward third-party contractors, agricultural workers, and educators. The site functionality and aesthetics have been improved. Also, additional language
<!-- Page 21 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

options have been added to the smudsafety.com website in order to represent the diverse community SMUD continues to serve.  
SMUD’s Marketing department and public safety team have partnered together to build out a campaign in support of public safety and workplace safety. This new campaign initiative involves building awareness on preventing obstructions near SMUD’s infrastructure. The broad campaign was developed based upon the labor requests from the Joint Labor Management Safety Committee (JLMSC). The campaign message will be delivered to the general public in several formats, including social media, Connections Newsletters, and bill inserts in the remainder of 2024.

### 3. Additional Supporting Information
The new SD-6 Safety Direction became effective February 2021. Our goal is to achieve the desired performance objectives by year-end 2025. This report summarizes the first half of the 2022 safety performance.

**Safety Leadership**  
The Safety Team continues with its integration efforts to support Executive Leadership’s 5-year plan that emphasizes zero incidents and injuries and a focus on a zero-accident safety culture. SMUD’s Executive Leadership team continue to emphasize our Safety priority with all personnel, contractors and in the public. We continue to grow our Safety for Life culture by reducing the risk of serious injuries and fatalities, targeting messages to staff on topics beyond work related risks, and looking for new ways to maintain engagement. These goals are outlined in SMUD’s Safety Road Map, which was last updated in 2023.

**Safety Management System (SMS)**  
During the first half of 2024, Optimization of Benchmark Gensuite, SMUD’s Safety Management System (SMS) continued. AI functionalities within SMS were explored and are currently being piloted in the ergo evaluation application. Supervisor employee interactions were a targeted focus with office personnel. Forms were updated and new forms created to insure that frequently performed tasks are being observed during these interactions. A new incident type and log was created in the Incident & Measurements application to meet the new OSHA regulation on Workplace Violence. Enhancements to the Sustainability, ACE Forms, Concern Report and ATS application have been implemented to better align with SMUD’s processes and Core Competencies. Electronic tailboards continue to be enhanced with human performance (HP) being utilized in the process. New projects and process improvements continue to evolve with increased utilization and visibility among the workforces.

**Safety Standards Development**  
The Safety Team continues our ongoing process of updating SMUD’s Health & Safety Standards, as a foundation and in support of the organization’s World Class Safety initiatives. The Core Standards Team has been utilizing the same routing process as the Sacramento Power Academy, through SharePoint. This process has proven positive to bringing updates and new Standards to completion.

The Standards Team has also been working on the implementation of new regulatory requirements, including:
- Workplace Violence Prevention Plan (CA Labor Code 6401.7 and 6401.9), added to the Injury & Illness Prevention Program, as Appendix B; and

![Board Monitoring Report - SD-6, Safety Leadership](https://example.com/image.png)

Information on the additional regulatory requirements and how SMUD leadership and employees should respond to these potential safety situations, to prevent incidents, will continue to be provided to all SMUD personnel in various formats, including Safety Meetings, ENN's, on-site electronic monitors, drop-in meetings, and Safety Training.

**Supervisor-Employee Interactions**  
Safety continues to strengthen the quality of the supervisor-employee interaction program by improving inspections and moving the process to the Safety Management System (SMS). Emphasis is placed on field visits for work with the highest hazard potential. Team Members continued visiting various crews throughout SMUD, to assist with employee safety concerns, processes, procedures, and equipment. For office personnel, an emphasis is placed on observing personnel pertaining to ergonomic risk, and slip/trip/fall hazards in walking areas. Eleven Q&A sessions were completed to support business units and leaders, navigate SMS ACE Forms and data mining reports to stay on top of their progress. Safety staff scheduled director level meetings where leaders received step by step tutorials, targets where established and the SMS Supervisor Employee interactions process was discussed. During the first half of 2024, a total of 3,418 Supervisor-Employee interactions were complete which resulted in 164% percentage observed.

**Near Miss and Positive Observation/Good Catch Reporting**  
Leadership continues to support and encourage near miss and positive observation/good catch reporting. The goal of this process is to identify opportunities for learning, prior to an incident occurring. During the first two quarters of 2024, 92 near miss and positive observation/good catch reports have been reported and recorded in the Safety Management System (SMS). Seventy-two have been recorded using the Concern Reporting application and 20 in Incident & Measurements application.

**4. Challenges**  
**Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs)**  
The SMUD Safety Team continues to partner with business units to reduce all WMSD's. In this hybrid Awards work environment, Safety continues to conduct Ergonomic evaluations in the office, field, and virtually for remote workers, to meet the needs of the workforce. Safety continues to consult with a Board-Certified Professional Ergonomist and other soft tissue injury reduction specialists to review opportunities for improvements of our Ergonomics Program, such as using AI technology for assessments and data collection. The Field Ergo Committee has been actively engaging with substation, field metering and hazmat crews conducting ergonomic assessments of various work tasks. Safety and Substation leadership partnered with ergo experts to initiate a strength and physical condition pilot program with the Substation Apprentices; results have been favorable.

**5. Recommendation**  
SMUD is committed to becoming a recognized leader in safety. Both SMUD’s leadership team and employees recognize that to achieve success we must integrate safety into all that we do. It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD-6.

6. Appendices - World Class Safety Program Improvements & Supporting Information

**Safety for Life**  
Safety and Environmental Day is on track for the second year since COVID. The event will be held at Safety Center’s Safetyville in October and welcomes all SMUD employees and their families. It will be Harvest theme with haystacks and plenty of decorations, kids are encouraged to dress up. Some of the events will be pedestrian safety, bicycle safety, and a CPR class along with multiple vendors and SMUD booths like CalTrans, SCORCH, Fleet Feet, Environmental team, Sac Metro Fire, and much more!

Sparky’s Crew continues to get families involved in safety by sending safety postcards and quarterly newsletters to SMUD children enrolled.

Our Safety for Life communications continue. This year we have placed emphasis on doing “About Me’s” for the SMUD Safety team so employees can get to know all of the Safety Team members.

**Driver Safety**  
In 2024 Safety hosted our first driving rodeos for the Line Department. Four of these rodeos took place in April and four in June. The driving rodeo team has two more planned for fall for the Facilities team as well as the Energy Specialist team. A preventable vehicle accident team has been established and reviews SMUD’s PVA’s every two weeks. This team looks for trending data and uses the data during the rodeos to have discussions with the employees and prevent further PVA’s. Safe driving is being emphasized in vehicle reports that are provided to directors and management as they contact for participating business units. The reports capture speeding and as well as seat belt use. Leaders are able to use this information in their interactions to help mitigate unsafe driving behaviors as well as reinforce safe driving behaviors. Modifications to the report continue to be made based on feedback from leaders and their business unit.

SMITH training continues to be provided to new hires, as well as existing employees due for refresher, continuing to elevate their driving performance. This is performed with internal trainers and SMITH instructors alike. The Safety team also trained additional leadership under E&O to perform driving-based SCORCH observations on their staff, adding value and focus to their observations.

Messaging in the form of highly visible banners continues to be installed in the Yard at ECOC, while opportunities for HQ Campus and Fresh Pond are under evaluation. These banners offer simple, straightforward reminders of key safe driving behaviors where they matter most – visible to our drivers while in the vehicle. Messaging in regular safety meetings has been tailored to target specific trends observed in internal accident data. Meanwhile, the safe driving decal refresh project is ongoing in collaboration with Fleet.

**Workplace Violence**  
SMUD Health and Safety team collaborated with PS&S, Security and the PMO staff to refresh the Workplace Violence Prevention Plan (WVPP) to meet new SB-553 and Cal/OSHA requirements. A few significant changes include:
- Workplace Violence Specialist (working title), which is supported by Security, PS&S and H&S.
- Incorporated in SMUD’s Safety Management System a Violence Incident Log. 

GM 24-144  
Board Monitoring Report - SD-6, Safety Leadership  
Page 6 of 11
<!-- Page 24 -->
- Learning & Development created LMS training to build awareness throughout the organization.

COVID-19 Support  
The safety of our employees is of utmost importance, so we continue to perform contact tracing and ensure employees report SMUD COVID-19 cases. As they are reported a dedicated team ensures that state requirements are followed. The Cal-OSHA Emergency Temporary Standard is sunsetting in February of 2025, and SMUD Safety, People, Services, & Strategies, along with Communications have updated the COVID-19 guidance to meet regulation changes within the Cal-OSHA Emergency Temporary Standard as the regulation is nearing sunsetting. Our third-party vendor Axiom Medical continues to provide staff with illness leave guidance. Our process continues to be followed and has prevented large outbreaks or work stoppages to critical areas of operations.

Wildfire Smoke  
In April of 2023, the HRO Safety Team reviewed the Health & Safety Standard for Wildfire Smoke for any gaps and collaborated with other work groups to ensure any necessary equipment, to reduce employee exposures were available and ready to deploy. In addition, there was a review and update of the Wildfire Smoke Training to ensure field crew members received information on how to access resources, should a Wildfire Smoke event occur. The training was delivered to all field crew personnel in June 2024. Examples of resources available to SMUD employees are: the use of the Purple Air monitoring system, in cab vehicle HEPA air filters, PPE, and scheduling. This year, to date, we have had 1 day of notifications. This was only an air quality status report due to a local fire that had broke out. AQI threshold did not exceed 150. Staff is also researching new wildfire smoke applications such as Watch Duty, which can help track fire that impact our infrastructure and field personnel.

Fire Retardant Clothing  
All employees who work on or around energized equipment are allotted a yearly FR Clothing allowance to ensure they are adequately protected. To ensure employees have access to clothing which meets the Arc Flash requirements of SMUD equipment and the latest FR material technologies to improve their level of comfort in various types of weather conditions (i.e., storms, cold, rain, or heat), Safety works with the FR Vendor, to host an annual review (in the Fall) of the latest offerings from the top FR Clothing Manufacturers and a sample of affected SMUD employees, for input. Safety is in process of scheduling this annual review. New employees of the electrical trades will receive FR Clothing Training by a Safety Representative to ensure employee is added to the FR Clothing portal and is apprised of the proper care and maintenance of their clothing.

Joint Labor Management Safety Committees  
Hydro JLMSC – Advanced First Responder training was completed to comply with Cal/OSHA standards regarding the administration of breathing air and stop-bleeding apparatus. Confined Space Rescue training has been completed amongst the field staff to ensure prompt response to any confined space rescue needs. Loon Lake Machine Hall evacuation procedure has been finalized and will be followed up with the production of a training video as well as evacuation exercises.

Line Assets JLMSC – A variety of safety improvements are in progress or already completed through the Line Assets JLMSC. Key improvements to highlight are: 1) Partnership between Line, Warehouse and Safety to update the inventory of Trauma Bags, including inspecting
<!-- Page 25 -->
![Board Monitoring Report - SD-6, Safety Leadership](https://example.com/image.png)

current trauma bags, replacing expired materials and adding in new products such as splints and tourniquets. 2) Partnership between Line, Public Safety and Communications to develop a communication plan with customers to highlight the importance of maintaining clear access to SMUD equipment on customer properties for both customer reliability and safety of our employees. 3) Line, Safety and Telecom partnered to identify a solution to a communication issue during Helicopter operations. Solution has been identified and is currently in the process of being funded, purchased and built.

**Substation JLMSC** – A Substation emergency response procedure was established and implemented. Tabletop and on-site exercises were conducted with both the work group personnel and the Emergency Preparedness Team to verify validity of this procedure and process.

**Safely Conducted Observations Reduce Common Hazards (SCORCH)**

**Observation Engagement & Behavior Trends**  
For the first half of 2024, a total of 2471 employees were observed under the Office & Professional process. Head/Neck Posture was both the top safe and at-risk behavior for this time frame. Risk Reduction Reminders are moving the needle in a positive direction. Validated in moving from a 2nd half at-risk rating of 28.5% in 2023 to a 1st half rating of 22% in 2024. Resulting in a total behavior reduction rating of 6.5%. Guidance was provided for elevating awareness on Mondays and in the AM hours of the workday based on data analytics. Monitor distance and height tips combined with job aids for adjusting font and display settings are also proving to be effective. Reminders were shared in monthly Safety for Life meetings, along with providing newly created leadership specific messaging that could be inserted into employee one-on-one safety interactions/conversations, and small team meetings.

A total of 1854 field employees under the Electrical Trades and CFAS process were observed for the 1st half of 2024. Observation feedback displayed the consistency in which Hand Protection was worn, making it the top observed safe behavior. Observation feedback highlighted the consistency in which employees took steps for minimizing exposure by wearing the proper type of glove per task, importance of proactively testing and making sure gloves are free of holes and tears. Opportunity for improvement was related to the top at-risk behavior of Knee Protection/Ergo Mat. Employees displayed a low perception of risk and awareness for potential soft-tissue related injury when performing kneeling/ground contacting task. Risk Reduction Reminders stressed the benefits of providing the knees a cushioned working surface no matter the frequency or duration. Though most employees use the ergo mat, the use of knee pads (attached to the body) was recommended to reduce leaving the kneeling mat behind in the truck and/or the lack of willingness for dragging it from location to location. Tips for considering knee pads as “shoes for the knees” spoke to the health benefits of how knee padding is designed to distribute pressure across the entire knee area, as well as to absorb some of the impact associated with moving around, shifting weight when changing positions or “walking” on your knees. We anticipate this behavior to trend and a positive fashion over the upcoming quarters.

**SCORCH Behavior Influencing Highlights:**
- **Internal Engagement** – After attending DEKRA’s 2024 National Safety in Action Conference in April. Committee members held a two-day (In-person/virtual) SCORCH Mini Conference to share lessons learned. A total of 12 presentations were provided to all employees highlighting personal ownership and awareness for working safely. Topic

![Board Monitoring Report - SD-6, Safety Leadership](https://example.com/image-url)

- **Timely Process Updates** – Digital monitors installed in the Substations and Field Metering departments are used to provide specific information related to the number of current and year-to-date observations completed. Top trending safe and at-risk behaviors, along with Risk Reduction Reminders. This visible platform for leveraging and broadcasting the real-time data capabilities of the Safety Management System has been positively received. This allows for more proactive behavior adjustments to be made within the month/quarter versus the reactionary sharing of the data primarily in safety meetings. The success of this process pivot has garnered the attention and request by additional departments to install safety themed monitors. SCORCH is extremely excited and believes this will be a highly effective tool for maintaining a seeded level of engagement, self-ownership for working safely and continuous education.

- **Safety RoadMap Alignment** – SCORCH continues to partner with the High-Risk Operations team and Safety Management System (SMS) app lead, Jackie Raemes to insert behavior-based safety examples and definitions into traditional safety investigation practices. The investigation templates for both vehicle (PVA’s) and (injury) incidents, have been updated to include a CBI (Critical Behavior Inventory) behavioral selection option. This will enhance the supervisors and investigators behavior identification ability, the extraction of specific job task behaviors. This will also allow us to generate historical and trending vehicle and injury incident data for both participating and non-participating work groups. This will prove to be one of the most effective ways in which SCORCH displays its flexibility and willingness to make process modifications to allow for greater utilization of its principles, taking bold steps to performing at a World-Class safety level.

- **External/Community Engagement** – SCORCH with its 23 years of behavior influencing success was asked to present and provide its behavior-based best practice share at multiple safety events. This encompassed presentations at the DEKRA, Safety in Action Conference, (ASSP) American Society of Safety Professionals and the Region IX (VPPPA) Voluntary Protection Program Participants Association, Safety Summit. Presentations highlight the creative ways in which behavior awareness can expand beyond the workplace and easily inserted into employees at-home and at-play environments. This displays SMUD’s cultural commitment to Safety for Life and behavior-based safety as a lifestyle choice that intentionally engages family and friends.

![Confined Space Rescue](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Confined+Space+Rescue)

**Confined Space Rescue**  
SMUD’s Confined Space Rescue program has expanded to include more robust training and support for field forces and safety trainers alike. These improvements help our field forces to be better equipped to both prevent and respond to real-world emergency situations.

During Bundled Training, field forces receive hands-on practice with entries and mock-rescue scenarios, specific to SMUD’s confined spaces. This was expanded to include additional groups who had not previously received this level of training. Additionally, these scenarios are undergoing review to maximize training value and consistency. Improvements were also made to SMUD’s confined space rescue equipment inspection, maintenance, and tracking operation this year. The rescue equipment necessary to perform this work was inspected by the manufacturer, Toolroom’s inventory was updated to include in-service equipment, and additional equipment was purchased to meet the evolving needs of our field forces.

In Q2, the Safety team also leveraged existing relationships with local confined space rescue contractors to ensure all SMUD field forces have access to these services. This has primarily benefited the Substations group and their transformer entry operations. Safety collaborated with one of these contractors and developed an updated rescue plan. As a result, the Safety department is prepared to deliver this complex training and provide related support to field forces on an as-needed basis. Simultaneously, Safety explored the use of new technologies to allow semi-remote inspection of transformer components, which reduces employee risk exposure by eliminating the need for entry into a high-risk environment.

With Hydro Operations consisting of multiple remote locations, employees from various work groups have undergone Non-Entry Confined Space Rescue training in order to provide prompt rescue services in-house. Along with this initial training, an annual refresher and real-life scenario mock rescue will occur. Rescue equipment upgrades and additions are underway, including an enclosed trailer dedicated to CSE Rescue equipment to ensure efficient mobilization.

**Heat Illness**  
SMUD continues to identify heat as one of the main hazards our employees face during the hot summer months. SMUD continues to train field-based employees each year on the signs/symptoms of heat illness, appropriate measures to reduce the potential for heat illness, as well as how to respond appropriately in the event of a heat-related emergency. SMUD’s tool room continues to offer a variety of solutions to combat working in the heat, including: water, ice, coolers, electrolyte supplements for water, portable shade structures, shade visors for hard hats.

The Network/Underground work group purchased and deployed an additional cooling trailer unit that can be used to provide both confined space ventilation as well as cooling of the air inside hot underground facilities during summer months. This reduces potential heat stress to the employees and allows for a safer work environment.

**Medical Monitoring**  
With the departure of our Onsite Medical Services provider EOMC, the health and safety team has begun migrating services to new vendors. This has included the use of onsite “pop-up clinics” to limit the need for SMUD employees to travel to off-site clinics. SMUD is working with the new vendors to migrate applicable records as well as set up dashboards that will be used to track employee seen for Medical Monitoring. Health and Safety will continue throughout.

3) Additional Supporting Information  
Project Implementation: SMUD’s Research and Development team has the primary responsibility of meeting SD-10; however, notable innovation occurs throughout SMUD.  

Electric Transportation (ET)  
Transportation electrification improves air quality and reduces net greenhouse gas emissions and petroleum consumption to support energy sustainability, while creating new revenue streams for SMUD. This strategy is supported through investigation of mitigation of grid impacts due to charging, improvement of electric vehicles (EV) value via pricing signals and remote controls, increased EV adoption and access to charging. SMUD is specifically exploring multiple opportunities to expand our understanding of managed charging (V1G) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) capabilities, applications, and implications.  

Key Achievements:  
- SMUD has the eFuel program ready to deploy EV chargers to underserved multi-family homes as part of the ChargeReady Community project, a $2.23M California Energy Commission REACH grant awarded to SMUD in 2022. Final agreement execution with Mutual Housing will enable construction to begin later this year.  
- The Del Paso Mobility Hub (three level 2 and one DC fast charger) started public operations in October 2023. Based on two quarterly reports received so far, project economics rely heavily on grant funding for long term viability. Majority of revenue is from DCFC utilization (mostly by drivers coming from the freeway nearby).  
- The Residential Managed EV Charging pilot has enrolled over 1,200 vehicles from Tesla, GM, Ford and BMW. Early results show modest load impacts. Staff are working with the evaluator to refine the analysis estimating success of pilot in reducing future transformer overloads.  
- SMUD was awarded $2.9 million by the California Energy Commission to deliver the FAST grant, deploying 150+kW fast chargers at the Sacramento International Airport, Sacramento Valley Amtrak Station and Sacramento State University. These stations offer public charging at an affordable rate for all users and further discounts for rideshare drivers, ensuring access to public charging at rates comparable to charging. The chargers will be in areas where rideshare drivers already wait and queue for fares, reducing deadhead trips. Additionally, these chargers will be located in public lots, requiring no additional access fees.  
- The CEC BESTFIT grant with the Twin Rivers Unified School District (TRUSD) aims to evaluate the effectiveness of managed charging (V1G) and V2G capabilities of electric school buses and light duty vehicles to balance impacts on customer and utility electrical distribution infrastructure and create value through grid services. Targeted use cases include reduced grid impacts, reduced customer infrastructure costs, wholesale cost avoidance. The site is expected to be fully operational, reporting valid usage data and controlling charging by late September 2024, pending a firmware upgrade for some of the chargers onsite. SMUD and FordPro plan to begin use case testing in late September, running through the end of 2024.

<!-- Page 33 -->
- Continued collaboration with TEPCO, Fermata, and Nissan includes demonstration of V2G on SMUD’s campus using Fermata FE-20 bidirectional charger and SMUD’s fleet Nissan Leaf. This charger is UL certified with endorsement by Nissan that it does not void their vehicle warranty. The vehicle charge and discharge can successfully be scheduled via API. Third-party optimization in response to price signals had some unexpected results. Staff is working through the analysis.

**Energy Efficiency (EE) & Electric Buildings (EB)**  
This program area optimizes energy delivery costs and improves grid asset utilization through targeted, time-specific energy efficiency and building electrification as well as by capturing permanent outcomes in building codes. R&D explores emerging and underutilized technologies; working to lower barriers to technology adoption.

**Key Achievements:**
- Phase 2 of the Home Infrastructure Planning project commenced, developing a model to estimate load profiles for single family residential customers after full electrification. Work will continue this year to expand the model to better represent SMUD’s full single family residential population, which will help distribution planners and customers make optimal decisions regarding utility service upgrades supporting residential electrification.

**Load Flexibility**  
This program supports cost-effective, reliable, scalable flexible resource growth to serve future grid needs. R&D determines functional, operational and market viability of flexible loads to align supply and demand, give customers bill management options, improve air quality, and reduce carbon emissions.

**Key Achievements:**
- SMUD funded the New Buildings Institute and Lawrence Berkley National lab to recruit from the 32 - 120V Heat Pump Water Heater (HPWH) installations statewide last year to test the use of CTA-2045 modules for price and load response. Technical difficulty prevented the Advanced Load Up command from functioning properly, however the Load Up command still shifted 39% of HPWH load away from utility peak periods, resulting in average utility bill savings of 24% of HPWH consumption costs.
- Phase 3 DERMS features to enable market and distribution-based operation of DERs have been implemented, integrated, and tested in coordination with flexible heat pump water heaters under the PowerMinder pilot program. In anticipation of Phase 3 go-live in Q4 2024, stakeholder discussions are underway to identify DERMS enabled processes for shared visibility into DER operations by distribution and bulk system operators. The operational processes include coordination with planning stakeholders to recognize avoided long-term costs, displaced by flexible DERs.
- Smart inverters allow utilities to monitor residential PV and storage (potentially as an alternative to generation submeters) and provide control functionality to assist in grid support. This project will test smart inverter connection via two pathways: direct connection and through vendors/aggregators. Data analysis was completed for the Direct Connection pathway, which used the IEEE 2030.5-CSIP protocol successfully in GM 24-144 Board Monitoring Report: SD-10, Innovation Page 3 of 11.

the majority of tests without issue. There remain some interoperability issues that hopefully will largely be fixed in the next 3.0 update. The Vendor/Aggregator pathway has gone through lab testing with an IEEE 2030.5-CSIP server and will start customer testing by Q4 2024. Direct connection will assist in development of the DERMS, while the vendor/aggregator pathway will leverage OEM and aggregator relationships to establish pilot access agreements to a broader range of smart inverters.

**Thermal Transition**  
R&D pursues innovative grid, storage and generation solutions to facilitate SMUD’s goal of zero carbon by 2030 and accelerate interconnection of grid-connected systems and devices to ensure safe and efficient operation. This program supports system reliability and reducing emissions through alignment of DERs and zero-carbon generation with grid needs. It seeks to improve grid reliability through reduced outage frequency and duration; control of the distribution system, voltage and frequency variations, and overload conditions; and optimize grid benefits of DERs through advancing integration standards and coordinated automation.

**Key Achievements:**
- The ESS Phase 1 demonstration will deploy 4 MW / 30 MWh of Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) iron flow batteries. This project will compare the reliability and uptimes of LDES and Lithium-Ion batteries as part of SMUD’s partnership with ESS. Two ESS battery models will be tested: the Energy Warehouse and Energy Center. Site Acceptance Testing (SAT) and troubleshooting continues to be in progress for the 6 Energy Warehouses deployed. SMUD was awarded a $10 million grant from the California Energy Commission to test 3.6 MW of the Energy Center product as part of the ESS Phase 1 demonstration. Preliminary design of the Energy Center build is in process in preparation for the Engineering Procurement and Construction solicitation.
- Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) and Green Hydrogen remain the leading alternative fuel candidates to convert and decarbonize thermal generation fleet operations longer term. SMUD continues to be engaged in the CEC Hydrogen Blending grant led by UCLA and the DOE Hyblend grant led by NREL. SMUD is pursuing participation in Phase 2 of the DOE Hyblend grant.

**Climate Change**  
This program provides technical, economic, and policy expertise on climate change and impacts to SMUD territory. It compliments SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan and aligns with our board direction to address climate vulnerabilities, and we partner with our customers and community on mitigation opportunities and regenerative, net positive projects.

**Key Achievements:**
- Carbon Farming and Ecosystem Service Research is a four-year study aiming to restore California prairie and native pollinator habitat under PV panels and in surrounding perimeter areas at Rancho Seco II. In its second year, the project completed a second native pollinator seeding within the panels, installed a half mile of hedgerow with native

| Building Electrification  | 67  | St. Francis Manor Central HPWH Study | SMUD staff monitored the performance and benefits of converting a gas powered (boiler) domestic hot water system to a heat pump water heater (HPWH) driven system and found that primarily due to incorrect flows/piping of the water flow and the addition of a kitchen, there was insufficient hot water throughout the whole year for the tenants/kitchen. However, solutions have been identified (adjust the direction of the water flow and install a dedicated HPWH for the kitchen) to meet the customer's needs and deem this project as a successful option for businesses to electrify. | Prior to the addition of an unplanned commercial kitchen, the impacts of the original water heater electrification project were as follows: Estimated savings of $2,233 annual energy cost saving (20%) compared to gas boiler (54% reduction in CO2 emissions). Conclusion: HPWH system is a cost-effective replacement for any building that already uses a central water heater. | 4/1/2021  | 9/30/2023  | 5    |

## Community Choice Aggregator Detail

Community Choice Aggregation. In 2002, Assembly Bill 117 was passed to establish Community Choice Aggregation in the State by authorizing Community Choice Aggregators (“CCAs”) to aggregate customer electric load and purchase electricity for customers. SMUD sees the growth of CCAs as an opportunity to support organizations with values closely aligned with SMUD’s values, while also generating additional revenue for SMUD. CCA programs are proliferating in the State thanks to support for expanding renewable energy use and desire for local control particularly for electricity procurement. There are numerous CCAs operating in the State, and more are anticipated to launch in the future. CCAs are responsible for procuring wholesale power, setting the generation rate, and staffing a call center to handle opt-outs and questions about the power portfolio. The local investor-owned utility (“IOU”) continues to deliver electricity from the electric grid, maintain its electric infrastructure, bill customers and collect payments.

In October 2017, SMUD contracted with Valley Clean Energy (“VCE”). VCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the City of Woodland, the City of Davis and Yolo County to implement a local CCA program. The service territory expanded to include the City of Winters in 2021.

In February 2018, SMUD contracted with Ava Community Energy (“Ava” formerly East Bay Community Energy). Ava is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Oakland, Piedmont, San Leandro and Union City in Alameda County to implement a local CCA.

**WHEREAS**, the proposed services leverage the systems and services already in place for VCE, Ava and MCE, which contribute to increased net revenue for SMUD and economies of scale in our CCA service offerings; and

**WHEREAS**, the Municipal Utility District Act (MUD Act) grants SMUD broad authority to provide services related to light, heat, and power, and take all acts necessary and convenient for the full exercise of the powers therein; and

**WHEREAS**, the MUD Act authorizes SMUD to provide competitive services and commodities within or outside of our service territory; and

**WHEREAS**, providing services to SCP to meet their energy objectives is a valid exercise of SMUD’s authority; and

**WHEREAS**, SMUD will ensure that our financial viability, internal operations, and customer service portfolio are not adversely affected by providing SCP services; NOW, THEREFORE,

**BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT:**

**Section 1.** The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his designee, is authorized to enter into a contract with the Sonoma Clean Power (SCP) to provide Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) data management and other services.

**Bundled Energy + RECs**

This Transaction Confirmation (this “Confirmation”) is entered into this 4th day of October, 2024 (“Effective Date”), by and between Sanborn 2 PV I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“S2PVI”), and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”), each referred to herein individually as a “Party” and collectively as the “Parties”, regarding the purchase and sale of the Products defined below under the terms and conditions herein. Additional definitions are included under the “Definitions / Interpretations” section below. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Master Agreement (as such term is defined below).

## Transaction:

**Seller:**  
S2PVI  

**Buyer:**  
SMUD  

**Master Agreement:**  
The Edison Electric Institute Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement between the Parties, dated as of September 30th, 2024 (collectively, the “Master Agreement”). In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Confirmation and the terms of the Master Agreement, the terms of this Confirmation shall prevail with respect to the Transactions evidenced by this Confirmation.

**Project:**  
Seller’s Sanborn 2 PV I solar project located in Mojave, California, in County, California, which has or will be certified by the CEC as an ERR, as that term is defined below, and as more particularly described in Exhibit 1.

**Transactions:**  
Throughout the Delivery Period, so long as no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default shall have occurred with respect to Buyer, Buyer shall be the exclusive purchaser of and hereby agrees to purchase the Products (but excluding any and all Excess Products, Storage Products, ancillary services, capacity attributes, or Resource Adequacy Capacity (as such term is defined in the Tariff)).

**Scheduled COD:**  
January 1, 2027, subject to extension on a day-for-day basis, up to 180 days in the aggregate, for each day that Commercial Operation of at least the Minimum Contract Capacity is delayed due to an event of Force Majeure.

**Guaranteed COD:**  
March 31, 2027, subject to extension on a day-for-day basis, up to 180 days in the aggregate, for each day that Commercial Operation of at least the Minimum Contract Capacity is delayed due to an event of Force Majeure.

**Delivery Period:**

**Failure to Achieve COD:**

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Confirmation or the Master Agreement to the contrary, Seller’s failure to achieve Commercial Operation of at least ninety percent (90%) of the full Contract Capacity (“Minimum Contract Capacity”) by the Scheduled COD shall result in payment of liquidated damages (“Delay Damages”) to Buyer equal to $150 per MW of Contract Capacity per day for each MW portion that is less than the Minimum Contract Capacity, to be adjusted daily as installed capacity of the Project achieves Commercial Operation (if applicable). The aggregate Delay Damages shall not exceed the amount of Seller’s Credit Support.

If the Project fails to achieve Commercial Operation of at least the Minimum Contract Capacity on or prior to the Guaranteed COD, then Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its sole discretion to terminate this Agreement by providing notice of termination to Seller, provided that such termination right shall expire once the Project achieves Commercial Operation of at least the Minimum Contract Capacity. If the Scheduled COD and Guaranteed COD have been extended for 180 days due to Force Majeure and Seller’s ability to achieve Commercial Operation of at least the Minimum Contract Capacity continues to be delayed due to Force Majeure, then either Party may terminate this Agreement by providing notice of termination to the other Party, provided that such termination right shall expire once the Project achieves Commercial Operation of at least the Minimum Contract Capacity. Upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to this “Failure to Achieve COD” section, neither Party shall have any financial or other liability to the other Party arising out of such termination, except that Seller may pay Buyer liquidated damages in the amount of three million eighty-two thousand dollars ($3,082,000), minus the aggregate amount of any Delay Damages previously paid by Seller (“Pre-COD Termination Damages”) within ten (10) Business Days after such termination; provided, however, that Seller will not be required to pay the Pre-COD Termination Damages in connection with such termination if Seller’s ability to achieve Commercial Operation of at least the Minimum Contract Capacity has been delayed by more than 180 days due to Force Majeure. Receipt of the Pre-COD Termination Damages is Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedy, and Seller’s sole and exclusive liability, for any failure of Seller to achieve Commercial Operation of at least the Minimum Contract Capacity on or prior to the Guaranteed COD or to achieve Commercial Operation at all. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event will Seller’s aggregate liability under this Agreement prior to achieving Commercial Operation of at least the Minimum Contract Capacity exceed the amount of the Pre-COD Termination Damages.

**Delivery Point:**

CAISO PNode assigned to the Project by the CAISO, or, for Replacement Product, the CAISO PNode assigned to the generating facility providing the Replacement Product.

**Scheduling:**

Seller or Seller’s designee will perform all scheduling requirements as may be applicable to the Energy portion of the Product. Such scheduling will be performed consistent with the Tariff.
<!-- Page 68 -->
![PART 1 – ENERGY AND REC DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=PART+1+%E2%80%93+ENERGY+AND+REC+DELIVERY+OBLIGATIONS)

**RPS Product:** As used herein, “Product” shall mean Energy produced by the Project and delivered to the Delivery Point, simultaneously bundled with the Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”) associated with such Energy (as evidenced by WREGIS Certificates) under the Applicable Program.

**Applicable Program:** State of California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program (hereinafter referred to as “California RPS”, “Renewables Portfolio Standards” or “RPS Program”), as codified at California Public Utilities Code Section 399.11, et seq.

**Contract Capacity:** 46 MW

**Minimum Annual Contract Quantity:** For each Contract Year during the Delivery Period, the amount set forth as the Minimum Annual Contract Quantity for such year in Schedule A, provided, however, that if a Contract Year is less than a full calendar year, then the Minimum Annual Contract Quantity for such Contract Year shall be automatically revised to equal the product of (a) the original volume set forth in Schedule A for such Contract Year, multiplied by (b) the quotient of the total number of days included in such Contract Year, divided by 365 days.

**Maximum Annual Contract Quantity:** For each Contract Year during the Delivery Period, the amount set forth as the Maximum Annual Contract Quantity for such year in Schedule A.

**Contract Quantity:** For each Contract Year during the Delivery Period, Seller shall deliver to Buyer one hundred percent (100%) of the Product produced by the Project, but not to exceed the Maximum Annual Contract Quantity for such Contract Year (the “Annual Contract Quantity”). Given the intermittent nature of the resource, Buyer understands the actual volume of delivered Product may vary; provided however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (a) Seller shall, as Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedy, pay LDs as provided in the Damages section below if the Annual Contract Quantity is lower than the Minimum Annual Contract Quantity, and (b) once the Product produced by the Project in a given Contract Year equals the Maximum Annual Contract Quantity for such Contract Year, with respect to any Product subsequently produced by the Project in excess of the Maximum Annual Contract Quantity in such Contract Year (“Excess Product”), Seller shall have the right to sell such Excess Product to one or more third parties and to retain any associated revenue.

**REC Vintage Period:** The vintage period of RECs shall correspond to the calendar year in which the Energy component of the Product or Replacement Product, as applicable, is delivered.

**Contract Price:** The price for each MWh of Product or Replacement Product delivered to Buyer (the “Contract Price”) shall consist of the Energy Price and the REC Price, calculated as follows:

**Contract Price = Energy Price + REC Price**

where:
<!-- Page 69 -->
```
“Energy Price” shall mean the applicable Locational Marginal Price (as such term is defined in the Tariff) for Energy delivered at the applicable Delivery Point per MWh determined in accordance with the procedures and rules of the California ISO; and

“REC Price” shall mean ______ per MWh (i.e., per REC) for the Product conveyed to Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Confirmation.

Seller shall retain the revenue received by Seller or the Scheduling Coordinator (as such term is defined in the Tariff) for the Project from CAISO for the Energy component of the Product or Replacement Product, in full satisfaction of Buyer’s payment obligation for the Energy Price component of the Product or Replacement Product, as applicable. The Parties acknowledge that such CAISO revenues retained by Seller may be greater than or less than the revenues that would have resulted based on the Energy Price published by the CAISO. For avoidance of doubt, Buyer’s net payment obligation for delivered Product or Replacement Product under this Transaction is ______ per MWh.

Settlements and Payment:
Seller shall deliver the Product by (i) delivering Energy from the Project to the California ISO on behalf of Buyer at the Delivery Point in accordance with the California ISO requirements and procedures and (ii) transferring the RECs by transferring the associated WREGIS Certificates and associated NERC e-Tags (if applicable) through WREGIS, to Buyer’s designated WREGIS account(s) maintained by Buyer, at Buyer’s sole cost and expense. California ISO shall pay the Energy Price directly to Seller for the Energy portion of the Product in accordance with the California ISO requirements and procedures and Buyer shall not be required to pay such amount to Seller. Buyer shall pay the REC Price to Seller no later than ten (10) Days following receipt of Seller’s invoice subsequent to the transfer of the RECs by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this Confirmation. Seller may invoice any time after it transfers such RECs to Buyer.

Damages:
With respect to any Contract Year after the first Contract Year, if the quantity of RECs associated with Energy for such Contract Year that is delivered to Buyer by the date that is one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of the applicable Contract Year plus Seller-Excused Energy during such Contract Year is less than the Minimum Annual Contract Quantity for such Contract Year, Seller shall at its option either replace such shortfall through PCCI-qualifying resources (“Replacement RECs”) by the date that is one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of the then-current Contract Year from other resources or pay Buyer liquidated damages (“LDs”) equal to the product of A and B, where:

A = the positive difference, if any, of: Minimum Annual Contract Quantity for such Contract Year – (RECs delivered + Seller-Excused Energy + Replacement RECs delivered for such Contract Year)

B = the positive difference, if any, of: the Replacement RECs Value for the applicable Contract Year – REC Price for such Contract Year

“Seller-Excused Energy” means the Energy that the Project could have produced but did not due to (i) events of Force Majeure at the Project or Delivery Point, (ii) periods during which generation or transmission is curtailed or interrupted for system emergencies, reliability, congestion, over-generation or any other reason not caused by the action or inaction of Seller, (iii) Buyer’s Event of Default, and/or (iv) the implementation of 50 hours of Planned Outages and/or Off-Peak Opportunity RA Maintenance Outages (as such term is defined in the Tariff) per Contract Year. For the purposes of calculating Seller-Excused Energy, Seller-Excused
```
<!-- Page 70 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Energy shall be based on Seller’s reasonable forecast of the Energy that could have been produced by the Project if not for the Seller-Excused Energy event, to consider solar insolation, Project availability, and all other reasonable variables.

**Replacement RECs:**

**Value:**  
The price per REC at which Buyer, acting reasonably, can purchase Replacement RECs, will not exceed $50.00 per MWh. For avoidance of doubt, Replacement RECs may be from other renewable resources.

**Contract Year:**  
Each calendar year, or fraction thereof, during the Delivery Period, provided, that the first Contract Year shall commence on the first day of the Delivery Period and end on December 31, 2027 and the last Contract Year shall commence on January 1, 2034 and end on December 31, 2034.

**REC Delivery:**  
Seller shall deliver and convey the applicable RECs to SMUD by transferring, via WREGIS to the account designated by SMUD, the WREGIS Certificates within five (5) Business Days after the WREGIS certificates are created. The transfer shall be made in accordance with the rules and regulations of WREGIS. Buyer acknowledges that certification under WREGIS requires, among other things, WREGIS be notified that the Project has achieved commercial operations and Seller shall notify WREGIS of the same. The Parties acknowledge that the creation and delivery of the WREGIS Certificates associated with the Product or Replacement Product, as applicable, may occur after the Energy has been delivered and invoiced, therefore the invoice may contain charges for Energy and WREGIS Certificates which were not generated in the same month(s).

**Data Reports:**  
After the end of each quarter during the Delivery Period, Seller shall promptly provide Buyer with meter data from the Project relating to the Energy portion of the Product delivered to Buyer when available (but not later than the twentieth (20th) Business Day after the end of the applicable quarter). Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep and maintain any other documentation supporting claims of production, delivery, and transfer of the Product delivered to Buyer and shall provide it to Buyer as may be required for Buyer to meet Applicable Program requirements as may be reasonably requested by Buyer.

**Change in Law Provisions:**  
In the event of a Change in Law in the designated Applicable Program, the Parties shall make commercially reasonable efforts to obtain compliance with such Change in Law, provided that Seller shall not be required to spend, together with the aggregate costs incurred by Seller within the scope of Special Provision B(5) below, more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) in documented expenses in any single calendar year or, in the aggregate, more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) in documented expenses after the Effective Date in Seller’s efforts to obtain such compliance (such limits, collectively, the “Change in Law Cost Cap”). Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of its efforts to obtain compliance. If despite such efforts to obtain compliance, including expenditure by Seller of the dollar amounts specified above, Seller cannot obtain compliance:

i. Buyer shall not be liable for damages for failure to accept delivery of the Product if Buyer refuses to accept delivery of the REC after the Change in Law solely due to the Change in Law;
<!-- Page 71 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

ii. Seller shall not be liable for damages for failure to initiate delivery of the Product if Seller is unable to initiate delivery of the REC after the Change in Law solely due to the Change in Law;

iii. Seller shall not be in breach of this Confirmation for a failure to perform caused by such Change in Law; and

iv. either Party shall have the right to terminate this Confirmation in the event of a Change in Law in the designated Applicable Program, and Seller is unable to obtain compliance pursuant to this section. Such termination is effectuated on thirty (30) days’ written notice to the other Party and, provided that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such termination, neither Party shall be liable to the other Party for any damages or costs (including any termination payment) for such early termination, provided that Buyer will remain liable for any unpaid amounts due with respect to RECs delivered prior to such Change in Law.

Notwithstanding the above, the Parties may mutually agree to address the issue of Seller’s inability to obtain compliance, including but not limited to Buyer agreeing to fund additional expenditures by Seller to comply.

Special Provisions:

A. Non-Modifiable Standard Terms and Conditions

(1) Eligibility: Seller, and, if applicable, its successors, represents and warrants, throughout the Delivery Period of this Agreement, that the Project qualifies and is certified by the CEC as an Eligible Renewable Energy Resource (“ERR”) as such term is defined in Public Utilities Code Section 399.12 or Section 399.16. To the extent a Change in Law occurs after execution of this Agreement that causes this representation and warranty to be materially false or misleading, it shall not be an Event of Default if Seller has used commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such Change in Law.

(2) Applicable Law. This Agreement and the rights and duties of the Parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed, enforced, and performed in accordance with the laws of the state of California, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. To the extent enforceable at such time, each Party waives its respective right to any jury trial with respect to any litigation arising under or in connection with this Agreement.

(3) Transfer of Renewable Energy Credits: Seller and, if applicable, its successors, represents and warrants that throughout the Delivery Period of this Agreement the RECs transferred to Buyer conform to the definition and attributes required for compliance with the California Renewables Portfolio Standard, as set forth in California Public Utilities Commission Decision 08-08-028, CEC RPS Guidebook and as may be modified by subsequent decision of the California Public Utilities Commission or CEC, or by subsequent legislation. To the extent a Change in Law occurs after execution of this Agreement that causes this representation and warranty to be materially false or misleading, it shall not be an Event of Default if Seller has used commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such Change in Law in accordance with the Changes in Law Provisions of this Confirmation.

(4) Tracking of RECs in WREGIS: Seller and Buyer each warrants that all necessary steps to allow the RECs transferred to Buyer pursuant to this Confirmation to be tracked in Western Renewable Energy Generation Information System will be taken prior to the first delivery under this Confirmation.

B. Additional Terms and Conditions

(1) Seller Representations and Warranties: Seller represents and warrants at the time of each delivery of Product to SMUD, pursuant to this Confirmation, with respect to such Product that:

(a) Seller has not sold the Product to be transferred to SMUD to any other person or entity;

(b) the Product delivered meets the specifications set forth herein;

(c) the Energy portion of the Product is from the Energy generated by the Project, except with respect to Replacement RECs which Energy shall be sourced from other PCC1-qualifying resources; and

(e) all rights, title and interest in and to the Product are free and clear of any taxes or security interests except for any right or interest by any entity claiming through SMUD.

(2) CEC Certification: Seller shall, promptly upon CEC approval, provide SMUD with a copy of the CEC certification of the Project(s) as eligible for the California Renewables Portfolio Standard under the CEC RPS Guidebook, and for each ERR shall provide the individual FERC ID number, NERC ID, number and EIA ID number.

(3) Review: To monitor compliance with this Confirmation, each Party reserves the right to review during normal business hours and at its own expense, for up to two (2) years following delivery of the RECs under this Confirmation, and with reasonable advance notice to the other Party, information in the possession of the other Party required to verify that the Product sold to Buyer under this Confirmation was not otherwise sold by Seller to a third party.

(4) Clarification of STCs: Without limiting the final sentence of Special Provision A(1) and A(3), it shall also not be an Event of Default if a Change in Law that takes effect after the delivery of any RECs or output from the Project, in each case, under this Confirmation, causes the representation and warranty made with respect to such RECs or output to be materially false or misleading or if such representation or warranty is not correct because the CEC has not yet certified the Project as an ERR.

(5) Green-e Tracking Attestation: During the Delivery Period, Seller shall maintain an approved Tracking Attestation Form on file with the Center for Resource Solutions (or its successor entity) (“CRS”); provided, however, that if there is any change in CRS requirements following the Effective Date for maintaining an approved Tracking Attestation Form on file with CRS, then Seller will only be required to comply with this Special Provision B(5) to the extent it can be achieved at a cost to Seller that, together with the aggregate cost to Seller of all other applicable actions within the scope of the “Change in Law Provisions” section above, is no greater than the Change in Law Cost Cap.

C. Collateral Support Requirements

(1) Seller’s Credit Support. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Effective Date, and ending upon the first date that both the Delivery Period has ended and Seller has satisfied all of its payment obligations due and owing to Buyer under this Agreement, Seller will post or issue and maintain, or cause to be posted or issued and maintained, in favor of Buyer, Credit Support to secure Seller’s obligations under this Agreement; provided, Seller has no obligation to replenish Seller’s Credit Support after any draw on Seller’s Credit Support by Buyer.

(2) Buyer’s Credit Support. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Effective Date, and ending upon the first date that both the Delivery Period has ended and Buyer has satisfied all of its payment obligations due and owing to Seller under this Agreement, for any period in which Buyer is no longer a Creditworthy Entity, Buyer will post or issue and maintain, or cause to be posted or issued and maintained, in favor of Seller, Credit Support to secure Buyer’s obligations under this Agreement; provided, Buyer has no obligation to replenish Buyer’s Credit Support after any draw on Buyer’s Credit Support by Seller so long as Buyer is a Creditworthy Entity.
<!-- Page 73 -->
(3) Security Interest. To secure its obligations under this Agreement, each Party posting Credit Support (the “Credit Support Provider”) hereby grants to the other Party, as the secured party (the “Credit Support Beneficiary”), a first priority and continuing security interest in, and lien on (and right of setoff against), and assignment of any Cash account, any Credit Support provided in the form of Cash and all Cash obtained by Credit Support Beneficiary resulting from a draw on Credit Support other than Cash, and all proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof, whether now or hereafter held by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of the Credit Support Beneficiary, and Credit Support Provider agrees to take such action as Credit Support Beneficiary reasonably requires to protect the Credit Support Beneficiary’s first-priority security interest in, and lien on and right of setoff against, such collateral and all proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof; provided, however, that the Credit Support Beneficiary may exercise its rights as a secured party (including the right of setoff granted pursuant to this sentence) against such Cash account and Cash collateral only upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If Credit Support Beneficiary receives Cash proceeds from a Letter of Credit pursuant to a drawing made in accordance with this Agreement, then the Credit Support Beneficiary will deposit such proceeds in a Cash account in accordance with Special Provision (C)(4), immediately below, under terms and conditions that allow the proceeds to be disbursed to Credit Support Beneficiary and provide for disbursement to Credit Support Provider upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, the inability to deposit such Cash proceeds into a Cash account, including as a result of the non-cooperation of the Credit Support Provider, shall not limit the right of Credit Support Beneficiary to receive, hold and apply such Cash collateral in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Cash collateral will constitute Credit Support for all purposes of this Agreement.

(4) Drawing of Credit Support. In an Event of Default that is continuing, Credit Support Beneficiary will be entitled to draw upon Credit Support in an amount equal to any amounts due and owing such Credit Support Beneficiary that have not been paid within the time provided under this Agreement that arise from (i) such Event of Default, or (ii) any prior Event of Default to the extent that such Event of Default is in the form of a Letter of Credit. Credit Support Beneficiary may draw the full amount of such Letter of Credit within thirty (30) days before the expiration of such Letter of Credit if, as of the date of such drawing, Credit Support Beneficiary does not receive replacement Credit Support meeting the requirements of this Agreement and the proceeds of any such draw will constitute collateral provided to the beneficiary in the form of Cash. If the Credit Support Beneficiary draws on the Letter of Credit as provided in the preceding sentence, the Cash will be maintained in a custodial account at a national bank reasonably acceptable to the applicant. The Credit Support Beneficiary may withdraw funds from such account to pay any amount due and owing by the applicant under this Agreement that has not been paid within the time provided under this Agreement. The Credit Support contemplated by this Special Provision (C) (including subparagraphs (1) through (6)) constitutes security for, but is not a limitation of, liability for either Party’s obligations and liabilities under this Agreement.

(5) Release Upon Termination. Credit Support will be released or returned, as applicable, to the Credit Support Provider immediately upon the first date that (a) the Delivery Period has ended, (b) such Credit Support Provider has satisfied all of its payment obligations to the other Party hereunder, and (c) such Credit Support Provider has confirmed in writing to the other Party that there will be no additional disputes regarding the correctness of an invoice or any adjustment to an invoice pursuant to Section 6.3 of the Master Agreement.

(6) Uniform Commercial Code Waiver. Section 8 of the Master Agreement and this Confirmation set forth the entirety of the agreement of the Parties regarding credit, collateral, and financial adequate assurances. Except as expressly set forth in this Special Provision (C) (including subparagraphs (1) through (6)), neither Party (a) has or will have any additional obligation to post Credit Support, pay deposits, make any other prepayments, or provide any other financial assurances in any form whatsoever; or (b) will have reasonable grounds for insecurity with respect to the creditworthiness of a Party that is complying with the relevant provisions of this Agreement.

(7) Letter of Credit Default. It shall be an Event of Default of the Credit Support Provider under this Confirmation upon the occurrence of a Letter of Credit Default with respect to any Letter of Credit issued in support of any obligations of such Party under this Confirmation or any issuer of any such Letter of Credit, and such default is not cured within five (5) Business Days after written notice from the other Party.

provided by SMUD staff and thanked Chief Diversity Officer Jose Bodipo-Memba and Dr. Markisha Webster, Director of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging (DEIB), Learning & Sustainable Communities, for putting the materials together. Paul Lau, Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, reported on the following items:

1) **SMUD Cares Employee Giving Campaign.** I would like to start by sharing some good news right off the press! The SMUD Cares Employee Giving Campaign - which just closed on October 4th - raised $436,701! This surpassed our goal of $430,000 with 30% employee participation the campaign. Thank you to our employees for their deep generosity and commitment to our community! Every year, we raise the goal, and every year, our employees step up and give back to the community.

2) **Neighborhood Electrification.** Now for an exciting milestone: As Vice President Fishman mentioned, we were honored to join Congresswoman Doris Matsui to announce $3 million in funding for the expansion of our neighborhood electrification efforts in Meadowview. The funding supports our goal to eliminate all carbon emissions by 2030 and will help electrify up to 300 homes, improve air quality, lower electric bills and reduce financial stress for hundreds of customers. Building on the success of Meadowview, we plan to roll out similar projects across our region, focusing on communities facing environmental and economic challenges. We are grateful for Congresswoman Matsui’s continued support and leadership in helping us make a real, tangible difference in people’s lives.

3) **Sparklz Lithium-ion Battery Manufacturing Facility.** We also celebrated a local economic and workforce development milestone with the opening of Sparklz’s new lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility. Not only is Sparklz the first of its kind
<!-- Page 88 -->

facility in the United States, it kicks off an innovative workforce development partnership with SMUD. We are working with the United Auto Workers’ Center for Manufacturing a Green Economy, the California Mobility Center and local nonprofits to enroll people from under resourced and underserved communities in a unique battery manufacturing training program. Qualified graduates from the training program will then be candidates for Sparkz’s battery technician apprenticeship. This kind of collaboration is what is going to get us to our bold goal of zero emissions – all while prioritizing building a workforce from within our community. Remember, the promise that we had beside the clean energy transition was that we want to make sure no community left behind. This is one way of doing it – making sure that the workforce that will work in the clean energy economy comes directly from our community. It is something we are very proud of. I think it is one of the first programs of its kind, and thank you to Jose Bodipo-Memba, Chief Diversity Officer, who was instrumental in negotiating with Sparkz to get the program.

4) GRIP Grant Contract. I am also very excited to share that our $50 million grant contract with the Department of Energy’s Grid Resilience and Innovative Partnerships, or GRIP program, has been officially signed! Last October, we secured this grant to support advanced smart meter technologies through our Connected Clean PowerCity project. This project will create an intelligent ecosystem for managing the grid with much greater precision while giving us the greater resiliency and grid hardening to support our clean energy transition. Congratulations to the whole team, and I look forward to seeing our next steps come to life!

5) **Connecting Communities Resource Expo.** As several of you have mentioned, this past month we were proud to host our second Connecting Our Communities Resource Expo and two Meet SMUD events. We know bringing SMUD resources to our customers is important – and so is making it easier for them to access wrap-around services from our partners. Thank you to all the Board members who attended these important community events, and to the teams who work hard each day to make it possible for our community to get the support they need. I want to give a special thanks to Chief Customer Officer Brandy Bolden, whose staff is simply amazing in connecting our customers to the community resources and organizations.

6) **Awards.** Team SMUD was recognized with several well-deserved awards this month. First, PR Daily awarded our Marketing and Corporate Communications team with two finalist honors – for Crisis Communications for our 2023 Storm Response efforts and for our “Contact SMUD First” marketing campaign.

Wanted to add an Agenda Item or, if it already exists, add to an existing Agenda Item about allowing Customers acquire access to a discounted Battery Backup Unit for their CPAP Machine. I know PG&E has a program for it, but SMUD does not appear to have one. There have been several evenings where my home's power went out for several hours and I was unable to use my CPAP machine and sleep.

If this can be addressed in the upcoming meeting, I would appreciate it!

Hello,

We are very much interested in purchasing a solar battery and participating in the rebate program. We are profoundly disappointed that SMUD is only doing business with Tesla. We would like to know when SMUD will do business with an apolitical organization rather than one that is headed by Elon Musk.

SMUD is a not for profit, community owned utility. As such, it should represent the community it serves. Allowing a polarizing figure to monopolize the entirety of the millions invested in solar battery energy is an insult to civic minded Sacramentans who refuse to give campaign contributions to the Trump administration via his vociferous billionaire surrogates. We refuse to do any business with Tesla and Elon Musk.

Warmly,  
Evan & Deanna Marmol

To the Board of Directors of SMUD:

Please find attached a letter from Scenic America' President Mark Falzone regarding the proposed communications tower as part of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Folsom Administrative Operations Building Project. Scenic America has reviewed the plans and expresses significant concern about the aesthetic and visual impacts of the proposed 100-foot-tall tower, especially in relation to its visibility from Lake Natoma and the surrounding scenic areas. We urge the Board to reconsider adopting the September 2024 Final Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS/MND) until further analysis is conducted on the potential impacts. The attached letter outlines our detailed concerns and provides context on the negative effects of such developments in sensitive scenic areas.

If you have any questions or would like further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
Board of Directors and Energy Resources and Customer Services Committee  
6301 S Street  
Sacramento, CA 95817  

To the SMUD Board of Directors and ERCS Committee Members:

I am writing to you as the president of Scenic America, the nation’s only 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated solely to the promotion, preservation, and protection of America’s scenic beauty. In our over forty years of operation, we have been on the forefront of advocacy and education for many issues that directly affect the beauty and character of our communities. We have built a reputation as an organization that can quickly and effectively organize and activate a motivated group of supporters for or against issues of importance.

Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) staff are recommending that on October 15th the SMUD Energy Resources and Customer Services (ERCS) Committee consider, and that on October 17th the SMUD Board of Directors adopt, the September 2024 Final Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS/MND) for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Folsom Administrative Operations Building Project (Project). For reasons outlined in this letter, Scenic America respectfully requests that the SMUD Board of Directors decline to adopt the IS/MND and direct staff to provide further study of the Project’s aesthetic/visual impacts prior to SMUD’s reconsideration of adoption or certification of an environmental document for the Project for compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

Of primary concern to Scenic America is the aesthetic/visual impact of the proposed 100-foot-tall tower within the immediate view of the public using lands surrounding Lake Natoma and much of the water surface of Lake Natoma. Lake Natoma provides a unique and important regional resource with important and well-documented biological, cultural, recreational, and scenic resources. Scenic America recognizes SMUD’s vital role as an electric utility service provider in the Sacramento region and encourages SMUD to receive and consider these comments in the interest of ensuring that SMUD continues its exemplary service while expanding its offices and equipment in a manner that minimizes environmental impacts within one of the region’s most environmentally important and visually sensitive areas.

![SMUD Project Proposal](https://example.com/image-url)

SMUD proposes to construct and operate an approximately 100,000-square-foot administrative office building and a 100-foot-tall communications tower on a vacant six-acre parcel located at 102 Woodmere Road in the City of Folsom. Site improvements would include parking, lighting, landscaping, security features, driveway access, utilities, and street frontage improvements. The Project site is on a parcel within the Lake Forest Technical Center and located immediately adjacent to open space lands and Lake Natoma within the Folsom Lake State Recreation Area (FLSRA) managed by the California Department of Parks and Recreation (State Parks).

As discussed herein, SMUD's IS/MND provides an insufficient description of the Project, presents visual simulations that fail to meaningfully demonstrate the visibility of the tower from sensitive viewpoints, and fails to consider and disclose the full range of sensitive view locations and viewers within the Lake Natoma area. Notably, SMUD's proposed tower would be visible from up to approximately 160 acres of the Lake Natoma surface which is a primary feature of the Lake Natoma-unit of the Folsom Lake SRA and is used by thousands of people each year who enjoy the unique and peaceful setting of Lake Natoma and its surrounding landscape; yet SMUD's IS/MND provides no analysis of the impact of the tower to views from the surface of Lake Natoma.

Attachment A to this letter provides a selection of exhibits prepared to support and demonstrate our argument. Figure A-1 illustrates the approximately 160-acre surface area portion of Lake Natoma from which we estimate there would be a direct view of the upper portion of the proposed tower. Figure A-2 provides a location index and explanation of sightline profile cross-sections prepared to demonstrate the portion of the tower anticipated to be visible within the line of sight from various view locations around and on Lake Natoma.

Please consider the concerns discussed below and ensure a more comprehensive and complete assessment of the Project’s visual impacts is performed prior to adoption of an environmental document for the Project.

1. SMUD’s Project Description Lacks Information Sufficient to Support Impact Analysis and Conclusions in the IS/MND

CEQA Courts have held that, “[a]n accurate and complete project description is necessary for an intelligent evaluation of the potential environmental impacts of the agency’s action. Only through an accurate view of the project may affected outsiders and public decision-makers balance the proposal’s benefit against its environmental cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the proposal…and weigh other alternatives in the balance.” (Save Our Capitol! v. Department of General Services (2023), Cal.App.5th, citing others).

The Project description of SMUD's IS/MND provides the following in describing SMUD's proposed communications tower, “[t]he Project would include a communications tower approximately 100 feet in height, located at the northeast corner of the Project site” (Draft IS/MND, pg. 10) and the
<!-- Page 96 -->
![IS/MND Document](https://example.com/image.png)

IS/MND includes a Figure 4, “Conceptual Site Design,” that shows the proposed (or at least conceptual) location of the tower.

The IS/MND Project description does not describe the design of the tower (e.g., mono-pole, free-standing lattice, guyed lattice), does not describe or present the proposed tower color, does not describe or present the proposed types of communication equipment that would be placed on the tower (e.g., dishes, antennae, conduit), and does not discuss whether the tower would include or require lighting. Without an understanding of these basic design components, it is not possible for the public and decision-makers to fully understand and assess the visibility and degree of visual impact that the tower would have from offsite view locations.

Although one of SMUD’s three photo simulations in the IS/MND (Figure 3.1-2, Key Observation Point 1 [KOP 1]) represent what appears to be a free-standing, steel lattice tower, the IS/MND does not describe that this is the actual tower design that is proposed and does not provide other detail about the design. Additionally, the KOP 1 simulation includes an antenna that appears to extend approximately 10 feet above the top of the steel lattice tower. However, the IS/MND provides no discussion of whether SMUD proposes that the top of such antenna would be limited to a maximum height of 100 feet or if SMUD intends that antennae would be allowed to extend even farther above the height of the 100-foot tower. Without a sufficient description of the proposed tower, it is impossible to fully understand and evaluate the visual impacts of the tower. SMUD’s IS/MND must be revised to provide sufficient detail for a meaningful evaluation of the proposed tower.

The Project description of SMUD's IS/MND provides the following in describing SMUD’s proposed landscaping, “[l]andscape strips with perimeter trees would be located in the landscaped areas along the northwest and east sides of the project site, within the perimeter fence” (Draft IS/MND pg. 10) and the IS/MND identifies interior and exterior landscape strips on Figure 4, “Conceptual Site Design.” However, the IS/MND does not include a landscaping plan and does not identify the types of plants/trees that would be used for landscaping. Yet, the visual simulations and impact analysis presented in the IS/MND rely on the presence of trees along the Project site perimeter to conclude that landscaping would mitigate the visual impact of SMUD’s proposed building and tower, stating, “views of the buildings and communications tower from the west of the Project site would be mostly obscured by screening trees.”

Further, IS/MND Figure 3.1-3 presents a simulated view toward the Project site which includes simulated trees, one of which appears to be gratuitously positioned to block what would otherwise be a view of SMUD’s proposed tower. Yet, neither the IS/MND Project description nor the visual impact analysis provide any discussion of the types of trees, their height, their degree of maturity in the simulation, or even if such a tree species exists that could be used for perimeter landscaping and achieve the screening necessary to mitigate the visual impact.
<!-- Page 97 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Page)

The absence of even a conceptual landscaping plan that identifies plant and tree types that would achieve the optimistic screening presented in the analysis renders SMUD’s Project description incomplete and insufficient for presenting a meaningful understanding of the Project and its visual impacts. Furthermore, the reliance on landscaping to avoid significant visual impacts (from one particular view location) without a sufficient landscaping plan and landscaping performance standards is deferred mitigation and impermissible under CEQA.

For an adequate CEQA document, SMUD must revise and expand the level of Project design detail and performance standards/commitments in the IS/MND Project description.

2. The IS/MND Analysis of Effects on Scenic Vistas is Insufficient

Section 3.1, “Aesthetics,” of the IS/MNM (Draft IS/MND pp. 21-29) discusses that, [e]levated views of Lake Natoma and the American River Parkway from surrounding bluffs provide remarkable scenery and are considered a scenic vista.” To assess the magnitude of the Project impact on views from scenic vistas, the analysis appears to rely solely on a single “key observation point” (KOP 3) and a photographic simulation toward the Project site from KOP 3. The analysis concludes that “due to distance and intervening vegetation, the proposed development would be nearly indistinguishable from surrounding development when viewed from the western shore of Lake Natoma. The Project would blend with the surrounding existing business development and would not have a substantial adverse effect on this scenic vista.” (Draft IS/MND pp. 21-22)

As shown on IS/MND Figure 3.1-1, KOP 3 is located adjacent to a residential development to the northwest of the Project site. Though not identified in the IS/MND, KOP 3 is approximately 2,400 feet from the Project site. The IS/MND conclusion that the Project would blend with the surrounding development is flawed. Although the visual simulation downplays the visibility of the tower (a zoom into the simulated view shows the tower merely as a few grey pixels), at a distance of 2,400 feet, the Project’s tower would be readily apparent in the view and would present a new, unnatural/cultural component to the viewshed. The human eye can easily and clearly see a 100-foot tower from a distance of 2,400 feet, regardless of whether that same clarity is presented in a photographic simulation.

Additionally, by selecting a view location at an elevation above much of the lands surrounding Lake Natoma and all of the water surface of Lake Natoma, this viewpoint is not representative of the many scenic vistas and other areas surrounding Lake Natoma. Looking down toward the Project site and technology center as from KOP 3, development in the technology center is visible. However, from the multitude of other locations and areas from which the tower would be visible, the more natural setting of Lake Natoma is dominant and the proposed tower would represent a conflicting element and significant adverse visual effect. To demonstrate, Figure A-4 in Attachment A of this letter is a GoogleEarth streetview image from a viewpoint along the bike trail in line with the KOP 3 sightline toward the Project (see Figure A-3 for sightline cross-section profile). The
<!-- Page 98 -->
![Figure A-4 viewpoint is a lower elevation than KOP 3 along a bike trail that has much higher use than the KOP 3 viewpoint. Figure A-4 includes a 100-foot tall three-dimensional block illustration situated at the proposed tower location. The 3D block is "clamped to the ground" to accurately demonstrate the height of the tower as seen from the Figure A-4 viewpoint along the bike trail. As shown, in Figures A-3 and A-4, the tower would extend above the view horizon, as opposed to blending with adjacent development in the technology center as represented in the KOP 3 simulation of the IS/MND. 

To sufficiently evaluate the Project impact to views from scenic vistas, SMUD must first inventory and identify scenic vistas from which the Project would be visible. Lands within the Folsom Lake SRA to the west of Lake Natoma contain a multitude of view locations that have panoramic views of Lake Natoma and its surrounding undeveloped lands and which the tower would be visible. The IS/MND’s focus on just one location without establishing a methodology or rationale for how that location was selected and how it might be considered representative of the multitude of other scenic vistas around the lake render the impact analysis cursory and insufficient as substantial evidence to conclude that the Project would not have a significant effect on scenic vistas.

3. The IS/MND Analysis of the Project Impacts to the Quality of Public Views of the Site and Surrounding Areas is Insufficient

CEQA requires that the analysis of a project’s impacts include enough detail to enable those who did not participate in the preparation of the environmental document to understand and to consider meaningfully the impacts of the Project. Under the CEQA Guidelines, an environmental document “should be prepared with a sufficient degree of analysis to provide decisionmakers with information which enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental consequences.” (CEQA Guidelines, section 15151.) The IS/MND assessment of whether the Project would substantially degrade the existing visual character of public views of the site and its surroundings fails to meet this standard.

First, the analysis identifies three “key observation points (KOPs)” that “were selected for focused evaluation of the Project’s potential effects on public views.” The IS/MND provides no discussion of how the KOPs were selected and the IS/MND provides no discussion for why the three KOPs are sufficient for an adequate analysis. The IS/MND discusses that the KOPs “provide a range of public viewpoints located within the visually sensitive American River Parkway,” yet, only two (KOP 2 and KOP 3) of the three KOPs are within the American River Parkway and the two KOPs are insufficient to adequately present and assess visual impacts from the multitude of locations and viewers within the lands surrounding Lake Natoma and the surface waters of Lake Natoma.

The IS/MND discusses that, “KOP 2 represents short-range views of cyclists and other recreationists using the Jedidiah Smith Memorial Trail/American River Bike Trail immediately west of the Project site.” While KOP 2 is a viewpoint “immediately west of the Project site” that is the 5**
<!-- Page 99 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)  
only viewpoint for which KOP 2 is representative and renders the evaluation and conclusion regarding impacts to views from KOP 2 similarly limited to that specific point. The viewpoint and simulation is not representative of many other bike trail, dirt trail, and shoreline areas within the lands surrounding Lake Natoma. Furthermore, the KOP 2 impact analysis in the IS/MND is premised on a gratuitously placed landscape tree, the presence of which is not ensured through any mechanism presented in the IS/MND Project description or any mitigation measure identified in the IS/MND. At best, the visual impact to the view from KOP 2 might be mitigated were SMUD to identify and commit to planting a tree of sufficient height and opacity to actually screen views of the tower; but no such mitigation is provided. Worse, one need only step a few feet to the left from the KOP 2 viewpoint, and the Project tower would be predominantly visible to the left of the simulated tree. At a minimum, to make KOP 2 useful in disclosing the Project's impacts, SMUD's analysis needs to present a visual simulation from KOP 2 that provides the actual appearance of the proposed tower without obscuring it with a speculative landscape tree.

Furthermore, the IS/MND analysis of KOP 2 attempts to downplay the visual impact by suggesting that other buildings, fencing, and utilities are present along this segment of bike trail and are “relatively consistent with the presence of a communications tower.” Scenic America disputes this notion. While such features are present, they are not characteristically similar to a massive 100foot-tall communication tower. Additionally, although acknowledging these existing features, nowhere in the IS/MND is there analysis or discussion of the cumulative visual impact associated with the Project tower in consideration of these existing buildings, fences, and utilities.

The IS/MND discusses that “KOP 3 represents mid-range views of the eastern shore of Lake Natoma from Arden Bluff which sits at a higher elevation than the Project site on the west side of Lake Natoma… at a trailhead that connects the Arden Bluff neighborhood…with the…American River Bike Trail.” While KOP 3 is representative of that particular view, it is not representative of views from the many other bike trail, dirt trail, and shoreline areas within the lands surrounding Lake Natoma.

To provide adequate disclosure at evaluation of the Project's visual impact, SMUD must more fully assess viewpoints from areas surrounding and on the surface of Lake Natoma.

Attachment A of this letter provides representative locations and cross-section illustrations to demonstrate the anticipated visibility of SMUD’s proposed tower. While the locations and cross-sections are just a small sampling of the views that should be considered, they provide substantial evidence that the Project tower would be a dominant visual feature that would degrade the natural and scenic qualities of the Lake Natoma viewshed.

Furthermore, SMUD must disclose and assess the Project’s visual impact to views from the Lake Natoma surface as would be visible to perhaps the most visual sensitive viewers – kayakers, paddleboarders, sailors, and rowers – that come to Lake Natoma for recreation and to enjoy its
<!-- Page 100 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)  
unique visual character and outstanding visual quality. Figure A-1 in Attachment A of this letter illustrates the estimated approximately 160 acres of Lake Natoma surface from which the tower would be partially visible. Figure A-6 illustrates a sightline cross-section profile from a representative location on the lake surface west of the Project site. SMUD’s IS/MND must recognize the viewer sensitive and Project impacts from the vast and important viewing area that the Lake Natoma water surface provides.

4. The Project would Conflict with Regulations Governing Scenic Quality  
Section 3.1, “Aesthetics,” of the IS/MNM (Draft IS/MND pp. 21-29) discusses that, “the Project would be required to obtain a Planned Development Permit from the City of Folsom for the proposed communications tower to exceed the maximum height standard established for the Project site. The Project is designed to be consistent with the applicable zoning and development standards related to design and aesthetics including requirements for neutral colored building exteriors, shielded lighting, and landscape screening, and would be subject to review by the City of Folsom Planning Commission to achieve desired city standards.”

First, as discussed above, the IS/MND Project description provides very little information about the specific Project design and does not support the visual analysis statement that, “the project is designed to be consistent with applicable development standards.” Instead, SMUD’s approach defers Project design detail until some future time after SMUD’s intended adoption of the IS/MND. However, for SMUD’s analysis to conclude the Project would not conflict with applicable zoning and regulations, SMUD must sufficiently identify Project design that complies with applicable zoning and regulations. SMUD’s failure to do so in the IS/MND at best constitutes deferred mitigation and is impermissible under CEQA.

More pointedly, the Project’s proposed 100-foot-tall tower would be in direct conflict with applicable regulations governing scenic quality.

The “Development Standards for Lake Forest Technical Center” (Development Standards) were adopted by the City of Folsom through Ordinance No. 425 in 1981 and are applicable to the Project site. The Development Standards expressly state their purpose and intent to, “mitigate and/or avoid potential impacts of industrial development adjacent to the unique and sensitive open space lands along Lake Natoma and Willow Creek.” With regard to building height, the Development Standards expressly state, “[n]o building, antenna, nor structure of any kind shall exceed the height of forty (40) feet above the established building grade for the site.”

The Project’s proposed 100-foot-tall tower would be 2.5 times taller than the maximum height allowed by the Development Standards. SMUD’s analysis and conclusions in the IS/MND are premised on the assumption that the City of Folsom will make a special exception for the Project.
<!-- Page 101 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)  
allowing for the tower. But such a conclusion is flawed or would require a disingenuous review and waiver from the City.  

First, the Development Standards allow for special exceptions only when, “there exist circumstances in the nature of the use(s) or its special design needs that make strict enforcement impractical or out of character with the intent of the standards and that the design of the project is consistent with the intent of these standards.” A waiver of the Development Standards’ 40-foot height limit to allow for a 100-foot tower simply cannot reasonably meet the exception criteria requiring a showing that the tower is “consistent with the intent of these standards.” Moreover, even if the City were to somehow determine that the Project’s tower qualified for the exception, the tower would still conflict with the Development Standard height limit. In such an instance, SMUD’s Project and tower might be found to comply with City regulations by obtaining a waiver, but would nevertheless still conflict with the applicable height regulation and represent a significant impact under CEQA.  

5. The IS/MND Fails to Fully Assess the Project’s Potential to Conflict with American River Parkway Plan and Folsom Lake SRA General Plan and Resource Management Plan Policies  

Section 3.11, “Land Use and Planning,” of the IS/MND discusses the Project’s potential to cause a significant impact due to a conflict with any land use plan, policy, or regulation adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect.  

Section 3.11 identifies two land use plans for assessment of potentially applicable policies – the City of Folsom General Plan and the American River Parkway Plan (ARPP). Scenic America does not address the Folsom General Plan in this letter and focuses our input on the ARPP and as well as the 2010 Folsom Lake State Recreation Area (SRA) General Plan and Resource Management Plan (Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP) discussion of which is absent from SMUD’s IS/MND.  

SMUD’s IS/MND provides a very brief discussion of the ARPP, stating that, “[t]he American River Parkway Plan (Sacramento County 2008) provides guidance for land use decisions affecting the Parkway and specifically addresses the preservation, use, development, and administration of the Parkway,” and concluding that, “Project activities would be limited to the Project site and would not encroach on the Parkway during construction or operation. The Project would not conflict with implementation of the American River Parkway Plan.” SMUD’s analysis of the ARPP fails to acknowledge that the ARPP incorporates the Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP in its entirety by reference. The 2008 ARPP states, “California State Parks and Reclamation are currently developing a new combined General Plan/Resource Management Plan for both the Folsom Powerhouse SHP and Folsom Lake SRA, including the Lake Natoma sub-unit. Upon adoption, this plan is adopted by reference into the American River Parkway Plan.” (ARPP, pg. 204)  

8
<!-- Page 102 -->
![Document Page](https://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/21299/files/FLSRA_GP_RMP_Vol1_Final_Plan.pdf)

It is unclear why SMUD’s analysis provided such a cursory review of the ARPP and more thorough consideration of the plan is warranted. The ARPP provides substantial evidence of the importance of important view locations and viewsheds that SMUD entirely omits from its analysis. For example, the ARPP discusses the Lake Overlook as follows (ARPP, pp. 209-210):

**Lake Overlook:** Located between Nimbus Dam and Mississippi Bar at the southern end of Lake Natoma, this zone is relatively unknown to all but local users—this despite the fact that its steep oak-studded ridges and canyons are such a visually dominant part of landscape here. Lake Overlook offers arguably the park’s most dramatic and high quality panorama across Lake Natoma and the Sierra Foothills to the north and the Sacramento Valley and Mt. Diablo to the south. A paved parking area is the only facility currently provided. Comprehensive site planning and design are needed to enhance the recreation and interpretive opportunities of the area and take advantage of the extraordinary visual setting.

SMUD’s exclusion of this location from a viewpoint inventory and the IS/MND’s omission of this and similar information renders the evaluation of the Project’s potential to conflict with the ARPP incomplete and insufficient.

Additionally, the Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP (of which SMUD’s IS/MND makes no mention) includes important policies associated with avoiding and minimizing impacts of adjacent development on resources within the Lake Natoma Unit of the Folsom Lake SRA. (The Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP is publicly available at the following webpage: [Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP](https://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/21299/files/FLSRA_GP_RMP_Vol1_Final_Plan.pdf))

Section III.f, “Visual Resources and Aesthetics,” of the Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP discusses that the Folsom Lake SRA “represents a significant visual and scenic resource within the region offering a combination of panoramic views and distinctive landscape features. Situated where the Central Valley meets the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, the SRA includes a variety of landscapes from rugged canyons along the American River forks, to the rolling hills and upland plateaus above Folsom Lake, to the bluffs and broad river plain of Lake Natoma. ... the resulting lakefront setting affords visitors with dramatic panoramas of the lakes, the surrounding natural landscape, and cultural resource features.” The plan identifies a visual resources goal of, “[p]rotection and enhancement of views and distinctive landscape features that contribute to the SRA’s setting, character, and visitor experience.”

**Visual Protection guidelines/policies in the Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP include:**

**Visual-2:** Work with local jurisdictions in the land use planning and development process to protect key views in the SRA from continued visual intrusion from surrounding development. This will include appropriate general planned land use designations, zoning to regulate such matters as building height and setbacks, ridgeline protection ordinances.
<!-- Page 103 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+not+displayed)

that help protect visual resources of the SRA, and rigorous development review and enforcement.

SMUD’s IS/MND makes no mention of the Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP or its visual resources protection goals and guidelines/policies and, therefore, fails to provide any analysis of the Project’s potential to conflict with relevant goals and guidelines/policies. With regard to guideline Visual-2 quoted above, the guideline establishes the important role of coordination among local agencies and State Parks for land use planning and development to protect key views in the SRA from visual intrusion from surrounding development. Yet, with SMUD’s apparent neglect to consider the Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP and foster the intended coordination specified in Visual-2, it appears that the land use planning coordination envisioned by Visual-2 has not occurred. Visual-2 anticipates “rigorous development review and enforcement,” yet SMUD’s intent to request variances from the City of Folsom to allow SMUD’s proposed tower to exceed applicable Development Standard height regulations is clearly in conflict with rigorous enforcement of established development standards. Thus, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, the IS/MND analysis must conclude that the Project would conflict with Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP policies intended for visual resources protection and consider this a significant visual impact and land use plan conflict.

6. The IS/MND Fails to Disclose and Mitigate for Impacts to Trees Protected Under the City of Folsom Tree Preservation Ordinance

The IS/MND Biological Resources section discusses that, “[t]he Project could require the removal of a few interior, live oak trees that are currently within the Project site. However, pursuant to subsection 12.16.050(C)(11) of the Folsom Municipal Code, SMUD is exempt from the requirements of City’s Tree Preservation Ordinance, as a public utility performing tree removal activities to maintain a safe operation of SMUD facilities.”

First, the Biological Resources Assessment (BRA) (IS/MND Appendix B) and IS/MND evaluation of potential impacts to protect trees is incomplete. The BRA discusses that, “[t]he proposed Project could require the removal of a few interior live oak trees that are currently within the Project site. If these trees are proposed for removal, an arborist survey should be conducted to determine the diameter at breast height (DBH) and assess the proposed Project impacts.” This analysis fails to disclose and assess tree removal and the impacts of tree removal. According to the IS/MND conceptual site plan (Figure 4), the entire Project site would be graded/developed for the Project and any existing trees would require removal. Additionally, the grading could affect the root zones of trees adjacent to the site, resulting in damage to or loss of those adjacent trees. While this loss would have biological resource impacts that also need to be assessed and disclosed, Scenic

The Project’s impact to protected trees must be evaluated, disclosed, and mitigated sufficient to avoid significant biological and visual impacts.

### 7. The IS/MND Fails to Acknowledge the Presence of and Potential Impacts to Nesting Bald Eagles

The IS/MND fails to acknowledge the presence of an active bald eagle nest within less than 1 mile and in direct line of sight of SMUD's proposed tower. Effects on foraging habitat, potential eagle interaction/injury associated with the tower, or other impacts to the nesting eagles would not just be a biological resources impact, but would also have a detrimental effect on the aesthetic benefit that the presence of the eagle nest and eagles provide to the Lake Natoma area. (Photographs and information about these eagles, including a spreadsheet with observations of eagle activities this spring and summer is available at the following publicly accessible website: https://folfaneaglecam.org/) Without a proposed design of the tower (e.g., guy wires, placement of dishes/antenna, etc.) and without assessing potential effects on bald eagle associated with the presence of the tower and the loss of foraging habitat on the Project site, SMUD cannot definitely determine potential effects on the nesting eagles.

### Conclusion

For the reasons discussed above, Scenic America objects to the Project as currently described and evaluated and urges SMUD to conduct a more thorough assessment of the aesthetic/visual impacts of the Project and to consider alternatives to the proposed 100-foot tower.

Sincerely,

Mark Falzone  
President, Scenic America

Subject: Letter of Opposition to IS/MND re. Folsom Administrative Operations Building Project, including 100-foot Communications Tower  

We (Save the American River Association/SARA) respectfully request that you review and respond to the attached letter with appendices that we have just received from a concerned friend of the river.  

The letter has influenced us to request that the SMUD Board of Directors decline to adopt the IS/MND and that you direct staff to engage in further study and analysis of the Project’s aesthetic/visual and biological/environmental impacts on one of the region’s most sensitive areas.  

We emphasize that the proposed construction is situated next to a federally recognized Wild and Scenic River, in an area additionally protected by the American River Parkway Plan (now a California statute) and by the constraints of the Folsom Lake State Recreation Area.  

Among many concerns we emphasize the following:  
- the continuing presence of nesting bald eagles;  
- the fact that the area is protected from visual intrusion from surrounding development; the proposed 100-foot tower is of special concern.  

For details underlying our opposition to the project in its current form, please see the attachment.  

Sincerely,  

Warren Truitt

Subject: Sacramento Municipal Utility District Folsom Administrative Operations Building Project  

Dear SMUD Board of Directors and ERCS Committee Members:

Save the American River Association (SARA) is a grass roots non-profit organization founded in 1961 to spearhead the establishment of the American River Parkway — the “crown jewel” of the Sacramento County Park System — and adoption of the American River Parkway Plan 2008. Our mission is to protect and enhance the wildlife habitat, fishery, and recreational resources of the American River Parkway. Our volunteer, non-profit group of members and Board of Directors work to ensure that the American River Parkway will survive and prosper for the benefit of future generations.

Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) staff are recommending that on October 15th the SMUD Energy Resources and Customer Services (ERCS) Committee consider, and that on October 17th the SMUD Board of Directors adopt, the September 2024 Final Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS/MND) for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Folsom Administrative Operations Building Project (Project). For reasons outlined in this letter, SARA respectfully requests that the SMUD Board of Directors decline to adopt the IS/MND and direct staff to provide further study of the Project’s aesthetic/visual impacts prior to SMUD’s reconsideration of adoption or certification of an environmental document for the Project for compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

A primary concern to SARA is the aesthetic/visual impact of the proposed 100-foot-tall tower within the immediate view of the public using lands surrounding Lake Natoma and much of the water surface of Lake Natoma. Lake Natoma provides a unique and important regional resource with important and well-documented biological, cultural, recreational, and scenic resources. SARA recognizes SMUD’s vital role as an electric utility service provider in the Sacramento region, and encourages SMUD to receive and consider these comments in the interest of ensuring that SMUD continues its exemplary service while expanding its offices and equipment in a manner that minimizes environmental impacts within one of the region’s most environmentally important and visually sensitive areas.

SMUD proposes to construct and operate an approximately 100,000-square-foot administrative office building and a 100-foot-tall communications tower on a vacant six-acre parcel located at 102 Woodmere Road in the City of Folsom. Site improvements would include parking, lighting, landscaping, security features, driveway access, utilities, and street frontage improvements. The Project site is on a parcel within the Lake Forest Technical Center, and located immediately adjacent to open space lands and Lake Natoma within the Folsom Lake State Recreation Area (FLSRA) managed by the California Department of Parks and Recreation (State Parks).

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

As discussed herein, SMUD’s IS/MND provides an insufficient description of the Project, presents visual simulations that fail to meaningfully demonstrate the visibility of the tower from sensitive viewpoints, and fails to consider and disclose the full range of sensitive view locations and viewers within the Lake Natoma area. Notably, SMUD’s proposed tower would be visible from up to approximately 160 acres of the Lake Natoma surface which is a primary feature of the Lake Natoma unit of the Folsom Lake SRA and is used by thousands of people each year who enjoy the unique and peaceful setting of Lake Natoma and its surrounding landscape; yet SMUD’s IS/MND provides no analysis of the impact of the tower to views from the surface of Lake Natoma.

Attachment A to this letter provides a selection of exhibits prepared to support and demonstrate argument herein. Figure A-1 illustrates the approximately 160-acre surface area portion of Lake Natoma from which we estimate there would be a direct view of the upper portion of the proposed tower. Figure A-2 provides a location index and explanation of sightline profile cross-sections prepared to demonstrate the portion of the tower anticipated to be visible within the line of sight from various view locations around and on Lake Natoma.

Please consider the concerns discussed below, and ensure a more comprehensive and complete assessment of the Project’s visual impacts is performed prior to adoption of an environmental document for the Project.

1. SMUD’s Project Description Lacks Information Sufficient to Support Impact Analysis and Conclusions in the IS/MND

CEQA Courts have held that, “[a]n accurate and complete project description is necessary for all intelligent evaluation of the potential environmental impacts of the agency’s action. Only through an accurate view of the project may affected outsiders and public decision-makers balance the proposal’s benefit against its environmental cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the proposal…and weigh other alternatives in the balance.” (Save Our Capitol! v. Department of General Services (2023), Cal.App.5th, citing others).

The Project description of SMUD's IS/MND provides the following in describing SMUD’s proposed communications tower, “[t]he Project would include a communications tower approximately 100 feet in height, located at the northeast corner of the Project site” (Draft IS/MND, pg. 10) and the IS/MND includes a Figure 4, “Conceptual Site Design,” that shows the proposed (or at least conceptual) location of the tower.

The IS/MND Project description does not describe the design of the tower (e.g., mono-pole, free-standing lattice, guyed lattice), does not describe or present the proposed tower color, does not describe or present the proposed types of communication equipment that would be placed on the tower (e.g., dishes, antennae, conduit), and does not discuss whether the tower would include or require lighting. Without an understanding of these basic design components, it is not possible for the public and decision-makers to fully understand and assess the visibility and degree of visual impact that the tower would have from offsite view locations.

Although one of SMUD’s three photosimulations in the IS/MND (Figure 3.1-2, Key Observation Point 1 [KOP 1]) represent what appears to be a free-standing, steel lattice tower, the IS/MND does not describe that this is the actual tower design that

Page 3 of 12
<!-- Page 120 -->
![Page 4 of 12](attachment://image.png)

is proposed and does not provide other detail about the design. Additionally, the KOP 1 simulation includes an antenna that appears to extend approximately 10 feet above the top of the steel lattice tower. However, the IS/MND provides no discussion of whether SMUD proposes that the top of such antenna would be limited to a maximum height of 100 feet or if SMUD intends that antennae would be allowed to extend even farther above the height of the 100-foot tower. Without a sufficient description of the proposed tower, it is impossible to fully understand and evaluate the visual impacts of the tower. SMUD’s IS/MND must be revised to provide sufficient detail for a meaningful evaluation of the proposed tower.

The Project description of SMUD's IS/MND provides the following in describing SMUD’s proposed landscaping, “[l]andscape strips with perimeter trees would be located in the landscaped areas along the northwest and east sides of the project site, within the perimeter fence” (Draft IS/MND pg. 10) and the IS/MND identifies interior and exterior landscape strips on Figure 4, “Conceptual Site Design.” However, the IS/MND does not include a landscaping plan and does not identify the types of plants/trees that would be used for landscaping. Yet, the visual simulation and impact analysis presented in the IS/MND rely on the presence of trees along the Project site perimeter to conclude that landscaping would mitigate the visual impact of SMUD’s proposed building and tower, stating, “views of the buildings and communications tower from the west of the Project site would be mostly obscured by screening trees.”

Further, IS/MND Figure 3.1-3 presents a simulated view toward the Project site which includes simulated trees, one of which appears to be gratuitously positioned to block what would otherwise be a view of SMUD’s proposed tower. Yet, neither the IS/MND Project description nor the visual impact analysis provide any discussion of the types of trees, their height, their degree of maturity in the simulation, or even if such a tree species exists that could be used for perimeter landscaping and achieve the screening necessary to mitigate the visual impact.

The absence of even a conceptual landscaping plan that identifies plant and tree types that would achieve the optimistic screening presented in the analysis renders SMUD’s Project description incomplete and insufficient for presenting a meaningful understanding of the Project and its visual impacts. Furthermore, the reliance on landscaping to avoid significant visual impacts (from one particular view location) without a sufficient landscaping plan and landscaping performance standards is deferred mitigation and impermissible under CEQA.

For an adequate CEQA document, SMUD must revise and expand the level of Project design detail and performance standards/commitments in the IS/MND Project description.

2. The IS/MND Analysis of Effects on Scenic Vistas is Insufficient
Section 3.1, “Aesthetics,” of the IS/MND (Draft IS/MND pp. 21-29) discusses that, [e]levated views of Lake Natoma and the American River Parkway from surrounding bluffs provide remarkable scenery and are considered a scenic vista.” To assess the magnitude of the Project impact on views from scenic vistas, the analysis appears to rely solely on a single “key observation point” (KOP 3) and a photographic simulation toward the Project site from KOP 3. The analysis concludes that “due to distance and intervening vegetation, the proposed development would be nearly indistinguishable from surrounding development.
<!-- Page 121 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)  
when viewed from the western shore of Lake Natoma. The Project would blend with the surrounding existing business development and would not have a substantial adverse effect on this scenic vista.” (Draft IS/MND pp. 21-22)

As shown on IS/MND Figure 3.1-1, KOP 3 is located adjacent to a residential development to the northwest of the Project site. Though not identified in the IS/MND, KOP 3 is approximately 2,400 feet from the Project site. The IS/MND conclusion that the Project would blend with the surrounding development is flawed. Although the visual simulation downplays the visibility of the tower (a zoom into the simulated view shows the tower merely as a few grey pixels), at a distance of 2,400 feet, the Project’s tower would be readily apparent in the view and would present a new, unnatural/cultural component to the viewshed. The human eye can easily and clearly see a 100-foot tower from a distance of 2,400 feet, regardless of whether that same clarity is presented in a photographic simulation.

Additionally, by selecting a view location at an elevation above much of the lands surrounding Lake Natoma and all of the water surface of Lake Natoma, this viewpoint is not representative of the many scenic vistas and other areas surrounding Lake Natoma. Looking down toward the Project site and technology center from KOP 3, development in the technology center is visible. However, from the multitude of other locations and areas from which the tower would be visible, the more natural setting of Lake Natoma is dominant and the proposed tower would represent a conflicting element and significant adverse visual effect. To demonstrate, Figure A-4 in Attachment A of this letter is a GoogleEarth streetview image from a viewpoint along the bike trail inline with the KOP 3 sightline toward the Project (see Figure A-3 for sightline cross-section profile). The Figure A-4 viewpoint is a lower elevation than KOP 3 and along a bike trail that has much higher use than the KOP 3 viewpoint. Figure A-4 includes a 200-foot-tall three-dimensional block illustration situation at the proposed tower location. The 3D block is “clamped to the ground” to accurately demonstrate the height of the tower as seen from the Figure A-4 viewpoint along the bike trail. As shown, in Figures A-3 and A-4, the tower would extend above the view horizon, as opposed to blending with adjacent development in the technology center as represented in the KOP 3 simulation of the IS/MND.

To sufficiently evaluate the Project impact to views from scenic vistas, SMUD must first inventory and identify scenic vistas from which the Project would be visible. Lands within the Folsom Lake SRA to the west of Lake Natoma contain a multitude of view locations that have panoramic views of Lake Natoma and its surrounding undeveloped lands and which the tower would be visible. The IS/MND’s focus on just one location without establishing a methodology or rationale for how that location was selected and how it might be considered representative of the multitude of other scenic vistas around the lake render the impact analysis cursory and insufficient as substantial evidence to conclude that the Project would not have a significant effect on scenic vistas.

3. The IS/MND Analysis of the Project Impacts to the Quality of Public Views of the Site and Surrounding Areas is Insufficient

CEQA requires that the analysis of a project’s impacts include enough detail to enable those who did not participate in the preparation of the environmental document to understand and to consider meaningfully the impacts of the Project. Under the CEQA Guidelines, an environmental document “should be prepared with  
Page 5 of 12
<!-- Page 122 -->
![Page 6 of 12](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+6+of+12)

a sufficient degree of analysis to provide decisionmakers with information which enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental consequences.” (CEQA Guidelines, section 15151.) The IS/MND assessment of whether the Project would substantially degrade the existing visual character of public views of the site and its surroundings fails to meet this standard.

First, the analysis identifies three “key observation points (KOPs)” that “were selected for focused evaluation of the Project’s potential effects on public views.” The IS/MND provides no discussion of how the KOPs were selected and the IS/MND provides no discussion for why the three KOPs are sufficient for an adequate analysis. The IS/MND discusses that the KOPs “provide a range of public viewpoints located within the visually sensitive American River Parkway,” yet, only two (KOP 2 and KOP 3) of the three KOPs are within the American River Parkway and the two KOPs are insufficient to adequately present and assess visual impacts from the multitude of locations and viewers within the lands surrounding Lake Natoma and the surface waters of Lake Natoma.

The IS/MND discusses that, “KOP 2 represents short-range views of cyclists and other recreationists using the Jedediah Smith Memorial Trail/American River Bike Trail immediately west of the Project site.” While KOP 2 is a viewpoint “immediately west of the Project site” that is the only viewpoint for which KOP 2 is representative and renders the evaluation and conclusion regarding impacts to views from KOP 2 similarly limited to that specific point. The viewpoint and simulation is not representative of many other bike trail, dirt trail, and shoreline views within the lands surrounding Lake Natoma. Furthermore, the KOP 2 impact analysis in the IS/MND is presented on a gratuitously placed landscape tree, the presence of which is not ensured through any mechanism presented in the IS/MND. At best, the visual impact to the view from KOP 2 might be mitigated were SMUD to identify and commit to planting a tree of sufficient height and opacity to actually screen views of the tower; but no such mitigation is provided. Worse, one need only step a few feet to the left from the KOP 2 viewpoint, and the Project tower would be predominantly visible to the left of the simulated tree. At a minimum, to make KOP 2 useful in disclosing the Project’s impacts, SMUD’s analysis needs to present a visual simulation from KOP 2 that provides the actual appearance of the proposed tower without obscuring it with a speculative landscape tree.

Furthermore, the IS/MND analysis of KOP 2 attempts to downplay the visual impact by suggesting that other buildings, fencing, and utilities are present along this segment of bike trail and are “relatively consistent with the presence of a communications tower.” SARA disputes this notion. While such features are present, they are not characteristically similar to a massive 100-foot-tall communication tower. Additionally, although acknowledging these existing features, nowhere in the IS/MND is there analysis or discussion of the cumulative visual impact associated with the Project tower in consideration of these existing buildings, fences, and utilities.

The IS/MND discusses that “KOP 3 represents mid-range views of the eastern shore of Lake Natoma from Arden Bluff which sits at a higher elevation than the Project site on the west side of Lake Natoma… at a trailhead that connects the Arden Bluff neighborhood…with the…American River Bike Trail.” While KOP 3 is representative of that particular view, it is not representative of views from the many
<!-- Page 123 -->

other bike trail, dirt trail, and shoreline areas within the lands surrounding Lake Natoma. 

To provide adequate disclosure at evaluation of the Project’s visual impact, SMUD must more fully assess viewpoints from areas surrounding and on the surface of Lake Natoma.

Attachment A of this letter provides representative locations and cross-section illustrations to demonstrate the anticipated visibility of SMUD’s proposed tower. While the locations and cross-sections are just a small sampling of the views that should be considered, they provide substantial evidence that the Project tower would be a dominant visual feature that would degrade the natural and scenic qualities of the Lake Natoma viewshed.

Furthermore, SMUD must disclose and assess the Project’s visual impact to views from the Lake Natoma surface as would be visible to perhaps the most visual sensitive viewers – kayakers, paddleboarders, sailors, and rowers – that come to Lake Natoma for recreation and to enjoy its unique visual character and outstanding visual quality. Figure A-1 in Attachment A of this letter illustrates the estimated approximately 160 acres of Lake Natoma surface from which the tower would be partially visible. Figure A-6 illustrates a sightline cross-section profile from a representative location on the lake surface west of the Project site. SMUD’s IS/MND must recognize the viewer sensitive and Project impacts from the vast and important viewing area that the Lake Natoma water surface provides.

4. The Project would Conflict with Regulations Governing Scenic Quality

Section 3.1, “Aesthetics,” of the IS/MN (Draft IS/MND pp. 21-29) discusses that, “the Project would be required to obtain a Planned Development Permit from the City of Folsom for the proposed communications tower to exceed the maximum height standard established for the Project site. The Project is designed to be consistent with the applicable zoning and development standards related to design and aesthetics including requirements for neutral colored building exteriors, shielded lighting, and landscape screening, and would be subject to review by the City of Folsom Planning Commission to achieve desired city standards.”

First, as discussed above, the IS/MND Project description provides very little information about the specific Project design and does not support the visual analysis statement that, “the Project is designed to be consistent with applicable development standards.” Instead, SMUD’s approach defers Project design detail until some future time after SMUD’s intended adoption of the IS/MND. However, for SMUD’s analysis to conclude the Project would not conflict with applicable zoning and regulations, SMUD must sufficiently identify Project design that complies with applicable zoning and regulations. SMUD’s failure to do so in the IS/MND at best constitutes deferred mitigation and is impermissible under CEQA.

More pointedly, the Project’s proposed 100-foot-tall tower would be in direct conflict with applicable regulations governing scenic quality.

The “Development Standards for Lake Forest Technical Center” (Development Standards) were adopted by the City of Folsom through Ordinance No. 425 in 1981 and are applicable to the Project site. The Development Standards expressly state their purpose and intent to, “mitigate and/or avoid potential impacts of industrial development adjacent to the unique and sensitive open space lands along Lake
<!-- Page 124 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Natoma and Willow Creek.” With regard to building height, the Development Standards expressly state, “[In] building, antenna, nor structure of any kind shall exceed the height of forty (40) feet above the established building grade for the site.”

The Project’s proposed 100-foot-tall tower would be 2.5 times taller than the maximum height allowed by the Development Standards. SMUD’s analysis and conclusions in the IS/MND are premised on the assumption that the City of Folsom will make a special exception for the Project allowing for the tower. But such a conclusion is flawed or would require a disingenuous review and waiver from the City.

First, the Development Standards allow for special exceptions only when, “there exist circumstances in the nature of the use(s) or its special design needs that make strict enforcement impractical or out of character with the intent of the standards and that the design of the project is consistent with the intent of these standards.” A waiver of the Development Standards’ 40-foot height limit to allow for a 100-foot tower simply cannot reasonably meet the exception criteria requiring a showing that the tower is “consistent with the intent of these standards.” Moreover, even if the City were to somehow determine that the Project’s tower qualified for the exception, the tower would still conflict with the Development Standard height limit. In such an instance, SMUD’s Project and tower might be found to comply with City regulations by obtaining a waiver, but would nevertheless still conflict with the applicable height regulation and represent a significant impact under CEQA.

5. The IS/MND Fails to Fully Assess the Project’s Potential to Conflict with American River Parkway Plan and Folsom Lake SRA General Plan/Resource Management Plan Policies

Section 3.11, “Land Use and Planning,” of the IS/MND discusses the Project’s potential to cause a significant impact due to a conflict with any land use plan, policy, or regulation adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect.

Section 3.11 identifies two land use plans for assessment of potentially applicable policies – the City of Folsom General Plan and the American River Parkway Plan (ARPP). SARA does not address the Folsom General Plan in this letter, and focuses our input on the ARPP as well as the 2010 Folsom Lake State Recreation Area (SRA) General Plan and Resource Management Plan (Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP) discussion of which is absent from SMUD’s IS/MND.

SMUD’s IS/MND provides a very brief discussion of the ARPP, stating that, “[t]he American River Parkway Plan (Sacramento County 2008) provides guidance for land use decisions affecting the Parkway and specifically addresses the preservation, use, development, and administration of the Parkway,” and concluding that, “Project activities would be limited to the Project site and would not encroach on the Parkway during construction or operation. The Project would not conflict with implementation of the American River Parkway Plan.” SMUD’s analysis of the ARPP fails to acknowledge that the ARPP incorporates the Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP in its entirety by reference. The 2008 ARPP states, “California State Parks and Reclamation are currently developing a new combined General Plan/Resource Management Plan for both the Folsom Powerhouse SHP and

Page 8 of 12
<!-- Page 125 -->
![Folsom Lake SRA Document](https://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/21299/files/FLSRAGP_RM_Vol1_Final_Plan.pdf)

Folsom Lake SRA, including the Lake Natoma sub-unit. Upon adoption, this plan is adopted by reference into the American River Parkway Plan.” (ARPP, pg. 204)

It is unclear why SMUD’s analysis provided such a cursory review of the ARPP and more thorough consideration of the plan is warranted. The ARPP provides substantial evidence of the importance of important view locations and viewsheds that SMUD entirely omits from its analysis. For example, the ARPP discusses the Lake Overlook as follows (ARPP, pp. 209-210):

Lake Overlook: Located between Nimbus Dam and Mississippi Bar at the southern end of Lake Natoma, this zone is relatively unknown to all but local users—this despite the fact that its steep oak-studded ridges and canyons are such a visually dominant part of landscape here. Lake Overlook offers arguably the park’s most dramatic and high quality panorama across Lake Natoma and the Sierra Foothills to the north and the Sacramento Valley and Mt. Diablo to the south. A paved parking area is the only facility currently provided. Comprehensive site planning and design are needed to enhance the recreation and interpretive opportunities of the area and take advantage of the extraordinary visual setting.

SMUD’s exclusion of this location from a viewpoint inventory and the IS/MND’s omission of this and similar information renders the evaluation of the Project’s potential to conflict with the ARPP incomplete and insufficient.

Additionally, the Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP (of which SMUD’s IS/MND makes no mention) includes important policies associated with avoiding and minimizing impacts of adjacent development on resources within the Lake Natoma Unit of the Folsom Lake SRA. (The Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP is publicly available at the following webpage: https://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/21299/files/FLSRAGP_RM_Vol1_Final_Plan.pdf)

Section III.I.f, “Visual Resources and Aesthetics,” of the Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP discusses that the Folsom Lake SRA “represents a significant visual and scenic resource within the region offering a combination of panoramic views and distinctive landscape features. Situated where the Central Valley meets the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, the SRA includes a variety of landscapes from rugged canyons along the American River forks, to the rolling hills and upland plateaus above Folsom Lake, to the bluffs and broad river plain of Lake Natoma. … the resulting lakefront setting affords visitors with dramatic panoramas of the lakes, the surrounding natural landscape, and cultural resource features.” The plan identifies a visual resources goal of, “[p]rotection and enhancement of views and distinctive landscape features that contribute to the SRA's setting, character, and visitor experience.”

Visual Protection guidelines/policies in the Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP include:

Visual-2: Work with local jurisdictions in the land use planning and development process to protect key views in the SRA from continued visual intrusion from surrounding development. This will include appropriate general planned land use designations, zoning to regulate such matters as building height and setbacks, ridgeline protection ordinances that help protect visual resources of the SRA, and rigorous development review and enforcement.

Page 9 of 12
<!-- Page 126 -->
SMUD’s IS/MND makes no mention of the Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP or its visual resources protection goals and guidelines/policies and, therefore, fails to provide any analysis of the Project’s potential to conflict with relevant goals and guidelines/policies. With regard to guideline Visual-2 quoted above, the guideline establishes the important role of coordination among local agencies and State Parks for land use planning and development to protect key views in the SRA from visual intrusion from surrounding development. Yet, with SMUD’s apparent neglect to consider the Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP and foster the intended coordination specified in Visual-2, it appears that the land use planning coordination envisioned by Visual-2 has not occurred. Visual-2 anticipates “rigorous development review and enforcement,” yet SMUD’s intent to request variances from the City of Folsom to allow SMUD’s proposed tower to exceed applicable Development Standard height regulations is clearly in conflict with rigorous enforcement of established development standards. Thus, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, the IS/MND analysis must conclude that the Project would conflict with Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP policies intended for visual resources protection and consider this a significant visual impact and land use plan conflict.

Without identifying Folsom Lake SRA GP/RMP guidelines/policies associated with avoiding/reducing environmental impacts, SMUD has not met its CEQA obligation to assess the Project's potential to conflict with such policies.

6. The IS/MND Fails to Disclose and Mitigate for Impacts to Trees Protected Under the City of Folsom Tree Preservation Ordinance

The IS/MND Biological Resources section discusses that, “[t]he Project could result in the removal of a few trees that are currently within the Project site. However, pursuant to subsection 12.16.050(C)(11) of the Folsom Municipal Code, SMUD is exempt from the requirements of City’s Tree Preservation Ordinance, as a public utility performing tree removal activities to maintain a safe operation of SMUD facilities.”

First, the Biological Resources Assessment (BRA) (IS/MND Appendix B) and IS/MND evaluation of potential impacts to protect trees is incomplete. The BRA discusses that, “[t]he proposed Project could require the removal of a few interior live oak trees that are currently within the Project site. If these trees are proposed for removal, an arborist survey should be conducted to determine the diameter at breast height (DBH) and assess the proposed Project impacts.” This analysis fails to disclose and assess tree removal and the impacts of tree removal. According to the IS/MND conceptual site plan (Figure 4), the entire Project site would be graded/developed for the Project and any existing trees would require removal. Additionally, the grading could affect the root zones of trees adjacent to the site, resulting in damage to or loss of those adjacent trees. While this loss would have biological resource impacts that also need to be assessed and disclosed, SARA is particularly concerned with the visual impact associated with the loss of native vegetation and oak trees. SMUD’s analysis must evaluate and disclose the Project’s actual impact on native vegetation, including oak trees and other trees on and near the property.

Additionally, although the IS/MND asserts that the Project is not subject to the City's Tree Preservation Ordinance, the cited exception provision is for "public and private utilities performing tree pruning or removal activities as is necessary to maintain a safe operation of their facilities." While SMUD might want the Project to be exempt

Page 10 of 12
<!-- Page 127 -->
![Document](https://example.com/document-image)  
from the tree preservation ordinance, the IS/MND does not provide sufficient rationale to support the assertion that the Project qualifies for this exemption. The City's tree preservation ordinance requires that a tree defined as “protected” under the Ordinance cannot be approved for removal unless a finding is made that, “there are no Reasonable Alternative Measures to allow for use of the property consistent with the Zoning Code.” Without evidence of a basis for how such a finding could be made, SMUD must seek reasonable alternative measures to preserve any trees on the site that fit the category of "protected" under the City's ordinance.  

Folsom Municipal Code section 12.16.010 expresses the purpose and intent of the Tree Preservation Ordinance as follows:  

A. Purpose. Trees are both community and environmental assets, unique in their ability to provide a multitude of benefits that appreciate over time. In addition to many others, these benefits include life-giving oxygen, filtration of air pollutants, protection from heat and ultra-violet radiation, energy savings, reduced Heat Island effect, habitat for wildlife, carbon sequestration, and improvement of property values. The purpose of this chapter is to advance these aesthetic, economic, environmental, and social contributions of the City’s Urban Forest through the creation and preservation of tree resources. In order to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, enhance the beauty of Folsom and to complement and strengthen zoning, subdivision and land use standards and regulations, while at the same time recognizing individual rights to develop private property, the City Council finds it necessary to establish standards and measures for the preservation of trees.  

The Project’s impact to protected trees must be evaluated, disclosed, and mitigated sufficient to avoid significant biological and visual impacts.  

7. The IS/MND Fails to Acknowledge the Presence of and Potential Impacts to Nesting Bald Eagles  
The IS/MND fails to acknowledge the presence of an active bald eagle nest within less than 1 mile and in direct line of sight of SMUD's proposed tower. Effects on foraging habitat, potential eagle interaction/injury associated with the tower, or other impacts to the nesting eagles would not just be a biological resources impact, but would also have a detrimental effect on the aesthetic benefit that the presence of the eagle nest and eagles provide to the Lake Natoma area. (Photographs and information about these eagles, including a spreadsheet with observations of eagle activities this spring and summer is available at the following publicly accessible website: https://folfonaeaglecam.org/) Without a proposed design of the tower (e.g., guy wires, placement of dishes/antenna, etc.) and without assessing potential effects on bald eagle associated with the presence of the tower and the loss of  
Page 11 of 12  
<!-- Page 128 -->
foraging habitat on the Project site, SMUD cannot definitely determine potential effects on the nesting eagles.  
**Conclusion**  
For the reasons discussed above, SARA objects to the Project as currently described and evaluated, and urges SMUD to conduct a more thorough assessment of the aesthetic/visual impacts of the Project and to consider alternatives to the proposed 100-foot tower.

# Board Monitoring Report 2024  
## SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management  

### 1. Background  
Strategic Direction 17 states that:  
Effectively balancing and managing risk to further SMUD’s policies and business goals is a core value of SMUD.  

Therefore:  
SMUD will implement and maintain an integrated enterprise risk management process that identifies, assesses, prudently manages, and mitigates a variety of risks facing SMUD, including financial, supply, operational, physical and cyber security, climate change, legal, legislative and regulatory, and reputational risk.  

### 2. Executive summary  
SMUD is in compliance with SD-17 Enterprise Risk Management. SMUD strategically manages risk to proactively reduce the chance of loss and take advantage of opportunities that support SMUD’s mission. In addition, as presented to the Policy Committee in June 2024, SMUD is maturing its risk management framework and reporting structure, the results of which will be presented to the Board in 2025 through Policy Committee updates ahead of the next Annual Monitoring Report.  

In preparation for the 2024 Annual Monitoring Report, staff interviewed and surveyed management to determine current risk levels. Enterprise risks are assessed by impact, likelihood and velocity to determine residual risk, or the risk remaining after mitigations and internal controls have been implemented.  

Overall, SMUD’s residual risk exposure has remained steady at medium/high. In many cases, the probability or potential impact of an adverse event increased, but SMUD leveraged its risk framework successfully to introduce new controls or mitigations that allowed the residual risk level to stay the same.  

Summarized below is the current Residual Risk Exposure over a three-year period.  

| Residual Risk Exposure | Nov. 2022 | Nov. 2023 | Nov. 2024 |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| “Red”: Extremely High Residual Exposure | 0         | 0         | 0         |
| “Orange”: High Residual Exposure | 6         | 5         | 5         |
| “Yellow”: Medium Residual Exposure | 39        | 40        | 41        |
| “Green”: Low Residual Exposure | 38        | 40        | 39        |
| “Blue”: Extremely Low Residual Exposure | 0         | 0         | 0         |
| **Total** | **83**    | **85**    | **85**    |

Although the counts remain the same from 2023 to 2024, we had two changes to risk levels:  
- Business agility – Changed from “Yellow” or medium to “Green” or low  
- Demand response – Changed from “Green” or low to “Yellow” or medium

Changes to SMUD’s risk landscape this year include increased cyber events, physical security concerns, disruptive technology, global and political unrest, supply chain shortages, and continued unprecedented weather events. SMUD is focused on building resiliency measures into our enterprise risk management practices to be better able to monitor and respond to hazards or uncertainties and adapt to a rapidly changing risk landscape.

### 3. Additional Supporting Information

#### A. 2024 Risk Management Highlights

In 2024, ERM continued to:
- support the organization by facilitating risk conversations, supporting special projects, and providing a uniform risk framework
- enhance cross-functional discussion and thorough understanding of major risk issues by leveraging five committees, including the Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee (EROC), Risk Champions Network (RCN), Trading Operations Risk Committee (TORC), Zero Carbon Plan Steering Committee, and the Three Lines Working Team

In terms of new efforts, ERM began a refresh of its risk framework to better anticipate and accommodate our changing risk landscape. Internal Audit Services and KPMG, a global consulting firm, completed a maturity assessment of SMUD’s Enterprise Risk Management program in April 2024 to identify potential areas for improvement. Results from the maturity assessment were presented to the Policy Committee in June 2024. SMUD incorporated several changes into how we manage enterprise risk in support of their recommendations. To that end, SMUD:
- realigned the Enterprise Risk Management function with Strategy
- created the new Enterprise Strategy & Risk team under the Chief Financial Officer
- hired and onboarded a new Enterprise Risk Program Manager
- aligned and coordinated commodity risk reporting with overall enterprise risk reporting on a quarterly basis
- continued to support decision-making during the enterprise prioritization, planning and budget process
- Created a plan for further ERM enhancements and implementation of KPMG recommendations in 2025

In addition, SMUD completed several efforts in 2024 to reduce the impact of risk in the areas of reliability, safety and supply chain. Highlights of those efforts are provided below.

![Contractor Code of Conduct](https://example.com/image.png)

**Contractor Code of Conduct**  
In 2024, staff implemented a new Contractor Code of Conduct to help mitigate supply chain risk and continue providing a safe, reliable and sustainable grid for the future. The Code of Conduct outlines how staff will recruit contractors – and their employees and subcontractors – who share SMUD’s vision. With their collaboration, SMUD is aiming to create a supply chain that collectively contributes to building a greener, more sustainable future. The Code of Conduct outlines specific guidelines that ensure compliance with; laws, rules and regulations, labor and human rights, environmental and social, health and safety, diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, and ethics and compliance.

**CrowdStrike Response**  
In July 2024, SMUD was one of many entities affected by a worldwide CrowdStrike information technology (IT) outage, which impacted Microsoft Windows applications. Staff acted promptly to alert support teams and communicate the cause and the solution. IT teams moved swiftly, prioritizing our most important systems and working through the night to bring systems back online. Due to our internal teams’ hard work and dedication, systems were back online quickly, and we were fully recovered in a matter of days, without having to pay for external recovery specialist services. The incident demonstrated the successful operation of our controls around business continuity, which is an Enterprise Risk.

**Storm Response Team**  
For a second year in a row, extreme weather interrupted power to thousands of SMUD customers as strong winds gusted persistently for several hours in February 2024. However, preparations conducted over the prior year significantly improved our speed of restoration and accuracy of estimated restoration times. SMUD was able to provide customers with new status information, letting them know when crews were scheduled to restore their power and when crews arrived on site. More staff was placed in the field by leveraging pre-existing contracts, training meter and substation staff to respond to damage reports and calling on retired annuitants. We used new technologies and processes to synthesize the data coming back to rapidly build a restoration schedule and were able to track and beat the schedule over the recovery period. This storm provided a first test of the improvements we implemented last year and showed significant impact to our customers' experiences. We will continue to build on these successes and iteratively enhance the processes for next year.

**Supply Chain Enhancements**  
Several enhancements were completed in 2024 to reduce the impact of supply chain shortages on SMUD’s operations. Staff held regular recurring business review and demand planning meetings across several operational areas primarily focused on construction, material, and equipment contractors. Staff also implemented two multi-million bulk purchasing efforts, the first to bring on additional substation resources at 200 million and the second to decrease the cost and lead times of transformers at 250 million.

**Insurance Recovery**  
To mitigate the financial impact of business disruption risks such as asset outages, SMUD has commercial insurance policies. In 2024, SMUD completed collections on two large insurance claims. We received final settlement of the Consumers Power Plant (CPP) business interruption claim resulting in recovery of an additional $88.9 million in 2024, for a total claim recovery of $152 million (equipment loss and business interruption). This year SMUD also finished collecting the $7.5 million insurance payout for the Station A fire in 2021. These funds offset prior costs and will support lower rate increases going forward.

**B. Benchmarking**

North Carolina State University’s (NCSU) Enterprise Risk Management Initiative and Protiviti continue to jointly publish benchmark information. The joint study, 2024 & 2034 Executive Perspectives on Top Risks, provides insight for short-term and long-term risks from 1,443 global board members and executives from across several industries.

Overall, the study found that risks are becoming increasingly interrelated and pose significant challenges to current business models and the ability of modern organizations to be resilient and agile. As the risks associated with the pandemic subside, concerns around several emerging risks and uncertainty in the world is causing risk exposure to rise. Today’s executive concerns continue to be focused on cybersecurity, third-party, talent and workforce management, and political and economic uncertainty, but the emerging risks associated with disruptive technologies, climate change, and regulatory changes are changing how risk is managed. Specific to the energy and utility industry, executives are more focused on the operational risks around cybersecurity, supply chain and weather-related risks, but found that their organizations were becoming more adaptable and better able to respond to events. In addition to operational concerns, the risks associated with regulatory and legislative changes ranked high for energy and utility leaders. Attachment B compares SMUD’s top enterprise risks to the top 10 Energy and Utility risks identified in NCSU and Protiviti study.

**C. Risk Focus Areas & Global Risk Trends**

As described in last year’s SD-17 Annual Report, SMUD leaders selected 16 risk focus areas in 2023. Risk focus areas have a high potential to impact the achievement of SMUD’s goals and strategic objectives in the upcoming year and are therefore areas of emphasis for our risk committees and investment decisions. This year, SMUD added two risks, Changing Customer Expectations and Grid Infrastructure and Operational Adequacy, for a total of 18 risk focus areas.

Attachment A outlines each risk focus area and the actions that have been taken to address these risks. Provided below is a synopsis of increasing global risk since the 2023 Board update that may cause risk focus areas to trend upward. These changes are also examples of the type of information tracked and reported by SMUD’s risk management functions.

Global risk trends impacting SMUD’s 2023-2024 risk focus areas:

- **Political and Regulatory Uncertainty:** There are potential effects of the upcoming November elections on the energy industry, specifically related to grant funding and regulation changes. Moreover, at the State level there are ever-evolving regulations as California manages the energy transition. This creates a level of uncertainty that deserves attention. Reliably delivering zero carbon power in an increasingly interconnected energy landscape will require coordination and collaboration between federal and state policy makers, regulators, owners, and operators.

- **Climate Change and Severe Weather:** Climate change continues to pose some of the biggest areas of uncertainty. Four characteristics make it especially impactful amongst other risks. That is its global nature, its long-term consequences, the fact that it is potentially irreversible, and the almost overwhelming uncertainty surrounding its progression and effects.

- **Third-Party and Supply Chain Risk:** Uncertainty around supply chain issues in the energy and utility industry has diminished since its peak during the pandemic. However, concerns remain high given how the energy industry’s value chain is highly service, feedstock, parts, and equipment oriented. Disruptions related to global events such as

![Board Monitoring Report – SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management](https://example.com/image.png)

geopolitical tensions or labor strikes at the Ports threaten to inhibit a utility’s ability to secure the equipment needed to maintain existing and build new infrastructure. Additionally, there is risk in testing new business models working with untested partners as the grid is modernized.

- **Physical and Cybersecurity Threats:** An increasingly modernized grid creates a larger physical and digital footprint, which in turn elevates exposure to physical and cybersecurity threats. On a national scale, there are an increasing number of reports of both physical and cybersecurity attacks against utilities from domestic terrorists. Lastly, while the recent acceleration of artificial intelligence provides prospective benefits, it also likely adds another dimension for use by bad actors.
  
- **Changing Customer Expectations:** Customer preferences are changing at a faster rate than they have in the past due to the prevalence of social media and more granular segmentation data. Additionally, customers continue to be impacted by the inflationary pressures introduced during the pandemic, which can increase energy bill burden, especially for certain communities. Lastly, as technological advances continue to accelerate, organizations are under more and more pressure to meet customers’ evolving needs.

Staff reviews available enterprise risk-related information, including global risk trends such as those above, and incorporates new risk issues and/or expands existing risk issues where appropriate.

**D. Looking forward**

In 2025, ERM will work with leaders to refresh the enterprise risk management framework. The refreshed framework will include improvements in standardization, prioritization, aggregation and interconnectedness of risks as recommended by KPMG. Included in the refreshed framework will also be a discussion of emerging risks impacting the organization.

**4. Challenges**

Today’s risk environment is increasingly becoming more complex, interconnected and crisis-driven. How we manage risk will need to evolve in response. As we refresh the enterprise risk management framework, we will be challenged to look holistically across the organization to identify and mitigate risk cross-functionally. Moving to an approach that identifies and manages risk both from a top-down and bottom-up perspective will improve risk governance across the enterprise, our ability to identify and manage emerging risks, and provide management with improved quantitative tools to make resource decisions.

**5. Recommendation**

It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management.

| Operational:  | Power generation asset reliability     | 2022: 🟢              | 2023: 🟢    | 2024: ➡️  | Staff has established processes to manage unexpected disruption to power generation and/or non-performance from power and gas contractual assets that threaten to cause partial or complete cessation of the day-to-day bulk power operations of SMUD. Staff continues to assess the reliability of SMUD’s assets and performs standard maintenance and rebuilds where necessary to meet SMUD’s current and future needs. In addition, staff continues to acquire critical long lead spare equipment and identify appropriate renewables resources in support of SMUD’s zero carbon goals. See renewables projects for additional information. |
| External      | Regulatory/legislative mandates        | 2022: 🟡              | 2023: 🟡    | 2024: ⬆️  | Staff continues to monitor and stay apprised of all regulatory/legislative mandates that have the potential to impact SMUD. SMUD anticipates this risk increasing in 2025 due to the potential effects of the upcoming November elections on the energy industry, specifically related to grant funding and regulation changes. At the State level, staff continue to monitor potential state mandates that impact SMUD’s zero carbon strategy. In 2024, staff continued to identify appropriate resources to meet SMUD’s needs and move SMUD closer towards the achievement of its zero carbon goals. Planned diversification of proven clean technologies and new technologies and business model evaluations ensure that the right projects and programs are selected to meet SMUD’s goals in a reliable and affordable manner. |
| Strategic      | Renewable projects                     | 2022: 🟡              | 2023: ⬜️    | 2024: ➡️  | SMUD continues to seek risk increase in the renewable portfolio related to supply chain, land acquisition, development timelines, and cost. SMUD worked to alleviate these risks in 2024 by implementing a new land procurement process and several portfolio management enhancements that work to proactively identify and mitigate risk. In 2025, staff will continue the development of the renewable portfolio and has received prioritization from the organization to execute those projects. |

| Risk Category | Risk | Year on Year Changes | Risk Trend | Target | Risk Mitigation Activity |
|---------------|------|----------------------|------------|--------|--------------------------|
| External      | Severe weather (incl wind, heat, lightning, capacity) | ⚪ ⚪ ⚪ | ➔ | ⚪ | Climate change increases the frequency, intensity, and impacts of extreme weather events. These impacts have a high potential to impact SMUD’s goals and operations. SMUD has conducted lessons learned after events and used those lessons to make process changes and plan for future events. Staff continues to conduct tabletop exercises for a number of hazard events such as storms, wildfires, heat waves, and gas pipeline to name a few. Doing so helps SMUD proactively identify gaps and address them, preparing SMUD for future events. |
| Operational: People | Strategic workforce planning: critical positions | ⚪ ⚪ ⚪ | ➔ | 🟢 | Staff conduct a bi-annual enterprise-wide role analysis to anticipate and mitigate risks of near-term and future workforce gaps. SMUD’s Organizational Effectiveness team facilitates the strategic workforce planning program, enabling senior leaders and team members to analyze workforce data and consider several criteria to identify key roles, including impact on strategy, turnover, cost of turnover, level of effort to backfill, operational impact, customer service impact, and performance variability. <br> In Q2 2024 we identified 7% of SMUD roles, or 57 total, as key roles and documented the rationale for selection as key. In Q3 we developed action plans to address workforce gaps in key roles. <br> Action plans encompass 79 different solutions to mitigate current and future risks associated with the key roles. Action plans range in complexity – some are relatively simple where a role has a single incumbent and requires knowledge transfer and cross training. Action plans can be much more complex. For example, in 2023 SMUD launched a robust Field Leader Program to address challenges in the transition from field to office. Action plans may identify the need for a new role. For example, in Energy Trading and Contracts, we’re developing a new Market Performance Analytics role to help address the increased volatility of commodities markets. |

Staff held regular recurring business review and demand planning meetings across several operational areas primarily focused on construction, material, and equipment contractors, including line transmission and distribution, substations, material planning, fleet, power generation, and facilities. These meetings were expanded to include additional areas with professional service and technology contractors during 2024. Staff established bulk purchasing agreements, new business service levels and replacement stock to reduce costs and lead procurement times.                                                                 |

Staff has developed updated solicitations and contract information including updated performance scorecards and procedures to support this effort. Supply chain staff recommends involving senior leadership in this process for the top vendors measured by spend and criticality annually.                                                                                     |

**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and award contracts to Utility Tree Service LLC, Mountain F. Enterprises Inc., Community Tree Service LLC, Rancho Tree Service, Greentek Services LLC, and Asmone Environmental Restoration Industry LLC for Vegetation Management – Utility Line Clearance Services for a contract term of three years from November 22, 2024, to November 21, 2027, with two optional one-year extensions, for a total aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount of $250 million.

**Summary:**  
Request for Proposals No. Doc4621886315 (RFP) was issued in June 2024 to solicit qualified firms to provide all supervision, labor, materials, equipment, and incidentals necessary to perform right-of-way vegetation maintenance work on SMUD’s Transmission and Distribution Systems on a task order basis. A pre-proposal conference was held on June 27, 2024, of which 28 contractors attended. On July 26, 2024, SMUD received 22 proposals of which 19 were responsive and three were non-responsive.

SMUD engaged in multiple rounds of negotiations with the top 13 proposers to arrive at the recommendation to award contracts to the six highest evaluated responsive proposers. Staff plans to utilize the two highest evaluated proposers, Utility Tree Service LLC, and Mountain F. Enterprises Inc., as the primary contractors performing the full scope of vegetation management utility line clearance maintenance work and storm restoration. Staff expects to utilize the proposers ranked there through six as secondary contractors on an as-needed basis should SMUD need additional resources. Any adjustments to primary and secondary contractor utilization made by staff over the term of the contract will be based on factors such as alignment with SMUD’s operational needs and/or contract availability and performance.

**Primary Contractors**

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize SMUD’s Accountant to defer recognition of $121 million of 2024 operating revenues to offset the following 1) $20 million future Community Impact Plan expenditures through 2028, 2) $60 million for future unexpected increases in Commodity expenditures through 2030 and 3) $41 million for future one-time specific expenditures in order to match such expenditures in the appropriate accounting period for rate-making purposes.

**Summary:**  
Pursuant to Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) codification section Re10 Regulated Operations, staff is recommending that the Board authorize a total deferral of $121.0 million of 2024 operating revenues as a regulatory liability for recognition in future years for the following expenditures:

1) A $20 million of deferred operating revenues will be utilized to offset future Community Impact Plan expenditures through 2028. This utilization of deferred revenues is in line with the plan to offset additional 2030 Zero Carbon Plan spending for pilots and programs.

2) A $60 million of deferred operating revenues will be utilized for future unplanned increases in Commodity expenditures through 2030 that will have a negative impact to net income. This deferral will provide reserves to cover large fluctuations in the commodity market that may have a significant financial impact on SMUD.

3) A $41 million of deferred operating revenues will help offset one-time expenditures that were not identified during the annual budget process. SMUD will be able to mitigate risks that may occur from unforeseen or one-time events which may have a significant financial impact on SMUD, such as, but not limited to, catastrophic events, wildfire costs and additional 2030 Zero Carbon Plan expenditures. This deferral will provide reserves to cover large contingencies while limiting or leveling out the impact of cost increases to rate payers.

These deferrals will allow for appropriate matching of revenue with expense recognition for rate-making purposes.

**Board Policy (Number & Title)**  
SD-2, Competitive Rates - allows SMUD to limit or level the impact of increases in rates.

**Benefits:**  
This accounting treatment will offset any negative significant financial impacts of unforeseen or one-time events which could have an impact on rate payers.

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
N/A

**Alternatives:**  
Recognize as operating revenues when received. When unforeseen expenditures occur in the future, the additional costs could lead to increases to SMUD rate payers.

Accounting, Budget, Treasury

**RESOLUTION NO. ______________**

WHEREAS, Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) codification section Re10 Regulated Operations allows the deferral of operating revenues from the current period to a future period as a regulatory liability for rate-making purposes; and

WHEREAS, this deferral will i) help offset $20 million of future Community Impact Plan expenditures through 2028 and is in line with the plan to offset additional 2030 Zero Carbon Plan spending for pilots and programs, ii) use $60 million for future unplanned increases in Commodity expenditures through 2030 that will have a negative impact to net income and provide reserves to cover large fluctuations in the commodity market that may have a significant financial impact on SMUD, and iii) help offset $41 million of onetime expenditures not identified during the annual budget process; and

WHEREAS, the deferral will help mitigate risks that may occur from unforeseen or onetime events that may have a significant financial impact on SMUD, such as, but not limited to, catastrophic events, wildfire costs, and additional 2030 Zero Carbon Plan expenditures; and

WHEREAS, providing reserves should leveling out the impact of future cost increases on ratepayers; and

WHEREAS, standard or default accounting practices would be to recognize the revenues and expenses in the accounting period incurred; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to GASB codification section Re10 Regulated Operations, for ratemaking purposes, it would be appropriate to match the expenses

with the revenues so that the revenue is recognized in the same period in which the amount is expended and will, therefore, more accurately reflect revenues and expenses in the same period; NOW, THEREFORE,

BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT:

That this Board authorizes SMUD’s Accountant to defer recognition of $121 million of 2024 operating revenues to offset the following: 1) $20 million future Community Impact Plan expenditures through 2028; 2) $60 million for future unexpected increases in Commodity expenditures through 2030; and 3) $41 million for future onetime specific expenditures in order to match such expenditures in the appropriate accounting period for ratemaking purposes.

**NARRATIVE:**  
**Requested Action:** Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his designee, to negotiate and execute the following:  

a. A power purchase agreement with Hatchet Ridge Wind, LLC for a 7-year term for 101.2 MW of renewable wind power at an annual approximate cost of $24 million, substantially in the form attached.  

b. A power purchase agreement with SunZia Wind PowerCo, LLC (SunZia) for a 15-year term for 150 MW of renewable wind power at an annual approximate cost of $41 million, substantially in the form attached; and subsequent replacement power purchase agreement(s) with a Pattern Energy, LLC subsidiary to address project investment capital needs, under substantially the same terms and conditions as the SunZia original power purchase agreement.  

**Summary:**  
SMUD received non-binding indications of interest from Pattern Energy, LLC (Pattern) for the Hatchet Ridge Wind and SunZia Wind Projects in 2023. SMUD conducted an evaluation of the market and determined that these projects provided superior value and key solutions compared to available alternatives for meeting our 2030 Zero Carbon Plan and California Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) compliance. SMUD and Pattern negotiated mutually beneficial power purchase agreements (PPAs) under which SMUD will purchase the energy, capacity attributes, and Portfolio Content Category 1 Renewable Energy Credits (PCC RECs). The two PPAs are offered by Pattern as a package deal and are therefore contingent on each other.  

a. Hatchet Ridge Wind Project, owned and operated by Hatchet Ridge Wind, LLC, is located in Northern California and is an existing wind facility interconnected to the California Independent System Operator Corporation (CAISO) grid. The renewable generation project has a capacity of 101.2 MW and will provide approximately 270,000 MWh annually. The contract start date for the PPA is December 14, 2025, and has a term of seven years. The approximate annual cost of the PPA is $24M.  

b. SunZia Wind Project, owned and operated by SunZia Wind PowerCo, LLC, and the associated SunZia Transmission Project, are located in New Mexico and Arizona and will combine to create the largest clean energy infrastructure project in the United States history at more than 3,500 MW split between a northern portion (SunZia North) and southern portion (SunZia South). SMUD’s share of the overall project is 150 MW of capacity which will be part of the CAISO Balancing Authority Area and provide approximately 490,000 MWh annually. The PPA’s expected commercial operation date is April 30, 2026, and has a term of 15 years. The approximate annual cost of the PPA is $41M.  

Given the unique size of the SunZia Wind Project, Pattern intends to separate the project into different portions and sell all or a part of the ownership interests to an outside investor to facilitate capital needs.

Buyer represents that deliveries of Product under this Agreement are not required to comply with such requirements.

3.11 California Renewables Portfolio Standard. Upon request of Buyer, Seller shall provide records or other information reasonably required to demonstrate that the Product has been conveyed and delivered in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, subject to Section 3.12, scheduling or delivery information necessary to meet the requirements of the California Renewables Portfolio Standard for the Product.

(“Compliance Expenditure Cap”)

(a) CEC Certification and Verification;

(b) Green Attributes;

(c) WREGIS; and

(d) Capacity Attributes.

Any actions required for Seller to comply with its obligations set forth in the first paragraph above, the cost of which will be included in the Compliance Expenditure Cap, shall be referred to collectively as the “Compliance Actions.”

If Seller reasonably anticipates the need to incur out-of-pocket expenses in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap in order to take any Compliance Action, Seller shall provide Notice to Buyer of such anticipated out-of-pocket expenses.

Buyer will have ninety (90) days to evaluate such Notice (during which time period Seller is not obligated to take any Compliance Actions described in the Notice) and shall, within such time, either (1) agree to reimburse Seller for all or some portion of the costs that exceed the Compliance Expenditure Cap (such Buyer-agreed upon costs, the “Accepted Compliance Costs”), or (2) waive Seller’s obligation to take such Compliance Actions, or any part thereof, for which Buyer has not agreed to reimburse Seller. If Buyer does not respond to a Notice given by Seller under this Section 3.12 within ninety (90) days after Buyer’s receipt of same, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its rights to require Seller to take the Compliance Actions that are the
<!-- Page 201 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
subject of the Notice, and Seller shall have no further obligations to take, and no liability for a failure to take, such Compliance Actions for the remainder of the Term

; provided, however, that Buyer shall have the right to reconsider Compliance Actions that have been rejected or waived pursuant to this paragraph at any time; provided further, upon Buyer’s written request in connection with such reconsideration, Seller shall provide Notice to Buyer with an updated estimate of the anticipated out-of-pocket expenses to take the reconsidered Compliance Action. Within ninety (90) days after Buyer’s receipt of Seller’s Notice, Buyer shall agree to reimburse Seller for the Accepted Compliance Costs or waive Seller’s obligation to take the reconsidered Compliance Actions, or any part thereof, for which Buyer does not agree to reimburse Seller; provided, if Buyer does not reply within such ninety (90) day period Buyer shall be deemed to have waived Seller’s obligation to take such Compliance Actions.

If Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for the Accepted Compliance Costs, then Seller shall take such Compliance Actions covered by the Accepted Compliance Costs as agreed upon by Buyer and Buyer shall reimburse Seller for Seller’s actual costs to effectuate the Compliance Actions, not to exceed the Accepted Compliance Costs, within sixty (60) days from the time that Buyer receives an invoice and documentation of such costs from Seller. If Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for the Accepted Compliance Costs for less than all of the costs that exceed the Compliance Expenditure Cap, Seller shall only be obligated to take the Compliance Actions covered by the Accepted Compliance Costs.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, any increases in Seller in excess of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) per year to comply with requirements regarding Capacity Attributes (including Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity) established by Buyer, or any Person vested with the authority under applicable Law to require Buyer to procure resource adequacy or other such products, over and above Seller’s costs to comply with CAISO and/or CPUC requirements as to Resource Adequacy Benefits as of the Effective Date (“Buyer Capacity Compliance Costs”), shall be excluded from the Compliance Expenditure Cap. If Buyer desires Seller to comply with any requirements regarding Capacity Attributes (including Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity) that differ from CAISO and/or CPUC requirements as described in the prior sentence, Buyer shall be responsible for payment of all such Buyer Capacity Compliance Costs.

The terms and conditions of this Section 3.12 with respect to Seller expenses in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to all Buyer Capacity Compliance Costs.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement: (i) Seller shall be under no obligation to take any action to comply with such requirements as could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact upon Seller’s ability to own, operate, or maintain the Facility; and (ii) if at any time, pursuant to (a) the then-current CAISO Tariff, (b) the rules or regulations of Buyer or any Person vested with the authority under applicable Law to require Buyer to procure resource adequacy or other such products, or (c) other applicable Law, the transfer and/or delivery to Buyer of Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity associated with the Facility is not permitted, then: Seller shall have no further obligation hereunder to deliver Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity to Buyer; Seller shall not be required to incur any costs or expenses in connection with delivery of Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity to Buyer; such non-delivery of Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity

(e) A “WREGIS Certificate Deficit” means any deficit or shortfall in WREGIS Certificates delivered to Buyer for a calendar month as compared to the Delivered Energy for the same calendar month (“Deficient Month”). If any WREGIS Certificate Deficit is caused, or the result of any action or inaction, by Seller, then the amount of Delivered Energy in the Deficient Month shall be reduced on a pro rata basis across all Settlement Periods in such Deficient Month by the amount of the WREGIS Certificate Deficit for purposes of calculating Buyer’s payment to Seller under Article 8 and the Guaranteed Energy Production for the applicable Performance Measurement Period; provided, however, that such adjustment shall not apply to the extent that after the ninety (90) days attributed to the delay in the creation of WREGIS Certificates for such Deficient Month, Seller either (x) resolves the WREGIS Certificate Deficit within an additional one hundred eighty (180) days or (y) provides Replacement Green Attributes within an additional one hundred eighty (180) days (i) upon a schedule reasonably acceptable to Buyer and (ii) provided that such deliveries do not impose additional costs upon Buyer for which Seller refuses to provide reimbursement. If the amount of Delivered Energy in the Deficient Month is reduced in accordance with the prior sentence and neither (x) nor (y) of the prior sentence apply, Buyer shall pay Seller for any Delivered Energy that is delivered by Seller without corresponding WREGIS Certificates at a price equal to the lesser of (i) the Contract Price, or (ii) the LMP in the Day-Ahead Market at the Delivery Point, and for purposes of the Guaranteed Energy Production, Delivered Energy is reduced by the amount of the WREGIS Certificate Deficit for the applicable Performance Measurement Period. Without limiting Seller’s obligations under this Section 4.8, if a WREGIS Certificate Deficit is caused solely by an error or omission of WREGIS, Delivered Energy shall not be reduced pursuant to this Section 4.8(e) and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to cause WREGIS to correct its error or omission.

(f) If WREGIS changes the WREGIS Operating Rules after the Effective Date or applies the WREGIS Operating Rules in a manner inconsistent with this Section 4.8 after the Effective Date, the Parties promptly shall modify this Section 4.8 as reasonably required to cause and enable Seller to transfer to Buyer’s WREGIS Account a quantity of WREGIS Certificates for each given calendar month that corresponds to the Delivered Energy in the same calendar month.

4.9 Standard of Care. Seller shall be responsible for designing, installing, operating, and maintaining the Facility (including all associated costs) in accordance with all applicable Law, and shall comply with all applicable WECC, RC West, FERC and NERC requirements, and with Prudent Operating Practice, including applicable interconnection and telemetering requirements set forth in the Interconnection Agreement.

Seller shall ensure that: (a) operation and maintenance of the Project is conducted in a safe manner in accordance with the Interconnection Agreement and Prudent Industry Practice; and (b) any governmental authorizations and permits required for the operation thereof are maintained. Consistent with (a) above, Seller shall ensure that any necessary and commercially reasonable repairs are made to the Facility.

Seller acknowledges receipt of SMUD’s Principles of Renewable Energy Development as expressed in Exhibit M, attached and incorporated herein. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to abide by the project-specific obligations identified in the “Communities Benefits Plan” as further described in Exhibit M, to the extent applicable to and feasible for the Facility as reasonably determined by Seller.

# ARTICLE 5  
## TAXES  

5.1 **Allocation of Taxes and Charges.** Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes on or with respect to the Facility or on or with respect to the sale and delivery of Product to Buyer, that are imposed on Product prior to the Delivery Point. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes on or with respect to the delivery to and purchase by Buyer of the Product that are imposed on Product at and from the Delivery Point (other than withholding or other Taxes imposed on Seller’s income, revenue, receipts or employees). If a Party is required to remit or pay Taxes that are the other Party’s responsibility hereunder, such Party shall promptly pay the Taxes due and then seek and receive reimbursement from the other for such Taxes. In the event any sale of Product hereunder is exempt from or not subject to any particular Tax, the exempted Party shall provide the other Party with all necessary documentation within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date to evidence such exemption or exclusion. If the exempted Party does not provide such documentation, then such Party shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party from any liability with respect to Taxes from which the exempted Party claims it is exempt.  

5.2 **Cooperation.** Each Party shall use reasonable efforts to implement the provisions of and administer this Agreement in accordance with the intent of the Parties to minimize all Taxes, so long as no Party is materially adversely affected by such efforts. The Parties shall cooperate to minimize Tax exposure; provided, however, that neither Party shall be obligated to incur any financial or operational burden to reduce Taxes for which the other Party is responsible hereunder without receiving due compensation therefor from the other Party. All Energy delivered by Seller to Buyer hereunder shall be a sale made at wholesale, with Buyer reselling such Energy.  

# ARTICLE 6  
## MAINTENANCE OF THE FACILITY  

6.1 **Maintenance of the Facility.** Seller shall comply with Law and Prudent Operating Practice relating to the operation and maintenance of the Facility and the generation and sale of Product.  

6.2 **Maintenance of Health and Safety.** Seller shall take reasonable safety precautions with respect to the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the Facility. If Seller becomes aware of any circumstances relating to the Facility that create an imminent risk of damage or injury to any Person or any Person’s property, Seller shall take prompt, reasonable action to prevent such damage or injury and shall give Buyer’s emergency contact identified on Exhibit K Notice of such condition. Such action may include disconnecting and removing all or a portion of the Facility, or suspending the supply of Energy to Buyer.  

6.3 **Shared Facilities.** The Parties acknowledge and agree that certain of the Interconnection Facilities, Seller’s rights and obligations under the Interconnection Agreement and Seller’s rights and obligations under transmission service agreements with a Transmission Provider, may at some point be subject to certain shared facilities and/or co-tenancy agreements (“Shared Facilities Agreements”) to be entered into among two or more of Seller, the Participating Transmission Owner, Seller’s Affiliates, and/or third parties pursuant to which

**ARTICLE 7  
METERING**

7.1 **Metering.** Seller shall measure the amount of Delivered Energy produced by the Facility using an Approved Meter. The Approved Meter shall be installed at the switching station PG&E’s Pit #3 – Round Mountain 230 kV Line and maintained at Seller’s cost. If the Approved Meter is inaccurate, Seller will cause such meter to be promptly corrected in accordance with Prudent Operating Practice and CAISO requirements. Seller will be responsible for any costs, fines or penalties, including imbalance charges as a result of the inaccurate meter. The meter shall be kept under seal, such seals to be broken only when the meters are to be tested, adjusted, modified or relocated. In the event that Seller breaks a seal, Seller shall notify Buyer as soon as practicable. In addition, Seller hereby agrees to provide all Approved Meter data to Buyer in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and consents to Buyer obtaining from CAISO the meter data applicable to the Facility and all inspection, testing and calibration data and reports. Seller, or Seller’s Scheduling Coordinator, shall cooperate with Buyer to allow both Parties to retrieve the meter reads from the CAISO Market Results Interface – Settlements (MRIS-S) (or its successor).

7.2 **Meter Verification.** Annually, if Seller has reason to believe there may be a meter malfunction, or upon Buyer’s reasonable request, Seller shall test the meter. The tests shall be conducted by independent third parties qualified to conduct such tests at Seller’s expense; provided, if the meter is tested at Buyer’s request and is determined to be accurate, the costs of such test shall be borne by Buyer. If practical, Buyer shall be notified seven (7) days in advance of such tests and have a right to be present during such tests. If a meter is inaccurate it shall be promptly repaired or replaced. If a meter is inaccurate by more than one percent (1%) and it is not known when the meter inaccuracy commenced (if such evidence exists such date will be used to adjust prior invoices), then the invoices covering the period of time since the last meter test shall be adjusted for the amount of the inaccuracy on the assumption that the inaccuracy persisted during the second half of such period.

**ARTICLE 8  
INVOICING AND PAYMENT; CREDIT**

8.1 **Invoicing.** Seller shall deliver an invoice to Buyer no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the prior monthly delivery period; provided that Seller’s failure to deliver an invoice to Buyer by such deadline shall not be a breach hereunder. Each invoice shall provide Buyer (a) records of metered data, including metering and CAISO transaction data sufficient to document and verify the amount of Delivered Energy for each Settlement Period during the preceding month, including the amount of Delivered Energy as set forth in the first CAISO settlement statement for the prior month that includes meter data from the Approved Meter, the applicable Contract Price, deviations between the Scheduled Energy and the Delivered Energy, the LMP in the Real-Time Market at the Delivery Point for each Settlement Period; (b) hourly meter data, plus any additional data as may be reasonably required by Buyer for compliance with CPUC reporting obligations, including pursuant to the CPUC’s Energy Division Portfolio Content Category Classification Review Handbook (or successor publication); (c) a statement of

the quantity of WREGIS Certificates transferred during the prior month; (d) access to any records, including invoices or settlement data from the CAISO, necessary to verify the accuracy of any amount; and (e) be in a reasonable format covering the services provided in the preceding month determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

8.2 Payment. Buyer shall make payment to Seller by wire transfer or ACH payment to the bank account provided on each monthly invoice. Buyer shall pay undisputed invoice amounts within thirty (30) days after receipt of the invoice. If such due date falls on a weekend, local business holiday observed by either Party, or a NERC holiday, such due date shall be the next Business Day. Payments made after the due date will be considered late and will bear interest on the unpaid balance. If the amount due is not paid on or before the due date or if any other payment that is due and owing from one party to another is not paid on or before its applicable due date, a late payment charge shall be applied to the unpaid balance and shall be added to the next billing statement. Such late payment charge shall be calculated based on an annual Interest Rate equal to the prime rate published on the date of the invoice in The Wall Street Journal (or, if The Wall Street Journal is not published on that day, the next succeeding date of publication), plus two percent (2%) (the “Interest Rate”). If the due date occurs on a day that is not a Business Day, the late payment charge shall begin to accrue on the next succeeding Business Day.

8.3 Books and Records. To facilitate payment and verification, each Party shall maintain all books and records necessary for billing and payments, including copies of all invoices under this Agreement, for a period of at least two (2) years or as otherwise required by Law. Upon fifteen (15) days’ Notice to Seller, Buyer shall be granted reasonable access to the accounting books and records pertaining to all invoices generated pursuant to this Agreement.

8.4 Payment Adjustments; Billing Errors. Payment adjustments shall be made if Buyer or Seller discovers there have been good faith inaccuracies in invoicing that are not otherwise disputed under Section 8.5, there is determined to have been a meter inaccuracy sufficient to require a payment adjustment, or if CAISO recalculates amounts due or owing in respect of prior periods. If the required adjustment is in favor of Buyer, Buyer’s monthly payment shall be credited in an amount equal to the adjustment. If the required adjustment is in favor of Seller, Seller shall add the adjustment amount to Buyer’s next monthly invoice. Other than recalculations by CAISO, adjustments in favor of either Buyer or Seller shall bear interest, until settled in full, in accordance with Section 8.2, accruing from the date on which the non-erring Party received Notice thereof.

8.5 Billing Disputes. A Party may, in good faith, dispute the correctness of any invoice or any adjustment to an invoice rendered under this Agreement or adjust any invoice for any arithmetic or computational error within twelve (12) months of the date the invoice, or adjustment to an invoice, was rendered. In the event an invoice or portion thereof, or any other claim or adjustment arising hereunder, is disputed, payment of the undisputed portion of the invoice shall be required to be made when due. Any invoice dispute or invoice adjustment shall be in writing and shall state the basis for the dispute or adjustment. Payment of the disputed amount shall not be required until the dispute is resolved. Upon resolution of the dispute, any required payment shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of such resolution along with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from and including the original due date to but excluding the date paid. Inadvertent overpayments shall be returned upon request or deducted by the Party receiving such overpayment.

from subsequent payments, with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from and including the date of such overpayment but excluding the date repaid or deducted by the Party receiving such overpayment. Any dispute with respect to an invoice is waived if the other Party is not notified in accordance with this Section 8.5 within twelve (12) months after the invoice is rendered or subsequently adjusted, except to the extent any misinformation was from a third party not affiliated with any Party and such third party corrects its information after the twelve-month period. If an invoice is not rendered within twelve (12) months after the close of the month during which performance occurred, the right to payment for such performance is waived.

8.6 Netting of Payments. The Parties hereby agree that they shall discharge mutual debts and payment obligations due and owing to each other on the same date through netting, in which case all undisputed amounts owed by each Party to the other Party for the purchase and sale of Product during the monthly billing period under this Agreement or otherwise arising out of this Agreement, including any related damages calculated pursuant to Exhibits B and E, interest, and payments or credits, including pursuant to Section 4.3(c), shall be netted so that only the excess amount remaining due shall be paid by the Party who owes the remaining amount.

8.7 Seller’s Pre-CSD Security. To secure its obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall deliver Pre-CSD Security to Buyer within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date. Seller shall maintain the Pre-CSD Security in full force and effect. Upon the earlier of (A) Seller’s delivery of the Performance Security, or (B) sixty (60) days after termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall return the Pre-CSD Security to Seller, less the amounts drawn in accordance with this Agreement. If and to the extent that any portion of the Pre-CSD Security is drawn by the issuer of such Letter of Credit (i) fails to maintain a Credit Rating of at least “A-” by S&P or “A3” by Moody’s, (ii) indicates its intent not to renew such Letter of Credit and such Credit expires prior to Contract Start Date, (iii) fails to honor Buyer’s properly documented request to draw on such Letter of Credit, or (iv) becomes Bankrupt, Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days to post substitute collateral that meets the requirements set forth in the definition of Pre-CSD Security. Seller shall have no obligation to replenish the Pre-CSD Security following any draws thereon by Buyer. Seller’s maximum liability for an Event of Default or failure to perform its obligations hereunder prior to the Contract Start Date shall be capped at the amount of the Pre-CSD Security, less any amounts collected by Buyer prior to such Event of Default or failure to perform.

8.8 Seller’s Performance Security. To secure its obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall deliver Performance Security to Buyer on or before the Contract Start Date. Seller shall maintain the Performance Security in full force and effect until the following have occurred: (A) the Delivery Term has expired or terminated early; and (B) all payment obligations of the Seller arising under this Agreement, including compensation for penalties, Termination Payment, indemnification payments or other damages are paid in full (whether directly or indirectly such as through set-off or netting). Following the occurrence of both events, Buyer shall promptly return to Seller the unused portion of the Performance Security. If and to the extent that any portion of the Performance Security is a Letter of Credit and the issuer of such Letter of Credit (i) fails to maintain a Credit Rating of at least “A-” by S&P or “A3” by Moody’s, (ii) fails to honor Buyer’s properly documented request to draw on such Letter of Credit, or (iii) becomes Bankrupt, Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days to post substitute collateral that meets the requirements set forth in the definition of Performance Security.

8.9 Financial Statements.

(a) If requested, Buyer shall provide to Seller (i) within one hundred twenty (120) days following the end of each fiscal year during the Contract Term, a copy of Buyer’s annual report containing audited consolidated financial statements for such fiscal year and (ii) within sixty (60) days after the end of each of its first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year during the Contract Term, a copy of Buyer’s quarterly report containing unaudited consolidated financial statements for such fiscal quarter. In all cases the statements shall be for the most recent accounting period and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”); provided, however, that should any such statements not be available on a timely basis due to a delay in preparation or certifications, such unavailability shall not be an Event of Default so long as Buyer diligently pursues the preparation, certification, and delivery of the statements.

8.10 Buyer’s First Priority Security Interest in Cash or Cash Equivalent Collateral.  
To secure its obligations under this Agreement, and until released as provided herein, Seller hereby grants to Buyer a present and continuing first-priority security interest in, and lien on (and right to net against), and assignment of the Pre-CSD Security or Performance Security, any other cash collateral and cash equivalent collateral posted by Seller pursuant to Sections 8.7 and 8.8, and any and all interest thereon or proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof, whether now or hereafter held by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of Buyer, and Seller agrees to take all action as Buyer reasonably requires in order to perfect Buyer’s first-priority security interest in, and lien on (and right to net against), such collateral and any and all proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof.

Upon or any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default caused by Seller, an Early Termination Date resulting from an Event of Default caused by Seller, or an occasion provided for in this Agreement where Buyer is authorized to retain all or a portion of the Pre-CSD Security or Performance Security, Buyer may do any one or more of the following (in each case subject to the final sentence of this Section 8.10 and the provisions of Article 12):

(a) Exercise any of its rights and remedies with respect to the Pre-CSD Security or Performance Security, as applicable, including any such rights and remedies under Law then in effect;  
(b) Draw on any outstanding Letter of Credit issued for its benefit and retain any cash held by Buyer as Pre-CSD Security or Performance Security, as applicable; and  
(c) Liquidate all Pre-CSD Security or Performance Security, as applicable then held by or for the benefit of Buyer free from any claim or right of any nature whatsoever of Seller, including any equity or right of purchase or redemption by Seller.

Buyer shall apply the proceeds of the collateral realized upon the exercise of any such rights or remedies to reduce Seller’s obligations under this Agreement (Seller remains liable for any amounts owing to Buyer after such application), subject to Buyer’s obligation to return any surplus proceeds remaining after these obligations are satisfied in full.

**ARTICLE 10  
FORCE MAJEURE**

10.1 **Definition.**

(a) “Force Majeure Event” means any act or event that delays or prevents a Party from timely performing all or a portion of its obligations under this Agreement or from complying with all or a portion of the conditions under this Agreement if such act or event, which event or circumstance, despite the exercise of reasonable efforts, cannot be avoided by and is beyond the reasonable control (whether direct or indirect) of and without the fault or negligence of the Party relying thereon as justification for such delay, nonperformance or noncompliance.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, so long as the following events, despite the exercise of reasonable efforts, cannot be avoided by, and are beyond the reasonable control (whether direct or indirect) of and without the fault or negligence of the Party relying thereon as justification for such delay, nonperformance or noncompliance, a Force Majeure Event may include an act of God or the elements, such as flooding, lightning, hurricanes, tornadoes, or ice storms; explosion; fire; volcanic eruption; flood; epidemic, or pandemic, including COVID-19 (but only to the extent that new governmental rules or mandates related to COVID-19 are implemented that were not in place as of the Effective Date); landslide; mudslide; sabotage; terrorism; earthquake; or other cataclysmic events; an act of public enemy; acts or failure to act by a Governmental Authority; war; blockade; civil insurrection; riot; civil disturbance; Serial Defect; or strikes or other labor difficulties caused or suffered by a Party or any third party except as set forth below.

<!-- Page 215 -->
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Force Majeure Event” does not include (i) economic conditions that render a Party’s performance of this Agreement at the Contract Price unprofitable or otherwise uneconomic (including Buyer’s ability to buy Energy at a lower price, or Seller’s ability to sell Energy generated by the Facility at a higher price, than the Contract Price); (ii) Seller’s inability to obtain permits or approvals of any type for the construction, operation, or maintenance of the Facility, except to the extent such inability is caused by a Force Majeure Event; (iii) the inability of a Party to make payments when due under this Agreement; (iv) a Curtailment Order, except to the extent that a Curtailment Order is caused by an event that otherwise qualifies as a Force Majeure Event; (v) Seller’s inability to obtain sufficient labor, equipment, materials, or other resources to build or operate the Facility except to the extent such inability is caused by a Force Majeure Event; (vi) a strike, work stoppage or labor dispute limited only to any one or more of Seller, Seller’s Affiliates, Seller’s contractors, their subcontractors thereof or any other third party employed by Seller to work on the Facility; (vii) any equipment failure except if such equipment failure is caused by a Force Majeure Event; or (viii) except as the Guaranteed Contract Start Date may be extended as a result of a Permitted Extension, Seller’s inability to achieve Contract Start Date following the Guaranteed Contract Start Date.

10.2 No Liability If a Force Majeure Event Occurs. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall be liable to the other Party in the event it is prevented from performing its obligations hereunder in whole or in part due to a Force Majeure Event. The Party rendered unable to fulfill any obligation by reason of a Force Majeure Event shall take reasonable actions necessary to remove such inability with due speed and diligence. Nothing herein shall be construed as permitting that Party to continue to fail to perform after said cause has been removed. The obligation to use due speed and diligence shall not be interpreted to require resolution of labor disputes by acceding to demands of the opposition when such course is inadvisable in the discretion of the Party having such difficulty. Neither Party shall be considered in breach or default of this Agreement if and to the extent that any failure or delay in the Party’s performance of one or more of its obligations hereunder is caused by a Force Majeure Event. The occurrence and continuation of a Force Majeure Event shall not suspend or excuse the obligation of a Party to make any payments due hereunder. Any delays caused by a Force Majeure Event will not serve to increase the Contract Term nor Contract Price of this Agreement.

10.3 Notice. In the event of any delay or nonperformance resulting from a Force Majeure Event, the Party suffering the Force Majeure Event shall (a) as soon as practicable, notify the other Party in writing of the nature, cause, estimated date of commencement thereof, the anticipated extent of any delay or interruption in performance, and, to the extent reasonably practicable, a mitigation plan for limiting or overcoming the impacts of the Force Majeure Event and (b) notify the other Party in writing of the cessation or termination of such Force Majeure Event, all as known or estimated in good faith by the affected Party; provided, however, that a Party’s failure to give timely Notice as provided in this Section 10.3 shall not affect such Party’s ability to assert that a Force Majeure Event has occurred unless the delay in giving Notice materially prejudices the other Party.

10.4 Termination Following Force Majeure Event. If a Force Majeure Event has occurred after the Contract Start Date that has caused either Party to be unable to perform its material obligations hereunder, and has continued for a consecutive twelve (12) month period, then, the

the non-claiming Party may terminate this Agreement upon Notice to the other Party experiencing the Force Majeure Event; provided that if Seller is the Party claiming such Force Majeure Event and such Force Majeure Event cannot reasonably be cured within such twelve (12) month period, then Seller may provide a plan to Buyer, which must be acceptable to Buyer in its reasonable discretion, to cure such Force Majeure Event within an additional consecutive six (6) month period and Buyer may not terminate this Agreement due to such Force Majeure Event unless Seller has not resumed performance of its material obligations hereunder upon the expiration of such additional consecutive six (6) month period. Upon any such termination, the non-claiming Party shall have no liability to the Party claiming Force Majeure Event, save and except for those obligations specified in Section 2.1(b).

ARTICLE 11

(b) with respect to Seller as the Defaulting Party, the occurrence of any of the following:

(i) except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time, Seller delivers or attempts to deliver Energy to the Delivery Point for sale under this Agreement that was not generated by the Facility; or

(ii) with respect to any outstanding Letter of Credit provided for the benefit of Buyer that is not then required under this Agreement to be canceled or returned, the failure by Seller to provide for the benefit of Buyer either (1) cash, or (2) a replacement surety bond (solely with respect to the Performance Security), or (3) a substitute Letter of Credit from a different issuer meeting the criteria set forth in the definition of Letter of Credit, in each case, in the amount required hereunder within ten (10) Business Days after Seller receives Notice of the occurrence of any of the following events:

(a) to send Notice, designating a day, no earlier than the day such Notice is deemed to be received and no later than twenty (20) days after such Notice is deemed to be received, as an early termination date of this Agreement (“Early Termination Date”) that terminates this Agreement (the “Terminated Transaction”) and ends the Contract Term effective as of the Early Termination Date;

(b) to accelerate all amounts owing between the Parties, and to collect as liquidated damages (i) the Damage Payment (in the case of an Event of Default by Seller occurring before the Contract Start Date) or (ii) the Termination Payment calculated in accordance with Section 11.3 below (in the case of any other Event of Default by Seller after the Contract Start Date or by Buyer throughout the Contract Term);

(c) to withhold any payments due to the Defaulting Party under this Agreement;

(d) to suspend performance; and

(e) to exercise any other right or remedy available at Law or in equity, including specific performance or injunctive relief, except to the extent such remedies are expressly limited under this Agreement;

provided, that payment by the Defaulting Party of the Damage Payment or Termination Payment, as applicable, shall constitute liquidated damages and the Non-Defaulting Party’s sole and exclusive remedy for the Terminated Transaction and the Event of Default related thereto. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller’s sole and aggregate liability under or arising out of a termination of this Agreement prior to the Contract Start Date shall be limited to the amount required to be posted as Pre-CSD Security pursuant to Section 8.7, less any amounts collected by Buyer prior to such Early Termination Date.

11.3 Termination Payment. The termination payment (“Termination Payment”) for a Terminated Transaction shall be the aggregate of all Settlement Amounts plus any all other amounts due to the Non-Defaulting Party netted into a single amount. If the Non-Defaulting Party’s aggregate Gains exceed its aggregate Losses and Costs, if any, resulting from the termination of this Agreement, the net Settlement Amount shall be zero. The Non-Defaulting Party shall calculate, in a commercially reasonable manner, a Settlement Amount for the Terminated Transaction as of the Early Termination Date. Third parties (which shall not include Affiliates of the Non-Defaulting Party) supplying information for purposes of the calculation of Gains or Losses may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors and other sources of market information. The Settlement Amount shall not include consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary, indirect or business interruption damages; provided, however, that any lost Capacity Attributes and Green Attributes shall be deemed direct damages covered by this Agreement. Without prejudice to the Non-Defaulting Party’s duty to mitigate, the Non-Defaulting Party shall not have to enter into replacement transactions to establish a Settlement Amount. Each Party agrees and acknowledges that (a) the actual damages that the Non-Defaulting Party would incur in connection with a Terminated Transaction would be difficult or impossible to predict with certainty, (b) the Damage Payment or Termination Payment described in Section 11.2 or this Section 11.3 (as applicable) is a reasonable and appropriate approximation of such damages, and (c) the Damage Payment or

![Termination Payment](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Termination+Payment+Document)

Termination Payment described in Section 11.2 or this Section 11.3 (as applicable) is the exclusive remedy of the Non-Defaulting Party in connection with a Terminated Transaction but shall not otherwise act to limit any of the Non-Defaulting Party’s rights or remedies if the Non-Defaulting Party does not elect a Terminated Transaction as its remedy for an Event of Default by the Defaulting Party.

11.4 Notice of Payment of Termination Payment. As soon as practicable after a Terminated Transaction, Notice shall be given by the Non-Defaulting Party to the Defaulting Party of the amount of the Termination Payment and whether the Termination Payment is due to the Non-Defaulting Party. The Notice shall include a written statement explaining in reasonable detail the calculation of such amount and the sources for such calculation. The Termination Payment shall be made to the Non-Defaulting Party, as applicable, within ten (10) Business Days after such Notice is effective.

11.5 Disputes With Respect to Termination Payment. If the Defaulting Party disputes the Non-Defaulting Party’s calculation of the Termination Payment, in whole or in part, the Defaulting Party shall, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the Non-Defaulting Party’s calculation of the Termination Payment, provide to the Non-Defaulting Party a detailed written explanation of the basis for such dispute. Disputes regarding the Termination Payment shall be determined in accordance with Article 15.

11.6 Rights And Remedies Are Cumulative. Except where liquidated damages are provided as the exclusive remedy, the rights and remedies of a Party under this article 11 shall be cumulative and in addition to the rights of the Parties otherwise provided in this Agreement.

11.7 Mitigation. Any Non-Defaulting Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its Costs, Losses and damages resulting from any Event of Default of the other Party under this Agreement.

ARTICLE 12
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES

12.1 No Consequential Damages. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PART OF AN EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER OR ITS INDEMNIFIED PERSONS FOR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOSSES OR DAMAGES FOR LOST REVENUE OR LOST PROFITS, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR NOT, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE.

REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE DEEMED TO “FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE” OR ARE OTHERWISE HELD TO BE INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, IF THERE IS AN EARLY TERMINATION DATE PRIOR TO THE CONTRACT START DATE, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF SELLER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT REQUIRED TO BE POSTED AS PRE-CSD SECURITY PURSUANT TO SECTION 8.7, LESS ANY AMOUNTS COLLECTED BY BUYER PRIOR TO SUCH EARLY TERMINATION DATE.

FOR BREACH OF ANY PROVISION FOR WHICH AN EXPRESS AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS PROVIDED, SUCH EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, THE OBLIGOR’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED AS SET FORTH IN SUCH PROVISION, AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES OR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE WAIVED.

TO THE EXTENT ANY DAMAGES REQUIRED TO BE PAID HEREUNDER ARE LIQUIDATED, INCLUDING UNDER SECTIONS 3.8, 4.7, 4.8(e), 11.2 AND 11.3, AND AS PROVIDED IN EXHIBIT B AND EXHIBIT E, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE, THAT OTHERWISE OBTAINING AN ADEQUATE REMEDY IS INCONVENIENT, AND THAT THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES CONSTITUTE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE ANTICIPATED HARM OR LOSS. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT THE LIMITATIONS HEREIN IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PARTY, WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO CONTEST SUCH PAYMENTS AS AN UNREASONABLE PENALTY.

THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT MONEY DAMAGES AND THE EXPRESS REMEDIES PROVIDED FOR HEREIN ARE AN ADEQUATE REMEDY FOR THE BREACH BY THE OTHER OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND EACH PARTY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO ANY OBLIGATION OF THE OTHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

(b) It shall maintain (or obtain from time to time as required) all regulatory authorizations necessary for it to legally perform its obligations under this Agreement; and

(c) It shall perform its obligations under this Agreement in compliance with all terms and conditions in its governing documents and any contracts to which it is a party and in material compliance with any Law.

**ARTICLE 14 ASSIGNMENT**

14.1 General Prohibition on Assignments. Except as provided below, neither Party may voluntarily assign this Agreement or its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any direct or indirect Change of Control of a Party (whether voluntary or by operation of Law) will be deemed an assignment and will require the prior written consent of the other Party, except as provided in Section 14.3. Any assignment made without required written consent, or in violation

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

of the conditions to assignment set out below, shall be null and void. The assigning Party shall be responsible for the other Party’s costs associated with the preparation, review, execution, and delivery of documents in connection with any assignment of this Agreement, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees.

14.2 Collateral Assignment. Subject to the provisions of this Section 14.2, Seller has the right to assign this Agreement as collateral for any financing or refinancing of the Facility without the consent of Buyer. In connection with any financing or refinancing of the Facility by Seller, Buyer will, upon request, cooperate with Seller and provide a consent to collateral assignment, stopped and/or similar instrument in favor of the financing parties providing financing to the Facility with reasonable terms and conditions consistent with customary industry practice.

14.3 Permitted Assignment. Notwithstanding Section 14.1, and in addition to its rights set forth in Section 14.2, Seller may at any time, without the prior written consent of Buyer, transfer or assign this Agreement (including by a Change of Control) (i) to an Affiliate of Seller, (ii) in connection with a tax equity financing (regardless of whether a Change of Control results from such tax equity financing), or (iii) as part of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the membership interests, equity, or assets of an Affiliate of Seller. Seller may also, without the prior written consent of Buyer, transfer or assign this Agreement (including by a Change of Control) to a Permitted Transferee.

14.4 Buyer Assignment. At any time during the Contract Term, upon not less than thirty (30) days’ written notice to Seller, Buyer may request that Seller enter into negotiations to permit Buyer to enter into a limited assignment of a portion of Buyer’s rights and obligations under this Agreement to J. Aron and Company, LLC (“J. Aron”). Following any such Notice from Buyer, (a) Seller, Buyer and J. Aron shall negotiate in good faith the execution of a limited assignment agreement based on the form attached hereto as Exhibit J, and (b) if requested by Seller, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith an indemnity and/or a legal opinion, to be provided by Buyer for the benefit of Seller in connection with such limited assignment agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall remain responsible for all of its obligations under this Agreement, including those related to all Product that may be assigned to J. Aron under any limited assignment agreement, including (i) the obligation to pay for all Product and (ii) any and all damages, costs and expenses of Seller associated with such assignee’s failure to take or pay for any such Product as contemplated by this Agreement.

15.2 Dispute Resolution. In the event of any dispute arising under this Agreement, within ten (10) days following the receipt of a Notice from either Party identifying such dispute, the Parties shall meet, negotiate and attempt, in good faith, to resolve the dispute quickly, informally and inexpensively. If the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute arising hereunder within the earlier of either thirty (30) days of initiating such discussions, or within forty (40) days after Notice of the dispute, either Party may seek any and all remedies available to it at Law or in equity, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 16
INDEMNIFICATION

16.1 Indemnification.

(a) Each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, representatives and agents (collectively, the “Indemnified Party”) from and against all third-party claims, demands, losses, liabilities, penalties, and expenses and expert witness fees (collectively “Indemnifiable Event”), to the extent such Indemnifiable Event arises out of, results from, or is caused by any of the following: (a) the negligent act or omission, recklessness or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party, its Affiliates, its or their directors, officers, employees, agents, subcontractors, and anyone directly or indirectly employed by the Indemnifying Party or any of its subcontractors or anyone that they control; or (b) any violation of applicable Law by the Indemnifying Party, in each case in connection with this Agreement. Upon the Indemnified Party’s written request, the Indemnifying Party, at its own expense, must defend any suit or action that is subject to the Indemnifying Party’s indemnity obligations.

(b) Nothing in this Section 16.1 shall enlarge or relieve Seller or Buyer of any liability to the other for any breach of this Agreement. Neither Party shall be indemnified for its damages resulting to the extent of its own negligence, intentional acts, or willful misconduct. These indemnity provisions shall not be construed to relieve any insurer of its obligation to pay claims consistent with the provisions of a valid insurance policy.

16.2 Claims. Promptly after receipt by a Party of any claim or Notice of the indemnity provided for in this Article 16 may apply, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such fact. The Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof with counsel designated by such Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to, or inconsistent with, those available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to select and be represented by separate counsel, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, unless a liability insurer is willing to pay such costs. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of a claim meriting indemnification, the Indemnified Party may at the expense of the Indemnifying Party contest, settle, or pay such claim, provided that settlement or full payment of any such claim may be made only following consent of the Indemnifying Party or, absent such consent, written opinion of the Indemnified Party’s counsel that such claim is meritorious or warrants settlement.

<!-- Page 225 -->
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence if the settlement consists solely of a monetary payment by the Indemnifying Party, such settlement shall not require the consent of the Indemnifying Party. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 16, in the event that a Party is obligated to indemnify and hold the other Party and its successors and assigns harmless under this Article 16, the amount owing to the Indemnified Party will be the amount of the Indemnified Party’s damages net of any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Party following a reasonable effort by the Indemnified Party to obtain such insurance proceeds.

# ARTICLE 17
## INSURANCE

17.1 **Insurance.**

(a) **General Liability.** Seller shall maintain, or cause to be maintained at its sole expense, (i) commercial general liability insurance against claims for personal injury (including bodily injury and death) and property damage with a limit of liability of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence, and a general aggregate of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) for combined bodily injury and property damage; and (ii) an umbrella insurance policy in a minimum limit of liability of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). The amounts of liability insurance described in this Article 17 may be satisfied by primary insurance or by any combination of primary and excess/umbrella insurance. Such insurance shall contain standard cross-liability and severability of interest provisions such that each person is protected in the same manner as though a separate policy has been issued to each but nothing therein shall operate to increase the insurance company’s liability beyond the amount the insurance company would have been liable if only one Person or interest had been named as insured. The liability insurance policies referenced in this Article 17 shall (x) provide an endorsement waiving rights of subrogation against Buyer, (y) name Buyer as additional insured on all required liability insurance (except workers compensation), and (z) be primary to any insurance of Buyer that may apply to such occurrence, accident or claim and no “other insurance” provision shall be applicable to Buyer or any additional insureds, by virtue of having been named an additional insured under any policy of insurance.

(b) **Workers Compensation and Employer’s Liability.** Employers’ Liability insurance shall not be less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) providing statutory benefits as required by Law (if any exposure exists) for injury, sickness, disability or death of the employees.

(c) **Business Auto Liability Insurance.** Seller shall maintain at all times during the Contract Term business auto insurance for bodily injury and property damage with limits of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit. Such insurance shall cover liability arising out of Seller’s use of all owned (if any), non-owned and hired motor vehicles in the performance of the Agreement.

(d) **Property Insurance.** Seller shall maintain or cause to be maintained property insurance covering the Facility against physical loss or damage, including coverage for natural perils including but not limited to flood, earthquake, windstorm, severe convective storm, and wildfire, all with limits in accordance with industry standard recognizing that natural perils may

be subject to a lower sublimit. Coverage will be on an "all-risk" basis including mechanical and electrical breakdown.

(e) Documentation. Before commencing work under this Agreement, Seller’s broker or agent shall provide certificates of insurance verifying that at least the minimum insurance coverages required above are in effect with additional insured, waiver of subrogation and any other policy provisions or endorsements include, as applicable. Acceptance of the evidence of coverage by Buyer shall not relieve or decrease the extent to which Seller may be held responsible for payment of damages resulting from Seller’s services or operations pursuant to this Agreement, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of Buyer’s rights to insurance coverage hereunder. Failure to demand evidence of full compliance with the insurance requirements set forth in this Agreement or failure to identify any insurance deficiency shall not relieve Seller from, nor be construed or deemed a waiver of, its obligation to maintain the required insurance at all times during the performance of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 18  
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

18.1 Definition of Confidential Information. The following constitutes "Confidential Information," whether oral or written which is delivered by Seller to Buyer or by Buyer to Seller from Buyer in connection with the terms and conditions of, and proposals and negotiations related to, this Agreement, and (b) information that either Seller or Buyer stamps or otherwise identifies as "confidential" or "proprietary" before disclosing it to the other. Confidential Information does not include (i) information that was publicly available at the time of the disclosure, other than as a result of a disclosure in breach of this Agreement; (ii) information that becomes publicly available through no fault of the recipient after the time of the delivery; (iii) information that was rightfully in the possession of the recipient (without confidential or proprietary restriction) at the time of delivery or that becomes available to the recipient from a source not subject to any restriction against disclosing such information to the recipient; and (iv) information that the recipient independently developed without a violation of this Agreement.

18.2 Duty to Maintain Confidentiality. Except as permitted in this Article 18, neither Party shall disclose Confidential Information to a third party, except upon the written consent of the Disclosing Party. Confidential Information will retain its character as Confidential Information but may be disclosed by the recipient (the "Receiving Party") if and to the extent such disclosure is required (a) to be made by any requirements of Law, (b) pursuant to an order of a court or (c) in order to enforce or implement this Agreement. If the Receiving Party becomes legally compelled (by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoenas, summons, civil investigative demands, or similar processes or otherwise in connection with any litigation or to comply with any applicable Law, order, regulation, ruling, regulatory request, accounting disclosure rule or standard or any exchange, control area or independent system operator rule) to disclose any Confidential Information of the disclosing Party (the "Disclosing Party"), Receiving Party shall provide Disclosing Party with prompt notice so that Disclosing Party, at its sole expense, may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy.

18.3 Irreparable Injury; Remedies. Receiving Party acknowledges that its obligations hereunder are necessary and reasonable in order to protect Disclosing Party and the business of Disclosing Party, and expressly acknowledges that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate Disclosing Party for any breach or threatened breach by Receiving Party of any covenants and agreements set forth herein. Accordingly, Receiving Party acknowledges that any such breach or threatened breach may cause irreparable injury to Disclosing Party and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, in Law, in equity or otherwise, Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief against the threatened breach of this Agreement or the continuation of any such breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages.

18.4 Permitted Disclosures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 18, Confidential Information may be disclosed by either Party to such Party’s counsel, accountants, auditors, advisors, other professional consultants, credit rating agencies, Affiliates or actual or prospective owners, investors, lenders, directors, underwriters, contractors, suppliers or others involved in the construction, operation and financing transactions and arrangements for a Party or its affiliates, or any of its or their agents, consultants or trustees, so long as the Person to whom Confidential Information is disclosed agrees in writing to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this Article 18 to the same extent as if it were a Party, or is bound by substantially similar confidentiality requirements.

18.5 Press Releases. Neither Party shall issue (or cause its Affiliates to issue) a press release regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless both Parties have agreed upon the contents of any such public statement.

ARTICLE 19
MISCELLANEOUS

19.1 Entire Agreement; Integration; Exhibits. This Agreement, together with the Cover Sheet and Exhibits attached hereto, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between Seller and Buyer with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements relating to the subject matter hereof, which are of no further force or effect. The Exhibits attached hereto are integral parts hereof and are made a part of this Agreement by reference. The headings used herein are for convenience and reference purposes only. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of the Cover Sheet or any Exhibit, the provisions of first the Cover Sheet, and then this Agreement shall prevail, and such Exhibit shall be corrected accordingly. This Agreement shall be considered for all purposes as prepared through the joint efforts of the Parties and shall not be construed against one Party or the other as a result of the preparation, substitution, submission, or other event of negotiation, drafting or execution hereof.

19.2 Amendments. This Agreement may only be amended, modified, or supplemented by an instrument in writing executed by duly authorized representatives of Seller and Buyer; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement may not be amended by electronic mail communications.

19.4 No Agency, Partnership, Joint Venture or Lease. Seller and the agents and employees of Seller shall, in the performance of this Agreement, act in an independent capacity and not as officers or employees or agents of Buyer. Under this Agreement, Seller and Buyer intend to act as energy service provider and energy service recipient, respectively, and do not intend to be treated as, and shall not act as, partners in, co-venturers in or lessor/lessee with respect to the Facility or any business related to the Facility. This Agreement shall not impart any rights enforceable by any third party (other than a permitted successor or assignee bound to this Agreement).

19.5 Severability.

Further, absent the prior written agreement in writing by both Parties, the standard of review for changes in the rates, terms or conditions of this Agreement proposed by a third party shall be the “public interest” standard of review set forth in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332 (1956) and Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U.S. 348 (1956). Changes proposed by a non-Party or FERC acting sua sponte shall be subject to the most stringent standard permissible under applicable Law.

19.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, including electronic signatures, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument and each of which shall be deemed an original.

19.8 Electronic Delivery. This Agreement may be duly executed and delivered by a Party by execution and electronic format (including portable document format (.pdf)) delivery of the signature page of a counterpart to the other Party.

19.9 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

19.10 Change in Electric Market Design.

(a) If a change in the CAISO Tariff renders this Agreement or any provisions hereof incapable of being performed or administered, then any Party may request that Buyer and Seller enter into negotiations to make the minimum changes to this Agreement necessary to make this Agreement capable of being performed and administered, while attempting to preserve to the maximum extent possible the benefits, burdens, and obligations set forth in this Agreement as of the Effective Date. Upon delivery of such a request, Buyer and Seller shall engage in such

negotiations in good faith. If Buyer and Seller are unable, within sixty (60) days after delivery of such request, to agree upon changes to this Agreement or to resolve issues relating to changes to this Agreement, then any Party may submit issues pertaining to changes to this Agreement to the dispute resolution process set forth in Article 15. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a change in cost shall not in and of itself be deemed to render this Agreement or any of the provisions hereof incapable of being performed or administered, or constitute, or form the basis of, a Force Majeure Event, and (ii) all of unaffected provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect during any period of such negotiation or dispute resolution.

# EXHIBIT B  
## CONTRACT START DATE  

1. **Reserved.**  

2. **Contract Start.** “Contract Start” means the condition existing when (i) Seller has fulfilled all of the conditions in Section 2.3 of the Agreement and (ii) Seller has confirmed to Buyer in writing that Contract Start has been achieved.  

   The “Contract Start Date” shall be the date on which Contract Start is achieved.  
   
   a. Seller shall use good faith efforts to cause the Contract Start Date to occur by the Guaranteed Contract Start Date. Seller shall notify Buyer at least thirty (30) days before the anticipated Contract Start Date.  
   
   b. If Seller does not anticipate achieving Contract Start by the Guaranteed Contract Start Date, Seller may elect to extend the Guaranteed Contract Start Date by paying Delay Damages to Buyer for each day Seller desires to extend the Guaranteed Contract Start Date. If Seller elects to extend the Guaranteed Contract Start Date, on or before the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the then-current Guaranteed Contract Start Date, Seller shall provide Notice and payment to Buyer of the Delay Damages for the number of days of extension to the Guaranteed Contract Start Date (“Delay Damages Payment”); provided such Delay Damages Payment may, at Seller’s option, be in the form of cash or an irrevocable, standby letter of credit issued by a U.S. commercial bank, or a foreign bank with a U.S. branch, with such bank having a Credit Rating of at least A- with an outlook designation of “stable” from S&P or A3 with an outlook designation of “stable” from Moody’s, which letter of credit Buyer may draw on to receive such Delay Damages Payment. If Seller achieves Contract Start prior to the Guaranteed Contract Start Date as extended by the payment of the Delay Damages Payment, Buyer shall refund to Seller in cash the Delay Damages for each day Seller achieves Contract Start prior to the Guaranteed Contract Start Date, as extended, times the Delay Damages, not to exceed the total amount of the Delay Damages Payment paid by Seller pursuant to this Section 2(b). The Parties agree that Buyer’s receipt of Delay Damages shall not be construed as Buyer’s declaration that an Event of Default has occurred under any provision of Section 11.1.  

3. **Termination for Failure to Achieve Contract Start.** If the Facility has not achieved Contract Start by the Outside Contract Start Date, either Party may elect to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 2.6.  

4. **Extension of the Guaranteed Dates.** The Guaranteed Contract Start Date shall, subject to notice and documentation requirements set forth below, be automatically extended on a day-for-day basis (the “Permitted Extension”) for the following delays:  
   
   a. delays due to a Force Majeure Event;

<!-- Page 233 -->
b. delays caused by a Transmission Provider not caused by the Seller’s action or inaction; or

c. delay due to a Buyer breach or default under this Agreement.

The cumulative extensions granted under clauses 4(a) and 4(b) above shall not exceed ___ for any reason, including a Force Majeure Event. The extension granted under clause 4(c) above shall have no termination. Except to the extent Seller has paid Delay Damages, or due to a delay clause 4(c) above, no extension due to a Permitted Extension shall be given if (i) the delay was the result of Seller’s failure to take all commercially reasonable actions to meet its requirements and deadlines, (ii) Seller failed to provide requested documentation as provided below, or (iii) Seller failed to provide Notice to Buyer as required in the next sentence. Seller shall provide prompt Notice to Buyer of a delay, but in no case more than thirty (30) days after Seller becomes aware of such delay, except that in the case of a delay occurring within sixty (60) days of the Guaranteed Contract Start Date, or after such date, Seller must provide Notice within five (5) Business Days of Seller becoming aware of such delay. Upon request from Buyer, Seller shall provide documentation demonstrating to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction that the delays described above did not result from Seller’s actions or failure to take commercially reasonable actions.

![EXHIBIT E ENERGY REPLACEMENT DAMAGES CALCULATION](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=EXHIBIT+E+ENERGY+REPLACEMENT+DAMAGES+CALCULATION)

In accordance with Section 4.7, if Seller fails to achieve the Guaranteed Energy Production during any Performance Measurement Period, and Seller elects to not provide Replacement Product, a liquidated damages (“Energy Replacement Damages”) payment shall be due from Seller to Buyer, calculated as follows:

[(A - B) * (C - D)] - E

where:

A = the Guaranteed Energy Production amount for the Performance Measurement Period, in MWh

B = the Adjusted Energy Production amount for the Performance Measurement Period, in MWh

C = Replacement price for the Performance Measurement Period, in $/MWh, which is the sum of (a) the simple average of the LMP in the Day-Ahead Market at the Delivery Point for all of the hours in the Performance Measurement Period, plus (b) the simple average REC Price for the applicable Performance Measurement Period.

D = the Contract Price, in $/MWh

E = the value of any Replacement Product provided retrospectively by Seller with respect to such Performance Measurement Period

“Adjusted Energy Production” shall mean the sum of the following: (i) the greater of (a) if Seller provided Replacement Product or paid Energy Replacement Damages during the prior Performance Measurement Period, seventy percent (70%) of the Expected Energy for the first Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period or (b) the Delivered Energy plus Lost Output plus Deemed Delivered Energy in the first Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period, plus (ii) Delivered Energy plus Lost Output plus Deemed Delivered Energy in the second Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period.

“Lost Output” means the sum of electric energy in MWh that would have been generated and delivered, but was not, on account of any Forced Facility Outage (not caused by Seller’s fault or negligence), Force Majeure Events, System Emergencies, Buyer’s failure to perform, and Curtailment Order. The additional MWh comprising Lost Output shall be calculated in the same manner as Deemed Delivered Energy.

No payment shall be due if the calculation of (A - B) or (C - D) yields a negative number.

# EXHIBIT J  
## FORM OF LIMITED ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT  

This Limited Assignment Agreement (this “Assignment Agreement” or “Agreement”) is entered into as of [____], by and among [____], a [____] (“PPA Seller”), Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a municipal utility district organized under the provisions of the Municipal Utility District Act (Division 6, Chapter 2, Articles 2 and 3, Sections 11581 through 11614 of the California Public Utilities Code, as amended) (“PPA Buyer”), and J. Aron & Company LLC, a New York limited liability company (“J. Aron”), and relates to that certain power purchase agreement between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller as further described in Appendix 1 (the “PPA”). Unless the context otherwise specifies or requires, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth in the PPA.  

In consideration of the premises above and the mutual covenants and agreements herein set forth, PPA Seller, PPA Buyer and J. Aron (the “Parties” hereto; each is a “Party”) agree as follows:  

1. **Limited Assignment and Delegation.**  

   (a) PPA Buyer hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to J. Aron all right, title and interest in and to the rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA to receive delivery of the products described on Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Products”) during the Assignment Period (as defined in Appendix 1), as such rights may be limited or further described in the “Further Information” section on Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Product Rights”). All Assigned Products shall be delivered pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the Assignment Period as provided in Appendix 1. All other rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly reserved for PPA Buyer. The Parties agree that the assignment, transfer and/or conveyance of all or any portion of the Assigned Products in accordance with this Agreement and the Parties’ performance of any obligation in accordance with this Agreement shall not constitute a failure to meet the requirements of the PPA, or a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty under the PPA (and in no event shall PPA Seller be responsible for any failure of any portion of the Assigned Products to satisfy the requirements of the PPA, to the extent such failure results from the assignment, transfer and/or conveyance of such Assigned Products in accordance with this Agreement).  

   (b) PPA Buyer hereby delegates to J. Aron the obligation to pay the APC Contract Price set forth in Appendix 1 for all Assigned Products that are actually delivered to J. Aron pursuant to the Assigned Product Rights during the Assignment Period (the “Delivered Product Payment Obligation” and together with the Assigned Product Rights, collectively the “Assigned Rights and Obligations”); provided that (i) all other obligations of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly retained by PPA Buyer and PPA Buyer shall be solely responsible for any amounts due to PPA Seller that are not directly related to Assigned Products; and (ii) the Parties acknowledge and agree that PPA Seller will only be obligated to deliver a single consolidated invoice during the Assignment Period (with a copy to J. Aron consistent with Section 1(d) hereof). To the extent J. Aron fails to pay for any Assigned Products by the due date for payment set forth in the PPA, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, PPA Buyer agrees that it will remain jointly and severally responsible as a primary obligor (and not as a surety) for such payment and that it will be an Event of Default pursuant to Section 11.1(a) if PPA Buyer does not make such payment within five (5) Business Days (as

**entitled to pursue collection on such PPA Buyer Receivables directly against PPA Buyer pursuant to the remedies set forth in the PPA for such Event of Default.**

(f) On or before the commencement of the Assignment Period, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Guarantor”) will issue, in favor of PPA Seller, a guaranty of J. Aron’s payment obligations under this Assignment Agreement substantially in the form of Appendix 3 attached hereto (“Guaranty”).

(g) The Assigned Prepay Quantity set forth in Appendix 2 relates to obligations by and between J. Aron and PPA Buyer and has no impact on PPA Seller’s rights and obligations under the PPA.

(h) In the event that the PPA or the Assigned Rights and obligations are either or both rejected or terminated in or as a result of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding affecting J. Aron, PPA Buyer shall, at the option of PPA Seller exercised within thirty (30) days after such rejection or termination, enter into a new agreement with PPA Seller having identical terms as the PPA (subject to any conforming changes necessitated by the substitution of parties and other changes as the parties may mutually agree), provided, that the term under such new agreement shall be no longer than the remaining balance of the term specified in the PPA.

**2. Assignment Early Termination.**

(a) The Assignment Period may be terminated early upon the occurrence of any of the following:

(1) delivery of a written notice of termination specifying a termination date by either J. Aron or PPA Buyer to each of the other Parties;

(2) delivery of a written notice of termination specifying a termination date by PPA Seller to each of J. Aron and PPA Buyer following J. Aron’s failure to pay when due any amounts owed to PPA Seller in respect of any Delivered Product Payment Obligation and such payment is not made by J. Aron within one (1) business day following receipt by J. Aron and PPA Buyer of written notice;

(3) delivery of a written notice by PPA Seller if any of the events described in the definition of “Bankrupt” in the PPA occurs with respect to J. Aron; or

(4) delivery of a written notice by J. Aron if any of the events described in the definition of “Bankrupt” in the PPA occurs with respect to PPA Seller.

(b) The Assignment Period will end at the end of last delivery hour on the date specified in the termination notice provided pursuant to Section 2(a), which date shall not be earlier than the end of the last day of the calendar month in which such notice is delivered if termination is pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) or 2(a)(2) above. All Assigned Rights and Obligations shall revert from J. Aron to PPA Buyer upon the early termination of the Assignment Period, provided that (i) J. Aron shall remain responsible for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation with respect to any Assigned Product delivered to J. Aron prior to the end of the Assignment Period, and (ii) any legal restrictions on the effectiveness of such reversion (whether arising under bankruptcy law or otherwise) shall not affect the expiration or early termination of the Assignment Period.

<!-- Page 249 -->
(c) The Assignment Period will automatically terminate upon the expiration or early termination of the PPA. All Assigned Rights and Obligations shall revert from J.

All Assigned Rights and Obligations shall revert from J. Aron to PPA Buyer upon the termination of the Assignment Period, provided that (i) J. Aron shall remain responsible for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation with respect to any Assigned Product delivered to J. Aron prior to the end of the Assignment Period, and (ii) any legal restrictions on the effectiveness of such reversion (whether arising under bankruptcy law or otherwise) shall not affect the expiration or early termination of the Assignment Period.

3. Representations and Warranties. The PPA Seller and the PPA Buyer represent and warrant to J. Aron that (a) the PPA is in full force and effect; (b) to the best of its knowledge, no event or circumstance exists (or would exist with the passage of time or the giving of notice) that would give either of them the right to terminate the PPA or suspend performance thereunder; and (c) all of its obligations under the PPA required to be performed on or before the Assignment Period Start Date have been fulfilled.

4. Notices. Any notice, demand, or request required or authorized by this Assignment Agreement to be given by one Party to another Party shall be delivered in accordance with [Article]/[Section] [__] of the PPA and to the addresses of each of PPA Seller and PPA Buyer specified in the PPA.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, J. Aron and PPA Seller expressly acknowledge and agree that:

(1) PPA Seller shall not be permitted to exercise any Default Right with respect to this Agreement or any Affiliate Credit Enhancement that is related, directly or indirectly, to an Affiliate of J. Aron becoming subject to receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution, or similar proceeding (an “Insolvency Proceeding”), except to the extent that the exercise of such Default Right would be permitted under the provisions of 12 C.F.R. 252.84, 12 C.F.R. 47.5 or 12 C.F.R. 382.4, as applicable and as amended; and

(2) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the transfer of any Affiliate Credit Enhancement, any interest or obligation in or under such Affiliate Credit Enhancement, or any property securing such Affiliate Credit Enhancement, to a transferee upon or following an Affiliate of J. Aron becoming subject to an Insolvency Proceeding, unless the transfer would result in PPA Seller being the beneficiary of such Affiliate Credit Enhancement in violation of any law applicable to PPA Seller.

(iv) If PPA Seller adheres to the ISDA U.S. Protocol, as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. as of July 31, 2018, after the date of this Agreement, the terms of the ISDA U.S. Protocol will supersede and replace the terms of this Section 6(b).

NAME  
ADDRESS  

Attention:

Ladies and Gentlemen:

For value received, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the “Guarantor”), a corporation duly organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, hereby unconditionally guarantees the prompt and complete payment when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations and liabilities, whether now in existence or hereafter arising, of J. Aron & Company LLC, a subsidiary of the Guarantor and a limited liability company duly organized under the laws of the State of New York (the “Company”), to COUNTERPARTY NAME (the “Counterparty”) arising out of or under the Limited Assignment Agreement among the Company, the Counterparty and [PPA Seller] dated as of [ ], 202_. This Guaranty is one of payment and not of collection.

The Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and notice of any obligation or liability to which it may apply, and waives presentment, demand for payment, protest, notice of dishonor or non-payment of any such obligation or liability, suit or the taking of other action by Counterparty against, and any other notice to, the Company, the Guarantor or others.

Counterparty may at any time and from time to time without notice to or consent of the Guarantor and without impairing or releasing the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder: (1) agree with the Company to make any change in the terms of any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (2) take or fail to take any action of any kind in respect of any security for any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (3) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company or others, or (4) compromise or subordinate any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty including any security therefor. Any other suretyship defenses are hereby waived by the Guarantor.

This Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect until the opening of business on the fifth business day after Counterparty receives written notice of termination from the Guarantor. It is understood and agreed, however, that notwithstanding any such termination this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the obligations and liabilities set forth above which shall have been incurred prior to such termination.

subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

The Guarantor may not assign its rights nor delegate its obligations under this Guaranty, in whole or in part, without prior written consent of the Counterparty, and any purported assignment or delegation absent such consent is void, except for (i) an assignment and delegation of all of the Guarantor’s rights and obligations hereunder in whatever form the Guarantor determines may be appropriate to a partnership, corporation, trust or other organization in whatever form that succeeds to all or substantially all of the Guarantor’s assets and business and that assumes such obligations by contract, operation of law or otherwise, and (ii) the Guarantor may transfer this Guaranty or any interest or obligation of the Guarantor in or under this Guaranty, or any property securing this Guaranty, to another entity as transferee as part of the resolution, restructuring or reorganization of the Guarantor upon or following the Guarantor becoming subject to a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution or similar proceeding. Upon any such delegation and assumption or transfer of obligations, the Guarantor shall be relieved of and fully discharged from all obligations hereunder, whether such obligations arose before or after such delegation and assumption or transfer.

THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. GUARANTOR AGREES TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, OVER ANY DISPUTES ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY.

In the event the Guarantor becomes subject to a proceeding under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together, the "U.S. Special Resolution Regimes"), the transfer of this Guaranty, and any interest and obligation in or under, and any property securing, this Guaranty, from the Guarantor will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under such U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Guaranty, and any interest and obligation in or under this Guaranty, were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event the Company or the Guarantor, or any of their affiliates, becomes subject to a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, default rights against the Company or the Guarantor with respect to this Guaranty are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such default rights could be exercised under such U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Guaranty was governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.

Very truly yours,

**PRINCIPLES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT**

SMUD is committed to developing carbon free renewable energy in a manner that supports the community, protects the environment, and respects human rights. This document provides guidance on the key objectives that SMUD expects to achieve associated with this commitment. Renewable energy projects engaged in a commercial relationship with SMUD such as a power purchase agreement will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, implement, and maintain throughout the associated term, a “Community Benefits Plan” that addresses how the project will achieve the key objectives identified herein.

**Key objectives:**

1. **Land Use:** Prioritize previously developed lands. Avoid or minimize impacts on sensitive environmental resources, including but not limited to cultural resources, tribal cultural resources, and biological resources such as endangered species habitat, vernal pools and other sensitive habitats, “Waters of the US”, “Waters of the State” and waters identified by California Department of Fish and Wildlife as “Streambed”. Provide additional mitigation measures if avoidance and minimization measures cannot fully eliminate impacts. Applicants are expected to discuss these topics with both SMUD and the lead agency as early as possible to identify potential associated issues in advance of the purchase power agreement being finalized.

2. **Land Use:** All projects should employ techniques for maintaining and/or restoring ecosystem function to the site in conjunction with renewable energy outcomes, including establishment of native vegetation, restricting use of herbicides and pesticides, use of grazing for vegetation management and seasonally appropriate maintenance practices. Where development is on or surrounded by agricultural lands the project should also employ agricultural practices on the property during operations including sheep grazing, dry crop farming and irrigated food production where feasible.

3. **Land Use:** Employ design and construction practices that minimize ground disturbance to the maximum extent possible. This is especially critical in areas where cultural, tribal and biological resources are of significant concern.

4. **Sustainable Life Cycle Management:** Include plans for sustainable life cycle management of construction materials and project components during construction and operation that provides for recycling and reuse of construction waste and waste during operation including but not limited to the solar panels.

5. **Community Benefits:**

   (a) **Inclusive Economic Development:** Leverage SMUD’s Supplier Education & Economic Development (SEED) team to connect with certified small business vendors/contractors in SMUD’s service territory to support the project. Submit requests to seed.mgr@smud.org.

9FBD-394166
<!-- Page 262 -->
6. **Zero Carbon Workforce Development:** SMUD seeks to galvanize and prepare the region for an inclusive, diverse, creative, and empowered future workforce. Leverage SMUD’s existing workforce development agreements, programs, and partnerships throughout the Project to support the development of a clean energy labor force. The Project Team will work with SMUD to engage various elements of the labor supply chain via pre-apprentice and apprenticeship programs, internships, informational sessions, and mentorship opportunities.

7. **Sustainable Materials & Equipment:** Sourcing materials and equipment from companies that have a human rights policy and statement of supply chain ethics commitment that expresses the corporation’s commitment to meet the responsibility to respect human rights and uphold ethical business practices in their operations and value chains.

**NARRATIVE:**  
**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his designee, to negotiate and execute the following:  

a. A power purchase agreement with Hatchet Ridge Wind, LLC for a 7-year term for 101.2 MW of renewable wind power at an annual approximate cost of $24 million, substantially in the form attached.  

b. A power purchase agreement with SunZia Wind PowerCo, LLC (SunZia) for a 15-year term for 150 MW of renewable wind power at an annual approximate cost of $41 million, substantially in the form attached; and subsequent replacement power purchase agreement(s) with a Pattern Energy, LLC subsidiary to address project investment capital needs, under substantially the same terms and conditions as the SunZia original power purchase agreement.  

**Summary:**  
SMUD received non-binding indications of interest from Pattern Energy, LLC (Pattern) for the Hatchet Ridge Wind and SunZia Wind Projects in 2023. SMUD conducted an evaluation of the market and determined that these projects provided superior value and key solutions compared to available alternatives for meeting our 2030 Zero Carbon Plan and California Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) compliance. SMUD and Pattern negotiated mutually beneficial power purchase agreements (PPAs) under which SMUD will purchase the energy, capacity attributes, and Portfolio Content Category 1 Renewable Energy Credits (PCC RECs). The two PPAs are offered by Pattern as a package deal and are therefore contingent on each other.  

a. Hatchet Ridge Wind Project, owned and operated by Hatchet Ridge Wind, LLC, is located in Northern California and is an existing wind facility interconnected to the California Independent System Operator Corporation (CAISO) grid. The renewable generation project has a capacity of 101.2 MW and will provide approximately 270,000 MWh annually. The contract start date for the PPA is December 14, 2025, and has a term of seven years. The approximate annual cost of the PPA is $24M.  

b. SunZia Wind Project, owned and operated by SunZia Wind PowerCo, LLC, and the associated SunZia Transmission Project, are located in New Mexico and Arizona and will combine to create the largest clean energy infrastructure project in the United States history at more than 3,500 MW split between a northern portion (SunZia North) and southern portion (SunZia South). SMUD’s share of the overall project is 150 MW of capacity which will be part of the CAISO Balancing Authority Area and provide approximately 490,000 MWh annually. The PPA’s expected commercial operation date is April 30, 2026, and has a term of 15 years. The approximate annual cost of the PPA is $41M.  

Given the unique size of the SunZia Wind Project, Pattern intends to separate the project into different portions and sell all or a part of the ownership interests to an outside investor to facilitate capital needs.

The conditions precedent in Section 2.3 are not applicable to the Parties’ obligations under this Section 3.7.

3.8 Capacity Attributes.

(a) From and after the Capacity Attributes Guarantee Date, Seller sells, grants, pledges, assigns and otherwise commits to Buyer all of the Capacity Attributes.

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.8 and Section 3.12, throughout the Delivery Term, Seller shall perform all commercially reasonable actions necessary to ensure that the Facility is eligible to provide Capacity Attributes at the Delivery Point. From and after the Capacity Attributes Guarantee Date, subject to the provisions of this Section 3.8 and Section 3.12, Seller hereby covenants and agrees to transfer all Capacity Attributes to Buyer. Seller shall not commit or encumber any portion of Buyer's Share of the output of the Facility so as to prevent the entire Buyer’s Share from serving as Buyer's Supporting Resource (as defined in the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure Business Rules) and delivering the Guaranteed Capacity Attributes.

(c) Subject to Section 3.12, for the duration of the Delivery Term, Seller shall use good faith efforts, including as set forth in this Section 3.8(c), to comply with requirements in connection with Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity that (i) are instituted by the governing body of Buyer or the CAISO, and (ii) differ from CAISO or CPUC rules applicable to Resource Adequacy Benefits. Seller shall provide to Buyer an attestation, in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, stating that Buyer has procured the Capacity Attributes.

(d) Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.8, at Buyer’s reasonable request, Seller shall execute such documents and instruments and take all steps and actions as may be reasonably required to effect recognition and transfer of the Capacity Attributes as belonging to Buyer; provided that no such request may impose any material additional third-party costs (other than those reimbursed by Buyer pursuant to Section 3.12) or obligations on Seller, or reduce Seller’s compensation hereunder.

(e) Buyer acknowledges that it may be required to take action and obtain certain rights at the Delivery Point in order to make use of the Capacity Attributes, including

-28-
84ET-387782

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  

obtaining and maintaining Import Capability and/or other rights as may be required under applicable Law to import energy and capacity into the CAISO Balancing Authority Area and make use of the Capacity Attributes. If applicable, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to support Buyer’s efforts to (i) obtain such Import Capability, (ii) obtain any other rights that Buyer is required to obtain, or (iii) take any other actions that Buyer is required to take, in each case in order for Buyer to make use of the Capacity Attributes, and in each case as may be required under applicable law and as may change from time to time. Buyer’s failure to obtain or maintain Import Capability or any other rights or capacities, or take any other actions, necessary to support the importation of the Capacity Attributes or otherwise receive or utilize the Capacity Attributes, for reasons other than a Seller failure under this Agreement, shall not be a Seller breach hereunder; any Capacity Attributes, expressed in kW, not delivered to Buyer due to such failure of Buyer shall be defined as “Deemed Delivered Capacity Attributes”. In addition, if any action or inaction of the governing board of Buyer (x) prevents Seller from delivering any Capacity Attributes to Buyer using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with and limited to Seller’s obligations hereunder with respect to Capacity Attributes as of the Effective Date, or (y) disqualifies the Facility from providing Capacity Attributes to Buyer, in whole or in part, all such undelivered or ineligible Capacity Attributes shall constitute Deemed Delivered Capacity Attributes.

(f) From and after the Capacity Attributes Guarantee Date, for any calendar month in which there is a Capacity Attribute Shortfall greater than zero (0) kW:

(i) Seller shall be liable for liquidated damages (“Capacity Damage Amount”) in the amount of

(d) Daily Forecast of Available Capacity. By 5:30 AM Pacific Prevailing Time each day on the day immediately preceding the date of delivery, Seller shall provide Buyer with (i) a non-binding forecast of its best estimate of Available Capacity and (ii) the Day-Ahead Forecast, in each case, for each hour of the immediately succeeding day.

(e) Real-Time Forecasts. During the Delivery Term, Seller shall notify Buyer of any changes to the Day-Ahead Forecast resulting from changes of fifteen (15) MW or more in available Installed Capacity, or when the hourly Energy expected to be produced by the Facility and delivered to the Delivery Point, net of all Electrical Losses, differs by more than fifteen (15) MWh, as applicable, of the amount set forth in the Day-Ahead Forecast, in each case, due to Forced Facility Outage or Force Majeure Event (such update, the “Real-Time Forecast”), as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than sixty (60) minutes prior to the deadline for submitting Schedules to the CAISO in accordance with the rules for participation in the Real-Time Market. If the available Installed Capacity or, if applicable, the hourly Energy expected to be produced by the Facility and delivered to the Delivery Point, net of all Electrical Losses, changes by at least fifteen (15) MW or 15 MWh, as applicable, due to Forced Facility Outage or Force Majeure Event as of a time that is less than one (1) hour prior to the Real-Time Market deadline, but before such deadline, then Seller must notify Buyer as soon as reasonably possible. Such Real-Time Forecasts shall be prepared by the Third-Party Forecast Vendor and shall contain information regarding the beginning date and time of the event resulting in the change in Installed Capacity or hourly Energy expected to be produced by the Facility and delivered to the Delivery Point, net of all Electrical Losses, as applicable, the expected end date and time of such event, and any other information required by the CAISO or reasonably requested by Buyer. With respect to any Forced Facility Outage, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to notify Buyer of such outage within ten (10) minutes of becoming aware of the Forced Facility Outage. Seller shall inform Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable of any developments that will affect either the duration of such outage or the availability of the Facility during or after the end of such outage. These real-time forecasts shall be communicated by email to Buyer unless Buyer requests an alternative method of communications reasonably acceptable to Seller.

4.5 Dispatch Down/Curtailment.

(a) General. Subject to Section 4.5(b), Seller agrees to reduce deliveries of the Energy produced by the Facility by the amount and for the period set forth in any Curtailment Order; provided that Seller is not required to reduce such amount to the extent it is inconsistent with the limitations of the Facility set out in the Operating Restrictions.

(b) Alternative Delivery Point/Third-Party Sales. In the event that, and for so long as, Seller is unable to deliver all or a portion of the Product to Buyer at the Delivery Point, but Seller is able to deliver Product to Buyer at one or more Alternative Delivery Points, such Alternative Delivery Points shall be considered the Delivery Point under this Agreement. If Buyer and Seller fail to agree upon an Alternative Delivery Point, (i) Seller may, in its sole discretion, sell and deliver some or all of the Product during any Curtailment Period to one or more third party buyers to the extent that Seller may do so in compliance with Law and Prudent Operating Practice, and (ii)

-37-
84ET-387782
<!-- Page 313 -->
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to sell and deliver some or all of the Product during Market Curtailment Periods at a positive price to the extent that Seller may do so in compliance with Law and Prudent Operating Practice. If and to the extent that Seller makes sales pursuant to the preceding sentence, (i) no PTC Amount shall be paid for Deemed Delivered Energy to the extent that Seller delivers Energy to a third party and (ii) Seller shall credit to Buyer all revenues, net of Seller’s incremental costs associated with such sales, up to the product of (A) the Contract Price multiplied by (B) the amount of Product sold (“Contract Revenues”), and Seller shall be entitled to all revenues in excess of the Contract Revenues.

4.6 Reduction in Delivery Obligation. For the avoidance of doubt, and in no way limiting Section 3.1 or Exhibit E:

(a) Facility Maintenance. Seller shall be permitted to reduce deliveries of Product during any Planned Outage; provided that during each period from June 1 to September 30, Seller shall not schedule any non-emergency maintenance of the Facility which reduces the energy generation capability of the Facility by more than ten percent (10%) unless (i) such maintenance is required to avoid an emergency or damage to the Facility or the Interconnection Facilities, (ii) such maintenance is necessary to maintain equipment warranties or is otherwise in accordance with equipment manufacturer recommendations and cannot reasonably be scheduled outside such period, (iii) such maintenance is in connection with a Force Majeure Event, (iv) such maintenance is required by applicable Law, the requirements of a Transmission Provider and/or any other applicable Governmental Authority, or Prudent Operating Practice, (v) such maintenance is required for other valid reasons, or (vi) the Parties agree otherwise in writing. On or before December 1st of each year, Seller shall provide Buyer with the scheduled maintenance for the Facility for the next calendar year.

(b) Forced Facility Outage. Seller shall be permitted to reduce deliveries of Product during any Forced Facility Outage. Seller shall provide Buyer with Notice and expected duration (if known) of any Forced Facility Outage and shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of any developments that will affect either the duration of the outage or the availability of the Facility during and after the end of such outage.

-38-
84ET-387782
<!-- Page 314 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Displayed)

provided, that if some amount of the Day-Ahead Forecast has been awarded a Day-Ahead Schedule, Seller shall not reduce the Delivered Energy, pursuant to this clause, below the amount of the Day-Ahead Forecast that has been awarded a Day-Ahead Schedule, and any such reduction shall not be included in a Market Curtailment Period. Seller shall also be permitted in its sole discretion to reduce a portion of Facility generation and/or deliveries of Facility generation to the Delivery Point not including Buyer’s Share during any Settlement Period that is not a Curtailment Period nor Market Curtailment Period. During such curtailments, Seller shall deliver Delivered Energy to Buyer in accordance with clause (c) of the definition of “Delivered Energy”. Illustrative settlement examples during the foregoing events are provided in Exhibit O.

4.7 Guaranteed Energy Production.

(a) After the first Contract Year, Seller shall be required to deliver to Buyer no less than the Guaranteed Energy Production (as defined below) in each period of two (2) consecutive Contract Years during the Delivery Term (such that the first Performance Measurement Period comprises Contract Years 2 and 3, the second Performance Measurement Period comprises Contract years 3 and 4 and so on) (“Performance Measurement Period”). “Guaranteed Energy Production” means an amount of Product for each Performance Measurement Period, as measured in MWh, equal to in such Performance Measurement Period. The calculation will be performed once each Contract Year, beginning with the third anniversary of the Commercial Operation Date. Seller shall be excused from achieving the Guaranteed Energy Production during any Performance Measurement Period only to the extent of any Forced Facility Outage (provided Seller has followed Prudent Operating Practices), Force Majeure Events, System Emergencies, Buyer’s failure to perform, Curtailment Periods and Market Curtailment Periods. If Seller fails to achieve the Guaranteed Energy Production amount in any Performance Measurement Period, Seller shall (i) pay Buyer Energy Replacement Damages calculated in accordance with Exhibit E, or (ii) in lieu of paying some or all of the Energy Replacement Damages, at Seller’s discretion, provide Replacement Product retrospectively pursuant to and subject to the requirements of Section 4.7(b)(ii).

(b) Seller shall be permitted to deliver Replacement Product (i) prospectively during any Performance Measurement Period if Seller reasonably anticipates that delivery of such Replacement Product is necessary to achieve the Guaranteed Energy Production for such Performance Measurement Period, or (ii) retrospectively during the Contract Year immediately following any Performance Measurement Period in accordance with Section 4.7(a) above; provided, Seller’s right to deliver Replacement Product shall be expressly subject to Buyer’s prior written acceptance of Seller’s proposed delivery schedule for such Replacement Product; provided further, Replacement Product shall be delivered to (x) at Seller’s election, the Delivery Point or the California-Oregon Border (COB) trading hub or (y) an Alternative Delivery Point. Seller shall provide Notice to Buyer of any proposed delivery of Replacement Product, including a proposed schedule of such deliveries, at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed delivery of such Replacement Product and, solely with respect to retrospective Replacement Product, at least thirty (30) days after the conclusion of any Performance Measurement Period with respect to which Seller proposes to deliver retrospective Replacement Product. If the parties cannot reach agreement on a schedule of deliveries, Seller shall have no right to deliver, and Buyer shall have no obligation to pay for, the proposed Replacement Product.

4.8  WREGIS. Seller shall, at its sole expense, take all actions and execute all documents or instruments necessary to ensure that all WREGIS Certificates associated with all Renewable Energy Credits corresponding to all Delivered Energy are issued and tracked for purposes of satisfying the requirements of the California Renewables Portfolio Standard and transferred in a timely manner to Buyer for Buyer’s sole benefit. Seller shall transfer such Renewable Energy Credits to Buyer. Seller shall comply with all Laws, including the WREGIS Operating Rules, regarding the certification and transfer of such WREGIS Certificates to Buyer and Buyer shall be given sole title to all such WREGIS Certificates. Seller shall satisfy its obligations pursuant to Section 3.10(d) and Section 4.2(b) by fulfilling its obligations under Sections 4.8(a) through (f) below. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4.8, following the occurrence of the SPTO Date, Seller shall not be required to generate E-Tags associated with Delivered Energy and/or Replacement Energy unless required (i) pursuant to the CAISO Tariff, or (ii) by WREGIS, the CPUC, the CEC, or other applicable Law for matching E-Tags with Delivered Energy and/or Replacement Energy in order to validate RPS claims.

(a)  Prior to the Commercial Operation Date, Seller shall register the Facility with WREGIS and establish an account with WREGIS (“Seller’s WREGIS Account”), which Seller shall maintain until the end of the Delivery Term. Seller shall transfer the WREGIS Certificates using Recurring Certificate Transfers from Seller’s WREGIS Account to the WREGIS account(s) of Buyer or the account(s) of a designate that Buyer identifies by Notice to Seller (“Buyer’s WREGIS Account”). Seller shall be responsible for all expenses associated with registering the Facility with WREGIS, establishing and maintaining Seller’s WREGIS Account, paying WREGIS registration and annual fees, and transferring WREGIS Certificates from Seller’s WREGIS Account to Buyer’s WREGIS Account. Buyer shall be responsible for all expenses associated with establishing and maintaining Buyer’s WREGIS account.

(b)  Seller shall cause Recurring Certificate Transfers to occur on a monthly basis in accordance with the certification procedure established by the WREGIS Operating Rules. Since WREGIS Certificates will only be created for whole MWh amounts of Energy generated, any fractional MWh amounts (i.e., kWh) will be carried forward until sufficient generation is accumulated for the creation of a WREGIS Certificate. WREGIS Certificates must be matched with E-Tags associated with the Dynamic Transfers (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred and the CEC does not require E-Tag matching in order to validate RPS claims, with the Delivered Energy and Replacement Energy). WREGIS Certificates without matching E-Tags associated with Dynamic Transfers (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred and the CEC does not require E-Tag matching in order to validate RPS claims, with the Delivered Energy and Replacement Energy) will be rejected.

(c)  Seller shall, at its sole expense, ensure that the WREGIS Certificates for a given calendar month correspond with the Delivered Energy for such calendar month as evidenced by the amounts corresponding to the Facility’s metered data that match E-Tags associated with the Dynamic Transfers (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred and the CEC does not require E-Tag matching in order to validate RPS claims, with the Delivered Energy and Replacement Energy). Subject to delivery of Replacement Product, Seller shall ensure that no WREGIS Certificates are transferred to Buyer’s WREGIS Account unless they are the result of Delivered Energy reflected in the Facility’s metered data and matched with E-Tags associated

- **Section 4.8**: WREGIS Certificates
  - (d) Due to the approximately fourteen (14) day delay in the creation of WREGIS Certificates relative to the timing of invoice payment under Section 8.2, Buyer shall make an invoice payment for a given month in accordance with Section 8.2 notwithstanding that the WREGIS Certificates may not have been formally transferred to Buyer in accordance with the WREGIS Operating Rules and this Section 4.8. Notwithstanding this delay, Buyer shall have all right and title to all such WREGIS Certificates upon payment to Seller in accordance with Section 8.2.
  
  - (e) A “WREGIS Certificate Deficit” means any deficit or shortfall in WREGIS Certificates delivered to Buyer for a calendar month as compared to the Delivered Energy for the same calendar month (“Deficient Month”). If any WREGIS Certificate Deficit is caused, or the result of any action or inaction, by Seller, then the amount of Delivered Energy in the Deficient Month shall be reduced on a pro rata basis across all Settlement Periods in such Deficient Month by the amount of the WREGIS Certificate Deficit for purposes of calculating Buyer’s payment to Seller under Article 8 and the Guaranteed Energy Production for the applicable Performance Measurement Period; provided, however, that such adjustment shall not apply to the extent that after the ninety (90) days attributed to the delay in the creation of WREGIS Certificates for such Deficient Month, Seller either (x) resolves the WREGIS Certificate Deficit within an additional one hundred eighty (180) days (i) upon a schedule reasonably acceptable to Buyer and (ii) provided that such deliveries do not impose additional costs upon Buyer for which Seller refuses to provide reimbursement. If the amount of Delivered Energy in the Deficient Month is reduced in accordance with the prior sentence and neither (x) nor (y) of the prior sentence apply, Buyer shall pay Seller for any Delivered Energy that is delivered by Seller without corresponding WREGIS Certificates at a price equal to the lesser of (i) the Contract Price, or (ii) the LMP in the Day-Ahead Market at the Delivery Point, and for purposes of the Guaranteed Energy Production, Delivered Energy is reduced by the amount of the WREGIS Certificate Deficit for the applicable Performance Measurement Period. Without limiting Seller’s obligations under this Section 4.8, if a WREGIS Certificate Deficit is caused solely by an error or omission of WREGIS, Delivered Energy shall not be reduced pursuant to this Section 4.8(e) and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to cause WREGIS to correct its error or omission.
  
  - (f) If WREGIS changes the WREGIS Operating Rules after the Effective Date or applies the WREGIS Operating Rules in a manner inconsistent with this Section 4.8 after the Effective Date, the Parties promptly shall modify this Section 4.8 as reasonably required to cause and enable Seller to transfer to Buyer’s WREGIS Account a quantity of WREGIS Certificates for each given calendar month that corresponds to the Delivered Energy in the same calendar month.

- **4.9 Modification of Installed Capacity**: At any time prior to January 31, 2025 (“Capacity Increase Deadline”), Seller shall have the option to elect to implement the South Turbine Uprate, and in connection therewith to (i) increase the maximum Installed Capacity of -41- 84ET-387782
<!-- Page 317 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
the Facility listed on the Cover Sheet of this Agreement up to an amount equal to 3,800 MW, and (ii) increase the Expected Energy under this Agreement to reflect the increased generating capacity resulting from the South Turbine Uprate. Seller shall deliver Notice to Buyer of its election to implement the South Turbine Uprate no later than the Capacity Increase Deadline, which Notice shall include the increased maximum Installed Capacity of the Facility and increased Expected Energy under this Agreement. Upon receipt of such Notice by Buyer, this Agreement shall be deemed automatically amended as follows:

(a) The text “3,515 MW” in the section “Description of Facility” on the Cover Sheet of this Agreement shall be replaced with the maximum Installed Capacity amount set forth in Seller’s Notice to Buyer delivered pursuant to this Section 4.9; and

(b) The text “________ MWh” in the section “Expected Energy” on the Cover Sheet of this Agreement shall be replaced with the Expected Energy amount set forth in Seller’s Notice to Buyer delivered pursuant to this Section 4.9.

4.10 Standard of Care.

ARTICLE 5  
TAXES

5.1 Allocation of Taxes and Charges. Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes on or with respect to the Facility or on or with respect to the sale and delivery of Product to Buyer, that are imposed on Product prior to the Delivery Point. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes on or with respect to the delivery to and purchase by Buyer of the Product that are imposed on Product at and from the Delivery Point (other than withholding or other Taxes imposed on Seller’s income, revenue, receipts or employees). If a Party is required to remit or pay Taxes that are the other Party’s responsibility hereunder, such Party shall promptly pay the Taxes due and then seek and receive reimbursement from the other for such Taxes. In the event any sale of Product hereunder is exempt from or not subject to any particular Tax, the exempted Party shall provide the other Party with all necessary documentation within thirty (30) days after

the Effective Date to evidence such exemption or exclusion. If the exempted Party does not provide such documentation, then such Party shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party from any liability with respect to Taxes from which the exempted Party claims it is exempt.

5.2 Cooperation. Each Party shall use reasonable efforts to implement the provisions of and administer this Agreement in accordance with the intent of the Parties to minimize all Taxes, so long as no Party is materially adversely affected by such efforts. The Parties shall cooperate to minimize Tax exposure; provided, however, that neither Party shall be obligated to incur any financial or operational burden to reduce Taxes for which the other Party is responsible hereunder without receiving due compensation therefor from the other Party. All Energy delivered by Seller to Buyer hereunder shall be a sale made at wholesale, with Buyer reselling such Energy.

ARTICLE 6
MAINTENANCE OF THE FACILITY

6.1 Maintenance of the Facility. Seller shall comply with Law and Prudent Operating Practice relating to the operation and maintenance of the Facility and the generation and sale of Product.

6.2 Maintenance of Health and Safety. Seller shall take reasonable safety precautions with respect to the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the Facility. If Seller becomes aware of any circumstances relating to the Facility that create an imminent risk of damage or injury to any Person or any Person’s property, Seller shall take prompt, reasonable action to prevent such damage or injury and shall give Buyer’s emergency contact identified on Exhibit K notice of such condition. Such action may include disconnecting and removing all or a portion of the Facility, or suspending the supply of Energy to Buyer.

6.3 Shared Facilities. The Parties acknowledge and agree that certain of the Interconnection Facilities, Seller’s rights and obligations under the Interconnection Agreement and Seller’s rights and obligations under transmission service agreements with a Transmission Provider, may be subject to certain shared facilities and/or co-tenancy agreements (“Shared Facilities Agreements”) to be entered into among two or more of Seller, the Participating Transmission Owner, Seller’s Affiliates, and/or third parties pursuant to which certain joint ownership and/or shared maintenance and operation arrangements.

ARTICLE 7
METERING

7.1 Metering. Seller shall measure the amount of Delivered Energy produced by the Facility using an Approved Meter.

**ARTICLE 7**

**METERING**

7.1 Meter Maintenance. Seller shall be responsible for maintaining the meter in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Seller shall not be responsible for any costs, fines or penalties, including imbalance charges as a result of the inaccurate meter. The meter shall be kept under seal, such seals to be broken only when the meters are to be tested, adjusted, modified and/or relocated. In the event that Seller breaks a seal, Seller shall notify Buyer as soon as practicable. In addition, Seller hereby agrees to provide all Approved Meter data to Buyer in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and consents to Buyer obtaining from CAISO or the PTO, as applicable (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred, in accordance with CAISO requirements only), the meter data applicable to the Facility and all inspection, testing and calibration data and reports. Seller, or Seller’s Scheduling Coordinator, shall cooperate with Buyer to allow both Parties to retrieve the meter reads from the CAISO Market Results Interface – Settlements (MRIS-S) (or its successor).

7.2 Meter Verification. Annually, if Seller has reason to believe there may be a meter malfunction, or upon Buyer’s reasonable request, Seller shall test the meter. The tests shall be conducted by independent third parties qualified to conduct such tests at Seller’s expense; provided, if the meter is tested at Buyer’s request and is determined to be accurate, the costs of such test shall be borne by Buyer. Buyer shall be notified seven (7) days in advance of such tests and have a right to be present during such tests. If a meter is inaccurate it shall be promptly repaired or replaced. If a meter is inaccurate by more than one percent (1%) and it is not known when the meter inaccuracy commenced (if such evidence exists such date will be used to adjust prior invoices), then the invoices covering the period of time since the last meter test shall be adjusted for the amount of the inaccuracy on the assumption that the inaccuracy persisted during the second half of such period.

**ARTICLE 8**

**INVOICING AND PAYMENT; CREDIT**

8.1 Invoicing. Seller shall deliver an invoice to Buyer no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the prior monthly delivery period; provided that Seller’s failure to deliver an invoice to Buyer by such deadline shall not be a breach hereunder. Each invoice shall provide Buyer (a) records of metered data, including metering and CAISO transaction data sufficient to document and verify the amount of Delivered Energy for each Settlement Period during the preceding month, including the amount of Delivered Energy as set forth in the first CAISO settlement statement for the prior month that includes meter data from the Approved Meter, the applicable Contract Price, deviations between the Scheduled Energy and the Delivered Energy, the LMP in the Real-Time Market at the Delivery Point for each Settlement Period; (b) a reconciliation of hourly meter data, E-Tag data (to the extent required under the CAISO Tariff) and associated calculations, including the lesser of each hour, plus any additional data as may be reasonably required by Buyer for compliance with CPUC reporting obligations, including pursuant to the CPUC’s Energy Division Portfolio Content Category Classification Review Handbook (or successor publication); (c) a statement of the quantity of WREGIS Certificates transferred during the prior month that have been matched with E-Tags associated with the Dynamic Transfers (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred, with the Delivered Energy and Replacement Energy, to the extent required by WREGIS, the CPUC, the CEC, or other applicable Law); (d) access to any records, including invoices or settlement data from the CAISO, necessary to verify the accuracy of any amount; and (e) be in a reasonable format covering the services provided in the preceding month determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

-44-

<!-- Page 320 -->
8.2  Payment. Buyer shall make payment to Seller by wire transfer or ACH payment to the bank account provided on each monthly invoice. Buyer shall pay undisputed invoice amounts within thirty (30) days after receipt of the invoice. If such due date falls on a weekend, local business holiday observed by either Party, or a NERC holiday, such due date shall be the next Business Day. Payments made after the due date will be considered late and will bear interest on the unpaid balance. If the amount due is not paid on or before the due date or if any other payment that is due and owing from one party to another is not paid on or before its applicable due date, a late payment charge shall be applied to the unpaid balance and shall be added to the next billing statement. Such late payment charge shall be calculated based on an annual Interest Rate equal to the prime rate published on the date of the invoice in The Wall Street Journal (or, if The Wall Street Journal is not published on that day, the next succeeding date of publication), plus two percent (2%) (the “Interest Rate”). If the due date occurs on a day that is not a Business Day, the late payment charge shall begin to accrue on the next succeeding Business Day.

8.3  Books and Records. To facilitate payment and verification, each Party shall maintain all books and records necessary for billing and payments, including copies of all invoices under this Agreement, for a period of at least two (2) years or as otherwise required by Law. Upon fifteen (15) days’ Notice to Seller, Buyer shall be granted reasonable access to the accounting books and records pertaining to all invoices generated pursuant to this Agreement.

8.4  Payment Adjustments; Billing Errors. Payment adjustments shall be made if Seller discovers there have been good faith inaccuracies in invoicing that are sufficient to require a payment adjustment, or if CAISO recalculates amounts due or owing in respect of prior periods. If the required adjustment is in favor of Buyer, Buyer’s monthly payment shall be credited in an amount equal to the adjustment. If the required adjustment is in favor of Seller, Seller shall add the adjustment amount to Buyer’s next monthly invoice. Other than recalculations by CAISO, adjustments in favor of either Buyer or Seller shall bear interest, until settled in full, in accordance with Section 8.2, accruing from the date on which the non-erring Party received Notice thereof.

8.5  Billing Disputes. A Party may, in good faith, dispute the correctness of any invoice or any adjustment to an invoice rendered under this Agreement or adjust any invoice for any arithmetic or computational error within twelve (12) months of the date the invoice, or adjustment to an invoice, was rendered. In the event an invoice or portion thereof, or any other claim or adjustment arising hereunder, is disputed, payment of the undisputed portion of the invoice shall be required to be made when due. Any invoice dispute or invoice adjustment shall be in writing and shall state the basis for the dispute or adjustment. Payment of the disputed amount shall not be required until the dispute is resolved. Upon resolution of the dispute, any required payment shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of such resolution along with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from and including the original due date to but excluding the date paid. Inadvertent overpayments shall be returned upon request or deducted by the Party receiving such overpayment from subsequent payments, with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from and including the date of such overpayment but excluding the date repaid or deducted by the Party receiving such overpayment. Any dispute with respect to an invoice is waived if the other Party is not notified in accordance with this Section 8.5 within twelve (12) months after the -45- 84ET-387782
<!-- Page 321 -->
![Invoice Section](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Invoice+Section)

invoice is rendered or subsequently adjusted, except to the extent any misinformation was from a third party not affiliated with any Party and such third party corrects its information after the twelve-month period. If an invoice is not rendered within twelve (12) months after the close of the month during which performance occurred, the right to payment for such performance is waived.

8.6 **Netting of Payments.** The Parties hereby agree that they shall discharge mutual debts and payment obligations due and owing to each other on the same date through netting, in which case all undisputed amounts owed by each Party to the other Party for the purchase and sale of Product during the monthly billing period under this Agreement or otherwise arising out of this Agreement, including any related damages calculated pursuant to Exhibits B and E, interest, and payments or credits, including pursuant to Section 4.3(c), shall be netted so that only the excess amount remaining due shall be paid by the Party who owes the remaining amount.

8.7 **Seller's Development Security.** To secure its obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall deliver Development Security to Buyer within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date. Seller shall maintain the Development Security in full force and effect. Upon the earlier of (A) Seller’s delivery of the Performance Security, or (B) sixty (60) days after termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall return the Development Security to Seller, less the amounts drawn in accordance with this Agreement. If and to the extent that any portion of the Development Security is a Letter of Credit and the issuer of such Letter of Credit (i) fails to maintain a Credit Rating of at least “A-” by S&P or “A3” by Moody’s, (ii) indicates intent not to renew such Letter of Credit and such Letter of Credit expires prior to the Commercial Operation Date, (iii) fails to honor Buyer’s properly documented request to draw on such Letter of Credit, or (iv) becomes Bankrupt, Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days to post substitute collateral that meets the requirements set forth in the definition of Development Security. Seller shall have no obligation to replenish the Development Security following any draws thereon by Buyer. Seller’s maximum liability for an Event of Default or failure to perform its obligations hereunder prior to the Commercial Operation Date shall be capped at the amount of the Development Security, less any amounts collected by Buyer prior to such Event of Default or failure to perform.

8.8 **Seller's Performance Security.** To secure its obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall deliver Performance Security to Buyer on or before the Commercial Operation Date. Seller shall maintain the Performance Security in full force and effect until the following occurred: (A) the Delivery Term has expired or terminated early; and (B) all payment obligations of the Seller arising under this Agreement, including compensation for penalties, Termination Payment, indemnification payments or other damages are paid in full (whether directly or indirectly such as through set-off or netting). Following the occurrence of both events, Buyer shall promptly return to Seller the unused portion of the Performance Security. If and to the extent that any portion of the Performance Security is a Letter of Credit and the issuer of such Letter of Credit (i) fails to maintain a Credit Rating of at least “A-” by S&P or “A3” by Moody’s, (ii) fails to honor Buyer’s properly documented request to draw on such Letter of Credit, or (iii) becomes Bankrupt, Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days to post substitute collateral that meets the requirements set forth in the definition of Performance Security.

![Financial Statements and Security Interest](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Financial+Statements+and+Security+Interest)

8.9 Financial Statements.

(a) If requested, Buyer shall provide to Seller (i) within one hundred twenty (120) days following the end of each fiscal year during the Contract Term, a copy of Buyer’s annual report containing audited consolidated financial statements for such fiscal year and (ii) within sixty (60) days after the end of each of its first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year during the Contract Term, a copy of Buyer’s quarterly report containing unaudited consolidated financial statements for such fiscal quarter. In all cases the statements shall be for the most recent accounting period and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”); provided, however, that should any such statements not be available on a timely basis due to a delay in preparation or certifications, such unavailability shall not be an Event of Default so long as Buyer diligently pursues the preparation, certification, and delivery of the statements.

8.10 Buyer’s First Priority Security Interest in Cash or Cash Equivalent Collateral. To secure its obligations under this Agreement, and until released as provided herein, Seller hereby grants to Buyer a present and continuing first-priority security interest in, and lien on (and right to net against), and assignment of the Development Security or Performance Security, any other cash collateral and cash equivalent collateral posted by Seller pursuant to Sections 8.7 and 8.8, and any and all interest thereon or proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof, whether now or hereafter held by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of Buyer, and Seller agrees to take all action as Buyer reasonably requires in order to perfect Buyer’s first-priority security interest in, and lien on (and right to net against), such collateral and any and all proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof.

Upon or any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default caused by Seller, an Early Termination Date resulting from an Event of Default caused by Seller, or an occasion provided for in this Agreement where Buyer is authorized to retain all or a portion of the Development Security or Performance Security, Buyer may do any one or more of the following (in each case subject to the final sentence of this Section 8.10 and the provisions of Article 12):

(a) Exercise any of its rights and remedies with respect to the Development Security or Performance Security, as applicable, including any such rights and remedies under Law then in effect;

(b) Draw on any outstanding Letter of Credit issued for its benefit and retain any cash held by Buyer as Development Security or Performance Security, as applicable; and

(c) Liquidate all Development Security or Performance Security, as applicable then held by or for the benefit of Buyer from any claim or right of any nature whatsoever of Seller, including any equity or right of purchase or redemption by Seller.

Buyer shall apply the proceeds of the collateral realized upon the exercise of any such rights or remedies to reduce Seller’s obligations under this Agreement (Seller remains liable for any amounts owing to Buyer after such application), subject to Buyer’s obligation to return any surplus proceeds remaining after these obligations are satisfied in full.

![ARTICLE 10 FORCE MAJEURE](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=ARTICLE+10+FORCE+MAJEURE)

**ARTICLE 10  
FORCE MAJEURE**

10.1 **Definition.**

(a) **“Force Majeure Event”** means any act or event that delays or prevents a Party from timely performing all or a portion of its obligations under this Agreement or from complying with all or a portion of the conditions under this Agreement if such act or event, which event or circumstance, despite the exercise of reasonable efforts, cannot be avoided by and is beyond the reasonable control (whether direct or indirect) of and without the fault or negligence of the Party relying thereon as justification for such delay, nonperformance, or noncompliance.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, so long as the following events, despite the exercise of reasonable efforts, cannot be avoided by, and are beyond the reasonable control (whether direct or indirect) of and without the fault or negligence of the Party relying thereon as justification for such delay, nonperformance or noncompliance, a Force Majeure Event may include an act of God or the elements, such as flooding, lightning, hurricanes, tornadoes, or ice storms; explosion; fire; volcanic eruption; flood; epidemic, or pandemic, including COVID-19 (but only to the extent that new governmental rules or mandates related to COVID-19 are implemented that were not in place as of the Effective Date); landslide; mudslide; sabotage; terrorism; earthquake; or other cataclysmic events; an act of public enemy; acts or failure to act by a Governmental Authority; war; blockade; civil insurrection; riot; civil

84ET-387782

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Force Majeure Event” does not include (i) economic conditions that render a Party’s performance of this Agreement at the Contract Price unprofitable or otherwise uneconomic (including Buyer’s ability to buy Energy at a lower price, or Seller’s ability to sell Energy generated by the Facility at a higher price, than the Contract Price); (ii) Seller’s inability to obtain permits or approvals of any type for the construction, operation, or maintenance of the Facility, except to the extent such inability is caused by a Force Majeure Event; (iii) the inability of a Party to make payments when due under this Agreement; (iv) a Curtailment Order, except to the extent that a Curtailment Order is caused by an event that otherwise qualifies as a Force Majeure Event; (v) Seller’s inability to obtain sufficient labor, equipment, materials, or other resources to build or operate the Facility except to the extent such inability is caused by a Force Majeure Event; (vi) a strike, work stoppage or labor dispute limited only to any one or more of Seller, Seller’s Affiliates, Seller’s contractors, their subcontractors thereof or any other third party employed by Seller to work on the Facility; (vii) any equipment failure except if such equipment failure is caused by a Force Majeure Event; or (viii) except as the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date may be extended as a result of a Development Cure Period, Seller’s inability to achieve Commercial Operation following the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date.

10.2 No Liability If a Force Majeure Event Occurs. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall be liable to the other Party in the event it is prevented from performing its obligations hereunder in whole or in part due to a Force Majeure Event. The Party rendered unable to fulfill any obligation by reason of a Force Majeure Event shall take reasonable actions necessary to remove such inability with due speed and diligence. Nothing herein shall be construed as permitting that Party to continue to fail to perform after said cause has been removed. The obligation to use due speed and diligence shall not be interpreted to require resolution of labor disputes by acceding to demands of the opposition when such course is inadvisable in the discretion of the Party having such difficulty. Neither Party shall be considered in breach or default of this Agreement if and to the extent that any failure or delay in the Party’s performance of one or more of its obligations hereunder is caused by a Force Majeure Event. The occurrence and continuation of a Force Majeure Event shall not suspend or excuse the obligation of a Party to make any payments due hereunder. Any delays caused by a Force Majeure Event will not serve to increase the Contract Term nor Contract Price of this Agreement.

10.3 Notice. In the event of any delay or nonperformance resulting from a Force Majeure Event, the Party suffering the Force Majeure Event shall (a) as soon as practicable, notify the other Party in writing of the nature, cause, estimated date of commencement thereof, the anticipated extent of any delay or interruption in performance, and, to the extent reasonably practicable, a mitigation plan for limiting or overcoming the impacts of the Force Majeure Event and (b) notify the other Party in writing of the cessation or termination of such Force Majeure Event, all as known or estimated in good faith by the affected Party; provided, however, that a Party’s failure to give timely Notice as provided in this Section 10.3 shall not affect such Party’s ability to assert that a Force Majeure Event has occurred unless the delay in giving Notice materially prejudices the other Party.
<!-- Page 325 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
10.4 **Termination Following Force Majeure Event.** If a Force Majeure Event has occurred after the Commercial Operation Date that has caused either Party to be unable to perform its material obligations hereunder, and has continued for a consecutive twelve (12) month period, then the non-claiming Party may terminate this Agreement upon Notice to the other Party experiencing the Force Majeure Event; provided that if Seller is the Party claiming such Force Majeure Event and such Force Majeure Event cannot reasonably be cured within such twelve (12) month period, then Seller may provide a plan to Buyer, which must be acceptable to Buyer in its reasonable discretion, to cure such Force Majeure Event within an additional consecutive six (6) month period and Buyer may not terminate this Agreement due to such Force Majeure Event unless Seller has not resumed performance of its material obligations hereunder upon the expiration of such additional consecutive six (6) month period. Upon any such termination, the non-claiming Party shall have no liability to the Party claiming Force Majeure Event, save and except for those obligations specified in Section 2.1(b).

(iii) the failure by such Party to perform any material covenant or obligation set forth in this Agreement (except to the extent constituting a separate Event of Default) and such failure is not remedied within thirty (30) days after Notice thereof; provided, that this thirty (30) day period shall be extended by an additional sixty (60) days if (a) the breach cannot reasonably be cured within the thirty (30) day period despite diligent efforts, (b) the default is capable of being cured within the additional sixty (60) day period, and (c) the Defaulting Party commences the cure within the original thirty (30) day period and is at all times thereafter diligently and continuously proceeding to cure the breach;

(b) with respect to Seller as the Defaulting Party, the occurrence of any of the following:

(i) except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time, Seller delivers or attempts to deliver Energy to the Delivery Point for sale under this Agreement that was not generated by the Facility; or

(ii) with respect to any outstanding Letter of Credit provided for the benefit of Buyer that is not then required under this Agreement to be canceled or returned, the failure by Seller to provide for the benefit of Buyer either (1) cash, (2) a replacement surety bond (solely with respect to the Performance Security), or (3) a substitute Letter of Credit from a different issuer meeting the criteria set forth in the definition of Letter of Credit, in each case, in the amount required hereunder within ten (10) Business Days after Seller receives Notice of the occurrence of any of the following events:

11.2 Remedies; Declaration of Early Termination Date. If an Event of Default with respect to a Defaulting Party shall have occurred and be continuing, the other Party (“Non-Defaulting Party”) shall have the following rights:

(a) to send Notice, designating a day, no earlier than the day such Notice is deemed to be received and no later than twenty (20) days after such Notice is deemed to be received, as an early termination date of this Agreement (“Early Termination Date”) that terminates this Agreement (the “Terminated Transaction”) and ends the Contract Term effective as of the Early Termination Date;

(b) to accelerate all amounts owing between the Parties, and to collect as liquidated damages (i) the Damage Payment (in the case of an Event of Default by Seller occurring before the Commercial Operation Date) or (ii) the Termination Payment calculated in accordance with Section 11.3 below (in the case of any other Event of Default by Seller after the Commercial Operation Date or by Buyer throughout the Contract Term);

(c) to withhold any payments due to the Defaulting Party under this Agreement;

(d) to suspend performance; and

(e) to exercise any other right or remedy available at Law or in equity, including specific performance or injunctive relief, except to the extent such remedies are expressly limited under this Agreement;

provided, that payment by the Defaulting Party of the Damage Payment or Termination Payment, as applicable, shall constitute liquidated damages and the Non-Defaulting Party’s sole and exclusive remedy for the Terminated Transaction and the Event of Default related thereto. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller’s sole and aggregate liability under or arising out of a termination of this Agreement prior to the Commercial Operation Date shall be limited to the amount required to be posted as Development Security pursuant to Section 8.7, less any amounts collected by Buyer prior to such Early Termination Date.

11.3 Termination Payment. The termination payment (“Termination Payment”) for a Terminated Transaction shall be the aggregate of all Settlement Amounts plus any or all other amounts due to the Non-Defaulting Party netted into a single amount. If the Non-Defaulting Party’s aggregate Gains exceed its aggregate Losses and Costs, if any, resulting from the termination of this Agreement, the net Settlement Amount shall be zero. The Non-Defaulting Party shall calculate, in a commercially reasonable manner, a Settlement Amount for the Terminated Transaction as of the Early Termination Date. Third parties (which shall not include Affiliates of the Non-Defaulting Party) supplying information for purposes of the calculation of Gains or Losses may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors and other sources of market information. The Settlement Amount shall not include consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary, indirect or business interruption damages; provided, however, that any lost Capacity Attributes and Green Attributes shall be deemed direct damages covered by this Agreement. Without prejudice to the Non-Defaulting Party’s duty to mitigate, the Non-Defaulting Party shall not have to enter into

**TERMINATION PAYMENTS**

11.1 **Calculation of Termination Payment.** The Non-Faulting Party shall calculate the Termination Payment based on the actual damages incurred and may use replacement transactions to establish a Settlement Amount. Each Party agrees and acknowledges that (a) the actual damages that the Non-Defaulting Party would incur in connection with a Terminated Transaction would be difficult or impossible to predict with certainty, (b) the Damage Payment or Termination Payment described in Section 11.2 or this Section 11.3 (as applicable) is a reasonable and appropriate approximation of such damages, and (c) the Damage Payment or Termination Payment described in Section 11.2 or this Section 11.3 (as applicable) is the exclusive remedy of the Non-Defaulting Party in connection with a Terminated Transaction but shall not otherwise act to limit any of the Non-Defaulting Party’s rights or remedies if the Non-Defaulting Party does not elect a Terminated Transaction as its remedy for an Event of Default by the Defaulting Party.

11.4 **Notice of Payment of Termination Payment.** As soon as practicable after a Terminated Transaction, Notice shall be given by the Non-Defaulting Party to the Defaulting Party of the amount of the Termination Payment and whether the Termination Payment is due to the Non-Defaulting Party. The Notice shall include a written statement explaining in reasonable detail the calculation of such amount and the sources for such calculation. The Termination Payment shall be made to the Non-Defaulting Party, as applicable, within ten (10) Business Days after such Notice is effective.

11.5 **Disputes With Respect to Termination Payment.** If the Defaulting Party disputes the Non-Defaulting Party’s calculation of the Termination Payment, in whole or in part, the Defaulting Party shall, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the Non-Defaulting Party’s calculation of the Termination Payment, provide the Non-Defaulting Party a detailed written explanation of the basis for such dispute. Disputes regarding the Termination Payment shall be determined in accordance with Article 15.

11.6 **Rights And Remedies Are Cumulative.** Except where liquidated damages are provided as the exclusive remedy, the rights and remedies of a Party pursuant to this Article 11 shall be cumulative and in addition to the rights of the Parties otherwise provided in this Agreement.

11.7 **Mitigation.** Any Non-Defaulting Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its Costs, Losses and damages resulting from any Event of Default of the other Party under this Agreement.

**ARTICLE 12**  
**LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES**

12.1 **No Consequential Damages.** EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PART OF AN EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER OR ITS INDEMNIFIED PERSONS FOR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOSSES OR DAMAGES FOR LOST REVENUE OR LOST PROFITS, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR NOT, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE.

12.2 Waiver and Exclusion of Other Damages. THE PARTIES CONFIRM THAT THE EXPRESS REMEDIES AND MEASURES OF DAMAGES PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT SATISFY THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSES HEREOF. ALL LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE PERTAINING TO THE PARTIES’ LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND THE PARTIES’ WAIVER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE DEEMED TO “FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE” OR ARE OTHERWISE HELD TO BE INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, IF THERE IS AN EARLY TERMINATION DATE PRIOR TO THE COMMERCIAL OPERATION DATE, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF SELLER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT REQUIRED TO BE POSTED AS DEVELOPMENT SECURITY PURSUANT TO SECTION 8.7, LESS ANY AMOUNTS COLLECTED BY BUYER PRIOR TO SUCH EARLY TERMINATION DATE.

FOR BREACH OF ANY PROVISION FOR WHICH AN EXPRESS AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS PROVIDED, SUCH EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, THE OBLIGOR’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED AS SET FORTH IN SUCH PROVISION, AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES OR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE WAIVED.

IF NO REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, THE OBLIGOR’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES ONLY. THE VALUE OF ANY TAX BENEFITS, DETERMINED ON AN AFTER-TAX BASIS, LOST DUE TO BUYER’S DEFAULT (WHICH SELLER HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO MITIGATE AFTER USE OF REASONABLE EFFORTS) AND AMOUNTS DUE IN CONNECTION WITH THE RECAPTURE OF ANY RENEWABLE ENERGY INCENTIVES, IF ANY, SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE DIRECT DAMAGES.

TO THE EXTENT ANY DAMAGES REQUIRED TO BE PAID HEREUNDER ARE LIQUIDATED, INCLUDING UNDER SECTIONS 3.8, 4.7, 4.8(e), 11.2 AND 11.3, AND AS PROVIDED IN EXHIBIT B AND EXHIBIT E, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE, THAT OTHERWISE OBTAINING AN ADEQUATE REMEDY IS INCONVENIENT, AND THAT THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES CONSTITUTE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE ANTICIPATED HARM OR LOSS. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT THE LIMITATIONS HEREIN IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PARTY, WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO CONTEST SUCH PAYMENTS AS AN UNREASONABLE PENALTY.

THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT MONEY DAMAGES AND THE EXPRESS REMEDIES PROVIDED FOR HEREIN ARE AN ADEQUATE REMEDY FOR THE BREACH BY THE OTHER OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND EACH

<!-- Page 332 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

the written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any direct or indirect Change of Control of a Party (whether voluntary or by operation of Law) will be deemed an assignment and will require the prior written consent of the other Party, except as provided in Section 14.3. Any assignment made without required written consent, or in violation of the conditions to assignment set out below, shall be null and void. The assigning Party shall be responsible for the other Party’s costs associated with the preparation, review, execution, and delivery of documents in connection with any assignment of this Agreement, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees.

14.2 Collateral Assignment. Subject to the provisions of this Section 14.2, Seller has the right to assign this Agreement as collateral for any financing or refinancing of the Facility without the consent of Buyer. In connection with any financing or refinancing of the Facility by Seller, Buyer shall work in good faith with Seller (and its Affiliate(s)) and Lender to agree upon and execute a consent to collateral assignment of this Agreement substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit H.

14.3 Permitted Assignment. Notwithstanding Section 14.1 and, in addition to its rights set forth in Section 14.2, Seller may at any time, without the prior written consent of Buyer, transfer or assign this Agreement (including by a Change of Control) (i) to an Affiliate of Seller, (ii) in connection with a tax equity financing (regardless of whether a Change of Control results from such tax equity financing), or (iii) as part of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the membership interests, equity, or assets of an Affiliate of Seller.

shall be brought in the federal courts of the United States or, if such federal courts refuse jurisdiction notwithstanding the Parties' agreement, then in the courts of the State of California, in either case sitting in the County of San Francisco, California.

ARTICLE 16
INDEMNIFICATION

16.1 Indemnification.

(a) Each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, representatives and agents (collectively, the “Indemnified Party”) from and against all third-party claims, demands, losses, liabilities, penalties, and expenses and expert witness fees (collectively “Indemnifiable Event”), to the extent such Indemnifiable Event arises out of, results from, or is caused by any of the following: (a) the negligent act or omission, recklessness or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party, its Affiliates, its or their directors, officers, employees, agents, subcontractors, and anyone directly or indirectly employed by the Indemnifying Party or any of its subcontractors or anyone that they control; or (b) any violation of applicable Law by the Indemnifying Party, in each case in connection with this Agreement. Upon the Indemnified Party’s written request, the Indemnifying Party, at its own expense, must defend any suit or action that is subject to the Indemnifying Party’s indemnity obligations.

(b) Nothing in this Section 16.1 shall enlarge or relieve Seller or Buyer of any liability to the other for any breach of this Agreement. Neither Party shall be indemnified for its damages resulting to the extent of its own negligence, intentional acts, or willful misconduct. These indemnity provisions shall not be construed to relieve any insurer of its obligation to pay claims consistent with the provisions of a valid insurance policy.

16.2 Claims. Promptly after receipt by a Party of any claim or Notice of the commencement of any action, administrative, or legal proceeding, or investigation as to which the indemnity provided for in this Article 16 may apply, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such fact. The Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof with counsel designated by such Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to, or inconsistent with, those available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to select and be represented by separate counsel, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, unless a liability insurer is willing to pay such costs. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume

-58-
84ET-387782
<!-- Page 334 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

the defense of a claim meriting indemnification, the Indemnified Party may at the expense of the Indemnifying Party contest, settle, or pay such claim, provided that settlement or full payment of any such claim may be made only following consent of the Indemnifying Party or, absent such consent, written opinion of the Indemnified Party’s counsel that such claim is meritorious or warrants settlement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence if the settlement consists solely of a monetary payment by the Indemnifying Party, such settlement shall not require the consent of the Indemnifying Party. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 16, in the event that a Party is obligated to indemnify and hold the other Party and its successors and assigns harmless under this Article 16, the amount owing to the Indemnified Party will be the amount of the Indemnified Party’s damages net of any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Party following a reasonable effort by the Indemnified Party to obtain such insurance proceeds.

ARTICLE 17  
INSURANCE.

17.1 Insurance.

(a) General Liability. Seller shall maintain, or cause to be maintained at its sole expense, (i) commercial general liability insurance against claims for personal injury (including bodily injury and death) and property damage with a limit of liability of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence, and a general aggregate of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) for combined bodily injury and property damage; and (ii) an umbrella insurance policy in a minimum limit of liability of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). The amounts of liability insurance described in this Article 17 may be satisfied by primary insurance or by any combination of primary and excess/umbrella insurance. Such insurance shall contain standard cross-liability and severability of interest provisions such that each person is protected in the same manner as though a separate policy has been issued to each but nothing therein shall operate to increase the insurance company’s liability beyond the amount the insurance company would have been liable if only one Person or interest had been named as insured. The liability insurance policies referenced in this Article 17 shall (x) provide an endorsement waiving rights of subrogation against Buyer, (y) name Buyer as additional insured on all required liability insurance (except workers compensation), and (z) be primary to any insurance of Buyer that may apply to such occurrence, accident or claim and no “other insurance” provision shall be applicable to Buyer or any additional insureds, by virtue of having been named an additional insured under any policy of insurance.

(b) Workers Compensation and Employer’s Liability Insurance. Employers’ Liability insurance shall not be less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) providing statutory benefits as required by Law (if any exposure exists) for injury, sickness, disability or death of the employees.

(c) Business Auto Liability Insurance. Seller shall maintain at all times during the Contract Term business auto insurance for bodily injury and property damage with limits of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit. Such insurance shall cover liability arising out of Seller’s use of all owned (if any), non-owned and hired motor vehicles in the performance of the Agreement.

-59-  
84ET-387782
<!-- Page 335 -->
(d) Property Insurance. Seller shall maintain or cause to be maintained property insurance covering the Facility against physical loss or damage, including coverage for natural perils including but not limited to flood, earthquake, windstorm, severe convective storm, and wildfire, all with limits in accordance with industry standard recognizing that natural perils may be subject to a lower sublimit. Coverage will be on an "all-risk" basis including mechanical and electrical breakdown.

(e) Documentation. Before commencing work under this Agreement, Seller’s broker or agent shall provide certificates of insurance verifying that at least the minimum insurance coverages required above are in effect with additional insured, waiver of subrogation and any other policy provisions or endorsements included, as applicable. Acceptance of the evidence of coverage by Buyer shall not relieve or decrease the extent to which Seller may be held responsible for payment of damages resulting from Seller’s services or operations pursuant to this Agreement, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of Buyer’s rights to insurance coverage hereunder. Failure to demand evidence of full compliance with the insurance requirements set forth in this Agreement or failure to identify any insurance deficiency shall not relieve Seller from, nor be construed or deemed a waiver of, its obligation to maintain the required insurance at all times during the performance of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 18
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

18.1 Definition of Confidential Information. The following constitutes “Confidential Information,” whether oral or written which is delivered by Seller to Buyer or by Buyer to Seller including: (a) pricing and other commercially-sensitive or proprietary information provided to or from Buyer in connection with the terms and conditions of, proposals and negotiations related to, this Agreement, and (b) information that either Seller or Buyer stamps or otherwise identifies as “confidential” or “proprietary” before disclosing it to the other. Confidential Information does not include (i) information that was publicly available at the time of the disclosure, other than as a result of a disclosure in breach of this Agreement; (ii) information that becomes publicly available through no fault of the recipient after the time of delivery; (iii) information that was rightfully in the possession of the recipient (without confidential or proprietary restriction) at the time of delivery or that becomes available to the recipient from a source not subject to any restriction against disclosing such information to the recipient; and (iv) information that the recipient independently developed without a violation of this Agreement.

18.2 Duty to Maintain Confidentiality. Except as permitted in this Article 18, neither Party shall disclose Confidential Information to a third party, except upon the written consent of the Disclosing Party. Confidential Information will retain its character as Confidential Information but may be disclosed by the recipient (the “Receiving Party”) if and to the extent such disclosure is required (a) to be made by any requirements of Law, (b) pursuant to an order of a court or (c) in order to enforce or implement this Agreement. If the Receiving Party becomes legally compelled (by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoenas, summons, civil investigative demands, or similar processes or otherwise in connection with any litigation or to comply with any applicable Law, order, regulation, ruling, regulatory request, accounting disclosure rule or standard or any exchange, control area or

18.3 Irreparable Injury; Remedies. Receiving Party acknowledges that its obligations hereunder are necessary and reasonable in order to protect Disclosing Party and the business of Disclosing Party, and expressly acknowledges that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate Disclosing Party for any breach or threatened breach by Receiving Party of any covenants and agreements set forth herein. Accordingly, Receiving Party acknowledges that any such breach or threatened breach may cause irreparable injury to Disclosing Party and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, in Law, in equity or otherwise, Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief against the threatened breach of this Agreement or the continuation of any such breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages.

18.4 Permitted Disclosures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 18, Confidential Information may be disclosed by either Party to such Party’s counsel, accountants, auditors, advisors, other professional consultants, credit rating agencies, Affiliates or actual or prospective owners, investors, lenders, directors, underwriters, contractors, suppliers or others involved in the construction, operation and financing transactions and arrangements for a Party or its affiliates, or any of its or their agents, consultants or trustees, so long as the person to whom Confidential Information is disclosed agrees in writing to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this Article 18 to the same extent as if it were a Party, or is bound by substantially similar confidentiality requirements.

18.5 Press Releases. Neither Party shall issue (or cause its Affiliates to issue) a press release regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless both Parties have agreed upon the contents of any such public statement.

ARTICLE 19
MISCELLANEOUS

19.1 Entire Agreement; Integration; Exhibits. This Agreement, together with the Cover Sheet and Exhibits attached hereto, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between Seller and Buyer with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements relating to the subject matter hereof, which are of no further force or effect. The Exhibits attached hereto are integral parts hereof and are made a part of this Agreement by reference. The headings used herein are for convenience and reference purposes only. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of the Cover Sheet or any Exhibit, the provisions of first the Cover Sheet, and then this Agreement shall prevail, and such Exhibit shall be corrected accordingly.

19.3 No Waiver. Waiver by a Party of any default by the other Party shall not be construed as a waiver of any other default.

19.4 No Agency, Partnership, Joint Venture or Lease. Seller and the agents and employees of Seller shall, in the performance of this Agreement, act in an independent capacity and not as officers or employees or agents of Buyer. Under this Agreement, Seller and Buyer intend to act as energy service provider and energy service recipient, respectively, and do not intend to be treated as, and shall not act as, partners in, co-venturers in or lessor/lessee with respect to the Facility or any business related to the Facility. This Agreement shall not impart any rights enforceable by any third party (other than a permitted successor or assignee bound to this Agreement).

19.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable or held to be unenforceable, the Parties agree that all other provisions of this Agreement have force and effect and shall not be affected thereby.

19.6 Mobile-Sierra. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Party shall seek, nor shall they support, any third party seeking to prospectively or retroactively revise the rates, terms or conditions of service of this Agreement through application or complaint to FERC pursuant to the provisions of Section 205, 206 or 306 of the Federal Power Act, or any other provisions of the Federal Power Act, absent prior written agreement of the Parties. Further, absent the prior written agreement in writing by both Parties, the standard of review for changes to the rates, terms or conditions of service of this Agreement proposed by a Party shall be the “public interest” standard of review set forth in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332 (1956) and Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U.S. 348 (1956). Changes proposed by a non-Party to FERC acting sua sponte shall be subject to the most stringent standard permissible under applicable Law.

19.10 Change in Electric Market Design.

(a) If a change in the CAISO Tariff renders this Agreement or any provisions hereof incapable of being performed or administered, then any Party may request that Buyer and Seller enter into negotiations to make the minimum changes to this Agreement necessary to make this Agreement capable of being performed and administered, while attempting to preserve to the maximum extent possible the benefits, burdens, and obligations set forth in this Agreement as of the Effective Date. Upon delivery of such a request, Buyer and Seller shall engage in such negotiations in good faith. If Buyer and Seller are unable, within sixty (60) days after delivery of such request, to agree upon changes to this Agreement or to resolve issues relating to changes to this Agreement, then any Party may submit issues pertaining to changes to this Agreement to the dispute resolution process set forth in Article 15. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a change in cost shall not in and of itself be deemed to render this Agreement or any of the provisions hereof incapable of being performed or administered, or constitute, or form the basis of, a Force Majeure Event, and (ii) all of unaffected provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect during any period of such negotiation or dispute resolution.

(b) If the Point of Interconnection and/or any of the Transmission Systems utilized to deliver Product to the Delivery Point under this Agreement are (i) integrated into a new or existing regional transmission organization or independent system operator (other than the CAISO Balancing Authority), or (ii) leave a regional transmission organization or independent system operator, and such integration has a material and adverse impact on either Party’s performance under this Agreement, including the costs of either Party to perform, then the affected Party may request that Buyer and Seller enter into negotiations to make the minimum changes to this Agreement necessary to restore the balance of benefits, burdens, and obligations set forth in this Agreement as of the Effective Date. Upon delivery of such a request, Buyer and Seller shall engage in such negotiations in good faith; provided, that neither Party shall be obligated to amend this Agreement if such amendment(s) would materially adversely affect, or could reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on, any of such Party’s rights, benefits, risks and/or obligations under this Agreement.

1. Reserved.

2. Commercial Operation of the Facility. “Commercial Operation” means the condition existing when (i) Seller has fulfilled all of the conditions in Section 2.3 of the Agreement and (ii) Seller has confirmed to Buyer in writing that Commercial Operation has been achieved.

The “Commercial Operation Date” shall be the date on which Commercial Operation is achieved.

a. Seller shall use good faith efforts to cause Commercial Operation for the Facility to occur by the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date. Seller shall notify Buyer at least thirty (30) days before the anticipated Commercial Operation Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller may continue to increase the Installed Capacity of the Facility after the Commercial Operation Date and will notify Buyer from time to time of such increases by delivering a certificate from a Licensed Professional Engineer substantially in the form attached as Exhibit G hereto; when the Installed Capacity is complete, Seller shall include a statement to that effect in a Notice accompanying the final such certificate.

b. If Seller does not anticipate achieving Commercial Operation by the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date, Seller may elect to extend the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date by paying Delay Damages to Buyer for each day Seller desires to extend the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date. If Seller elects to extend the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date, on or before the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the then-current Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date, Seller shall provide Notice and payment to Buyer of the Delay Damages for the number of days of extension to the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date (“Delay Damages Payment”); provided such Delay Damages Payment may, at Seller’s option, be in the form of cash or an irrevocable, standby letter of credit issued by a U.S. commercial bank, or a foreign bank with a U.S. branch, with such bank having a Credit Rating of at least A- with an outlook designation of “stable” from S&P or A3 with an outlook designation of “stable” from Moody’s, which letter of credit Buyer may draw on to receive such Delay Damages Payment. If Seller achieves Commercial Operation prior to the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date as extended by the payment of the Delay Damages Payment, Buyer shall refund to Seller in cash the Delay Damages for each day Seller achieves Commercial Operation prior to the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date, as extended, times the Delay Damages, not to exceed the total amount of the Delay Damages Payment paid by Seller pursuant to this Section 2(b). The Parties agree that Buyer’s receipt of Delay Damages shall not be construed as Buyer’s declaration that an Event of Default has occurred under any provision of Section 11.1.

3. **Termination for Failure to Achieve Commercial Operation.** If the Facility has not achieved Commercial Operation by the Outside Commercial Operation Date, either Party may elect to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 2.6.

4. **Extension of the Guaranteed Dates.** The Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date shall, subject to notice and documentation requirements set forth below, be automatically extended on a day-for-day basis (the “Development Cure Period”) for the following delays:

   a. delays due to a Force Majeure Event;

   b. delays caused by a Transmission Provider not caused by the Seller’s action or inaction;

   c. delays in the completion of the Interconnection Facilities or the commercial operation date of the SunZia Transmission Line, in each case not caused by Seller’s action or inaction; or

   d. delay due to a Buyer breach or default under this Agreement.

   The cumulative extensions granted under clauses 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c) of the Development Cure Period shall not exceed __________ for any reason, including a Force Majeure Event. The extension granted under clause 4(d) of the Development Cure Period shall have no termination. Except to the extent Seller has paid Delay Damages, or due to a delay clause 4(d) of the Development Cure Period, no extension under the Development Cure Period, no extension shall be given if (i) the delay was the result of Seller’s failure to take all commercially reasonable actions to meet its specified deadlines, (ii) Seller failed to provide requested documentation as provided below, or (iii) Seller failed to provide Notice to Buyer as required in the next sentence. Seller shall provide prompt Notice to Buyer of a delay, but in no case more than thirty (30) days after Seller becomes aware of such delay, except that in the case of a delay occurring within sixty (60) days of the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date, or after such date, Seller must provide Notice within five (5) Business Days of Seller becoming aware of such delay. Upon request from Buyer, Seller shall provide documentation demonstrating to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction that the delays described above did not result from Seller’s actions or failure to take commercially reasonable actions.

5. **Failure to Reach Guaranteed Capacity.** If, at Commercial Operation, one hundred percent (100%) of the Guaranteed Capacity has not been completed and is not ready to produce and deliver Product to Buyer, Seller shall have one hundred eighty (180) days after the Commercial Operation Date to install additional capacity and/or network upgrades such that the Installed Capacity is equal to at least the Guaranteed Capacity. In the event that Seller fails to construct the Guaranteed Capacity by such date, Seller shall pay “Capacity Damages” to Buyer, in an amount equal to __________ for each MW that the Guaranteed Capacity exceeds the Installed Capacity and the Guaranteed Capacity and other applicable portions of the Agreement shall be adjusted accordingly.

![EXHIBIT E ENERGY REPLACEMENT DAMAGES CALCULATION](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=EXHIBIT+E+ENERGY+REPLACEMENT+DAMAGES+CALCULATION)

In accordance with Section 4.7, if Seller fails to achieve the Guaranteed Energy Production during any Performance Measurement Period, and Seller elects to not provide Replacement Product, a liquidated damages (“Energy Replacement Damages”) payment shall be due from Seller to Buyer, calculated as follows:

\[
[(A - B) * (C - D)] - E
\]

where:

- **A** = the Guaranteed Energy Production amount for the Performance Measurement Period, in MWh
- **B** = the Adjusted Energy Production amount for the Performance Measurement Period, in MWh
- **C** = Replacement price for the Performance Measurement Period, in $/MWh, which is the sum of (a) the simple average of the LMP in the Day-Ahead Market at the Delivery Point for all of the hours in the Performance Measurement Period, plus (b) the simple average REC Price for the applicable Performance Measurement Period.
- **D** = the Contract Price, in $/MWh
- **E** = the value of any Replacement Product provided retrospectively by Seller with respect to such Performance Measurement Period

“Adjusted Energy Production” shall mean the sum of the following: (i) the greater of (a) if Seller provided Replacement Product or paid Energy Replacement Damages during the prior Performance Measurement Period, seventy five percent (75%) of the Expected Energy for the Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period or (b) the Delivered Energy plus Lost Output plus Deemed Delivered Energy in the first Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period, plus (ii) Delivered Energy plus Lost Output plus Deemed Delivered Energy in the second Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period.

“Lost Output” means the sum of electric energy in MWh that would have been generated and delivered, but was not, on account of Forced Facility Outage (not caused by Seller’s fault or negligence), Force Majeure Events, System Emergencies, Buyer’s failure to perform, and Curtailment Order. The additional MWh comprising Lost Output shall be calculated in the same manner as Deemed Delivered Energy.

No payment shall be due if the calculation of (A - B) or (C - D) yields a negative number.

<!-- Page 377 -->
![EXHIBIT J FORM OF LIMITED ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1085.png?text=EXHIBIT+J+FORM+OF+LIMITED+ASSIGNMENT+AGREEMENT)

This Limited Assignment Agreement (this “Assignment Agreement” or “Agreement”) is entered into as of [____], by and among [____], a [____] (“PPA Seller”), Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a municipal utility district organized under the provisions of the Municipal Utility District Act (Division 6, Chapter 2, Articles 2 and 3, Sections 11581 through 11614 of the California Public Utilities Code, as amended) (“PPA Buyer”), and J. Aron & Company LLC, a New York limited liability company (“J. Aron”), and relates to that certain power purchase agreement between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller as further described in Appendix 1 (the “PPA”). Unless the context otherwise specifies or requires, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth in the PPA.

In consideration of the premises above and the mutual covenants and agreements herein set forth, PPA Seller, PPA Buyer and J. Aron (the “Parties” hereto; each is a “Party”) agree as follows:

1. Limited Assignment and Delegation.

   (a) PPA Buyer hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to J. Aron all right, title and interest in and to the rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA to receive delivery of the products described on Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Products”) during the Assignment Period (as defined in Appendix 1), as such rights may be limited or further described in the “Further Information” section on Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Product Rights”). All Assigned Products shall be delivered pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the Assignment Period as provided in Appendix 1. All other rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly reserved for PPA Buyer. The Parties agree that the assignment, transfer and/or conveyance of all or any portion of the Assigned Products in accordance with this Agreement and the Parties’ performance of any obligation in accordance with this Agreement shall not constitute a failure to meet the requirements of the PPA, or a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty under the PPA (and in no event shall PPA Seller be responsible for any failure of any portion of the Assigned Products to satisfy the requirements of the PPA, to the extent such failure results from the assignment, transfer and/or conveyance of such Assigned Products in accordance with this Agreement).

   (b) PPA Buyer hereby delegates to J. Aron the obligation to pay the APC Contract Price set forth in Appendix 1 for all Assigned Products that are actually delivered to J. Aron pursuant to the Assigned Product Rights during the Assignment Period (the “Delivered Product Payment Obligation” and together with the Assigned Product Rights, collectively the “Assigned Rights and Obligations”); provided that (i) all other obligations of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly retained by PPA Buyer and PPA Buyer shall be solely responsible for any amounts due to PPA Seller that are not directly related to Assigned Products; and (ii) the Parties acknowledge and agree that PPA Seller will only be obligated to deliver a single consolidated invoice during the Assignment Period (with a copy to J. Aron consistent with Section 1(d) hereof). To the extent J. Aron fails to pay for any Assigned Products by the due date for payment set forth in the PPA, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, PPA Buyer agrees that it will remain jointly and severally responsible as a primary obligor (and not as a surety) for such payment and that it will be an Event of Default pursuant to Section 11.1(a) if PPA Buyer does not make such payment within -1- 84ET-387872
<!-- Page 378 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1085.png?text=Document+Image) 

five (5) Business Days (as defined in the PPA) of receiving notice of such non-payment from PPA Seller, and that PPA Buyer shall remain liable for, and indemnify and hold PPA Seller harmless from, any and all losses, damages, costs and expenses of PPA Seller of any kind as a result of or arising from (x) the assignment, transfer, conveyance, and delegation described in Section 1(a) and this Section 1(b), or (y) J. Aron’s failure to take or pay for any such Assigned Product or make any payment in respect of the Delivered Product Payment Obligation as and when due under the PPA and disregarding the effects of any stay or other suspension rights, including without limitation under sections 362 or 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or similar laws, whether due to bankruptcy, insolvency or any other cause.

(c) J. Aron hereby accepts and PPA Seller hereby consents and agrees to the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delegation described in clauses (a) and (b) above.

(d) All scheduling of Assigned Products and other communications related to the PPA shall take place between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller pursuant to the terms of the PPA; provided that (i) title to Assigned Product will pass from PPA Seller to J. Aron upon delivery by PPA Seller of Assigned Product in accordance with the PPA; (ii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to J. Aron of any Notice of a Force Majeure Event or Event of Default or default, breach or other occurrence that, if not cured within the applicable grace period, could result in an Event of Default contemporaneously upon delivery thereof to PPA Seller and promptly after receipt thereof from PPA Seller; (iii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to J. Aron of any forecasts of Energy generation provided by PPA Seller under the PPA; (iv) PPA Seller will provide copies to J. Aron of all invoices and supporting data provided to PPA Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1 of the PPA, provided that any payment adjustments or subsequent reconciliations occurring after the date that is 10 days prior to the payment due date for a monthly invoice, including pursuant to Section 8.4 of the PPA, will be resolved solely between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller and therefore PPA Seller will not be obligated to deliver copies of any communications relating thereto to J. Aron; and (v) PPA Buyer and PPA Seller, as applicable, will provide copies to J. Aron of any other information reasonably requested by J. Aron relating to Assigned Products.

(e) PPA Seller acknowledges that (i) J. Aron intends to immediately transfer title to any Assigned Products received from PPA Seller through one or more intermediaries such that all Assigned Products will be re-delivered to PPA Buyer; and (ii) in the event that PPA Buyer fails to pay the relevant intermediary entity for any such Assigned Products, the receivables owed by PPA Buyer for such Assigned Products (“PPA Buyer Receivables”) may be transferred to J. Aron. To the extent any such PPA Buyer Receivables are transferred to J. Aron, J. Aron may transfer such PPA Buyer Receivables to PPA Seller and apply the face amount thereof as a reduction to any Delivered Product Payment Obligation, and PPA Buyer waives all rights to dispute or claim any defence in respect of such PPA Buyer Receivables other than a defence that would have arisen under the PPA if this Agreement were not in effect. To effect such transfer, J. Aron shall deliver to PPA Seller a notice of intent to transfer PPA Buyer Receivables not later than the payment due date for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation and shall deliver to PPA Seller a bill of sale signed by J. Aron not later than five Business Days thereafter, provided that no such transfer or application shall reduce or limit PPA Buyer’s obligations under Section1(b) above. Such transfer of PPA Buyer Receivables shall immediately be deemed an Event of Default under Section 11.1(a) of the PPA, without regard to any cure periods set forth therein, and PPA Seller shall be entitled to pursue collection on such PPA Buyer Receivables.

directly against PPA Buyer pursuant to the remedies set forth in the PPA for such Event of Default.

(f) On or before the commencement of the Assignment Period, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Guarantor”) will issue, in favor of PPA Seller, a guaranty of J. Aron’s payment obligations under this Assignment Agreement substantially in the form of Appendix 3 attached hereto (“Guaranty”).

(g) The Assigned Prepay Quantity set forth in Appendix 2 relates to obligations by and between J. Aron and PPA Buyer and has no impact on PPA Seller’s rights and obligations under the PPA.

(h) In the event that the PPA or the Assigned Rights and obligations are either or both rejected or terminated in or as a result of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding affecting J. Aron, PPA Buyer shall, at the option of PPA Seller exercised within thirty (30) days after such rejection or termination, enter into a new agreement with PPA Seller having identical terms as the PPA (subject to any conforming changes necessitated by the substitution of parties and other changes as the parties may mutually agree), provided, that the term under such new agreement shall be no longer than the remaining balance of the term specified in the PPA.

2. Assignment Early Termination.

(a) The Assignment Period may be terminated early upon the occurrence of any of the following:

(1) delivery of a written notice of termination specifying a termination date by either J. Aron or PPA Buyer to each of the other Parties;

(2) delivery of a written notice of termination specifying a termination date by PPA Seller to each of J. Aron and PPA Buyer following J. Aron’s failure to pay when due any amounts owed to PPA Seller in respect of any Delivered Product Payment Obligation and such payment is not made by J. Aron within one (1) business day following receipt by J. Aron and PPA Buyer of written notice;

(3) delivery of a written notice by PPA Seller if any of the events described in the definition of “Bankrupt” in the PPA occurs with respect to J. Aron; or

(4) delivery of a written notice by J. Aron if any of the events described in the definition of “Bankrupt” in the PPA occurs with respect to PPA Seller.

(b) The Assignment Period will end at the end of last delivery hour on the date specified in the termination notice provided pursuant to Section 2(a), which date shall not be earlier than the end of the last day of the calendar month in which such notice is delivered if termination is pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) or 2(a)(2) above. All Assigned Rights and Obligations shall revert from J. Aron to PPA Buyer upon the early termination of the Assignment Period, provided that (i) J. Aron shall remain responsible for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation with respect to any Assigned Product delivered to J. Aron prior to the end of the Assignment Period, and (ii) any legal restrictions on the effectiveness of such reversion (whether arising under bankruptcy law or otherwise) shall not affect the expiration or early termination of the Assignment Period.

**NAME**  
**ADDRESS**  

Attention:

Ladies and Gentlemen:

For value received, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the “Guarantor”), a corporation duly organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, hereby unconditionally guarantees the prompt and complete payment when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations and liabilities, whether now in existence or hereafter arising, of J. Aron & Company LLC, a subsidiary of the Guarantor and a limited liability company duly organized under the laws of the State of New York (the “Company”), to **COUNTERPARTY NAME** (the “Counterparty”) arising out of or under the Limited Assignment Agreement among the Company, the Counterparty and [PPA Seller] dated as of [ | , 202_]. This Guaranty is one of payment and not of collection.

The Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and notice of any obligation or liability to which it may apply, and waives presentment, demand for payment, protest, notice of dishonor or non-payment of any such obligation or liability, suit or the taking of other action by Counterparty against, and any other notice to, the Company, the Guarantor or others.

Counterparty may at any time and from time to time without notice to or consent of the Guarantor and without impairing or releasing the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder: (1) agree with the Company to make any change in the terms of any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (2) take or fail to take any action of any kind in respect of any security for any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (3) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company or others, or (4) compromise or subordinate any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty including any security therefor. Any other surety defenses are hereby waived by the Guarantor.

This Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect until the opening of business on the fifth business day after Counterparty receives written notice of termination from the Guarantor. It is understood and agreed, however, that notwithstanding any such termination this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the obligations and liabilities set forth above which shall have been incurred prior to such termination.

![Guaranty Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Guaranty+Document)

The Guarantor further agrees that this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the guaranteed obligations, or interest thereon is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Counterparty upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or reorganization of the Company. No failure on the part of the Counterparty to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Counterparty of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power. Notwithstanding anything in this Guaranty to the contrary, this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time, either before or after the termination hereof, payment of the obligations or liabilities guaranteed pursuant to this Guaranty, or any part thereof, is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by Counterparty for any reason, including without limitation upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or the Guarantor, all as though such payment had not been made.

Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, Guarantor hereby agrees that no delay of Counterparty in the exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights or a release of Guarantor from any obligations hereunder.

No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended, modified, altered, waived or supplemented except in a writing signed by Guarantor and Counterparty.

The Guarantor hereby represents as follows:

(a) The Guarantor is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Guaranty.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Guaranty have been and remain duly authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of the Guarantor's certificate of incorporation or by-laws, as amended to date, or any law, regulation, decree, order, judgment, resolution or any contractual restriction binding on the Guarantor or its assets that could affect, in a materially adverse manner, the ability of the Guarantor to perform any of its obligations hereunder.

(c) All consents, licenses, clearances, authorizations, and approvals of, and registration and declarations with, any governmental or regulatory authority necessary for the due execution and delivery of this Guaranty have been obtained and remain in full force and effect and all conditions thereof have been duly complied with, and no other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental or regulatory authority is required in connection with the execution or delivery of this Guaranty.

(d) This Guaranty constitutes the legal, valid, and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with all of its terms and conditions (subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar law).

**THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.**  

The Guarantor may not assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this Guaranty, in whole or in part, without prior written consent of the Counterparty, and any purported assignment or delegation absent such consent is void, except for (i) an assignment and delegation of all of the Guarantor’s rights and obligations hereunder in whatever form the Guarantor determines may be appropriate to a partnership, corporation, trust or other organization in whatever form that succeeds to all or substantially all of the Guarantor’s assets and business and that assumes such obligations by contract, operation of law or otherwise, and (ii) the Guarantor may transfer this Guaranty or any interest or obligation of the Guarantor in or under this Guaranty, or any property securing this Guaranty, to another entity as transferee as part of the resolution, restructuring or reorganization of the Guarantor upon or following the Guarantor becoming subject to a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution or similar proceeding. Upon any such delegation and assumption or transfer of obligations, the Guarantor shall be relieved of and fully discharged from all obligations hereunder, whether such obligations arose before or after such delegation and assumption or transfer.

# EXHIBIT M
## PRINCIPLES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT

SMUD is committed to developing carbon free renewable energy in a manner that supports the community, protects the environment, and respects human rights. This document provides guidance on the key objectives that SMUD expects to achieve associated with this commitment. Renewable energy projects engaged in a commercial relationship with SMUD such as a power purchase agreement will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, implement, and maintain throughout the associated term, a “Community Benefits Plan” that addresses how the project will achieve the key objectives identified herein.

### Key objectives:

1. **Land Use:** Prioritize previously developed lands. Avoid or minimize impacts on sensitive environmental resources, including but not limited to cultural resources, tribal cultural resources, and biological resources such as endangered species habitat, vernal pools and other sensitive habitats, “Waters of the US”, “Waters of the State” and waters identified by California Department of Fish and Wildlife as “Streambed”. Provide additional mitigation measures if avoidance and minimization measures cannot fully eliminate impacts. Applicants are expected to discuss these topics with both SMUD and the lead agency as early as possible to identify potential associated issues in advance of the purchase power agreement being finalized.

2. **Land Use:** All projects should employ techniques for maintaining and/or restoring ecosystem function to the site in conjunction with renewable energy outcomes, including establishment of native vegetation, restricting use of herbicides and pesticides, use of grazing for vegetation management and seasonally appropriate maintenance practices. Where development is on or surrounded by agricultural lands the project should also employ agricultural practices on the property during operations including sheep grazing, dry crop farming and irrigated food production where feasible.

3. **Land Use:** Employ design and construction practices that minimize ground disturbance to the maximum extent possible. This is especially critical in areas where cultural, tribal and biological resources are of significant concern.

4. **Sustainable Life Cycle Management:** Include plans for sustainable life cycle management of construction materials and project components during construction and operation that provides for recycling and reuse of construction waste and waste during operation including but not limited to the solar panels.

5. **Community Benefits:**
   - (a) **Inclusive Economic Development:** Leverage SMUD’s Supplier Education & Economic Development (SEED) team to connect with certified small business vendors/contractors in SMUD’s service territory to support the project. Submit requests to seed.mgr@smud.org.

# RESOLUTION NO. ________________

DRAFT

WHEREAS, the California Energy Commission (CEC) mandates continuously escalating procurement of renewable energy by load-serving entities in California under the Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS); and

WHEREAS, by Resolution No. 21-04-04, adopted on April 15, 2021, this Board revised Strategic Direction SD-9, Resource Planning, to align with SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan goal of zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in SMUD’s energy supply by 2030, reflecting a more aggressive target than the state’s RPS requirements; and

WHEREAS, in 2023, SMUD received non-binding indicative offers from Pattern Energy, LLC (Pattern), for the Hatchet Ridge Wind Project and SunZia Wind Project (collectively, Projects) for renewable wind power; and

WHEREAS, SMUD performed an evaluation of the market and determined that the Projects provided superior value and key solutions compared to available alternatives; and

WHEREAS, the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for the Projects were offered by Pattern as a package deal and are therefore contingent upon one another; and

WHEREAS, the SunZia Wind Project, and the associated Sunzia Transmission Project, are located in New Mexico and Arizona, and will combine to create the largest clean energy infrastructure project in United States history at more than 3,500 MW split between a northern portion (SunZia North) and southern portion (SunZia South); and
<!-- Page 400 -->
![DRAFT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=DRAFT)

WHEREAS, SMUD and SunZia Wind PowerCo, LLC (parent company is Pattern), negotiated a mutually beneficial PPA for the SunZia Wind Project under which SMUD will purchase 150 MW of energy, capacity attributes, and Portfolio Content Category 1 Renewable Energy Credits (PCC1 RECs), for a term of fifteen (15) years, at an annual approximate cost of $41 million; and

WHEREAS, SMUD’s share of the SunZia Wind Project covered in the PPA will be part of the California Independent System Operator Corporation (CAISO) Balancing Authority Area and provide approximately 490,000 MWh annually; and

WHEREAS, the PPA commercial operation date is April 30, 2026, and will support SMUD’s compliance requirements for RPS; and

WHEREAS, due to the unique size of SunZia Wind Project, Pattern intends to separate the project into different portions and sell all or a part of ownership interest to an outside investor to facilitate capital needs; and

WHEREAS, to support the sale, the PPA provides for SunZia Wind PowerCo, LLC, the right to either (i) split the PPA into two new power purchase agreements, one with SunZia North and one with SunZia South (a Bifurcation) or (ii) replace the PPA with one new power purchase agreement with either SunZia North or SunZia South (a Transition); and

WHEREAS, new power purchase agreement(s) under a Bifurcation or Transition would be with a separate subsidiary of Pattern and under substantially the same terms and conditions as the PPA and would result in the termination of the PPA upon the effective date of any new power purchase agreement(s); and
<!-- Page 401 -->
![DRAFT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=DRAFT)

WHEREAS, the price and other terms proposed in the PPA are commercially reasonable and benefit SMUD’s ratepayers; NOW, THEREFORE,

BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT:

**Section 1.** The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his delegate, is authorized to negotiate and execute the SunZia Wind Project Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for a 15-year term for 150 MW of renewable wind power at an annual approximate cost of $41 million, substantially in the form of Attachment ___, and subsequent replacement power purchase agreement(s) with a Pattern Energy, LLC, subsidiary to address project investment capital needs, under substantially the same terms and conditions as the PPA.

**Section 2.** The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his delegate, is authorized to make future changes to the terms and conditions of the contract that, in his prudent judgment: (a) further the primary purpose of the contract; (b) are intended to provide a net benefit to SMUD; and (c) do not exceed the authorized contract amounts and applicable contingencies.

## SD-16 Information Management and Security  

1) **Background**  

Strategic Direction Information Management and Security policy states that:  

Proper management of cyber and physical information, as well as physical security, is a core value. Robust information management and physical security practices are critical to effective risk management and to ensure regulatory compliance, business resiliency and customer satisfaction. SMUD shall take prudent and reasonable measures to accomplish the following:  

a) **Information Security:** SMUD will protect customer, employee and third-party information, and SMUD information systems are protected from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.  

b) **Physical Security:** SMUD will safeguard its employees while at work as well as customers and visitors at SMUD facilities. SMUD will also protect its facilities and functions that support the reliability of the electric system and overall operation of the organization from unauthorized access or disruption of business operations.

### 3) Additional supporting information

**Information Security**

SMUD, customer, employee and third-party information and SMUD information systems are protected from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

SMUD’s Cybersecurity program, under the direction of the Chief Information Security Officer, continues to evolve and mature to keep pace with the evolving cyber threats we face and to manage our cyber, privacy, legal, regulatory and compliance risk. This includes the adoption of a Zero Trust Architecture strategy, aligned to the CIOs larger IT Strategic Plan. We align to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to establish prudent and reasonable measures intended to protect SMUD’s operations from a cyber-attack, disruption and other threats to enterprise technologies, processes, and information. The CSF has been updated to now have six core functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover, and Govern) which comprise both administrative and technical controls to effectively manage information and cybersecurity risk. Cybersecurity is actively working to implement the CSF controls through SMUD policies to enhance and govern information management and security risk management practices and processes in support of SD-16. Cybersecurity will highlight the cybersecurity capabilities provided in an update to the board for SD-16 during an upcoming closed session.

**Physical Security**

SMUD will safeguard its employees while at work as well as customers and visitors at SMUD facilities.

SMUD facilities welcome thousands of community members through community events, meetings, and face-to-face interactions in addition to being the home of nearly 2300 employees.

![SMUD's Security Operations Report](https://example.com/image.png)

SMUD’s Security Operations continues to meet its goal of maintaining customer and employee safety by leveraging physical security staff, video surveillance technology, lighting and signage, passive and active physical security barriers, education and partnerships with law enforcement and community stakeholders.

This year, SMUD authored and implemented a comprehensive new Visitor Control and Management policy. This policy outlines the requirements for planning, coordinating, escorting and approving visits throughout SMUD. The new policy ensures uniform, consistent, safe and efficient processes for visitors and SMUD employees. SMUD additionally added an enhanced Workplace Violence Prevention policy and training for all employees. These safeguards and policies ensure that safety remains priority one at SMUD. As with most new policies and procedures, these will be updated appropriately when needed to reflect the ever-changing threat landscape.

SMUD will also protect its facilities and functions that support the reliability of the electric system and overall operation of the organization from unauthorized access or disruption of business operations.

Security Operations has identified a new thermal imaging technology that will be used to supplement existing intrusion detection methods at substations and other sites where false alarms have been rampant. This system “sees” things thermally and then directs a camera to the detected object for the Security Dispatcher to assess. This will help with an aging fiber optic sensor system that has been giving widespread false alarms for years. The resulting drain on resources and unnecessary patrol response has been a costly issue, and introducing this new system should reduce those problems significantly. This is part of a larger effort to use metrics-gathering tools to increase operational efficiency, identify trends and hotspots, and increase visibility of emergent issues, particularly at our Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) sites.

**Customer Privacy**

SMUD will annually notify customers about the collection, use and dissemination of sensitive and confidential customer information.

SMUD sent out our annual privacy notice via email and as a bill insert to customers during the May bill cycle. The language in the notice was updated this year to emphasize that any non-SMUD business uses of personal information require individual consent. The notice is otherwise very similar to previous years and continues to include plain language regarding SMUD’s collection, use, and release of customer sensitive and confidential information, the business purposes for which customer information is used, as well as a reaffirmation of SMUD’s commitment to customer privacy.

Except as provided by law or for a business purpose, SMUD will not disseminate sensitive and confidential customer information to a third party for non-SMUD business purposes unless the customer first consents to the release of the.

![GM 24-163 Board Monitoring Report – SD-16, Information Management and Security Page 5 of 8](attachment://image.png)

No sensitive and confidential customer information has been sent to a third party for non-SMUD business purposes this year.

Where sensitive and confidential information is disseminated for a business purpose, SMUD will ensure: (i) the third party has robust information practices to protect the sensitive and confidential customer information, and (ii) use of the information by the third party is limited to SMUD’s business purpose.

Cybersecurity and Procurement continue to follow a formalized supply chain risk management process, in compliance with NERC CIP requirements. The process is aligned to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and is reviewed on at least an annual basis to ensure it is functioning as designed and incorporates lessons learned as new procurements follow the process. The process includes a mandatory procurement requirement for vendors to allow the Cybersecurity team to evaluate the security posture of a proposed vendor solution. The American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) Service Organization Control 2 (SOC 2) Type 2 continues to be our procurement standard as it is an independent assessment focused on a solution’s security controls which includes tests of the security controls’ efficacy. SOC 2 Type 2 reports provide staff confidence that vendor security controls are robust and sufficient to protect SMUD information. Contract and non-disclosure agreement language is used to provide assurance that SMUD provided sensitive and confidential information will not be used for any unapproved purposes. Additionally, our data sharing policy and process also align to this requirement.

SMUD will maintain a process that identifies the business purposes for which SMUD will collect, use and disseminate sensitive and confidential customer information.

MP 07.03.01.122 - Data Sharing requires an approved data sharing request prior to sharing information with a third party for SMUD business purposes. No significant policy or process changes related to data sharing occurred this year.

Records Management

The efficient and systematic control of the creation, capture, identification, receipt, maintenance, use, disposition, and destruction of SMUD records, in accordance with legal requirements and Board policies.

The IMC Program in collaboration with the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) team launched a mass content migration (Enterprise Shared Drive Migration) project at the beginning of 2023. Using completed IMC records evaluations, this effort has migrated or is in the process of migrating content from 29 business areas out of the 41 business areas in scope, for an estimated total of 4.5 million documents classified and migrated. The project identifies, organizes, and migrates content for each business area from non-approved records repositories.

![Physical Security](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Physical+Security)

**Physical Security**  
Physical Security is a first line of defense against any unauthorized intrusions at our facilities. With the ever-changing international and domestic threat landscape, as well as the significant increase in unsafe activity located near SMUD campuses, sub-stations and other assets, the risk of outside impacts to SMUD assets and field staff continues to increase. SMUD Security Operations continues to invest in technology, increased training and adoption of best practices as well as partnerships with local and federal law enforcement and local community and government agencies to ensure we are prepared to meet and withstand current threat conditions in support of our employees, physical assets and the community we serve.

SMUD continues to grow as an organization in size and reputation, gaining national and international attention as one of the best public utilities in the world and as an economic development driver in the Sacramento region. As such, our infrastructure and facilities footprint continue to grow as we move toward our 2030 Zero Carbon Plan. As SMUD continues to grow our influence, impact and footprint, our threat exposure grows as well.

SMUD Security Operations continues to work to ensure compliance with the NERC CIP standards while meeting the SMUD Strategic Directives. Balancing SMUD’s management of critical CIP areas while maintaining our role as a community convener and customer facing campus will continue to offer challenges. As CIP standards are adopted in 2025 and into the future, SMUD Security Operations will continue to evaluate our program to ensure that SMUD continues to have sufficient resources from a personnel, technology and security infrastructure standpoint to meet future needs, responsibilities and conditions.

**Customer Privacy**  
SMUD continues to see requests for SMUD customer data to be used and shared for additional purposes and programs, including customer personally identifiable information (PII). SMUD’s Data Sharing Policy and process are in place to provide request tracking and approval to ensure that all sharing of PII is authorized and that transmission is performed using an approved and secure transfer mechanism.

**Records Management**  
The IMC program continues to integrate information management best practices into SMUD’s daily operations. Business areas are actively collaborating with IMC in the creation of information management and recordkeeping polices/procedures specific to their day-to-day operational needs. SMUD’s continued development of the IMC program further reduces the risk of potential multi-million-dollar fines and reputational damage associated with lack of records management controls.

The Enterprise Shared Drive Migration project which launched at the beginning of 2023 (expected to end in 2025) is a large undertaking that involves the mass organization and migration of content from Enterprise shared drives to approved SMUD information repositories. IMC in collaboration with the ECM team is working diligently to ensure completion of the project tasks by business areas and ease the learning curve that comes with these implemented changes.

changes. We have created documentation that helps with the classification of the records as well as training to ease the transition into using a new repository. This project will ensure SMUD stays in line with information management industry best practices, create an environment of purposeful organization and generate information management symmetry across SMUD.
