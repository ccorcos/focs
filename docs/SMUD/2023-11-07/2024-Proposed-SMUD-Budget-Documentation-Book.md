Board of Directors  

Re: 2024 SMUD Budget  

Dear Board Members:

I’m pleased to present SMUD’s proposed 2024 Budget. The proposed 2024 Budget Authorization request is $2.1 billion. It provides funding for Operations and Maintenance (O&M), Public Good and Capital Programs needed to successfully meet the Board’s Strategic Directions, meet legislative and regulatory requirements, and continue the progress on our 2030 Clean Energy Vision. Staff will present detailed information at the Finance & Audit Committee meetings on Nov. 7 and 8. The proposed 2024 Budget supports 3 priorities: infrastructure investment, 2030 Zero Carbon Plan, and community impact.

**Executive Summary**  
Each year, we look holistically at our budget, programs, projects and initiatives to ensure SMUD continues to deliver value to our customers and community. The proposed 2024 Budget reflects staff’s focus on ensuring SMUD’s responsible and sustainable financial stewardship, our commitment to keeping rates as low as possible, and consistently among the lowest in California.

Upholding our foundational commitment to provide safe, reliable electric service, the proposed Budget funds necessary infrastructure investments, ensures compliance with mandates and supports our customers and community through investments that serve our purpose to improve their quality of life. Wherever possible, staff identified cost savings and sought external grant funding to offset the inflationary cost pressures that impact every component of providing electric power and help fund planned initiatives to reduce the impacts to the requested Budget for 2024.

SMUD was recently awarded a $50 million grant from the Department of Energy (DOE) for the Grid Resilience & Innovative Partnerships (GRIP) Program. Starting in 2024, this funding offsets costs for planned projects in five elements: next generation metering technology, Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) enhancements, Outage Management System (OMS) modernization, enabling technologies and Wilton Rancheria job training for grid technologies. Importantly, this funding brings forward the timeline on planned work that supports our transition to a clean energy future.

The proposed 2024 Budget funds activities that are critically important to support our customers and community today, while also funding activities that support SMUD’s

long-term success and leadership position, including investments to meet carbon reduction mandates, maintaining and improving our infrastructure, and delivering positive community impact through our many community programs and outreach. By partnering with key community and customer stakeholders, we’ll continue to deliver maximum community impact by ensuring every dollar we spend delivers the most value possible.

Our O&M and Public Good budgets (lines b and c in the following table) are increasing by $45.8 million. Key initiatives in our 2024 O&M and Public Good budgets include our Community Impact Plan, electric transportation and building electrification incentives and implementation of other carbon reduction efforts. The O&M budget also includes funding for equipment maintenance, vegetation management, wildfire mitigation, cybersecurity, and property and casualty insurance, which have all seen significant inflationary increases. Staff works day-in and day-out to minimize budget impacts from these items through ongoing Operational Excellence initiatives, which help minimize the impact of many increases outside of our control. Over the past year, we captured $60 million in cost savings, some of which have reduced the proposed 2024 Budget, and others that will result in future savings. We’ll continue our Operational Excellence work across the organization throughout 2024 and beyond, to aggressively capture additional and sustainable savings.

Our Capital budget (line e) is decreasing by $70 million as prior-year renewable and clean energy investment projects are nearing completion. Major capital projects for 2024 include:
- Completing the Solano 4 Wind Project
- Ongoing construction for the Country Acres and Coyote Creek solar and storage projects
- Continuing work on our ESS iron-flow battery partnership projects
- Beginning work on Station H Substation
- Designing and planning for our new Power Control Center.

The proposed 2024 Budget also includes funding for new and continuing technology projects reflecting the growing and critical role technology has in our operations and enterprise support.

The proposed Budget authorizes 2,250 full-time positions, an increase of 8 positions, primarily for our operations staff. Also included is funding for our future workforce pipeline needs and flexibility for shorter-term needs, with limited-term, student, and part-time positions.

In 2024, we expect an increase in our customer count and system peak load, which will drive up the Commodity budget (line a). However, total system kWh energy sales are expected to be lower due to a reduction in total energy sales to a large commercial customer. Our Commodity budget is increasing by $87 million; much of that increase is driven by the increased need for Resource Adequacy (RA) required to serve the higher peak. The cost to purchase RA has also significantly increased. Other market conditions impacting the Commodity budget are continued extreme price volatility for power and

gas. The proposed 2024 Budget includes assumptions for a normal water year. The Commodity budget also assumes the Solano 4 wind project is online June 1, 2024.

We recognize the potential for new growth related to building electrification, electric vehicle adoption and mixed-use commercial/residential sales growth, and have maintained conservative planning assumptions so we can act nimbly as business conditions change. To manage potential impacts to our budget and operations, we’ll monitor these and other factors throughout the year, including the local economy, construction costs, and any supply chain and labor shortages.

The proposed 2024 Budget will allow SMUD to:
- Maintain reliable service through a reliable grid — today and in the future — through strong investments in our infrastructure.
- Execute on SMUD’s vision to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy in a way that is equitable for all.
- Invest in a clean energy future for the Sacramento region.
- Deliver on key priorities while meeting key financial metrics.

### Budget breakdown
The table below provides a brief overview of the proposed 2024 Budget compared to the 2023 Budget:

|                     | 2023 ($M) | 2024 ($M) | Change ($M) |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Commodity (a)       | $485.0    | $572.0    | $87.0       |
| Public Good excluding subsidies (b) | 75.5      | 67.9      | (7.6)       |
| Other O&M (c)      | 692.8     | 746.2     | 53.4        |
| **Subtotal**        | **$1,253.2** | **$1,386.1** | **$132.8**   |
| Debt Service (d)    | 225.5     | 202.3     | (23.2)      |
| Capital (e)         | 624.9     | 555.0     | (69.9)      |
| **Total Budget Authorization** | **$2,103.6** | **$2,143.4** | **$39.7**    |

*Totals may reflect minor rounding differences.*

Note: The total Public Good budget is $106.6 million; the public good spending for rate subsidies are not included in the Budget Authorization listed above because the Board previously approved these as a component of the rate tariff. The rate subsidy budget is increasing by $4.4 million. The remaining portion of the public good budget is decreasing as research work is being operationalized; when that occurs the budget dollars move from Public Good to O&M budget category.

### Additional budget details
The following sections provide details on the major initiatives and programs funded in the proposed 2024 Budget, grouped by the Board’s Strategic Directions (SD).

![Board Members - November 1, 2023 GM 23-191](https://www.smud.org/-/media/SMUD/Images/Board-Meeting/2023/November/Board-Members-4-2023-11-01.ashx)

**Competitive Rates (SD-2)**  
The proposed 2024 Budget reflects the first year of rate increases that the Board adopted in September 2023. Even with these rate increases, our rates continue to be among the very lowest in California. As of September 2023, our system rates are on average 50% lower than Pacific Gas & Electric’s average rates, which translates to about $1.3 billion in annual bill savings for our customers – money that stays in our local economy each year.

Part of the recent rate proposal included an additional Energy Assistance Program Rate (EAPR) discount of up to $35 per month for our customers most in need. The additional discount for customers increases the rate subsidy portion of the Public Good budget accounts by $1.9 million of the $4.4 million total increase in rate subsidies.

As part of the budget resolution, the Board will be asked to approve provisions that transfer money to and from a rate stabilization fund, dependent upon precipitation amounts and amount of energy deliveries from the Western Area Power Administration’s (WAPA) Central Valley Project. The intent of fund transfer is to reduce impacts to customer bills by being able to rely on the rate stabilization fund and provide a financial buffer when purchasing replacement power on the open market in years with minimal precipitation.

We’ll enter 2024 with approximately $96.4 million in the Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund (HRSF) and $3.9 million in the Rate Stabilization Fund (RSF) (this excludes funds in RSF for Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), Cap-and-Trade (AB32) and Deferred Revenue).

**Access to Credit Markets (SD-3)**  
We proactively manage our financial position to ensure financial strength and strong credit ratings. Strong credit ratings maintain and improve access to credit markets and deliver a lower cost of borrowing, which is especially important in times of high/rising interest rates and provides more and lower cost options for funding our zero carbon projects.

We target strong financial metrics in our cash flow coverage (fixed charge) and liquidity (days cash). For SMUD’s annual budget, the Board sets a minimum fixed charge of 1.50 times operating cash flow; however, as a practice, we plan to a minimum of 1.70. This higher performance standard has proven valuable during the last 3 years of economic uncertainty as investors seek high-quality investments.

We manage a strong liquidity position by setting a minimum number of days cash-on-hand, maintaining an additional $300 million commercial paper program and a $100 million line of credit. A strong liquidity position is important in demonstrating to our customers, investors and rating agencies that SMUD can withstand various financial stresses. Our current days cash-on-hand threshold is 150 days; the minimum amount of cash-on-hand before triggering a new debt or commercial paper issuance to replenish cash balances. The commercial paper and line of credit programs allow for short-term cash balances.

**Reliability (SD-4)**  
Providing reliable electric service to our customers is always a top priority. The 2024 Budget includes funding to ensure our transmission and distribution (T&D) systems have sufficient capacity and load serving capability to serve the needs of our customers safely, reliably and cost-effectively, while meeting regulatory compliance requirements.

Key Reliability investments in the proposed 2024 Budget include:  
- Power Control Center (PCC) to replace the existing Energy Management Center (EMC) building. This is a multi-year project; $6M planned in 2024.  
- Substation investments: $155 million of capital investments to add capacity to support reliability and load growth.  
- Vegetation management & wildfire mitigation: $53 million in the 2024 budget for reliability and risk reduction for wildfire.  
- Pole and cable replacements: $36 million of capital investment to replace 1,200 poles and 240,000 circuit feet of underground cable.  
- Maintenance, including inspections, overhauls, compliance activities to maintain reliable operations of our existing assets.

**Customer Relations (SD-5), Outreach & Communication (SD-15)**  
In 2024, we’ll continue to deliver on the needs of our customers, focusing on outreach, education, and awareness to achieve a carbon-free future by 2030 that our customers can equitably participate in.

We’re engaging with members of our diverse communities to deliver wide-reaching benefits, including expanded workforce development programs. Our Community Impact Plan will continue to provide ways to diversify our portfolio of offerings, creating a more inclusive economic development opportunities and expanding our community education and outreach efforts to ensure no community is left behind.

Key Customer Relations, Outreach & Communication investments in the proposed 2024 Budget include:  
- Continuing to implement our Community Impact Plan, budgeting $14 million in 2024 as part of a multi-year, $41 million program that commits to meaningful investments in under-resourced communities to ensure equitable participation in a clean energy future. We’ll leverage partnerships; increase energy efficiency, electrification, weatherization, solar, and electric vehicle (EV) readiness for our low- and median-income customers; provide $450,000 in Shine Awards; launch our Business District Electrification program; connect technical training partners and community organizations to offer workforce development training, and increase community education and communication.

# About SMUD

As the nation’s sixth-largest, community-owned, not-for-profit electric service, SMUD has been providing low-cost, reliable electricity to Sacramento County since 1946. SMUD is a recognized industry leader and award winner for its innovative energy efficiency programs, renewable power technologies and its sustainable solutions for a healthier environment.

We provide electric service to most of Sacramento County and small, adjoining portions of Placer and Yolo Counties. Our service area is divided into seven wards, each represented by an elected board member who serves a 4-year term. Our Board of Directors determines policy direction and appoints our Chief Executive Officer & General Manager, who is responsible for SMUD’s day-to-day operations.

SMUD became a Control Area, presently called a Balancing Authority (BA), in June 2002 and since then has operated its transmission and generation system independently. On January 1, 2006, the Western Area Power Administration’s Sierra Nevada Region (WAPA-SNR) was integrated into the SMUD BA, followed on December 1, 2006, by the California-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP) – a 500kV transmission line - and the Modesto Irrigation District (MID). On May 8, 2009, together with MID and the cities of Redding and Roseville, SMUD entered into a Joint Powers Agreement to create the new Balancing Authority of Northern California (BANC). With regulatory approval on May 1, 2011, the operations of SMUD BA were transferred to BANC. BANC uses SMUD’s existing employees and physical resources to be the BANC Operator. BANC’s General Manager reports to a five-person Commission made up of SMUD, MID, City of Redding, City of Roseville, and Trinity Public Utility Districts chief executives. This BA, as an independent entity, is not subject to market disruptions that result from financially induced supply shortages within the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) or investor-owned utilities. SMUD is still subject to certain CAISO transmission, grid management and other costs for transactions that use the CAISO controlled grid. These costs have been included in SMUD’s 2024 Budget.

## SMUD Governance

### Our Board of Directors

SMUD is owned by its customers, who elect a seven-member Board of Directors. Each director represents a different geographic area or "ward." During their four-year terms, they establish policies and values about how we serve you and to set the long-term direction SMUD will take as we move forward.

SMUD's Board of Directors establish our vision and guidelines. The Board reviews and approves strategies, such as Community Impact, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging (DEI&B), Electric Vehicle (EV) and Fleet, Wildfire, and Zero Carbon. The Board has the final approval for large expenditures, such as bond issuances, contracts, land purchases, and power purchase agreements. For the annual budget process, the Board approves the budgeted expenses, or authorization to spend, and monitors performance through strategic direction reporting and monthly financial updates.

# 2030 Zero Carbon Plan

**High-level summary of the key elements and actions in our 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.**

| Year | Key Actions |
|------|-------------|
| 2021 | Reliability studies |
| 2023 | McClellan, Campbell |
| 2025 | Canon |
| 2027 | Procter & Gamble, Consumers |
| 2030 | Scale investments, grants, ventures in new tech & business models |

We are committed to achieving our 2030 Zero Carbon Plan and keeping rates affordable. While the plan represents significant new investments, there are several opportunities to manage the impact to customer bills. This strategy depends on regional, national, and international partnerships to share the costs of common goals and fund the development and acceleration of new technologies. We’ll continue to expand new revenue sources, such as Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits, U.S. EPA electric Renewable Identification Number, Inflation Reduction Act direct pay provisions, grants and carbon credits. This strategy also focuses on leveraging use of our low-cost of capital, mechanisms such as green bonds and commodity prepaids that may lower costs and improve efficiency in delivery of our operational services. As technologies progress, we’ll regularly review the financial impact and manage our finances to keep rate increases low and stable.

If you’re interested in learning more about our 2030 Zero Carbon Plan, please visit our [2030 Clean Energy Vision site](https://www.smud.org) and check out how we’re doing with our latest [2030 Zero Carbon Plan Progress Report](https://www.smud.org).

# Budget Process and Assumptions

The process to complete the 2024 Budget began with setting financial limits to ensure that the budget would result in achieving our key financial metrics: Positive Net Income, Fixed Charge Ratio of at least 1.70 and Days Cash of 150 or more. With input from every business unit, we looked holistically at the work planned for the upcoming year and identified the most important work that must be done to support our Clean Energy Vision, our customers, and community. In October 2023, we presented an early look of the budget to the Board before the budget was finalized. The load, revenue, and commodity forecasts were then completed which results in the final proposed 2024 Budget.

Our planning and budgeting philosophy is to plan and measure the total cost of SMUD business processes and set performance improvement targets for the processes and Business Units that will most efficiently accomplish strategic goals. This budgeting methodology also most efficiently allocates and plans resources throughout SMUD to the Business Units and work processes.

SMUD’s Board of Directors has autonomous authority to establish the rates charged for all SMUD services. SMUD typically reviews and sets rates on a two-year cycle. This rate approval process is separate from the annual budget process. SMUD plans its revenue by using the Board approved rates in conjunction with the load forecast. Through approval of the budget, the Board provides the authorization to spend for SMUD to support the work we do to carry out our purpose of enhancing the quality of life for our customers and community by providing reliable and affordable electricity and leading the transition to a clean energy future. To learn more about our rate process please refer to the latest [General Manager's Report](#).

**Public Good Budget**  
Public Good is included in the total O&M budget and is captured within the costs of the Business Unit responsible for the work. Therefore, these costs are not shown on a separate line of the O&M budget and are provided here for information only and to present details as to the programs covered. Total Public Good is $106.6 million, a decrease of $3.2 million, after inclusion of rate subsidies. The Public Good 2024 Proposed Budget is $67.9 million and is the cash disbursement portion of the program that requires Board authorization.

Total subsidies are $38.8 million. The total cost of the Energy Assistance Program Rate (EAPR) subsidy is budgeted at $36.1 million in 2024, an increase of $3.7 million from 2023, and the subsidy for customers using medical equipment increased by $0.7 million for a total of $2.7 million. By December 2024, the number of subsidized customers is expected to be approximately 97,912.

Energy efficiency proposed spending of $50.4 million decreased $3.0 million over prior year. Incorporation of savings from codes and standards is included as a component of the energy efficiency portfolio to match standard industry practice. Building electrification is included in Energy Efficiency public good. The Energy Efficiency budget remains in line with the goal of achieving savings of 1.5% of average annual retail energy sales and reflects our goals of reaching zero carbon by 2030. Residential Assistance decreased slightly, $0.3 million, as we shifted some operational costs to O&M. Research & Development decreased $4.2 million to $8.9 million to right size the funding needed to investigate new and emerging technologies.

**Commodity Budget**

Commodity costs are part of the total O&M budget. The Commodity budget for 2024 of $572 million is $87 million higher than the 2023 Budget. Commodities are not in surplus power sales. The budget for commodities assumes a typical water year. Purchased power is increasing primarily due to resource adequacy costs, zero/low carbon power purchases and higher Renewable Energy Credit (REC) purchases. Fuel for Generation is increasing due to higher forecasted thermal generation.

Further details on power supply information can be found in the Supplemental Information of this document on these pages – Power Supply & Requirements, SMUD Generation Sources, and Purchased Power.

**Other Employee Benefits Budget**

Other Employee Benefits are part of the total O&M budget. These benefit costs are not allocated or included as a labor expense in the Business Unit expenditures. SMUD’s Other Employee Benefits are $37.0 million, an increase of $1.4 million. This budget consists of the O&M portion (unfunded liability) of Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) expense of $33.9 million which is an increase of $2.1 million from the prior year due to adjustments to the unfunded liability balance, and $3.1 million of workers compensation which is a decrease of $0.7 million from the prior year’s budget resulting from reducing reserve estimates.

# Capital Budget Summary

The Capital Proposed Budget for 2024 totals $555 million, which is $70 million or 11 percent lower than the 2023 Budget. This decrease is mainly due to two key projects for the Zero Carbon Plan in 2024 – the Solano 4 Wind Project and the Country Acres Solar + Storage Project – having significantly less scheduled costs in the 2024 Proposed Budget. Both projects are key to us meeting our Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirement.

**Benefits Summary**

The Benefits Summary reflects allocated costs for active employee benefits, the costs to administer those benefits, and Social Security and retirement contributions for current staff. The 2024 Proposed Budget of $146.3 million is an increase of $4.1 million over the 2023 Budget resulting from increased retirement plan contributions driven by higher payroll costs and changes to liability funding, increased employer Social Security/Medicare contributions, offset somewhat by lower health care benefit costs.

The budget for benefit costs is shown as information only as 100% of these expenditures are included in the budgeted dollars of all SMUD O&M and Capital described in this documentation.

# Debt Service

The following schedules show the summary and details of the 2024 Proposed Debt Service Budget. SMUD issues electric revenue bonds and commercial paper notes to finance long-lived capital assets. The Debt Service Budget includes accrued interest expense on outstanding electric revenue bonds and commercial paper notes, net of any swap revenues tied to debt issues, scheduled principal repayments of bonds and commercial paper, trustee fees associated with administration of debt service payments, and interest expense and issuance costs associated with planned new debt issues.

| Debt Service | 2023 Forecast | 2023 Budget | 2024 Proposed | $ Change vs Budget | % Change vs Budget |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Interest Expense | $103,946 | $106,688 | $106,205 | ($483) | 0% |
| Interest on New Debt Issuance | 5,250 | 8,500 | 8,500 | - | 0% |
| Principal Repayments | 111,165 | 111,165 | 84,590 | (26,575) | -24% |
| Fees/Bond Issuance Cost | 2,132 | 2,772 | 6,297 | 3,526 | 127% |
| **Total Debt Service** | **222,493** | **229,125** | **205,592** | **(23,533)** | **-10%** |
| Allocated to JPAs | (3,633) | (3,633) | (3,329) | 304 | -8% |
| **Net Debt Service** | **$218,860** | **$225,492** | **$202,263** | **($23,229)** | **-10%** |

Interest Expense on existing debt totals $106.2 million in the 2024 Proposed Budget, a decrease of $0.5 million from 2023. Revenue bond interest is decreasing $9.7 million to $101.7 million. Commercial paper interest totals $4.5 million in the 2024 Proposed Budget, an increase of $0.7 million. Included in interest expense are Build America Bonds which are gross of the rebate of $9.3 million expected in 2024. The Debt Service Budget includes net debt related swap payments and interest on long-term, variable rate, and subordinated debt. The budget assumes an interest rate of 4.26% (including all related fees & swaps) on an average commercial paper balance of $100 million.

Interest on new debt issuance totals $8.5 million in the 2024 Proposed Budget. This is an estimate of interest expense for new debt expected to be issued within 2024.

Scheduled principal repayments of revenue bonds and commercial paper notes total $84.6 million in 2024, a $26.6 million decrease from the 2023 Budget.

Fees/bond issuance cost of $6.3 million are included for new 2024 bond issuances and related fees.

# Budget Financial Statements

The SMUD financial statements depict the expected results of operations (Income Statement) and cash position (Statement of Cash Flow) at the end of the 2024 budget year. The Income Statement also includes "non-cash" expenses such as depreciation and amortization of capital and regulatory assets, which are not included in the 2024 Budget because funds were expended in prior budget years.

The pro forma financial statements include the consolidated accounts and operations of SMUD, the Sacramento Financing Authority (SFA), the Northern California Gas Agency No. 1 (NCGA No. 1) and the Northern California Energy Authority (NCEA). SFA is a joint powers authority between SMUD and other entities which have issued debt to construct the Carson Cogeneration plant, Procter & Gamble Cogeneration plant, Campbell Soup Cogeneration plant and the Cosumnes Power Plant, respectively, and own and operate the plants. SMUD has entered into a Power Purchase Agreement with SFA to purchase all the plants’ output and pay for Joint Powers Authority (JPA) and plant costs. NCGA No.1 is a joint powers authority that has issued bonds and used the proceeds to prepay long-term natural gas supply contracts. SMUD has entered into an agreement to buy all the gas procured by NCGA No. 1 but is not liable for repayment of the bonds in the event of a default. NCEA is a joint powers authority that has issued bonds and used the proceeds to prepay long-term commodity supply contracts. SMUD has entered into an agreement to buy all the commodities procured by NCEA but is not liable for repayment of the bonds in the event of a default. The relationship between SMUD, SFA, NCGA No. 1 and NCEA meets the criteria established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) for consolidation in the controlling entity's financial statements.

The 2024 Budget will produce $125.3 million of net income for SMUD, which is a decrease of $5.7 million from the 2023 Budget. The fixed charge coverage is planned at 2.08 times operating cash flow. Revenue from electric sales has increased compared to the 2023 Budget due to the impact of the 2024 rate increase.

The budgeted and actual fixed charge ratio and net income as shown on the Pro Forma Income Statement are primary measures of SMUD’s financial performance which are monitored closely by the bond rating agencies in setting SMUD’s bond rating. The fixed charge ratio is a measure of the number of times net operating cash flow before interest expense covers total cash debt service payments, including both interest and principal, for SMUD, the JPAs and SMUD’s share of Transmission Agency of Northern California (TANC) debt service. Net income is the residual after deducting all expenses from revenues for the period.

For detailed descriptions of the financial statement line items please refer to the Supplemental Information section or to this link – Financial Statement Line Item Descriptions.

The 2024 Pro Forma Cash Flow Statement shows the budgeted sources and uses of cash and the projected year-end unrestricted cash balance for 2024. SMUD's current practice is to maintain unrestricted cash and Rate Stabilization Fund (RSF) balances at a minimum of 150 days cash on hand. At the end of 2024, SMUD’s unrestricted cash balance is projected to be $576.7 million, in addition to the Rate Stabilization Fund balance of $3.9 million. The Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund balance, which is expected to be $96 million, is not included in this target minimum.

SMUD generates positive net cash flow from operations because of net income and non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization. In 2024, cash generated from operations is estimated to total approximately $452.7 million. The primary uses of this cash are capital investments, scheduled debt principal repayments and interest payments. The 2024 Budget for capital investment totals $555 million. Scheduled debt principal repayments in 2024 total $84.6 million for SMUD and $13.1 million for SFA (detail included in SFA budget documentation).

We currently maintain $300 million in commercial paper capacity and a $100 million line of credit. Any new money needs can be handled through short-term borrowing or issuing new long-term debt.

![SMUD 2024 Budget](https://www.smud.org/-/media/SMUD/Images/2024-Budget-Page-53.png)

The 2024 Proposed O&M Budget of $97.5 million is higher than the 2023 Budget by $3.7 million, or 4%. The increase is primarily due to a shift of costs resulting from an organizational restructure with no net increase to SMUD. We continue to prioritize our residential and commercial customers and segments, including small and medium businesses with enhanced customer experience, channels, tools and outage support.

The 2024 Proposed Public Good Budget of $8.1 million is lower than the 2023 Budget by $0.2 million, or -2%. In addition to supporting the implementation of the EAPR Stabilization Fund which provides additional discounts to customers in the 0-50% federal poverty level, our 2024 Proposed Budget remains focused on and in support of our low income and underserved communities. Another focus area is our newly implemented Community Impact Plan with a goal of offering a zero-carbon journey that ensures our most under-resourced customers reap the benefits of a clean energy future.

The 2024 Proposed Capital Budget of $7.9 million is higher than the 2023 Budget by $0.3 million or 4%. The increase is driven by the continued growth our region is experiencing and the resources required to manage the purchase and installation of meters.

![SMUD 2024 Budget](https://www.smud.org/-/media/SMUD/Images/2024-Budget-Page-58.png)

The 2024 Proposed O&M Budget of $223.1 million is higher than the 2023 Budget by $10.5 million, or 5%. This is primarily due to increases in network corrective maintenance, service reconnect & repair, transmission and underground corrective maintenance work, additional labor costs associated with increased labor rates as well as the hiring of additional apprentices to meet the 2024 planned workload.

The 2024 Proposed Capital Budget of $239.3 million is higher than the 2023 Budget by $54.4 million or 29%. This is primarily due to a large increase in substation construction projects for future load growth (e.g., Meister-Lonetree, Waterman-Grantline, Whiterock-Sunrise Bank #2, Rio Del Oro, Herald-Twin Cities, McClellan, and Placerville-Grand Prairie) and continued reliability (e.g., Truxel #2 bank replacement, Hurley 230kV and 69kV breaker replacement, Foothill 230kV breaker replacement, and relay upgrades). There is also an additional increase for substation design for future construction (e.g., Elverta Bulk Substation, Station H). The proposed budget for Transmission Planning & Operations is higher mainly due to the Energy Management System (EMS) lifecycle upgrade. There was a decrease in Line Asset capacity projects.

The 2024 Proposed O&M Budget is higher than the 2023 Budget by $19.2 million, or 12%. The primary cost increase driver is Power Generation, driven by dam safety, gas pipeline regulation and critical maintenance requirements to ensure operational reliability. Other areas of increased focus and budget are transportation electrification, load flexibility and strategic grant capture and partnerships.

The 2024 Proposed Public Good Budget of $58.2 million is lower than the 2023 Budget by $4.3 million, or -7%. The decrease is primarily due to reductions in research and development to help fund new business development opportunities. Efforts remain focused on building electrification, Community Impact Plan programs and the implementation of highly prioritized research and development efforts such as EV charging at multi-family dwellings through the ChargeReady Community Grant, long duration energy storage, managed EV charging and virtual power plants.

The 2024 Proposed Capital Budget of $179.9 million is lower than the 2023 Budget by $160.4 million, or -47%. The primary driver is that the Solano 4 Wind and Country Acres Solar and Storage projects are multi-year efforts that had significantly more scheduled costs in 2023 than 2024. We are focused in 2024 on the completion of Solano 4 Wind, construction of Country Acres and other capital improvements projects required to maintain existing assets.

The 2024 Proposed O&M Budget of $44.9 million is higher than the 2023 Budget by $5.6 million, or 14%. This is due to increased spending on enterprise-level initiatives, Zero Carbon Plan, and cybersecurity, offset by a shift in O&M costs to the Allocated cost category. Areas of focus for 2024 are customer and grid-based projects to automate operations and increase reliability, new tools to aid in strategic planning, critical hardware infrastructure to support field work, outage map functionality, a residential bill pre-pay pilot, enhancements in support of real estate services and collection of field data, Critical Infrastructure Plan (CIP) compliance and asset management tool and planning efforts around the new enterprise SAP system.

The 2024 Proposed Capital Budget of $60.2 million is higher than the 2023 Budget by $14.9 million or 33%. This is due to increased efforts in support of the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan with projects such as advanced analytical “grid-edge” sensors to enhance grid capacity and flexibility, an Outage Management System (OMS) replacement and a new phase of the Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS). Other areas of focus for 2024 include conference room technology upgrades, deployment of additional security monitoring, continuation of the Customer Technology Platform replacement, development of an Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging app, consolidating accident and damage claims reporting information, consolidating our Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system on a new cloud platform and further development of our Cloud Center of Excellence.

The 2024 Proposed Allocated Budget of $73.6 million is higher than the 2023 Budget by $9.9 million, or 15%. The increase is due to a shift of billing and payment platform support costs to Allocated from O&M, along with additional contract labor. This budget includes required spending for software licenses, maintenance and support, and scheduled upgrades of staff computer equipment. Additionally, scheduled hardware replacements for field workers are planned. Lastly, a reorganization of business unit functions resulted in a shift of work and related costs from the Enterprise Systems, Strategy & Governance segment to other segments.

With a focus on our region’s historically under-resourced communities, we’re investing in community partnerships that strengthen our neighborhoods and provide equitable support to encourage inclusive economic development in our region. Through our Regional Workforce programs, we are creating an equitable and diverse pathway to zero carbon jobs through education and on-the-job opportunities for underrepresented individuals participating in our workforce training programs.

The 2024 Proposed O&M Budget is higher than the 2023 Budget by $0.2 million, or 1%. This increase is comprised of a shift in costs from Public Good to O&M, mostly offset by a cost reduction due to the delay and rescope of the human resources technology replacement project.

The 2024 Proposed Public Good Budget is lower than the 2023 Budget by $1.2M, or -73%. No funding was reduced in the Sustainable Communities segment; rather, the decrease reflects a shift in costs from Public Good to O&M.

The 2024 Proposed Allocated Budget is higher than the 2023 Budget by $1.5 million, or 10%. The increase is due to the return of labor resources that were charging the human resources technology replacement project in 2023. No additional headcount was added, just a return of hours from project to operational work.

# SMUD 2024 Budget

The 2024 Proposed O&M Budget of $127.2 million is higher than the 2023 Budget by $12.4 million, or 11%. This is primarily due to increases in insurance premiums for general, liability and wildfire insurance. Other notable increases are the start of the planning phase of SMUD’s new Primary Control Center (PCC), additional outside support for audit and legal services, and a shift of marketing costs to O&M from Public Good with no decrease in overall funding.

The 2024 Proposed Public Good Budget is lower than the 2023 Budget by $1.9 million, or -100%. The budget for marketing was shifted to O&M with no overall reduction in funding to better align the work with the funding type.

The Applied to SMUD Capital & Public Good line on the report above indicates the amount of administrative and general expenses that Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows to be allocated to capital and public good work processes. SMUD has chosen a portion of Treasury and Risk Management (including Insurance) as the base of this allocation. Therefore, the allocation applied to other Business Units is shown in the report above to avoid duplication of overall O&M dollars.

The 2024 Proposed Capital Budget of $45.2 million is higher than the 2023 Budget by $21.4 million, or 90%. This is primarily driven by Facilities asset lifecycle replacement projects and the start of the PCC building project.

# Power Supply & Requirements

## Power Supply Assumptions
The 2030 Zero Carbon Plan is the basis for the operating assumptions for the 2024 Budget. Electricity and natural gas prices are forecasted to be lower than what was projected in the 2023 Budget. The Upper American River Project (UARP) generation will be lower due to more planned outages, renewable generation is expected to be lower than the 2023 Budget due to biogas sales. Thermal generation is expected to be higher due to less outages than 2023.

## Energy Sales & Requirements
Total expected supply requirements for the 2024 Proposed Budget are forecasted to be approximately 1% lower than the 2023 Budget. Our expected retail energy sales to customers are projected to decrease and our expected system peak load is forecasted to increase.

The following tables provide additional information regarding generation, purchased power and market transactions.

**SMUD Generation Sources**

**SMUD Hydroelectric (Upper American River Project)**  
The 2024 Budget assumes median rainfall and normal starting reservoir levels in 2024. Generation is expected to be 1,581 GWh.

**Other SMUD Generation: South Fork, Chili Bar, Photovoltaic, Hedge Battery, Solano Wind**  
The 2024 Budget assumes average generation subject to limitations governing the operation of each plant. The largest contributor, Solano Wind, is expected to generate 776 GWh. This includes the additional 91 MW wind capacity (Solano 4) that is forecasted in Q2 2024.

**Cosumnes Power Plant**  
This 603 MW gas-fired combined cycle power plant began commercial operation in February 2006. Forecasted generation from this plant in 2024 is 4,178 GWh.

**Carson Cogeneration**  
This gas-fired cogeneration project, which began commercial operation in October 1995, consists of a 65 MW combined cycle unit and a 42 MW peaking unit. With the installation of an auxiliary steam boiler in 2017, if running the cogeneration unit is uneconomic, it can be turned off. Energy will be supplied from the auxiliary boiler instead of the cogeneration unit. The forecasted generation from this facility in 2024 is 429 GWh.

**Procter & Gamble Cogeneration**  
This gas-fired cogeneration plant began commercial operation in March 1997. It consists of a 136 MW combined cycle power plant and a 50 MW peaking unit that became operational in May 2001. With the installation of an auxiliary steam boiler in 2016, if running the cogeneration unit is uneconomic, it can be turned off. Steam will be supplied from the auxiliary boiler instead of the cogeneration unit. Forecasted generation from this facility in 2024 is 764 GWh.

**Campbell Soup Cogeneration**  
This gas-fired combined cycle plant began commercial operation in December 1997. It consists of a 160 MW combined cycle power unit. Beginning in 2008 the 72 MW McClellan gas turbine is also included under SPA. Forecasted generation from these two units in 2024 is 951 GWh.

The balance of energy requirements to meet forecasted sales to customers will be met by short-term purchases of energy.

Some of the long-term and short-term contracts will be delivered over SMUD’s 528 MW share of the California-Oregon Transmission Project (Northwest) or under the South-of-Tesla transmission agreement with PG&E (Southwest & Southern California). These purchases are coordinated through SMUD's membership in the Western Systems Power Pool (WSPP), which facilitates sales and exchanges among its 30 member utilities, and through market trading.

Lastly, another 5-year extension to the WAPA Custom Product ~300-MW sale/purchase contract with WAPA allows SMUD to import additional power from California Oregon Border through 2024.

*SMUD thermal emissions are estimates based on 2024 forecast and historical emissions factors.

Based on 2024 budgeted generation from SMUD thermals, purchased power, hydro generation, and renewables, our SD-7 greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to be about 2.2 million metric tonnes. This estimate is based on normal conditions, and the use of our thermals and associated emissions could be lower or higher based on actual conditions in the 2024 operating year. Further, the estimate assumes our short-term power purchases are from general market power which carry an emissions factor. While carbon-free power purchases are subject to hydro conditions and availability year to year, SMUD’s Energy Traders continually look for opportunities to purchase clean power from the market to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our portfolio.

# Cost Categories

The Budget includes the following major components:

**Operating Expenses (O&M):** Expenses related to producing and acquiring energy, operating and maintaining the electrical delivery system, providing service to customers including public goods (energy efficiency, low-income assistance, new renewable generation sources, and research and development of advanced technologies) programs, and corporate activities. Included within this category as a separate line item are commodity costs associated with energy supply. These costs include purchased power, fuel for energy production, and transmission wheeling costs.

Also included in O&M under Zero Carbon Energy Solutions Business Unit are fuel, operating and interest expense associated with SFA: Carson Cogeneration plant, Procter & Gamble plant, Campbell Soup Cogeneration plant, Cosumnes Power Plant; NCGA No. 1, and NCEA pass-through gas costs. These expenses are shown in the SMUD Budget because SMUD will reimburse SFA, NCGA No. 1 and NCEA for their costs under the terms of the Power and Gas Purchase Agreements. The detailed SFA, NCGA No. 1 and NCEA Budgets are also in separate booklets and/or resolutions as they will be approved by the SFA, NCGA No. 1 and NCEA Commissions.

**Capital Investments:** Investment in additions and improvements to SMUD’s property, plant and equipment. The Capital Investment budget includes all qualifying costs related to acquiring or constructing tangible and intangible assets which meet SMUD’s capitalization guidelines - cost exceeding $5,000 and an estimated service life greater than two years. SMUD follows Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) capitalization guidelines which dictate the inclusion of all direct costs (labor, employee benefits, materials, services and other) and a proportionate share of indirect costs (engineering and construction supervision and support, transportation, insurance, etc.) related to capital projects. Capital assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful service life.

**Allocated Expenses:** A portion of the costs in four business units: Information Technology, Workforce, Diversity & Inclusion, Energy Delivery & Operations and Corporate, which enable the business units to perform work. These costs are pooled and then allocated to both O&M and capital costs based on the quantity of labor hours planned in the receiving business unit. The aggregated allocated costs are presented in the budget documentation separately as information only; the actual costs are reflected in each of the Business Unit’s budgets as part of the total cost of their work processes. Examples of allocated costs are enterprise-wide used software, safety services, human resources, procurement and fleet services.

**Debt Service:** Interest expense on and principal repayments of SMUD’s outstanding long-term debt and commercial paper notes, any revenues or payments on interest rate swaps, and trustee fees and debt issuance costs.

# Expense Type Descriptions

**Activity Type Labor:** SMUD employee labor planned to a business unit work process. Each Activity Type has a standard hourly charge-out rate that is based on work (non-leave) hours, average annual employee salaries, and includes benefits.

**Materials & Equipment:** Materials and equipment either issued from inventory or purchased for a specific project or task.

**Other Expenses:** Is a grouping of several non-material costs including dues and publications, memberships, training, travel, rents, leases, license fees, taxes, advertising, utilities, and postage.

**Outside Services:** The cost of outside services contracts, consultants, and outside legal counsel services.

**Rebates & Incentives:** The cost of rebates and incentives paid to customers for energy efficiency, building electrification and electric transportation programs.

**Commodities:** The cost of purchased power, wheeling, and fuel for SMUD and JPA generating plants, net of surplus/wholesale power sales which represents revenues from the sale of generation and bulk power purchases which are surplus to our generation needs.

**Reimbursements:** Reimbursements, cost-sharing grants, or pass-through amounts received from outside parties to reduce net costs.

**Allocations/Surcharges:** Includes cost center overheads and surcharges. Cost center overheads are a rate developed to recover the indirect costs of a Cost Center and includes labor for administration, supervision, training, and miscellaneous expenses such as office supplies and travel. It is assessed per hour of labor planned directly to the work processes. Surcharge rates are developed to recover 1) an allocation of internal service costs such as transportation and technology assessed per hour of labor planned directly to the work processes, 2) the costs of procuring outside service agreements and costs of procuring, storing, and handling materials and equipment and 3) miscellaneous general and administrative SMUD expenses including insurance and risk management, cash management, debt management, and other assessed to capital and public good projects based on a flat percentage of overall SMUD labor.

![SMUD 2024 Budget - Notes to Performance Metrics](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+2024+Budget+-+Notes+to+Performance+Metrics)

**Notes to Performance Metrics:**

Footnotes

[1] 2023 under target due to the unanticipated outage at Camino and the scheduled outage at Campbell.

[2] Atmospheric storm activity in January (Q1) had significant impact on the distribution system. January storms resulted in 195% of average rainfall and 60+ MPH winds in downtown Sacramento causing service disruption throughout the County from downed powerlines, poles, and other impacted SMUD assets. We are projected to miss SAIDI targets including and excluding major events and SAIFI including major events targets but are on track to meet the goal for SAIFI excluding major events target.

[3] The overall Value for What you Pay (VFP) score through September is 71%, staying nearly the same as 2022 despite tremendous customer impacts of the winter storms and higher cost-of-living burdens. Year-to-date residential VFP is at 70% and commercial is at 72%. The steady score is due to SMUD's extensive customer support, responsiveness during critical events, and tailored and new outreach, education, and solutions for our unique communities. The overall Value for What you Pay (VFP) targets are 70% by the end of 2025 and 80% by the end of 2030.

[4] As of the end of September, 8,034 Employee-Supervisor interactions have been reported. This is well over the 6,050 target and puts SMUD on track to meet the prediction based on the performance in the last 9 months.

[5] As of the end of September, 16 of the 18 incidents included in this metric were reported within 3 days of the supervisor being notified of the incident. The prediction is based on the performance in the last 9 months.

[6] As of the end of September, 14 OSHA Recordable cases resulted in Lost Time or Restricted Work. Based off the performance in the last 9 months SMUD will likely miss this metric.

[7] 50.67 represents the projected funding at the 50% confidence level on the fiscal anniversary date of 6/30/2022. The trend development that has occurred, however, as of 03/2023 now reflects that figure is $0.36 that level projects based on 2023 historical lows in both the number of claims received, as well as the injury patterns and losses incurred. The $0.36 reflects the 50% confidence level for funding on 6/30/2023 for the 2024 fiscal year taking all these factors into account.

[8] Employee engagement survey is planned to be launched in the second quarter of 2024.

[9] All figures for this metric are cumulative based on the impacts from both energy efficiency and building electrification measures in place in a given year. 
   (a) Forecast is lower than target primarily because of the following:
   - Cumulative energy efficiency and electrification programs experienced reduced activity and participation as businesses continue to experience challenging financial conditions, inflationary impacts, and increased project costs.
   (b) 2023 and 2024 targets are set based on the resource modeling tools and framework of the 2019 IRP which is being updated to reflect the resource mix assumptions in the updated Zero Carbon Plan projections.

[10] All figures in this metric series are cumulative
   a) Carbon emission reductions from transportation electrification are based on an updated average of 3.1 tonnes per equivalent light duty vehicle in 2023 and 3.2 tonnes per equivalent light duty vehicle in 2024.
   b) 2022 target developed reflecting the most current resource planning and carbon reduction data and assumptions in the Zero Carbon Plan.

[11] SMUD expects its 2023 Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) percentage to be ~48% using in year purchases. The RPS statutes allow renewables procured above the compliance period targets to be carried over and applied in future compliance periods. We are on track to fulfill our RPS obligations for compliance period 4 which runs from 2021 to 2024.

# SMUD 2024 Budget

**RESOLUTION NO. Draft**

WHEREAS, the proposed 2024 Budget is expected to result in a positive net income for 2024; NOW THEREFORE,

**BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT:**

**Section 1.** This resolution may be referred to as the 2024 Budget Resolution.

**Section 2.** (a) There is hereby appropriated from the General Fund sufficient monies for the payment of demands against SMUD which relate to obligations incurred for the purposes and within the amount specified for such purposes in the following projection of SMUD's program for the period January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.

**Operations and maintenance:**

- Commodity - purchased power, fuel, and wheeling: $572,000,004
- Public Goods: $67,888,971
- Customer, energy delivery, zero carbon, enterprise strategy, workforce diversity & inclusion, information technology, corporate services and Rancho Seco: $746,217,455

**Sub-Total:** $1,386,106,430

**Debt Service:** $202,263,155  
**Capital and reserve:** $554,965,979  

**TOTAL:** $2,143,335,564

(b) The Commodity line item budget is based on assumptions of average rainfall and temperatures during 2024. SMUD has in place a Hydro Generation Adjustment (SMUD HGA) mechanism whereby, based on the actual rainfall amounts between April 1, 2023 and March 31, 2024 in comparison to the budget assumptions, SMUD may transfer funds to or from the Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund and, once pre-established limits are met,
<!-- Page 100 -->
![SMUD 2024 Budget](https://www.smud.org/-/media/Smud-Documents/2024-Budget/SMUD-2024-Budget-Page-100.png)

increase or decrease customer rates. The Commodity line item budget will be increased or reduced based on the actual transfer and/or change in customer revenues from the SMUD HGA adjustment.

(c) SMUD also has in place or may enter into additional agreements under which monies will be received by SMUD in the event actual weather conditions are drier than average. In the event of below average rainfall, the Commodity line item budget will be increased by an amount equal to the payments received under these contracts.

(d) SMUD has budgeted to receive energy in 2024 under its contract with the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). SMUD has in place a WAPA Hydro Generation Adjustment (WAPA HGA) mechanism whereby, based on the actual delivery from WAPA between April 1, 2023 and March 31, 2024 in comparison to the budget assumptions, SMUD may transfer funds to or from the WAPA Rate Stabilization Fund and, once pre-established limits are met, increase or decrease customer rates. This energy primarily is generated at Central Valley Project hydroelectric plants, and the actual quantity of energy received will be dependent on rainfall, carryover water storage and operation of the WAPA system to meet contractual water deliveries. Because WAPA generation facilities are spread over a wide area, insurance is not practical for offsetting variations of energy deliveries due to weather. One purpose of the Rate Stabilization Fund is to mitigate such variations. The Commodity line item budget will be increased or reduced based on the actual transfer and/or change in customer revenues from the WAPA HGA adjustment.

(e) Budgeted energy purchases necessary to meet customer energy sales requirements (10,302 GWh) are based on average weather conditions and expected customer growth in 2024. Should actual weather conditions or growth levels cause SMUD retail sales and related energy requirements to be higher, the Commodity line item budget will be.
<!-- Page 101 -->
![SMUD 2024 Budget](https://www.smud.org/-/media/Smud-Org/Images/2024-Budget/2024-Budget-Page-101.png)

increased by the NP15 power price per megawatt-hour of additional retail energy sales to offset the cost of these sales.

(f) SMUD participates in regulatory programs such as Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and Cap-and-Trade. Under these programs, SMUD has the option to monetize the credits and allowances applicable to these programs through sales transactions. When SMUD collects revenues through these sales, it is required to apply the proceeds toward specific expenses that support the program goals. An additional purpose of the Rate Stabilization Fund is to mitigate fluctuations from regulatory programs. The Accountant is hereby authorized to transfer funds to or from the Rate Stabilization Fund to match LCFS and Cap-and-Trade revenues with expenses. The budgeted amount will be increased or decreased accordingly.

(g) For purposes of Section 11891.6 of the Municipal Utility District Act, there shall be deemed added to each line item, in section 2a, a 10 percent contingency. Demands against SMUD which relate to obligations incurred for each line item and are within such line item amount plus the 10 percent contingency may be paid without prior specific approval of this Board, provided the total of such payments during 2024 may not exceed the total budget amount plus this 10% contingency, plus the commodity contingency and adjustments for weather hedge contracts, higher retail sales and Rate Stabilization transfers as set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) above.

Section 3. Demands against SMUD may be paid without the prior specific approval of this Board if they relate to obligations incurred for the purpose and within the amounts specified in Section 2, provided such demands are approved by the CEO & General Manager or someone to whom he has delegated such approval authority. It is the purpose and intent of this paragraph to delegate to the CEO & General Manager authority to make purchases, to negotiate and execute contracts, and expend funds in any manner necessary or appropriate to the

administration of the business affairs of SMUD, all within the amounts and for the purposes set forth above, and subject to the provisions of existing law and of all the duly passed resolutions of this Board, including the Board-approved delegations of authority.

**Section 4.** At monthly intervals the Treasurer shall transfer from the General Fund appropriate amounts into each of the various funds established to service SMUD’s general obligation indebtedness, its Electric System Revenue Bond indebtedness, and its Electric Revenue Bond indebtedness in approximately equal installments as set forth in the tabulations on file with the Accountant. Investment authority, for all funds, is delegated to the Treasurer for a one-year period in accordance with California Code Section 53607.

**Section 5.** The number of permanent full-time employees during 2024 shall not exceed 2,250 employees plus a five percent contingency without further authorization of this Board.

**Section 6.** The Public Goods Charge shall be adjusted from 16.77 percent of 1994 revenues to 16.28 percent of 1994 revenues. The percentage allocation for the public goods charge expenditures shall be adjusted from 6.60 percent to 7.22 percent for low-income assistance, and from 8.16 percent to 7.70 percent for energy efficiency, and from 2.01 percent to 1.37 percent for research and development, and stayed the same at 0.00 percent for new renewable generation.

# SMUD 2024 Budget

**Section 1.** The Board of Directors of SMUD declares its intention to authorize the issuance of additional revenue bonds or Clean Renewable Energy Bonds for the purpose of financing, in whole or in part, the costs of the capital items identified in SMUD’s 2024 capital budget, 2022 and 2023 capital expenditures not previously financed, the prepayment of purchased power or natural gas and the purchase of natural gas reserves, pipelines or storage facilities, for all of which SMUD is authorized by law to issue such bonds. SMUD has paid or reasonably expects to pay certain expenditures (the “Reimbursement Expenditures”) in connection with such capital items prior to the issuance of such bonds, and hereby officially declares its intent to use certain proceeds of such bonds to reimburse the Reimbursement Expenditures. The declarations contained in this section are made solely for purposes of establishing compliance with Section 1.150-2 of the U. S. Treasury Regulations, and do not bind SMUD to make any expenditure, incur any indebtedness or proceed with the above-mentioned capital expenditures.

**Section 2.** The maximum principal amount of the additional revenue bonds proposed to be issued under this supplemental resolution is $400,000,000. Such maximum principal amount is in addition to the $8,655,000,000 principal amount of revenue bonds authorized pursuant to the Prior Resolutions. Such additional bonds may be issued in series from time to time, and it shall not be necessary that all of the bonds proposed to be issued be issued at any one time.

Proceeds from the issuance of these bonds will be used to finance capital improvements identified in SMUD's 2024 capital budget, 2022 and 2023 capital expenditures not previously financed, capital expenditures for the prepayment of purchased power or natural gas and the purchase of natural gas reserves, pipelines, or storage facilities. The declarations in this section are made solely to establish compliance with Section 12852 of the California Public

Utilities Code, and do not bind SMUD to make any expenditure, incur any indebtedness or proceed with the above-mentioned capital expenditures.

**Section 3.** The maximum term of any of such bonds is 40 years. In the event the maximum authorized amount under a series of bonds is divided into two or more series, the said maximum term shall be calculated in each case from the date of each divided series of bonds.

**Section 4.** The maximum rate of interest to be payable upon such bonds shall not exceed the interest rate per annum equal to the greater of fifteen percent (15 percent) per annum or the yield of United States Treasury bonds having a remaining term equal, as nearly as practicable, to the final maturity of such bonds, as determined by SMUD as of the date of sale of such bonds, plus three percent (3 percent). The maximum discount with respect to such bonds shall not exceed ten percent (10 percent).

**Section 5.** This resolution shall take effect immediately, subject only to the right of referendum provided in Article 6a of Chapter 6 of Division 6 of the California Public Utilities Code (beginning at Section 12850 thereof).

**Section 6.** The Secretary of SMUD is hereby directed to publish a copy of this resolution once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published within SMUD’s boundaries. At any time within 60 days after the date of the second such publication, a referendum petition signed by voters in number equal to at least three percent (3 percent) of the total vote cast, as defined in Section 11507 of the California Public Utilities Code, demanding the submission of this resolution to a vote of the voters of SMUD for their assent to the issuance of the proposed bonds, may be filed with the Secretary of SMUD. Upon presentation to the Secretary of SMUD of such a referendary petition, this resolution shall not be of effect unless and until it has been assented to by the voters.
