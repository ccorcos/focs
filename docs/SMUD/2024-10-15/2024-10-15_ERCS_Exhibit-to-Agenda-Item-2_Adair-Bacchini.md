# Evaluation Process

- In July, staff conducted an evaluation of the market and determined that this offer provided superior value and diversity in the portfolio versus available alternatives.

- The Sanborn 2 PV I phase is part of a larger 300 MW solar photovoltaic project located near Mojave in Kern County, California.

- Environmental Services has reviewed the project and CEQA shows impacts from the projected have been mitigated to less than significant for most resource areas.

- A Statement of Overriding Considerations was prepared with adoption of the EIR for the significant and unavoidable impacts.
