# Contract Strategy

- Previously, SMUD held separate contracts for General Line Construction & Pole Replacement work.
- In combining the scopes, SMUD sought to drive pricing reductions by leveraging higher volume of expected spend with the contractors.
- Bid Schedule restructured to unitize high quantity, well-defined types of work.
