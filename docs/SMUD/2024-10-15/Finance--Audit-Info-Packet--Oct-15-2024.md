**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and award contracts to Hot Line Construction, Inc. (Hot Line) and Mountain G Enterprises Inc. (MGE) for General Line Construction and Pole Replacement Services for a period of three years from November 1, 2024, to November 1, 2027, with two optional one-year extensions, for a total not-to-exceed aggregate amount of $250 million.

**Summary:**  
Request for Proposals No. Doc4585979980 (RFP) was issued in June 2024 to solicit qualified firms to provide general line construction and pole replacement services. A pre-proposal conference was held on June 26, 2024. On July 18, 2024, 15 proposals were received. An initial evaluation was conducted to assess whether the proposals received, including pricing and other factors, were fair and reasonable. Eight of the 15 proposals were rejected by SMUD in accordance with RFP Section No. 5 – Proposal Evaluation Criteria, as they were found to contain unfair and unreasonable pricing, and/or exceptions to SMUD contractual terms and conditions. Seven proposals were found to be commercially viable and were evaluated in accordance with the advertised criteria. Of the seven proposals received, six were responsive.

SMUD initiated negotiations with top-ranked proposers which resulted in a price reduction of ~1.5% to overall pricing from Hot Line’s proposal, and ~1.4% to overall pricing from MGE’s proposal. The final pricing from Hot Line and MGE is highly competitive, as the final proposal pricing of $90.7 million and $95.9 million, respectively, represent significant reductions from the budgeted spend of $250 million. Coupled with their technical score, this supports the recommendation to award contracts to the two highest rated proposers. Awarding two zero-dollar contracts with an aggregate amount of all tasks not-to-exceed $250,000,000 for five years gives the business unit flexibility and mitigates the risk of work disruption. The result of the evaluation and award recommendations are shown below.

**Recommendation:**  
Award the 2 Highest Evaluated Responsive Proposers.

**Award to:**  
- Hot Line Construction, Inc.  
  9020 Brentwood Blvd. Ste. H  
  Brentwood, CA 94513  
- Mountain G Enterprises Inc.
