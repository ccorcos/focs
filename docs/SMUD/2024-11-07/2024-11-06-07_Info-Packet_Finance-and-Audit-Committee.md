**Summary:**  

**2025 Budget Resolution**  
The 2025 Proposed SMUD Budget Resolution is comprised of Operations and Maintenance budget of $1.46 billion, Debt Service budget of $205.4 million, and Capital budget of $612 million. The proposed 2025 Budget Resolution limits spending to $2.28 billion (total of prior amounts), plus 10% contingency, plus the commodity contingency and adjustments for Hydro Generation Adjustment (LTSFRs or revenue, Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) energy delivery shortfall, and higher retail sales. Additionally, SMUD participates in regulatory programs such as Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and Cap-and-Trade. When SMUD collects revenues through these program’s sales, it is required to apply the proceeds toward specific expenses that support the programs' goals. Should actual sales proceeds exceed the budgeted amount for these programs, the budgeted amount may be increased to match the sales proceeds without the prior specific approval of this Board. The proposed resolution also limits authorized permanent full-time positions to 2,295 plus 5 percent.  

**Public Good Charge**  
The Public Goods Charge shall be adjusted for expenditures of $104.8 million, which exceeds the minimum of 2.85% of 1994 revenues. The percentage allocation for the public goods charge expenditures shall apply to low-income assistance, energy efficiency, research and development, and new renewable generation.  

**2025 Debt Resolution**  
The 2025 Proposed Debt Resolution contains the official Declaration of Intent to Issue Debt to create $400 million of additional bonding authority to reimburse for qualifying capital expenditures. The resolution also contains the Official Intent to reimburse for 2025, 2024 and 2023 capital expenditures from bond proceeds, which is required to maintain tax-exempt financing capability.  

**Pay Schedule and Special Compensation Items**  
Approve/Adopt SMUD’s pay schedule and special compensation pursuant to California Code of Regulations (CCR).  

**Board Policy:**  
The 2025 SMUD Budget funds programs and initiatives that contribute to meeting Board strategic directives. GP-3 (e) Board will adopt SMUD’s budget on an annual basis.  

**Benefits:**  
Approval of the 2025 SMUD Budget meets the requirements of the MUD Act and will authorize spending within the limits prescribed.

# RESOLUTION NO. ________________

WHEREAS, the proposed 2025 Budget is expected to result in a positive net income for 2025; NOW THEREFORE,

**BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT:**

**Section 1.** This resolution may be referred to as the 2025 Budget Resolution.

**Section 2.** (a) There is hereby appropriated from the General Fund sufficient monies for the payment of demands against SMUD which relate to obligations incurred for the purposes and within the amount specified for such purposes in the following projection of SMUD’s program for the period January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025.

**Operations and maintenance:**

- Commodity - purchased power, fuel, and wheeling: $610,000,000
- Public Goods: $67,630,890
- Customer, energy delivery, zero carbon, workforce diversity & enterprise partnerships, information technology, corporate services & Rancho Seco: $786,248,204

**Sub-Total:** $1,463,879,094

**Debt Service:** $205,393,922  
**Capital and reserve:** $612,031,708  

**TOTAL:** $2,281,304,724
<!-- Page 10 -->
![DRAFT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=DRAFT)

(b) The Commodity line-item budget is based on assumptions of average rainfall and temperatures during 2025. SMUD has in place a Hydro Generation Adjustment (SMUD HGA) mechanism whereby, based on the actual rainfall amounts between April 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025 in comparison to the budget assumptions, SMUD may transfer funds to or from the Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund and, once pre-established limits are met, increase or decrease customer rates. The Commodity line-item budget will be increased or reduced based on the actual transfer and/or change in customer revenues from the SMUD HGA adjustment.

(c) SMUD has budgeted to receive energy in 2025 under its contract with the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). SMUD has in place a WAPA Hydro Generation Adjustment (WAPA HGA) mechanism whereby, based on the actual delivery from WAPA between April 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025 in comparison to the budget assumptions, SMUD may transfer funds to or from the WAPA Rate Stabilization Fund and, once pre-established limits are met, increase or decrease customer rates. This energy primarily is generated at Central Valley Project hydroelectric plants, and the actual quantity of energy received will be dependent on rainfall, carryover water storage and operation of the WAPA system to meet contractual water deliveries. Because WAPA generation facilities are spread over a wide area, insurance is not practical for offsetting variations of energy deliveries due to weather. One purpose of the Rate Stabilization Fund is to mitigate such variations.
<!-- Page 11 -->
![DRAFT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=DRAFT)

Commodity line-item budget will be increased or reduced based on the actual transfer and/or change in customer revenues from the WAPA HGA adjustment

(d) Budgeted energy purchases necessary to meet customer energy sales requirements (10,500 GWh) are based on average weather conditions and expected customer growth in 2025. Should actual weather conditions or growth levels cause SMUD retail sales and related energy requirements to be higher, the Commodity line item budget will be increased by the NP15 power price per megawatt-hour of additional retail energy sales to offset the cost of these sales.

(e) SMUD participates in regulatory programs such as Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and Cap-and-Trade. Under these programs, SMUD has the option to monetize the credits and allowances applicable to these programs through sales transactions. When SMUD collects revenues through these sales, it is required to apply the proceeds toward specific expenses that support the program goals. An additional purpose of the Rate Stabilization Fund is to mitigate fluctuations from regulatory programs. The Accountant is hereby authorized to transfer funds to or from the Rate Stabilization Fund to match LCFS and Cap-and-Trade revenues with expenses. The budgeted amount will be increased or decreased accordingly.

(f) For purposes of Section 11891.6 of the Municipal Utility District Act, there shall be deemed added to each line item, in section 2a, a 10 percent contingency. Demands against SMUD which relate to obligations incurred for each line item and are within such line item amount plus the 10
<!-- Page 12 -->
![DRAFT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=DRAFT)

percent contingency may be paid without prior specific approval of this Board, provided the total of such payments during 2025 may not exceed the total budget amount plus this 10% contingency, plus the commodity contingency and adjustments for weather hedge contracts, higher retail sales and Rate Stabilization transfers as set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) above.

**Section 3.** Demands against SMUD may be paid without the prior specific approval of this Board if they relate to obligations incurred for the purpose and within the amounts specified in Section 2, provided such demands are approved by the CEO & General Manager or someone to whom he has delegated such approval authority. It is the purpose and intent of this paragraph to delegate to the CEO & General Manager authority to make purchases, to negotiate and execute contracts, and expend funds in any manner necessary or appropriate to the administration of the business affairs of SMUD, all within the amounts and for the purposes set forth above, and subject to the provisions of existing law and of all the duly passed resolutions of this Board, including the Board-approved delegations of authority.

**Section 4.** At monthly intervals, the Treasurer shall transfer from the General Fund appropriate amounts into each of the various funds established to service SMUD's general obligation indebtedness, its Electric System Revenue Bond indebtedness, and its Electric Revenue Bond indebtedness in approximately equal installments as set forth in the tabulations on file with the Accountant. Investment authority, for all funds, is delegated to the Treasurer for a one-year period in accordance with California Code Section 53607.

**Section 5.** The number of permanent full-time employees during 2025 shall not exceed 2,295 employees plus a five percent contingency without further authorization of this Board.

**Section 6.** The Public Goods Charge shall be adjusted for expenditures of $104.8 million, which exceeds the minimum of 2.85% of 1994 revenues. The percentage allocation for the public goods charge expenditures shall apply to low-income assistance, energy efficiency, research and development, and new renewable generation.

**Section 7.** The CEO & General Manager, or his designee, is authorized to make future changes to the Budget that, in his prudent judgment: (a) further the primary purpose of the Budget; (b) are intended to provide a net benefit to SMUD; and (c) do not exceed the authorized Budget amounts and applicable contingencies.

<!-- Page 16 -->
![DRAFT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=DRAFT)

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of SMUD desires to inform its customers and the public of its plans for financing capital improvements and other capital expenditures to its system by specifying certain items for which the proceeds of said revenue bonds are to be used, which uses shall not include daily maintenance and operations costs; NOW, THEREFORE,

BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT:

**Section 1.** The Board of Directors of SMUD declares its intention to authorize the issuance of additional revenue bonds or Green Bonds for the purpose of financing, in whole or in part, the costs of the capital items identified in SMUD’s 2025 capital budget, 2023 and 2024 capital expenditures not previously financed, the prepayment of purchased power or natural gas, and pipelines or storage facilities, for all of which SMUD is authorized by law to issue such bonds. SMUD has paid or reasonably expects to pay certain expenditures (the “Reimbursement Expenditures”) in connection with such capital items prior to the issuance of such bonds, and hereby officially declares its intent to use certain proceeds of such bonds to reimburse the Reimbursement Expenditures. The declarations contained in this section are made solely for purposes of establishing compliance with Section 1.150-2 of the U. S. Treasury Regulations, and do not bind SMUD to make any expenditure, incur any indebtedness or proceed with the above-mentioned capital expenditures.

**Section 2.** The maximum principal amount of the additional revenue bonds proposed to be issued under this supplemental resolution is $400,000,000. Such maximum principal amount is in addition to the
<!-- Page 17 -->
$9,055,000,000 principal amount of revenue bonds authorized pursuant to the Prior Resolutions. Such additional bonds may be issued in series from time to time, and it shall not be necessary that all of the bonds proposed to be issued be issued at any one time.

Proceeds from the issuance of these bonds will be used to finance capital improvements identified in SMUD's 2025 capital budget, 2023 and 2024 capital expenditures not previously financed, capital expenditures for the prepayment of purchased power or natural gas, and pipelines or storage facilities. The declarations in this section are made solely to establish compliance with Section 12852 of the California Public Utilities Code, and do not bind SMUD to make any expenditure, incur any indebtedness or proceed with the above-mentioned capital expenditures.

**Section 3.** The maximum term of any of such bonds is 40 years. In the event the maximum authorized amount under a series of bonds is divided into two or more series, the said maximum term shall be calculated in each case from the date of each divided series of bonds.

**Section 4.** The maximum rate of interest to be payable upon such bonds shall not exceed the interest rate per annum equal to the greater of fifteen percent (15 percent) per annum or the yield of United States Treasury bonds having a remaining term equal, as nearly as practicable, to the final maturity of such bonds, as determined by SMUD as of the date of sale of such bonds, plus three percent (3 percent). The maximum discount with respect to such bonds shall not exceed ten percent (10 percent).
<!-- Page 18 -->
![DRAFT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=DRAFT)

**Section 5.** This resolution shall take effect immediately, subject only to the right of referendum provided in Article 6a of Chapter 6 of Division 6 of the California Public Utilities Code (beginning at Section 12850 thereof).

**Section 6.** The Secretary of SMUD is hereby directed to publish a copy of this resolution once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published within SMUD’s boundaries. At any time within 60 days after the date of the second such publication, a referendum petition signed by voters in number equal to at least three percent (3 percent) of the total vote cast, as defined in Section 11507 of the California Public Utilities Code, demanding the submission of this resolution to a vote of the voters of SMUD for their assent to the issuance of the proposed bonds, may be filed with the Secretary of SMUD.

# SFA THERMAL FLEET

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority (SFA) is a Joint Powers Authority (JPA) formed by Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) and currently consists of five separate Thermal plants: Campbell Power Plant, Carson Power Plant, Cosumnes Power Plant, McClellan Power Plant, and Procter & Gamble Power Plant. On November 1, 2021, these plants transferred individual JPA ownerships to SFA.

## CAMPBELL POWER PLANT / MCCLELLAN POWER PLANT

The plant is located at 3215 47th Avenue, Sacramento, CA. The plant consists of a 160 MW clean-burning gas-fired combined cycle turbine generator unit. Besides electricity, the plant can generate steam, which could be sold to a suitable steam host. The plant's original steam host, Campbell Soup Supply Company, closed their factory in 2013 and no suitable replacement has been identified. The plant burns natural gas, which is supplied through natural gas pipelines owned and operated by SMUD. SMUD has designed and built transmission and telecommunications facilities to integrate the plant into SMUD’s electrical system.

On May 11, 2007, the McClellan Gas Turbine (McClellan) facility was acquired through an Asset Sales Agreement. At that time, the operation and maintenance of McClellan became a secondary function of Campbell Power Plant. The McClellan gas turbine is a 72 MW simple cycle combustion turbine with both fast and black start capabilities. McClellan has been in commercial operation at the McClellan business park in Sacramento County since 1986. All electricity produced by McClellan is sold to SMUD.

## CARSON POWER PLANT

The plant is a cogeneration plant located adjacent to the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (SRCSCD) facility in southern Sacramento County. The plant consists of one clean-burning gas-fired combined cycle gas turbine generator unit, one steam turbine generator unit, and one simple cycle gas turbine for a combined capacity of 107.5 MW. Besides electricity, the plant generates steam that is sold to SRCSCD and an adjacent ice producing facility owned by the Glacier Valley Ice Company (Glacier Ice). The units are permitted to burn both digester gas from the SRCSCD facility, which was previously flared, and natural gas. SMUD has designed and built transmission and telecommunications facilities to integrate the plant into SMUD’s electrical system. Since January 2012, Carson Power Plant has been cleaning the digester gas it receives from SRCSCD to pipeline quality and selling it to SMUD for use in the Cosumnes Power Plant, where it can be used more efficiently.

## COSUMNES POWER PLANT

Cosumnes is located on a property adjacent to the decommissioned Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station near the town of Herald, in the County of Sacramento. The plant consists of two ultra-low emissions, F-class, high efficiency gas-fired combined cycle gas turbine generator units, two heat recovery boilers, and one steam turbine generator unit with a combined, net capacity of 602 MW. The plant burns natural gas, which is supplied through a natural gas pipeline owned and operated by SMUD. SMUD has designed and built transmission and telecommunications facilities to integrate the plant into SMUD’s electrical system.

## PROCTER & GAMBLE POWER PLANT

The Procter & Gamble Power Plant is located adjacent to the Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Company (Procter & Gamble) in Sacramento County. The plant consists of two clean-burning gas-fired combined cycle gas turbine generator units, one steam turbine generator unit, and one simple cycle gas turbine for a combined capacity of 190.3 MW. Besides electricity, the plant generates steam, which is sold to Procter & Gamble. The plant burns natural gas, which is supplied through a natural gas pipeline owned and operated by SMUD. SMUD has designed and built transmission and telecommunications facilities to integrate the plant into SMUD’s electrical system.

# 2025 SFA – Thermal Fleet Budget

The 2025 SFA – Thermal Fleet Budget covers the expected financial operations of all the thermal plants. These budgets represent expenses to be incurred and/or paid by SFA in 2025 while running and conducting the business of each plant. The second part of the budget lists capital and other expenditures proposed for 2025. Also included in this document is a pro forma financial statement. This statement incorporates SFA revenues and non-cash expenses such as depreciation to show the complete financial results of operations for the year.

The operation of SFA is governed by a series of agreements, among the JPA members and outside parties. A description of these agreements follows:

**JOINT POWERS AGREEMENT**, SMUD will provide technical and administrative services for SFA pursuant to the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), as SFA has no employees. The SFA Board consists primarily of the SMUD Board with one non-voting member representing Modesto Irrigation District (MID).

**POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT (PPA)** between SMUD and SFA. SFA has agreed to sell to SMUD and SMUD has agreed to purchase the energy and capacity from the Thermal Fleet. SMUD will pay SFA for its costs whether the plants are operating or not. This agreement will be in effect until terminated by SMUD, but in no case before the bonds for Cosumnes Power Plant is paid in full. This agreement covers the terms of how the fleet will be operated (SMUD will dispatch) and the calculation of payments from SMUD to SFA for operation of the plants.

**GAS SUPPLY AGREEMENT (GSA)** between SMUD and SFA. SMUD will arrange for all natural gas supply and transportation requirements for the SFA, and SMUD will charge SFA for SMUD’s actual supply and transportation costs properly allocable to each plant.

**WATER SUPPLY AGREEMENT** between SMUD and SFA covers the terms under which SMUD supplies all water to the Cosumnes Power Plant.

**OPERATIONS & MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (O&M AGREEMENT)** between SFA and Ethos Energy Power Plant Services (Ethos), the plant operator. SFA has contracted with Ethos to operate, repair, overhaul and maintain the thermal fleet for a five-year term effective January 1, 2016, in exchange for payments tied to specified plant performance standards. On August 21, 2020, SFA exercised a onesided renewal clause extending the agreement for a second five-year term.

**GROUND LEASE AGREEMENT** between SMUD and SFA covers the terms of SFA’s ground lease for the property on which the plants are located.

**INDENTURE OF TRUST (INDENTURE)** between SFA – Cosumnes Power Plant and U.S. Bank National Association. This agreement covers the terms and conditions of the Trust Estate executed on behalf of the bondholders. It secures and pledges revenues to the payment of principal and interest on the bonds and ensures compliance by SFA with all covenants contained therein.

**COMMODITY AGREEMENT** between SFA – Carson Power Plant and SRCSD. This agreement covers the terms and conditions of the sale of digester gas from the SRCSD to SFA and the sale of steam from SFA to SRCSD.

![DRAFT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=DRAFT)

**THERMAL ENERGY SALES AND SUBLEASE AGREEMENT** between SFA – Carson Power Plant and Glacier Ice. This agreement covers the terms and conditions of energy sales from SFA to Glacier Ice. In September 2016, the second amendment to this agreement was signed wherein SFA replaced the steam driven refrigeration equipment with electrically driven motors. The electrification project was completed in February 2017.

**STEAM SALES AGREEMENT** between SMUD and Procter & Gamble, and Steam Services Agreement assigning SMUD’s rights to SFA. These agreements cover the terms and conditions of steam sales from SFA to Procter & Gamble.

**NATURAL GAS PRICES** are based on SMUD’s actual costs obligated to firm natural gas purchases and estimates for the non-firm portion prepared by SMUD’s Energy Trading & Contracts group. The variable rate is based on the latest available Petroleum Industry Research Associates forecast of commodity prices by month for 2025, plus 3.2% fuel use. The fixed component represents SFA’s pro rata share of fixed capacity costs on the Alberta Gas Company/NOVA Corporation of Alberta/Pacific Gas Transmission Company (ANG/NOVA/PGT) interstate pipelines, and its pro rata share of depreciation, interest, and O&M costs on SMUD’s ownership interest in the Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) Line 300/401 interstate pipeline and SMUD’s local gas pipeline. The monthly prices are shown on the Operating Assumptions page.

**FIXED OPERATING FEE** to be paid from SFA to Ethos is based on the flat annual base operating fee per the O&M Agreement. This payment is assumed to cover all direct and indirect labor costs, including benefits, tax, insurance, home office support, management and supervision incurred by Ethos. This payment escalates in future years at 2.5% per year in accordance with the existing O&M Agreement.

**REIMBURSABLE & MAINTENANCE OVERHAUL OPERATING COSTS** to be paid from SFA to Ethos are based on estimated variable plant operating costs, excluding fuel, to be incurred by Ethos in 2025.

# 2025 SFA – THERMAL FLEET BUDGET

## LINE-ITEM DETAIL

### FUEL
This schedule shows details of the budgeted expenses for fuel to be burned at each plant.

### OPERATION & MAINTENANCE
- **OPERATOR FEES & BONUSES:** The budget for operator fees and plant operating expenses represents fees to be paid to Ethos under the terms of the O&M Agreement, plus actual plant operating expenses incurred by Ethos and reimbursed from SFA without markup. The budget shows the portion paid to Ethos as an operating expense. Under the terms of the O&M Agreement, Ethos is reimbursed for all plant operating and maintenance expenses, and repairs. Ethos will earn performance bonuses under the O&M Agreement if the combined cycle Equivalent Forced Outage Factor is less than five percent (5%). Ethos will also earn bonuses for maintaining a peaking plant successful call-up ratio based on how successfully the unit starts and generates electricity when needed. The 2025 budget assumes that Ethos will successfully earn these bonuses.

- **OPERATOR REIMBURSEABLE EXPENSES:** Under the terms of the O&M Agreement and PPA, various tests (heat rate, NDC, etc.) of plant operations may be required by SMUD or SFA during the year. This line item covers the estimated reimbursement to Ethos for performing such tests, or for other items not covered by the O&M Agreement.

- **OPERATING EXPENSES:** This represents the estimated cost of various expenses required to keep the plants within operational expectations. This includes Water/Sewage, Station Service Electricity, and the Site Lease.

### ADMINISTRATION & GENERAL COSTS
Under the terms of the JPA, SMUD will provide staff to perform administrative and technical support services to SFA and arrange for insurance coverage, and SMUD will be reimbursed for the cost of providing these services subject to available funds per the priority of distribution of SFA revenues. SMUD will contract with engineering specialists to assist in technical engineering and regulatory compliance issues which arise during operation. Also, SFA retains the services of an Independent Auditor to audit and certify the SFA financial statements and evaluate internal controls applicable to SFA.
