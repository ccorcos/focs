# Procurement strategy

- Proposals were originally solicited by RFP and awarded to the two highest evaluated Proposers, Wright Tree Service of the West, Inc. and The Original Mowbray’s Tree Service.

- This contract change will bridge the gap until new contracts are sourced through a competitive process this year.
