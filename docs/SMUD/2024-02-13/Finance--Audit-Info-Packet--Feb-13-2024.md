**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and execute a three-year contract renewal and expansion to $250 million with Bank of America, N.A. (BANA) for a Letter of Credit (BANA LOC) that supports the outstanding Commercial Paper Series M, with terms substantially similar to the attached term sheet.  

**Summary:**  
SMUD currently has a $400 million commercial paper/line of credit program which provides a funding mechanism for SMUD’s capital program, and a source of liquidity, without the long lead time needed for a bond issuance. This program consists of contracts with three counterparties, one of which is BANA. This proposed contract will modify the current contract with BANA, which is for $150 million and expires in February 2025, and will increase and extend that contract to $250 million expiring in 2027. This will expand the program to a total of $500 million.  

**Board Policy:**  
Strategic Direction SD-3, Access to Credit Markets  

**Benefits:**  
The letter of credit provides liquidity and funding to support SMUD’s capital program.  

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
Fees and expenses are estimated to be an additional $1.97 million over the life of the contract expansion and are included in budget forecasts.  

**Alternatives:**  
Issue fixed rate debt/bonds at a higher borrowing cost and with a longer lead time.

(i) Defined Terms. As used in this Section 1.1:

(A) “Letter of Credit Fee Rate” shall mean the rate per annum corresponding to the Rating (as defined below), as specified in the applicable Level in the below applicable pricing matrix for each day in the related fee period.

(B) “Stated Amount” shall mean the Original Stated Amount (i) less the amount of all prior reductions pursuant to drawings with respect to the payment at maturity of the principal of and interest at maturity of the Notes, (ii) less the amount of any reduction thereof pursuant to a reduction certificate in the form of Annex B to the Letter of Credit, (iii) plus the amount of all reinstatements as provided in the Letter of Credit.

(ii) For the period commencing on February [__], 2024 to but excluding April 1, 2025, the Letter of Credit Fees shall be an amount equal to the product of (i) the Letter of Credit Fee Rate determined in accordance with the pricing matrix set forth below, times (ii) the Stated Amount (without regard to any reduction of the Stated Amount subject to reinstatement) for each day in the related fee period.

| LEVEL | MOODY’S RATING | S&P RATING | FITCH RATING | LETTER OF CREDIT FEE RATE |
|-------|----------------|------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| Level 1 | Aa3 or above | AA- or above | AA- or above | 0.29% |
| Level 2 | A1 | A+ | A+ | 0.39% |
| Level 3 | A2 | A | A | 0.49% |
| Level 4 | A3 | A- | A- | 0.59% |
| Level 5 | Baa1 | BBB+ | BBB+ | 0.69% |
| Level 6 | Baa2 | BBB | BBB | 0.79% |

| Level 2 | A1 | A+ | A+ | 0.42% |
<!-- Page 23 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**MOODY’S** | **FITCH** | **LETTER OF CREDIT**  
**LEVEL** | **RATING** | **S&P RATING** | **RATING** | **FEE RATE**  
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---  
Level 3 | A2 | A | A | 0.52%  
Level 4 | A3 | A- | A- | 0.62%  
Level 5 | Baa1 | BBB+ | BBB+ | 0.72%

Level 7 | Baa3 | BBB- | BBB- | 0.92%  

The following paragraphs shall apply to all pricing matrices set forth above. The term “Rating” as used herein shall mean the long-term unenhanced debt rating assigned by Moody’s, Fitch and S&P to any Debt of SMUD secured by or payable from Net Revenues on a parity with Bonds and Parity Bonds. In the event of a split rating (i.e., the Rating of one of the Rating Agencies’ is different than the Rating of any of the other Rating Agencies), the Letter of Credit Fee Rate shall be based upon the Level in which the lowest of the two highest Ratings appears (for the avoidance of doubt, Level 7 is the Level with the lowest Ratings and Level 1 is the Level with the highest Ratings for purposes of the above pricing grids). In the event that less than three Rating Agencies then assign a long-term unenhanced debt rating to Bonds and Parity Bonds, the Letter of Credit Fee Rate shall be based upon the Level in which the lower Rating appears. Any change in the Letter of Credit Fee Rate resulting from a change in a Rating shall be deemed effective as of and on the date of the announcement of the change in such Rating. References to ratings levels above are references to rating categories as presently determined by the Rating Agencies and in the event of adoption of any new or changed rating system, including, without limitation, any recalibration or realignment of Rating in connection with the adoption of a “global” rating scale, the rating from the Rating Agency in question referred to above shall be deemed to refer to the rating category under the new rating system that most closely approximates the applicable rating category as currently in effect. In the event that a Rating is suspended or withdrawn (for the avoidance of doubt, a decision by SMUD to cause a Rating Agency to no longer maintain its Rating, for non-credit related reasons and not for the purpose of avoiding the occurrence of an event of default, shall not constitute a suspension or withdrawal of such Rating) from any Rating Agency or upon the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Letter of Credit Fee Rate shall increase to the sum of the Letter of Credit Fee Rate specified above for Level 7 in the applicable pricing matrix above plus 1.50% per annum. The Letter of Credit Fees shall be payable as set forth above, together with interest on the Letter of Credit Fees from the date payment is due until payment in full at the Default Rate.

For the avoidance of doubt, at all times prior to February [ __ ], 2024, the Letter of Credit Fees shall be payable and determined in accordance with the Existing Fee Letter.

**Section 1.2. Annual Draw Fee.** SMUD hereby agrees to pay to the Bank a non-refundable draw fee of $2,000, which shall be paid annually in advance within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice from the Bank.

**Section 1.3. Amendment Fee.** SMUD hereby agrees to pay to the Bank on the date of any amendment, modification or supplement to the Agreement, the Letter of Credit or this Fee Letter or in connection with any amendment to any Program Document which requires a waiver from, or the consent of, the Bank, a non-refundable amendment fee in an amount equal to $2,500, plus the reasonable fees of any legal counsel retained by the Bank in connection therewith.

**Section 1.4. Transfer Fee.** SMUD hereby agrees to pay to the Bank on the date of each transfer of the Letter of Credit to a successor Depositary, a non-refundable transfer fee in an amount equal to $2,500, plus the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Bank in connection therewith.

**Section 1.5. Termination Fee; Reduction Fee.** (a) SMUD hereby agrees to pay to the Bank a termination fee in connection with any termination or replacement of the Letter of Credit by SMUD prior to February 21, 2025, in an amount equal to the difference between (A) the product of (i) the Letter of Credit Fee Rate in effect on the date of such termination or replacement under the applicable pricing matrix above, (ii) the Stated Amount in effect as of the Second Amendment Effective Date and (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of days from and including the date of such termination or replacement to and including February 21, 2025, and the denominator of which is 360, and (B) any amount paid to the Bank pursuant to Section 1.5(b) hereof (the “Termination Fee”), payable on the date of such termination or replacement; provided, however, that no such Termination Fee shall be payable if (i) the short-term unenhanced ratings of the Bank are reduced below “P-1” (or its equivalent), “A-1” (or its equivalent) or “F1” (or its equivalent), by any two of Moody’s, S&P or Fitch, respectively; (ii) the Notes are refinanced in full from the proceeds of fixed rate long-term debt issuance or a source of funds which, in either case, does not involve the issuance by a bank or other financial institution of a letter of credit, liquidity facility, or credit facility or a direct purchase of such debt by a bank or other financial institution; or (iii) the Bank imposes on SMUD increased costs pursuant to Section 2.14 of the Agreement; provided that this clause (ii) shall not be construed to relieve SMUD of any of its obligations under Section 2.14 of the Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything set forth herein or in the Agreement to the contrary, SMUD agrees not to permanently reduce the Stated Amount below the Stated Amount in effect as of the Second Amendment Effective Date prior to February 21, 2025, without the payment by SMUD to the Bank of a reduction fee in connection with each and every permanent reduction of the Stated Amount in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Letter of Credit Fee Rate in effect under the applicable pricing matrix above on the date of such reduction, (ii) the difference between the Stated Amount (without regard to any reduction of the Stated Amount subject to reinstatement) prior to such reduction and the Stated Amount (without regard to any reduction of the Stated Amount subject to reinstatement) after such reduction, and (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of days from and including the date of such reduction to and including February 21, 2025, and the denominator of which is 360 (the “Reduction Fee”); provided, however, that no such Reduction Fee shall be payable if (i) the short-term unenhanced ratings of the Bank are reduced below “P-1” (or its equivalent), “A-1” (or its equivalent) or “F1” (or its equivalent), by any two of Moody’s, S&P or Fitch, respectively; (ii) the Notes are refinanced in full from the proceeds of fixed rate long-term debt issuance or a source of funds which, in either case, does not involve the issuance by a bank or other financial institution.

institution of a letter of credit, liquidity facility, or credit facility or a direct purchase of such debt by a bank or other financial institution; or (iii) the Bank imposes on SMUD increased costs pursuant to Section 2.14 of the Agreement; provided that this clause (iii) shall not be construed to relieve SMUD of any of its obligations under Section 2.14 of the Agreement.

![SUMMARY](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SUMMARY)

**SUMMARY**

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) was formed by vote of the electors in 1923 under provisions of the California Municipal Utility District Act (Division 6 of the California Public Utilities Code) (the “Act”). The Act provides SMUD with broad powers to acquire, construct, own and operate works for the supplying of light, water, heat, power, communications, transportation and other services for its inhabitants. The Act also confers upon SMUD the necessary rights and powers for the conduct of business, including the right to sue and be sued, to exercise the power of eminent domain, to enter into contracts of all kinds, to take property and construct works, to fix rates and charges for commodities or services furnished, to incur indebtedness and issue bonds or other obligations and to invest its funds.

SMUD owns and operates an integrated electric system that includes generation, transmission and distribution facilities. SMUD’s headquarters are located in the city of Sacramento (the “City”) and its service area of approximately 900 square miles includes the principal parts of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. The service area includes the state capital, the City, the populous areas principally to the northeast and south of the City and the agricultural areas to the north and south. The City is located 85 miles northeast of San Francisco.

The Commercial Paper Notes, Series M consisting of Subseries M-1 and Subseries M-2 (the “Subseries M-1 Notes” and the “Subseries M-2 Notes” and, collectively, the “Notes”) are secured by a package of Available Revenues, as described herein and supported by an irrevocable, transferable, direct-pay letter of credit, as amended (the “Letter of Credit”) in substantially the form attached hereto as Appendix A and issued by Bank of America, N.A. (the “Bank”) pursuant to a Reimbursement Agreement between SMUD and the Bank, dated as of February 1, 2019, as amended (the “Reimbursement Agreement”). The Bank has issued the Letter of Credit in the aggregate maximum stated amount of $256,164,384 (consisting of $250,000,000 principal plus ninety (90) days interest calculated at a rate of 10% per annum assuming a 365-day year). The Notes will be issued in book-entry form through the Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). See “The Commercial Paper Notes” herein.

This material relating to SMUD is for general informational purposes. While SMUD considers the material relating to SMUD reliable, SMUD does not represent that it is a complete and accurate disclosure of the facts pertaining to SMUD. Investors are expected to base their investment decisions solely on the liquidity and credit support provided by the Bank, rather than the financial and operating history of SMUD, which this Commercial Paper Memorandum does not purport to fully disclose. Additional information about SMUD is available from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board’s (the “MSRB”) Electronic Municipal Access System (“EMMA”). See also “Additional Information” herein.

If for any reason the Bank fails to honor a properly presented and conforming drawing under the Letter of Credit, SMUD cannot provide any assurance that it will have sufficient funds on hand and available to make such payment of principal and/or interest on the Notes supported by the Letter of Credit or to make such payments in a timely manner.

**Prospective investors should therefore base their investment decision primarily on the credit of the Bank, rather than on that of SMUD.**

BofA Securities, Inc., as dealer of the Notes (the “Dealer”) has provided the following sentence for inclusion in this Commercial Paper Memorandum. The Dealer has reviewed the information in this Commercial Paper Memorandum in accordance with, and as part of, its responsibilities to investors under the federal securities law as applied to the facts and circumstances of this transaction, but the Dealer does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information.

SMUD is issuing the Notes pursuant to (a) Articles 6a and 6b of Chapter 6 of the Act (California Public Utilities Code Section 12850 et seq.), (b) Chapter 7.5 of the Act (California Public Utilities Code Section 13371 et seq.) and (c) Article 11 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the California Government Code (California Government Code Section 53580 et seq.). Resolution No. 19-02-02 of SMUD, adopted on February 21, 2019, as supplemented and amended by Resolution No. 22-02-06 of SMUD, adopted on February 17, 2022, and by Resolution No. 24-02-__ of SMUD, adopted on February 15, 2024 (collectively, the “Resolution”), provides that Notes may be outstanding in an aggregate principal amount that does not exceed $250,000,000. The proceeds of the Notes may be used by SMUD to finance or refinance capital improvements, certain costs associated with the purchase of fuel, facilities design, site preparation, the acquisition of equipment, and to pay maturing Notes.

The Notes are secured by a pledge of Available Revenues and supported by the Letter of Credit. The Letter of Credit has been issued pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement. Available Revenues of SMUD are composed of net revenues of SMUD after payment of operating, maintenance, and purchased power expenses, Rate Stabilization Fund deposits, and debt service and reserves on SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds and Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds, all as provided in the Resolution.

The Notes will be issued as book-entry obligations evidenced by a master note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee. The Notes may be issued in denominations of $100,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess of $100,000, with interest payable at maturity, and shall mature on such dates as SMUD may establish, provided that no Note shall mature more than 270 days from the date of issuance thereof. Subseries M-1 Notes shall bear interest on the basis of a 365- or 366-day year, as applicable, and the actual number of days elapsed and Subseries M-2 Notes shall bear interest on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. The Notes are payable at the principal office of U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association (the “Depositary”).

Pursuant to the Depositary Agreement relating to the Notes, dated February 28, 2019 (the “Depositary Agreement”), between SMUD and the Depositary, the Depositary is not permitted to authenticate and deliver any Note if, immediately after the authentication and delivery thereof, the aggregate face amount of the Outstanding Notes plus the maximum amount of interest which may accrue thereon would exceed the aggregate Letter of Credit Stated Amount.

**BANK CREDIT ARRANGEMENT**

**Stated Amount and Term of the Letter of Credit.** Pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement, the Bank has issued to the Depositary the Letter of Credit in the aggregate maximum stated amount of $256,164,384 (consisting of $250,000,000 principal plus 90 days interest calculated at a rate of 10% per annum assuming a 365-day year) as reduced and reinstated from time to time in accordance with terms of the Letter of Credit (the “Letter of Credit Stated Amount”). The Letter of Credit’s stated expiration date is February [__], 20[__], unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, and unless such expiration date is extended by the Bank in accordance with the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement.

**Drawings under the Letter of Credit.** The Depositary is authorized to make drawings under the Letter of Credit in accordance with its terms. If demand for payment under the Letter of Credit is properly presented as provided therein and in conformity with the requirements thereof, payment shall be made by the Bank to the Depositary, in immediately available funds, at such times as provided in and in accordance with the provisions of the Letter of Credit. All payments made by the Bank under the Letter of Credit shall be made with the Bank’s own funds.

If for any reason the Bank fails to honor a properly presented and conforming drawing under the Letter of Credit, SMUD cannot provide any assurance that it will have sufficient funds on hand and available to make such payment of principal and/or interest on the Notes supported by the Letter of Credit or to make such payments in a timely manner. Prospective investors should therefore base their investment decision primarily on the credit of the Bank, rather than on that of SMUD.

**Reimbursement of Drawings under the Letter of Credit.** Drawings made under the Letter of Credit to pay interest due on the Notes are required to be reimbursed by SMUD on the date of such drawing. Drawings made under the Letter of Credit to pay the principal of the Notes if not reimbursed by SMUD in full on the date of such drawing will, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions of the Reimbursement Agreement, automatically convert to and constitute and advance made by the Bank to SMUD (an “Advance”) to be paid in installments on (a) the first business day to occur on or after the six (6) month anniversary of the date the related Advance is made and the first business day of each sixth (6th) calendar month occurring thereafter prior to the related Amortization End Date and (b) the related Amortization End Date. The “Amortization End Date” means, with respect to any Advance, the earliest to occur of: (i) the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date on which the related Advance was made, (ii) the date on which an Alternate Letter of Credit (defined herein) becomes effective in substitution of the Letter of Credit with respect to the Notes, and (iii) the date on which the Letter of Credit Stated Amount is permanently reduced to zero or the Letter of Credit is otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms prior to its stated expiration date.

![Events of Default under the Reimbursement Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Events+of+Default+under+the+Reimbursement+Agreement)

**Events of Default under the Reimbursement Agreement.** The Reimbursement Agreement contains certain events of default by SMUD, including, but not limited to, an event of default under the Program Documents, the Master Bond Resolution or the Subordinate Bond Resolution (each as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement), a failure by SMUD to reimburse the Bank for a drawing under the Letter of Credit when due under the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement or a payment default or certain other defaults with respect to certain other obligations of SMUD, subject to such grace periods as are provided for in the Reimbursement Agreement, material misrepresentation or breach of covenant by SMUD, subject to such grace periods as are provided for in the Reimbursement Agreement, voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency of SMUD, or the downgrade by any Rating Agency (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) of its long-term unenhanced rating with respect to any Bonds (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) to a level below “Baa3” (or its equivalent) in the case of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., “BBB-” (or its equivalent) in the case of Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services or “BBB-” (or its equivalent) in the case of Fitch, Inc.

**Remedies under the Reimbursement Agreement.** Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under the Reimbursement Agreement, the Bank may, but is not obligated to (i) declare all Obligations (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) to be immediately due and payable, (ii) deliver to the Depositary a “No-Issuance Notice” under the terms of the Letter of Credit stating the amount of the then outstanding Notes supported by the Letter of Credit and/or terminate the Letter of Credit Stated Amount as the then outstanding Notes are paid, (iii) issue the “Final Drawing Notice” to the Depositary, the effect of which shall be to cause the termination of the Letter of Credit to occur on the 15th day after the date of receipt thereof by the Depositary or (iv) pursue such other remedies as are available to it at law or in equity.

Upon the issuance of a Final Drawing Notice by the Bank, the Depositary is required to draw upon the Letter of Credit in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes then outstanding as the same become due.

**ALTERNATE LETTER OF CREDIT**

Pursuant to the terms of the Resolution, SMUD may elect to replace the Letter of Credit with one or more letters of credit issued by a commercial bank or financial institution (or a syndicate of such institutions acting jointly or severally), delivered to the Depositary pursuant to the Depositary Agreement and conforming to the requirements of the Resolution (the “Alternate Letter of Credit”). SMUD shall give written notice of its intention to exercise such election to the Depositary, not fewer than ten (10) days prior to the proposed date upon which an Alternate Letter of Credit is to become effective (the “Substitution Date”). No substitution of an Alternate Letter of Credit for the Letter of Credit shall occur unless all Notes outstanding on the Substitution Date are either (1) paid from the proceeds of the Notes issued on the Substitution Date or (2) paid from the proceeds of a drawing under the Letter of Credit and cancelled.

THE DEALER

SMUD has appointed BofA Securities, Inc. (the “Dealer”) as a dealer for SMUD in connection with the offering, issuance and sale of the Notes pursuant to a Dealer Agreement, dated February 28, 2019, as amended (the “Dealer Agreement”), between SMUD and the Dealer. SMUD agrees to pay to the Dealer a fee in an amount as set forth in the Dealer Agreement.

The Dealer Agreement may be terminated by the Dealer or SMUD at any time on written notice given no less than ten (10) business days prior to such termination date; provided, however, that upon the mutual agreement, such written notice may be given fewer than ten (10) business days prior to such termination date.

The Dealer, in its individual capacity, may in good faith buy, sell, own, hold and deal in any of the Notes, including, without limitation, any Notes offered and sold by the Dealer pursuant to the Dealer Agreement, and may join in any action which any owner of the Notes may be entitled to take with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity under such Agreement. The Dealer may sell any of the Notes in the secondary market at prices above or below par, at any time. The Dealer, however, is not obligated to purchase any Notes for its own account at any time. The Dealer, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, and its affiliates may also engage in or be interested in any financial or other transaction with SMUD and may act as depositary, account party, or agent for any committee or body of owners of the Notes or other obligations of SMUD as freely as if it did not act in any capacity under the Dealer Agreement.

The Dealer and its affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Under certain circumstances, the Dealer and its affiliates may have certain creditor and/or other rights against SMUD in connection with such activities. In the various course of their various business.

activities, the Dealer and its affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of SMUD (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with SMUD. The Dealer and its affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities and instruments.

The Dealer, which is serving as the dealer for the Notes, and the Bank, which is providing the Letter of Credit for the Notes, are affiliates. The activities of the Dealer and the Bank are unrelated to and independent of each other. By purchasing a Note, the purchaser thereof consents to any conflict of interest that could exist by reason of the different capacities in which the Dealer, the Bank and any other potential affiliate provides services in connection with the Notes.

The Dealer and its affiliates, including the Bank, may provide services to SMUD from time to time unrelated to the offering of the Notes.

TAX MATTERS

Subseries M-1 Notes

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, bond counsel to SMUD (“Bond Counsel”), based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings, and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes will be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and will be exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes will not be a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations will not be excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. The amount treated as interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes and excluded from gross income will depend upon the taxpayer’s election under Internal Revenue Notice 94-84. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Subseries M-1 Notes. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in Appendix B.

The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the Subseries M-1 Notes. SMUD has made certain representations and covenanted to comply with certain restrictions, conditions and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes will not be included in federal gross income. Inaccuracy of these
<!-- Page 40 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page) 

representations or failure to comply with these covenants may result in interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the Subseries M-1 Notes. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants. Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken) or events occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond Counsel’s attention after the date of issuance of the Subseries M-1 Notes may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the Subseries M-1 Notes. Accordingly, the opinion of Bond Counsel is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon in connection with any such actions, events or matters.

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes will be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and will be exempt from State of California personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of amounts treated as interest on, the Subseries M-1 Notes may otherwise affect a beneficial owner’s federal, state or local tax liability. The nature and extent of these other tax consequences will depend upon the particular tax status of the beneficial owner or the beneficial owner’s other items of income or deduction. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences.

Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Code or court decisions may cause interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes to be subject, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to federal income taxation or to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent beneficial owners from realizing the full tax benefit of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals or clarification of the Code or court decisions may also affect, perhaps significantly, the market price for, or marketability of, the Subseries M-1 Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Subseries M-1 Notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential impact of any pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, and regarding the impact of future legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment of the Subseries M-1 Notes for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of SMUD, or about the effect of future changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the IRS. SMUD has covenanted, however, to comply with the requirements of the Code.

Bond Counsel’s engagement with respect to the Subseries M-1 Notes ends with the delivery of its opinion, and, unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to defend SMUD or the beneficial owners regarding the tax-exempt status of the Subseries M-1 Notes in the event of an audit examination by the IRS. Under current procedures, beneficial owners would have little, if any, right to participate in the audit examination process. Moreover, because achieving judicial review in connection with an audit examination of tax-exempt obligations is
<!-- Page 41 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

Payments on the Subseries M-1 Notes generally will be subject to U.S. information reporting and possibly to “backup withholding.” Under Section 3406 of the Code and applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, a non-corporate beneficial owner of Subseries M-1 Notes may be subject to backup withholding with respect to “reportable payments,” which include interest paid on the Subseries M-1 Notes and the gross proceeds of a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of the Subseries M-1 Notes. The payor will be required to deduct and withhold the prescribed amounts if (i) the payee fails to furnish a U.S. taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) to the payor in the manner required, (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect, (iii) there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in Section 3406(c) of the Code or (iv) the payee fails to certify under penalty of perjury that the payee is not subject to withholding under Section 3406(a)(1)(C) of the Code. Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a beneficial owner’s federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Certain beneficial owners (including among others, corporations and certain tax-exempt organizations) are not subject to backup withholding. The failure to comply with the backup withholding rules may result in the imposition of penalties by the IRS.

### Subseries M-2 Notes

**State of California Income Tax Considerations.** In the opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Subseries M-2 Notes is exempt from State of California personal income taxes.

**Certain United States Federal Tax Considerations.** Interest on the Subseries M-2 Notes is not excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes.

Prospective investors that are not individuals or regular C corporations who are U.S. persons purchasing the Subseries M-2 Notes for investment should consult their own tax advisors as to any tax consequences to them from the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Subseries M-2 Notes.

### RATINGS

Each rating below reflects only the view of the ratings service issuing such rating and is not a recommendation by such rating services to purchase, sell or hold the obligations to which such rating applies or as to the market price or suitability of such obligations for a particular investor. An explanation of the significance of a rating may be obtained from the ratings service issuing such rating. There is no assurance that any rating will continue for any period of time or

### DTC’S BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM

Each subseries of the Notes will be evidenced by a single master note (each a “Master Note” and, collectively, the “Master Notes”) registered in the name of a nominee of DTC. The Master Notes will be deposited with the Depositary as custodian for DTC. DTC will record, by appropriate entries on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the amounts payable in respect of the Notes. Payments by DTC participants to purchasers for whom a DTC participant is acting as agent in respect of Notes will be governed by the standing instructions and customary practices under which securities are held at DTC through DTC participants.

### LITIGATION

There is no litigation now pending or, to the knowledge of SMUD, threatened against SMUD which restrains or enjoins the issuance or delivery of the Notes or the use of the proceeds of the Notes or which questions or contests the validity of the Notes or the proceedings and authority under which they are to be issued, executed and delivered. To the knowledge of SMUD, neither the creation, organization, nor existence of SMUD, nor the title of the present members or other officials of SMUD to their respective offices, is being currently contested or questioned.

### CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS

The validity of the Notes and certain other legal matters are subject to the approving opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to SMUD. A complete copy of the proposed form of Bond Counsel opinion is contained in Appendix B. Bond Counsel undertakes no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of this Commercial Paper Memorandum. Certain legal matters will be passed upon for the Bank by Chapman and Cutler LLP.

**PROPOSED FORM OF OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL**

[Closing Date]  
Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
Sacramento, California  

Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
Commercial Paper Notes, Series M  
(Final Opinion)  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as bond counsel to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) in connection with the authorization of the issuance of up to $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount (at any time Outstanding) of commercial paper notes by SMUD, pursuant to Resolution No. 19-02-02, adopted by SMUD on February 21, 2019, as supplemented by Resolution No. 22-02-06, adopted by SMUD on February 17, 2022, and by Resolution No. 24-02-[__], adopted by SMUD on February 15, 2024 (collectively, the “Resolution”), and designated Sacramento Municipal Utility District Commercial Paper Notes, Subseries M-1 (the “Subseries M-1 Notes”) and Subseries M-2 (the “Subseries M-2 Notes” and, together with the Subseries M-1 Notes, the “Notes”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Resolution.

In such connection, we have reviewed the Resolution; the Tax Certificate of SMUD, dated the date hereof (the “Tax Certificate”); the Depositary Agreement, dated February 28, 2019 (the “Depositary Agreement”), between SMUD and the Depositary; an opinion of counsel to SMUD; certificates of SMUD, the Depositary and others; and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after the date hereof before or after Notes are issued. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted to occur or any other matters come to our attention after the date hereof. Accordingly, this letter speaks only as of its date and is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon or otherwise used in connection with any such actions, events or matters. We disclaim any obligation to update this letter. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures provided to us and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than SMUD. We have assumed, without undertaking to verify, the accuracy (as of the date hereof and as of each date of issuance from time to time of the Notes) of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents, and of the legal conclusions contained in the opinion, referred to in the second paragraph hereof. Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in the Resolution and the Tax Certificate, including (without limitation) covenants and agreements compliance with which is necessary to assure that future actions, omissions or events will not cause interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly retroactive to the date on  

B-1

which the first Subseries M-1 Notes were issued. We call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the Notes, the Resolution and the Tax Certificate and their enforceability may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against governmental entities such as SMUD in the State of California. We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any opinion with respect to the state or quality of title to or interest in any of the property described in or subject to the lien of the Resolution or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description contained therein of, or the remedies available to enforce liens on, any such property. Our services did not include financial or other non-legal advice. Finally, we undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Commercial Paper Memorandum or other offering material relating to the Notes and express no view with respect thereto.

Based on and subject to the foregoing and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the following opinions:

1. The Resolution has been duly adopted by SMUD and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of SMUD.

2. The Notes, when duly issued from time to time in the form authorized by and otherwise in compliance with the Resolution, executed by an Authorized Officer and authenticated by the Depositary against payment therefor, will constitute the valid and binding limited obligations of SMUD.

3. Interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes, when issued in accordance with the Resolution and the Tax Certificate, will be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amount treated as interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes and excluded from gross income will depend on the taxpayer’s election under Internal Revenue Service Notice 94-84. Interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. We observe that interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Interest on the Notes, when issued in accordance with the Resolution and the Tax Certificate, is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. We observe that interest on the Subseries M-2 Notes is not excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Notes.

**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and award a sole source Master Services Agreement with Iron Networked Solutions, Inc. (“Itron”) to purchase hardware, software, and professional services to enhance the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) platform for an amount not to exceed $42.5 million.  

**Summary:**  
The AMI platform is comprised of communication infrastructure equipment (smart meters), a communication network and back-office systems, which was originally implemented in 2009 and partially funded by SMUD’s SmartSacramento Smart Grid Investment Grant.  

During 2021 and 2022, as part of SMUD’s Next Generation AMI Roadmap, use cases supporting the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan (ZCP) were analyzed. The AMI Roadmap identified the need for generation of smart meters as a key enabling technology required to support many of the use cases under the ZCP as they provide advanced functionality and additional data granularity. In October 2023, SMUD was awarded a $50 million grant from the Department of Energy Grid Deployment Office’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program, and Itron was identified as a named partner for new technologies to increase reliability, efficiency, and flexibility of the electric grid. Itron was selected as a partner since they are the only manufacturer with a commercially available next generation Distributed Intelligence (DI) enabled smart meter and associated DI applications deployed at scale that are compatible with our existing AMI network. As part of the grant, SMUD will deploy 200,000 Itron Riva edge computing sensors with measurement capabilities (smart meters) and eight (8) DI applications with deployment beginning in September 2024 and continuing through the end of 2025. The GRIP grant is SMUD’s first step in our journey to life cycle our meters, replacing 200,000 meters by the end of 2025, as SMUD’s existing smart meters are nearing their end of design life. This contract will allow SMUD to move forward with ordering meters, software, and professional services to meet the GRIP grant deployment schedule for 2025 and beyond. In Q4 2023, SMUD obtained Board approval to execute a bridge sole source agreement with Itron for the initial purchase of the meters due to global supply chain lead time constraints of 12+ months. As previously communicated, SMUD is now seeking Board approval to negotiate and award a subsequent master agreement with Itron to purchase the remainder of the meters, software, and professional services.  

Because Itron manufactures the only commercially available DI enabled meter that is compatible with our existing AMI mesh network and back-office systems and does not have any resellers, issuing a competitive solicitation would be an idle act.  

The Itron Riva edge computing sensors (smart meters) with measurement capabilities are priced competitively, within 11% on average compared to our existing legacy smart meters that lack the DI enabled capabilities. The cost per meter for the most common form factors is within 5% of their legacy smart meter equivalents. Costs for the software and professional services are found to be competitive when compared to other software products and associated professional services purchased by SMUD. Given this information paired with the fact that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has increased by 46% since the current contract was put in place, the proposed pricing is considered fair and reasonable.
<!-- Page 60 -->
Recommendation:  Award a Sole Source contract to:

**Itron Networked Solutions, Inc.**  
2111 North Molter Road  
Liberty Lake, WA 90919  

**Comments:** This will be a non-standard contract that is being negotiated by SMUD.

**Board Policy:**  
(Number & Title)  
Strategic Direction SD-4, Reliability; Strategic Direction SD-7, Environmental Leadership  

**Benefits:**  
Ability to continue purchasing the smart meters, associated software, and professional services required to enhance the AMI platform while also meeting supply chain lead time constraints and GRIP grant obligations.

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
$42.5 million; Budgeted by Information Technology.

**Alternatives:**  
If this contract is not approved, SMUD will not be able to fulfill the obligations proposed in the GRIP grant due to supply chain lead time constraints, which would not be in our best interest. Additionally, due to the proprietary nature of the products and services provided by Itron to support our existing network, issuing a competitive solicitation would be an idle act.

**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Approve an increase to the aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount for general line construction services by $12 million, from $44 million to $56 million, for Contract No. 4600001474 with Hot Line Construction Inc. and Contract No. 4600001475 with Mountain G Enterprises.  

**Summary:**  
The original contracts were awarded on a competitive basis to Hot Line Construction, Inc. and Mountain G Enterprises in March 2021 per Resolution No. 21-03-06. The original contract was awarded for the period from March 22, 2021, to March 21, 2023, for an aggregate not-to-exceed amount of $20 million. The work generally consists of overhead and underground line construction and maintenance on 12/21kV and 69kV sub transmission lines. In October 2022, Resolution No. 22-10-11 approved an increase to the aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount from $20 million to $40 million. Releasing the 10% contingency increased the not-to-exceed amount to $44 million.  

SMUD has been adversely affected by the labor climate induced by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) and their ongoing commitment to reduce wildfire risk across its service area. As a result, SMUD has lost contract crews that supported critical Line Assets programs. This loss has caused Line Assets to strategically realign its workload and the work performed by internal SMUD crews. Securing the services provided by Hot Line Construction Inc. and Mountain G Enterprises will allow the business unit the ability to augment general line construction work while maintaining flexibility in its realignment efforts.  

Additionally, the January 2023 Storm Event, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) labor increases, and Local Agency projects accelerated the contract spend rate resulting in a $12 million shortage of funding, which brings SMUD to request the Board to approve a $12 million increase to the aggregate not-to-exceed amount from $44 million to $56 million to support general line construction work planned through the end of this contract. Without the additional funding planned projects would be delayed resulting in customer impact. Currently, the contract balance is approximately $5,200,955.  

**Contract Change No. 01 to Contract No. 4600001474 with Hot Line Construction Inc. increased their rates by 7.14%. A portion (5.44%) of the increase accounted for labor as a direct result of Hot Line’s agreement with the IBEW 1245 that became effective on June 1, 2022. The remaining portion (1.7%) of the increase was for increased fuel costs since the time of bid. Additionally, this contract extended the expiration date to March 21, 2025.**  

**Contract Change No. 02 to Contract No. 4600001474 with Hot Line Construction Inc. increased rates to align with current published rates from Hot Line Construction Inc.’s IBEW 1245 Agreement for years 2023 and 2024.**  

**Contract Change No. 01 to Contract No. 4600001475 with Mountain G Enterprises increased Rate Schedule, Part B, Line Items 11 and 12 by ~36% and ~45%, respectively.**  
<!-- Page 63 -->
![Contract Actions](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Contract+Actions)

Contract Change No. 02 to Contract No. 4600001475 with Mountain G Enterprises added subcontractor, WBE Traffic Control Inc., to Exhibit 1 - Designation of Prime Contractor. Subcontractors and Suppliers to perform traffic control where lane closures and/or night work is required. WBE Traffic Control Inc. is a verified Supplier Education & Economic Development (SEED) vendor.

Contract Change No. 03 to Contract No. 4600001475 with Mountain G Enterprises increased their rates by 5.2% as a direct result of Mountain G Enterprises’ agreement with the IBEW 1245 that became effective on June 1, 2022. Additionally, this contract change extended the expiration date to March 21, 2025.

Contract Change No. 04 to Contract No. 4600001475 with Mountain G Enterprises modified invoicing terms from Net 45 days to Net 30 days and increased rates to align with current published rates from Mountain G Enterprises’s IBEW 1245 Agreement for years 2023 and 2024.

**Requested Action:**  
Approve an increase to the aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount for vegetation management utility line and subject pole clearance services by $10 million, from $171.6 million to $181.6 million for Contract No. 4600001364 with Wright Tree Service of the West, Inc. (Wright Contract) and Contract No. 4600001365 with The Original Mowbray’s Tree Service, Inc. (Mowbray Contract) (collectively, the “Contracts”).  

**Summary:**  
The Contracts were awarded on a competitive basis to The Original Mowbray’s Tree Service, Inc. (Mowbray’s) and Wright Tree Service of the West, Inc. (WTS) in March 2020 per Resolution No. 20-03-05. The Contracts were awarded for a three-year term starting March 25, 2020, with two optional one-year extensions for each contract for a total not-to-exceed aggregate amount of $156 million. The scope requires the contractors to provide all supervision, labor, materials, equipment, and incidentals necessary to perform right-of-way vegetation maintenance work on SMUD’s Transmission and Distribution Systems on a task order basis. In January 2024, the 10% allowable contingency ($15.6 million) was released to ensure the Contracts are fully funded.  

This Board action is requesting approval of an additional $10 million dollars to support SMUD’s routine maintenance Vegetation Management Program to ensure safety and reliability of SMUD’s electric system. The driver for the additional funding request was due to unplanned work as a result of the 2023/24 January storms series.  

The balance of funds available for continued work from the Contracts is approximately $27.5 million.  

Contract Change No. 01 to the Wright Contract replaced Exhibit D, Performance Bond and Exhibit E, Payment Bond forms with revised annual bond forms.  

Contract Change No. 01 to the Mowbray Contract added wildfire liability to $15M General Liability Insurance Requirements and reduced Rate Schedule Items 70 -79, 87-98, 100-103, and 105-106 by an average of 69% resulting in a total contract savings of 1% for the initial three-year term, and an additional 1% for each of the two option years. This contract change did not change the total not-to-exceed aggregate contract amount.  

Contract Change No. 02 to the Wright Contract added Skyline Tree Enterprise, Inc. as a designated subcontractor to assist WTS with the performance of utility line clearance services and added Sierra Integrated Services, Inc. as a designated subcontractor to perform pole clearing work via herbicide spraying.  

Contract Change No. 02 to the Mowbray Contract added subcontractor R&B Quality Tree Care, Inc. to Exhibit I, Designation of Prime Contractor, Subcontractors and Suppliers. Under this contract, R&B Quality Tree Care, Inc. was designated to perform vegetation management services under Mowbray’s. R&B Quality Tree Care, Inc. has an “A” grade in the International Suppliers Network (ISN). This change did not require any adjustment to the contract amount.
<!-- Page 66 -->
Contract Change No. 03 to the Wright Contract substituted Skyline Tree Enterprise, Inc. for Maximus Tree Works as the designated subcontractor to assist WTS with the performance of utility line clearance services.

Contract Change No. 03 to the Mowbray Contract adds subcontractor California Trees Inc. dba Cal Trees to Exhibit I, Designation of Prime Contractor, Subcontractors and Suppliers. Under this contract, Cal Trees was designated to perform vegetation management services under Mowbray’s. Cal Trees has an “A” grade in ISN. This change did not require any adjustment to the contract amount.

Contract Change No. 04 to the Wright Contract added subcontractors P31 Enterprises, Inc., VM Tree Service, and R&B Quality Tree Care, Inc. to Exhibit I, Designation of Prime Contractor, Subcontractors and Suppliers. Under this contract, P31 Enterprises, Inc., VM Tree Service, and R&B Quality Tree Care, Inc. were designated to perform vegetation management utility line clearance services under WTS. All three of these subcontractors have an “A” grade in ISN. This change did not require any adjustment to the contract amount.

Contract Change No. 04 to the Mowbray Contract revised the address and point of contact for Mowbray’s. This change did not require any adjustment to the contract amount.

Contract Change No. 05 to the Wright Contract included an increase in rates by 2.75%. SMUD Vegetation Management, Budget and Procurement staff had dialogue with representatives from both WTS and Mowbray’s regarding their request for labor-specific rate increases to the Contracts, driven by provisions of Senate Bill 247 (Dodd) Wildland fire prevention: vegetation management (SB 247) and the ratification of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Labor Agreement in July 2022 (IBEW Labor Agreement). Staff validated the increases for each year. The rate increases apply to Veg Mgmt. IBEW labor only. Contractors did not request increases in Fuel, Insurance, or Equipment.

Contract Change No. 05 to the Mowbray Contract increased rates by 2.8% in year 3 (retroactively effective as of June 1, 2022), 1.8% in option Year 4, and 1.7% in option Year 5, due to and driven by provisions of SB 247, and the related ratification of the IBEW Labor Agreement. Staff validated the increases for each year. The rate increases apply to Veg Mgmt. IBEW labor only. Contractors did not request increases in Fuel, Insurance, or Equipment.

Contract Change No. 06 to the Mowbray Contract extended the expiration date from March 23, 2023, to March 22, 2025 (exercising Option Years 1 and 2), and reduced rates across the majority of line items by an average of 3.8% in Option Year 1 (effective March 23, 2023), and by an average of 5.4% in Option Year 2 (effective March 23, 2024).

Contract Change No. 06 to the Wright Contract included an increase in rates on overtime equipment/operator line items. These increases align with the increases previously approved via CC-5.

Contract Change No. 07 to the Mowbray Contract removed Performance and Payment Bond Requirements.

Contract Change No. 07 to the Wright Contract extended the expiration date from March 23, 2023, to March 22, 2024 (exercising Option Year 1 only), and reduced rates to select line item by an average of 2.9% effective June 1, 2023.
