## Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership (GRIP) Grant:
- SMUD was recently awarded a $50 million grant from the Department of Energy (DOE) Grid Deployment Office’s GRIP program, and Itron was identified as a named partner, for new technologies to increase reliability, efficiency, and flexibility of the electric grid.
- As part of the grant, SMUD proposed to deploy 200,000 Itron Riva edge computing sensors with measurement capabilities (smart meters) and eight Distributed Intelligence (DI) applications to enable Grid Edge Intelligence with deployment beginning in September of 2024 and continuing through the end of 2025.

![Procurement strategy](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=Procurement+strategy)

To deliver on the 200,000-meter deployment schedule the following three-step procurement strategy was previously recommended:

**Step #1: Maximize existing Itron contract**  
Purchase ~6,000 meters to deliver in August 2024 to support installations planned for September 2024

**Step #2: New Itron bridge contract**  
Sole source contract to order ~70,000 meters needed for GRIP grant through January 2025  
This is the sole source contract action previously approved in December 2023 for a total of $15 million to ensure the grant project could commence

**Step #3: New master agreement with Itron**  
New contract for remaining hardware, software, and services needed for GRIP grant and ongoing legacy system needs  
This is the sole source contract action currently requested for $42.5 million
