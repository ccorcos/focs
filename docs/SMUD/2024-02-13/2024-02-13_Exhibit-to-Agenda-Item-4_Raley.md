# Procurement strategy

- Proposals were originally solicited in 2021 by Request for Proposal (RFP) and resulted in contract awards to the two highest evaluated and responsive Proposers, Hot Line Construction Inc. and Mountain G. Enterprises.

- This contract change will bridge the gap until new contracts are sourced through a competitive process this year.
