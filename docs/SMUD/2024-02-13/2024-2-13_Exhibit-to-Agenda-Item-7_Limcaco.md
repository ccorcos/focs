# December 2023 Energy Sources

- Hydro generation was 74% higher than budget in December, and 45% higher than budget year-to-date due to higher level of precipitation from last year’s water year.

- Thermal plants generation was 21% lower than budget in December due to unplanned outage, and 16% lower than budget year-to-date due to increased hydro generation.

- Net purchased power was 37% higher than budget in December due to decreased thermal generation and lower market prices, but 8% lower year-to-date due to increased hydro generation and reduced load.
