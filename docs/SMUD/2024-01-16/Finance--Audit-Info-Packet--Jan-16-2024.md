**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his delegate, to execute the third amendment to the California Oregon Transmission Project (COTP) Long-Term Layoff Agreement (Agreement) by and among the Transmission Agency of Northern California (TANC) and certain of its members, namely, SMUD, Modesto Irrigation District (MID), the Turlock Irrigation District (TID), the City of Palo Alto (Palo Alto), and the City of Roseville (Roseville), substantially in form attached, to extend the existing Agreement for an additional 10 years to January 31, 2034.  

**Summary:**  
Pursuant to Resolution No. 90-03-10, SMUD, Palo Alto, MID, Roseville, and TID are each Participants in and parties to TANC Project Agreement No. 3 (“TANC PA 3”), entered into March 1, 1990, for the funding, construction, and operation of the COTP.  

Pursuant to Resolution No. 09-01-05, SMUD entered into a Long-Term Layoff Agreement on February 1, 2009, with TANC and certain of its members, namely, Palo Alto, Roseville, MID, and TID wherein Palo Alto and Roseville laid off their entitlement to TANC’s Transfer Capability on the COTP associated with their participation percentages under TANC PA 3 to MID, TID, and SMUD for a 15-year term of the Agreement.  

In the Agreement, MID, Roseville, TID, and SMUD accepted and assumed all of Palo Alto and Roseville’s participation percentages under TANC PA 3 for the term of the Agreement, with SMUD acquiring 35 MW of capacity in the north-to-south direction and 27 MW in the south-to-north direction on the COTP.  

Pursuant to Resolution No. 14-04-08, SMUD executed Amendment No. 1 to the Agreement effective July 1, 2014, which returned Roseville’s COTP interests, rights, and obligations from MID, TID, and SMUD back to Roseville, and clarified Palo Alto’s voting rights under TANC PA 3.  

SMUD executed Amendment No. 2 to the Agreement on May 26, 2016, pursuant to authorization under Resolution No. 14-04-08, which provided that in the absence of a default by MID, TID, and SMUD, Debt Service for the 2016A Bonds and any extension thereof associated with Palo Alto’s 3.6815 participation percentage in TANC’s entitlement to transfer capability on the COTP would be paid by MID, TID, and SMUD.  

The Parties have negotiated on this Amendment No. 3 to extend the Agreement for an additional 10 years to January 31, 2034 to ensure that all of Palo Alto’s interests, rights, and obligations associated with its participation percentage under TANC PA 3 continue to be laid off to MID, TID, and SMUD (with SMUD maintaining 22 MW north-to-south and 17 MW south-to-north transfer capability) for the extended term of the Agreement and to add an annual market payment to Palo Alto from MID, TID, and SMUD. This Amendment No. 3, by modifying the term of the Agreement, will also extend the term of Roseville’s layoff of its South of Tesla (“SOT”) allocation, originally described in Section 4 of the Agreement.  

The Agreement will expire on January 31, 2024, if this Amendment Number 3 is not approved.

**Board Policy:** Strategic Direction SD-2, Competitive Rates; Strategic Direction SD-4, Reliability, Strategic Direction SD-9, Resource Planning  

**Benefits:**  
SMUD will maintain 22 MW north-to-south and 17 MW south-to-north of additional transmission capacity on the COTP. The Amendment will enable SMUD to continue to import additional amounts of Northwest Power from outside the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) grid, avoid the associated CAISO fees, enhance SMUD's import reliability through the purchase of more firm energy, and provide an opportunity for SMUD to pursue additional long-term renewable power supply agreements with projects located in northern California or from points beyond in the long-term.  

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
The expected annual cost for SMUD’s share of this Agreement is approximately $755,000 (including the market payment) and is included in the budget for 2024 and beyond. SMUD’s share of the market payment is approximately $244,000 per year in the first five years and $355,000 per year in the last five years.  

**Alternatives:**  
Forego the opportunity to continue having an additional 22 MW north-to-south and 17 MW south-to-north of COTP capacity and continue utilizing the existing import capability SMUD has on PG&E's grid across CAISO's Balancing Authority.  

**Affected Parties:**  
SMUD, TANC, the City of Palo Alto, MID, TID, and the City of Roseville.

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to award contracts to Siemens Energy, Inc., ILJIN Electric USA, Inc., Mader Supply LLC, PTI Transformers LP, and WEG Transformers USA LLC to manufacture and provide Generation, Distribution and Transmission Power Transformers during the five-year period of February 1, 2024, to January 31, 2029, with one optional two-year extension for a total aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount of $250,000,000.

**Summary:**  
Request for Proposals (RFP) No. Doc40937983728 was issued in July 2023 to solicit proposals to establish strategic alliance agreements with one or more power transformer suppliers for a five-year period with one optional two-year extension. The not-to-exceed aggregate amount includes funding for 60 transformer units over the next five years. The optional two-year extension will account for project or manufacturing delays. Each of the 70 units fall into 19 different transformer types or sizes and will be used in one of three areas of our overall system including distribution, transmission, or power generation. Due to the complexity across the broad category of “large power transformers,” proposers did not bid on all 70 units or all 19 types of transformers. This solicitation was aggregated to include all large power transformer needs forecasted by SMUD over the next five years to encourage participation from as many potential global manufacturing partners as possible with the intent to award multiple category specific contracts and, in some cases, primary and secondary sources of supply to mitigate risk of supply disruption, delays, quality or other factors. A Pre-Proposal Conference was held on July 27, 2023, with 19 attendees. On October 23, 2023, SMUD received 11 proposals that were evaluated in accordance with the advertised criteria. Of the 11 proposals received, seven were responsive. SMUD initiated and continues to negotiate with the top ranked proposers. SMUD is requesting approval to award contracts to the highest ranked proposers upon successful completion of negotiations for a total aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount of $250,000,000. The current result of the solicitation is shown below.

**DATE SENT**  
12/22/2023  

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and award a Sole Source contract to Siemens Industry, Inc. (“Siemens”) for the upgrade of their proprietary Energy Management System (“EMS”) for the term January 19, 2024, through December 31, 2026, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $6,000,000.

**Summary:**  
The EMS is critical to the real-time operations of SMUD's transmission, generation, distribution, gas scheduling, and commodity settlement systems. SMUD Transmission Planning and Operations is currently using the Siemens Spectrum Power 7, v2.2 EMS that was implemented in 2019. The EMS is also used to perform the Balancing Authority operations for the Balancing Authority of Northern California (BANC) and participation in the Energy Imbalance Market (EIM). The EMS was originally scheduled for an upgrade in 2026, but with projects coming online in support of the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan (ZCP), it is critical that the timeline for the EMS upgrade project be expedited. This will ensure the hardware, software and other third-party products are refreshed and the EMS that supports both SMUD’s and BANC’s grid management and operations are current on vendor supported products. As this software is proprietary, Siemens is the only vendor with the access required to upgrade the EMS.

**Recommendation:**  
Award a Sole Source contract to:  
Siemens Industry, Inc.  
10900 Wayzata Blvd., Ste. 400  
Minnetonka, MN 55305  

**Comments:**  
This will be a non-standard contract that will be negotiated with and approved by SMUD Risk Management and Legal.

**Board Policy:**  
(Number & Title)  
Board-Staff Linkage BL-8, Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Procurement; Strategic Direction SD-4, Reliability; Strategic Direction SD-7, Environmental Leadership

**Benefits:**  
The upgrade will provide minimized operational costs, new features and functionality to improve real-time monitoring and control of the grid and generation assets by Transmission Planning and Operations and will allow for a refresh of all hardware and third-party software before they are outdated and unsupported.

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
$6,000,000; Budgeted for 2024-2026 by Transmission Planning and Operations.

**Alternatives:**  
Issue a competitive solicitation to replace the entire EMS. This alternative is cost and resource prohibitive, introduces unnecessary risk to operations, and would delay integrating ZCP requirements into the system.

**Affected Parties:**  
Transmission Planning and Operations, Procurement, Warehouse and Fleet, and Siemens.

**Coordination:**  
Transmission Planning & Operations and Procurement, Warehouse & Fleet.

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to award contracts to Arrow Construction (Arrow), Nyecon, Inc. (Nyecon), Roebblen Contracting, Inc. (Roebblen) and Sierra National Construction, Inc. (SNC) to provide General Building Construction and Support Services for a three-year term from January 22, 2024, to January 21, 2027, with three optional one-year extensions, for a total aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount of $30 million.

**Summary:**  
Request for Proposals DOC4022189793 (RFP) was issued in July 2023 to solicit qualified firms to provide general building construction and support services in support of the Facilities Business Unit. The solicitation was issued with a provision to award multiple contracts for an approximate three-year period. The Contractors will furnish all supervision, labor, materials, equipment, and incidentals necessary to accomplish the work in accordance with the contract. This is a master task contract that will include a variety of project types. The work may include, but is not limited to tenant improvements projects, asphalt concrete and concrete parking repairs, installation of underground utilities and site work, electrical work, demolition, soil remediation, abatement of hazardous materials, structure repair and construction, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) work, replacement of end-of-life equipment and systems, fencing, roofing, landscaping, and miscellaneous work in support of ongoing Facilities operations and design build tasks. A pre-proposal conference was held on July 27, 2023. On August 21, 2023, SMUD received four proposals that were evaluated in accordance with the advertised criteria. The rate schedule provided to the Contractors consisted of 11 items, but only two line-items were cost driven. SMUD pre-set the rates on items 3-11 but allowed Contractors to provide mark-up on the labor rates, items 1-2. SMUD initiated rate negotiations on those two line items and as a result, two of the Contractors (Nyecon and SNC) lowered their mark-up compared to their current labor rates, and the other two Contractors (Arrow and Roebblen) raised their rates. Staff determined rates to be fair and reasonable by comparing the Contractor’s proposed rates with existing contract rates. The result of the analysis determined that the proposed rates are within 5% of existing contracts. Furthermore, while the evaluated proposal amounts includes labor, subcontracting, materials, and equipment for the estimated volume of work over the term of the contracts, actual project work will be evaluated and awarded at the task or project level on a competitive basis driving further competition and cost savings to SMUD long term. The result of the evaluation and award recommendations are shown below.

**Recommendation:**  
Award to Highest Evaluated Responsive Proposers  

**Award to:**  

| Contractor | Address |
|---|---|
| Arrow Construction | 1850 Diesel Drive, Sacramento, CA 95838 |
| Nyecon, Inc. | 3780 Happy Lane, #A, Sacramento, CA 95827 |

**Net Position**
- The change in net position is an increase of $232.5 million compared to a budgeted increase of $140.1 million, resulting in a favorable variance of $92.4 million.

**Revenues**
- Revenues from sales to customers were $1,488.5 million, which was $18.4 million lower than planned. The decrease is primarily due to:
  - Lower commercial customer revenue of $27.0 million primarily due to lower customer usage.
    - Offset by lower provision for uncollectible accounts of $9.2 million.
- Revenues under the California Global Warming Solutions Act Assembly Bill – 32 (AB-32) were $29.3 million. This is due to carbon allowances sold through the state sanctioned quarterly auctions.
- Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) revenues were $5.9 million due to LCFS credit sales.
- Other electric revenues were higher by $13.1 million primarily due to higher Procter & Gamble Power Plant steam sales than planned.
- Non-cash revenues transferred to the rate stabilization fund were $101.4 million, of which $65.4 million was for the annual Hydro Generation Adjustment, $30.0 million was for AB-32 and $6.0 million was for LCFS. AB-32 and LCFS funds are deferred until SMUD has qualified program expenses (projects that reduce carbon emissions or electric vehicle programs) to recognize revenue.
- Non-cash revenues transferred from the rate stabilization fund were $41.8 million, which is $15.8 million higher than plan. The increase is primarily due to $27.7 million of revenue recognized for AB-32, offset by lower revenue recognized for the Community Impact Plan (CIP) of $6.2 million and lower revenue recognized for LCFS electric vehicle programs expenses of $5.7 million.

**Commodities, Purchased Power, and Generation**
- SMUD’s generation was lower by 55 GWh (0.8 percent); JPA and other generation was lower by 765 GWh (15.1 percent); and hydro generation was higher by 710 GWh (43.9 percent).
- Purchased power expense of $415.9 million, less surplus power sales of $176.8 million, was $239.1 million, which was $8.7 million lower than planned. October and November were warmer than forecasted and load is still down overall due to the loss of datacenter accounts and a cooler September. Hydro generation is still higher than planned due to higher precipitation levels earlier in the year and resulting inflows from snow melt. In addition, surplus power is being sold and market purchases are being purchased at a lower price than plan due to abundant hydro generation driving market prices down.
- Production operations cost of $307.8 million, less surplus gas sales of $107.8 million, was $200.0 million, which was $30.3 million lower than planned.
  - Fuel costs of $195.8 million less surplus gas sales of $107.8 million, was $88.0 million, which was $24.7 million lower than planned. This is primarily due to lower usage and lower prices.
- The “power margin”, or sales to customers less cost of purchased power, production operations costs and gas hedges included in investment revenue was $1,042.0 million, which was $13.3 million higher than planned. The power margin as a percentage of sales to customers was 70.0 percent, which is 1.7 percent higher than planned. This is due to lower sales to customers, lower thermal generation, and lower purchased power.

**Other Operating Expenses**
- All other operating expenses were $876.8 million, which was $7.6 million lower than planned.
  - Customer Service and Information expenses were down $10.3 million primarily due to supply chain issues causing equipment delivery delays and, in turn, switch installation delays in the NextGen ACLM program and charger installation delays in transportation electrification. Additionally, the delay in the launch of the Partner+ program in Storage Virtual Power Plant and lower rebate activity in the transportation electrification programs are driving costs down.
  - Administrative & General expenses were down $12.8 million primarily due to a difference in accounting and budgeting for the other postemployment benefits (OPEB) normal cost, lower new business development planning expenses under demonstration and selling expenses, and lower miscellaneous expenses.
<!-- Page 26 -->
- General expenses, including the enterprise shared drive migration project, T3 transformation project, and other expenses and projects.
  - Public Good expenses were down $11.4 million primarily due to project delays in building electrification and energy efficiency CIP program initiatives. Additionally, research and development project delays in Electric Transportation, ChargeReady Community Grant, Energy Storage Systems (ESS) battery storage and other projects being moved to 2024.
  - Production maintenance expenses were $2.7 million lower than planned primarily due to lower Solano wind maintenance expenses and shifting of maintenance timelines for Cosumnes Power Plant.
  - Transmission and distribution maintenance expenses were $17.2 million higher than planned. This is primarily due to higher costs related to the storm response early in the year.
  - Non-cash depreciation and amortization is higher by $14.5 million primarily due to unplanned amortization of lease assets, offset by a timing difference between budgeted and actual depreciation.

Non-operating Revenues and Expenses
- Other revenue, net, was $94.1 million higher than planned primarily due to gain on sale of the Solano property of $33.3 million, an insurance recovery payment of $13.6 million related to Cosumnes Power Plant, higher settlements of $9.8 million due to a settlement payment of $14.8 million related to the US Bureau of Reclamation, Central Valley Project Improvement Act settlement, a distribution from the Transmission Agency of Northern California of $6.1 million, and higher interest income of $23.0 million, all offset by higher investment expense of $6.7 million primarily due to natural gas hedging activity.
- Interest charges were $6.9 million lower than planned primarily due to budgeted interest expense continuing for bonds refunded in June and a new swap agreement that reduces interest expense.

The presentation will review the purpose, authority and responsibilities of Internal Audit Services. In addition, the organizational relationship and role in SMUD’s overall risk management and control will be presented.  

Internal Audit Services takes multiple steps to create the proposed annual audit plan. The objective is to develop a plan that is risk based and focused to deliver value to SMUD. The following key steps are completed: understand SMUD’s business environment, organization, and strategic goals; assess risk and exposure in achieving goals; understand controls/strategies in place to mitigate risks; obtain input from executives, managers and key stakeholders; assess impact of prior audit work; availability and expertise of resources and best practices. This information is gathered, evaluated, and prioritized to develop the final plan. The audits selected reflect greater business risks, audits that are performed cyclically or areas that may not have as robust systems of internal controls to help ensure adequate risk mitigation.

# Heat Illness Prevention Program
## Executive Summary

Internal Audit Services (IAS) has completed a review of SMUD’s Heat Illness Prevention Program. The purpose of this audit was to confirm that SMUD’s Heat Illness Prevention standards align with Cal/OSHA’s Heat Illness Prevention Regulations. This audit was included in the 2023 IAS Audit Plan.

Heat illness is a serious medical condition resulting from the body’s inability to cope with a particular heat load, and includes heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat syncope, and heat stroke. In California, Cal/OSHA’s Heat Illness Prevention regulations require employers to take steps to protect outdoor workers from heat illness with water, rest, shade, and training. Heat illness training is required for all outdoor workers and a written prevention plan must be available at all outdoor worksites.

We reviewed all SMUD policies, procedures, and training related heat illness prevention and identified each employer requirement in Cal/OSHA’s Heat Illness Prevention regulations; we then reviewed SMUD's Heat Illness Prevention plan and related training and confirmed that all of the requirements were met. We also selected a sample of field employees and confirmed that they all received the required heat illness prevention training. Our review found that SMUD’s Heat Illness Prevention program complies with Cal/OSHA’s Heat Illness Prevention regulations, and that the training is delivered to applicable field employees.

IAS commends Safety Services staff for its dedication to employee safety and the prevention of heat illness, and we would like to thank them for their cooperation and support during this audit. We would also like to thank Sacramento Power Academy staff for the assistance they provided.

## Internal Audit Services Report

### Background:
Internal Audit Services (IAS) has completed a review of SMUD’s Heat Illness Prevention Program. The purpose of this audit was to determine whether SMUD’s Heat Illness Prevention Program complies with Cal/OSHA’s Heat Illness Prevention regulations. This audit was included in the 2023 IAS Audit Plan.

Heat illness is a serious medical condition resulting from the body’s inability to cope with a particular heat load, and includes heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat syncope and heat stroke. In California, Cal/OSHA’s Heat Illness Prevention regulations require employers to take steps to protect outdoor workers from heat illness with water, rest, shade, and training. Heat illness training is required for all outdoor workers and a written prevention plan must be available at all outdoor worksites.

SMUD’s Health and Safety (Safety Services) team is responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining safety standards, programs, and processes, as well as monitoring compliance with safety statutes and regulations. The Safety Services team is also responsible for developing and conducting training on safety procedures; the Sacramento Power Academy (SPA) staff assist in delivering training, and are responsible for maintaining documentation of safety and health training for all Energy Delivery and Operations team members.

### Scope:
The scope of this audit included all heat illness prevention-related procedures and training, and all applicable 2023 training records. Because the fieldwork for this audit was completed in October and November, we did not have the opportunity to visit sites and test the implementation of heat illness prevention procedures.

### Objectives:
The objective of this audit was to determine whether SMUD’s Heat Illness Prevention Program complies with Cal/OSHA’s Heat Illness Prevention regulations.

### Summary:
AQS interviewed Safety Services staff to learn about the processes related to heat illness prevention and training. We also reviewed all policies, procedures, and training related heat illness prevention. Specifically, we identified each requirement in Cal/OSHA’s Heat Illness Prevention regulations; we then reviewed SMUD’s Health and Safety Standard for Heat Illness, as well as Energy Delivery and Operations’ Safety Manual, and confirmed that each requirement was addressed.

We also identified all Cal/OSHA requirements for Heat Illness Prevention training, and reviewed SMUD’s Heat Illness Prevention training to confirm that all of the required

elements were included. We also selected a sample of field employees and confirmed that they all received the required heat illness prevention training.

**Conclusion:**  
SMUD’s Heat Illness Prevention program complies with Cal/OSHA’s Heat Illness Prevention regulations. Additionally, its Heat Illness Prevention training complies with the regulations’ training requirements, and is delivered to applicable field employees.

IAS commends Safety Services staff for its dedication to employee safety and the prevention of heat illness, and we would like to thank them for their cooperation and support during this audit. We would also like to thank Sacramento Power Academy staff for the assistance they provided.
