# Conclusion
- Entering Master Service Agreements (MSAs) with the 7 awarded contractors for a not-to-exceed value of $250 million provides SMUD with resources to meet significant equipment demand over the next 5-7 years.
- Awarding MSAs to 3 highest ranked bidders for each item provides competitive incentive for suppliers to contain escalation and avoids manufacturing delays.
