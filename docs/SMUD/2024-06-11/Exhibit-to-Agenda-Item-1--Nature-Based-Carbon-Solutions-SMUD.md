**Biodiversity loss is accelerating**  
Electric utilities are not the main cause of biodiversity loss, but we can help address it with land assets we manage.

**Headlines:**

1. **Biodiversity loss accelerates with 1 million species at risk of extinction, UN report finds**  
   Nation  
   May 6, 2019 9:16 AM EDT

2. **Our Response to Climate Change Is Missing Something Big, Scientists Say**  
   Yes, planting new trees can help. But intact wild areas are much better. The world needs to treat warming and biodiversity loss as two parts of the same problem, a new report warns.

3. **Loss of biodiversity poses a great risk to humanity as climate change**  
   The Economist  
   June 19th, 2020 edition

**California Floristic Province**  
Conserving 30 percent of California’s lands and coastal waters by 2030.

**Customers & Other Stakeholders Care**  
**2022 SMUD Customer Survey on Biodiversity**

- 85% of respondents are very or somewhat concerned about the decrease in biodiversity in California.  
- 89% of respondents strongly or somewhat support SMUD in adopting a 30x30 Biodiversity Plan.  

The majority of respondents (75%) were not aware of SMUD’s current efforts to support biodiversity, and when those efforts were described, 85% said that it had a positive impact on their opinion of SMUD.

- 51% of respondents believe that SMUD should take on a great deal of responsibility in supporting biodiversity and sustaining healthy ecosystems at the sites of large-scale renewable energy projects and another 42% believe they should take on a moderate amount. Only 3% said SMUD does not have a responsibility to support biodiversity.

### Major Goal: 
**Completion of SMUD's Habitat Conservation Plan**

![SMUD Operations Diagram](https://example.com/diagram)
<!-- Page 7 -->
![Nature-Based Solutions](https://biologydictionary.net)

**“Nature-Based Solutions” address climate and biodiversity, sequestering carbon in natural spaces**

- Photosynthesis and other biological processes store carbon in soil and biomass
- These natural systems can be protected and enhanced to increase CO₂ removal from the atmosphere

**Land-based GHG Reduction Strategies**
- Improved nitrogen fertilizer management
- Replacing synthetic nitrogen fertilizer with soil amendments
- Oak woodland restoration
- Cover crops
- Mulching
- Riparian restoration
- Urban forestry
- Hedgerow planting
- Avoided conversion to croplands
- Avoided conversion to urban
- Compost application to grasslands
- Native grassland restoration

**JANUARY 2019 DRAFT California 2030 Natural and Working Lands Climate Change Implementation Plan**

**Integrated Vegetation Management (IVM) Strategy**

SMUD is accredited as a "Right-Of-Way Steward" by the Right-Of-Way Stewardship Council for our approach to Vegetation Management -  
• Initial accreditation received and maintained since 2015  
• Reaccredited in 2022, for 5 years  
• 1 of only 9 utilities in North America to receive accreditation  
• Rigorous and lengthy audit process to ensure only those with high standards in sustainability are accredited  

**Benefits:**  
- Industry Accredited Reliability And Sustainability  
- Enhanced Community Relations  
- Assured Regulatory Compliance  

The Right-of-Way Stewardship Council (ROWSC) is an accreditation program that establishes very high standards for environmentally sustainable right-of-way vegetation management within a utilities right of way.

![UARP Study Location](https://example.com/uarp_study_location.png)

- SMUD partnered with Sonoma State University in 2016 to begin expanding ROW studies within key areas on our electrical assets; this partnership continues today.
- SMUD also performed a similar one-time project for a sample site in the American River Parkway in 2016 shown on the left.
- The Study of SMUD's VM work shows an occurrence of native pollinator species, both the richness (2X) and abundance (3X) being higher at IVM sites.

1. **NATIVE FLOWERING SHRUB PLANTINGS IN OAK UNDERSTORY**  
   Remove invasive vegetation and plant native pollinator friendly species with wood chip method. Maintain existing oak trees that are below height restrictions.

2. **UTILITY POLE COMMUNITY ART PROJECT (optional)**  
   Paint utility pole within the oak understory planting area with large colorful native pollinators. Community members could be engaged by painting or design contest.

3. **SEATING AREA**  
   Uses re-purposed SMUD redwood logs as benches. Use decomposed granite for ADA accessibility. View from seating area frames native shrub oak understory and signage.

4. **NATIVE FLOWERING SHRUB SLOPE PLANTING**  
   Coir logs secured along contour to hold wood chips in place. Colorful flowering shrubs planted using wood chip mulch method.

⭐ **SIGNAGE**  
Panel near seating area includes description of SMUD’s collective group and closed loop process. Panel near slope describes the relationship between native pollinators and plant species installed at the site.

**Planting instruction**  
Sow seeds in early to mid-fall or early spring in full sun or part shade. Rake soil surface to create grooves in the soil and scatter seeds by hand. Gently rake again or press seeds into the soil. Do not bury seeds. Water thoroughly and keep soil moist for 4–6 weeks. Gradually reduce watering.
