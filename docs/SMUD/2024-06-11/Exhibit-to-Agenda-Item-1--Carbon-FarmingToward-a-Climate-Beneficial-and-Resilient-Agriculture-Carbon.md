# What is Carbon Farming?

- Engaging agriculture as a climate solution through the beneficial transfer of atmospheric carbon to working land soils and vegetation.

- Managing the farm system for increased photosynthesis, increased cycling and storage of carbon and reduced emissions of other GHG.

- Building agroecological resilience and other ecosystem functions and services.

**Photosynthesis:**  
the transformation of solar radiation into biochemical energy

Carbon, drawn from the air through the process of photosynthesis, embodies the solar energy used by primary producers (plants) to drive the process.

Carbon is thus the energy currency of living systems, including farm systems and farm system processes.

**Carbon Cycle Values:**  
- Atmosphere: 750 Gt C  
- Vegetation: 610 Gt C  
- Soils: 1,580 Gt C  
- Surface Ocean: 1,020 Gt C  
- Deep Ocean: 38.100 Gt C  
- Marine Biota: 3 Gt C  
- Dissolved Organic Carbon: <700 Gt C  
- Rivers: 90 Gt C  
- Fossil Fuels & Cement Production: 4,000 Gt C  
- Sediments: 150 Gt C

# Recarbonizing the Biosphere: 
## Managing the flow of solar energy through the farm system

Carbon Farming manages for increased photosynthesis and transformation of solar energy into soil organic matter, soil fertility, farm production and the cascade of energy that flows through the entire farm ecosystem.

![Hydrological Impact of Soil Organic Carbon Loss](https://example.com/image.jpg)

# Hydrological Impact of Soil Organic Carbon Loss  
= Hydrological Impact of Drought (McDermid et al. 2022)

## Increasing SOC:
- Increases water infiltration (Basche and DeLonge 2019; Blanco-Canqui et al. 2015)
- Increases soil water holding capacity (Bagnall et al. 2022)
- Ameliorates drought and flood impacts on crops (Arenas-Calle et al. 2021; Iizumi and Wagai 2019; Webb et al. 2017; Williams et al. 2016)

Increased soil water holding capacity and ground water recharge through carbon farming are related to increases in SOC, increased root and symbiotic fungal growth, increased soil faunal activity associated with a denser rooting system, and increased soil aggregation that, collectively, decrease soil bulk density, increase soil porosity and enhance water infiltration.
