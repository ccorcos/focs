- The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) emphasizes biodiversity, pollinator conservation, and nature-based solutions in its operations, reflecting its commitment to environmental stewardship and community engagement.

- Jessica Fox, Senior Technical Executive at the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), presented findings at the SMUD Board Meeting in June 2024, highlighting:
  - 39% of 28 surveyed electric utility companies lack a biodiversity strategy.
  - 11% have a strategy, 18% have a policy, and 14% have both.
  - 18% are developing a strategy or policy.
  - The Power-in-Pollinators Initiative aims to enhance understanding and support for pollinator habitats.

- The [Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF)](https://about.bnef.com/) New Energy Outlook 2022 projects that by 2050:
  - 76% of electricity generation will come from solar and wind technologies.
  - Only 6% will come from fossil fuels.
  - The U.S. will require 0.6-0.9 million acres by 2030 and 2.4-3.6 million acres by 2050 for solar installations.

- California aims to conserve 30% of its lands and coastal waters by 2030 as part of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. A 2022 SMUD survey revealed:
  - 85% of customers are concerned about biodiversity loss in California.
  - 89% support the adoption of a 30x30 Biodiversity Plan.

- Nature-based solutions, which sequester carbon and enhance biodiversity, include:
  - Improved nitrogen fertilizer management.
  - Oak woodland restoration.
  - Cover cropping, mulching, riparian restoration, urban forestry, hedgerow planting, and compost application to grasslands.

- SMUD's current initiatives include:
  - The Integrated Vegetation Management Strategy, accredited as a "Right-Of-Way Steward" by the Right-of-Way Stewardship Council.
  - Community collaborations such as the Johnny Cash Trail and Pine Hill Preserve to enhance local ecosystems and provide educational opportunities.

- Jonathan Wachter from the Carbon Cycle Institute discussed carbon farming practices that improve soil health and biodiversity, including:
  - Cover cropping, managed grazing, and riparian restoration.
  - Orchard planting can sequester over 19 metric tons of CO₂ equivalent per acre per year.
  - Hedgerows can sequester over 8 metric tons of CO₂ equivalent per acre per year.

- Public feedback from the 2022 SMUD customer survey indicates:
  - 51% of respondents believe SMUD should take significant responsibility for supporting biodiversity and sustaining healthy ecosystems at large-scale renewable energy project sites.
  - 42% believe the utility should take moderate responsibility, demonstrating strong community support for SMUD's environmental initiatives.

The document underscores SMUD's proactive approach to integrating biodiversity and nature-based solutions into its operations, aligning with community concerns and environmental goals.
