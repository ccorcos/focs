# Key Insights:
- Companies that provide pollinator and/or biodiversity information to their board or investors also report higher perceived executive understanding of the topics.
- The topic of biodiversity and/or pollinator management and measurement is growing in importance, as 61% of responding companies either have policies or strategies in place or have these in development.
- Despite its growing importance, only 30% of responding companies have a definition of success for the management of biodiversity and/or pollinators, and even fewer have a definition for determining the condition of biodiversity on their lands.
- Departmental ownership of biodiversity management is not always clearly defined or understood, even within organizations.
