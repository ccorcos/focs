**May 2024 Financial Highlights**

- **Customer Revenue**  
  $570 Million  
  $2M or 0.4% higher revenues than budgeted (favorable)  
  • Customer revenue above target due to higher commercial customer usage offset by lower residential customer usage for the year.

- **Commodity**  
  $208 Million  
  $18M or 8.1% lower commodity expenditures than budgeted (favorable)  
  • Production costs were under target due to increase hydro generation and lower fuels costs from the reduction in thermal generation.

- **Other Operating Expenses**  
  $412 Million  
  $6M or 1.4% higher expenditures than budgeted (unfavorable)  
  • Administrative & general expenses $7.2M higher due to bond issuance costs and storm response expenses.  
  • Public good expenses $2.9M above budget due to higher than planned rebate volume in Advanced Home Solutions and building electrification programs.  
  • Transmission & distribution expenses $5.0 below budget due to lower transmissions fees offset by higher costs related to the February storm response.

- **Other Non-Operating Revenues**  
  $82 Million  
  $58M or 241.7% higher than budgeted (favorable)  
  • Primarily due to insurance recovery payment on Cosumnes power plant business interruption insurance claim, Rancho Seco settlement payment and interest income.

*There are $3M other net revenues not included in the highlights above*

# May 2024 Energy Sources

Hydro generation was 11% lower than budget in May due to increased thermal plants & other generation, and 4% higher than budget year-to-date due to higher spring precipitation.

Thermal plants & other generation was 17% higher than budget in May, and 10% lower year-to-date due to unplanned plant outage and higher hydro generation.

Net purchased power was 9% higher than budget in May, and 21% higher year-to-date primarily due to decreased thermal generation than planned and favorable prices.
