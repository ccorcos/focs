# Background
- SoftwareAG is the provider of SMUD’s Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).
- The ESB is a centralized integration platform used to enable communication between many of SMUD’s core systems and 3rd party Software as a Service (SaaS) providers.
- The ESB has been in operation at SMUD since 2011 and was brought on as a part of the SmartSacramento initiative to support the integration of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) data into various SMUD systems and processes.

# Why ratification was needed

- SoftwareAG recently worked out a deal with IBM to sell off the portion of their software which included all the integration functionality SMUD is currently using.
- This sale was set to go into effect July 1, 2024.
- It was advantageous for SMUD to sign a deal with SoftwareAG by the end of June as they were motivated to lock in a final sale.
- Any contracts not signed by the end of June, IBM gave the directive to cancel and renegotiate.

# Benefit to SMUD

## New negotiated contract cost:
- $8.7M for 5 years
- Includes provisions for new OMS integration environment
- Options included for early termination
- $2.4M - $3.7M in savings over 5 years vs. alternatives

## Potential scenarios with IBM:
- Best – $11.1M (based on year-to-year quote and assuming no increase over 5 years)
- Likely – $12.4M (assuming a 5% YoY increase)
- Most Likely – much higher than 5% increase (this is the trend we have been seeing with many software contracts)
