![SMUD Board Policy](https://via.placeholder.com/1265x768.png?text=SMUD+Board+Policy)

**SMUD BOARD POLICY**  
Category: Board-Staff Linkage  
Policy No.: BL-8  
Title: Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Procurement  

The procurement of goods and services is an integral part of SMUD operations. SMUD’s procurement activities shall take place in accordance with the following principles:

a) **Competition:** SMUD’s procurement activities shall be competitive whenever practical.

b) **Direct Procurement:** Direct procurement may be utilized when it is in SMUD’s best interest. Direct procurement is the purchase of goods or services without competition when multiple sources of supply are available.

c) **Sole Source Procurement:** Sole source procurement shall be performed only in the case of emergency or when a competitive process would be an idle act.

d) **Inclusiveness:** SMUD’s procurement practices shall promote inclusiveness of the entire contractor community in its contracting opportunities.

e) **Economic Development:** SMUD’s procurement practices shall promote the economic development of the community we serve.

f) **Environmental Procurement:** SMUD shall minimize the impact on the environment through its procurement practices. In making procurement decisions, staff shall consider the environmental impacts in assessing total cost and benefits.

g) **Responsible Bidder:** SMUD shall only do business with reputable and responsible contractors. A Responsible Bidder demonstrates trustworthiness, quality, capacity, financial capability, fair labor practices, and experience to satisfactorily perform SMUD work through the bidding and evaluation process. In addition, SMUD will determine Responsible Bidders by considering a contractor’s social, environmental ethical, and safety accountability where applicable.

h) **Contractor Code of Conduct:** SMUD shall set minimum expectations and standards for all contractors to follow in the course of doing business with SMUD (in some cases by submitting data and reporting annually) including but not limited to, labor and human rights, environmental, social, governance (ESG), health and safety accountability, ethics and compliance, and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging practices.

i) **Best Value Procurement:** SMUD may procure goods and services by the best value at the lowest cost methodology, where cost and other factors are used to obtain the maximum value while ensuring a fair and equitable process.

j) **Leveraged Procurement Agreement (LPA):** SMUD may procure goods and services where another lead public agency or organization competitively procures the same goods or services under applicable state and federal laws to streamline procurement processes and leverage collective buying power of multiple agencies to achieve cost savings and.
<!-- Page 15 -->

other benefits to SMUD. Leveraged procurement agreements are generally referred to by other public agencies as “Cooperative Purchasing Agreements.”

k) **Strategic Alliances:** SMUD may enter into strategic alliance contracts for the procurement of goods or services. A Strategic Alliance is a competitively bid multi-year contract for goods and/or services in which the Contractor and SMUD work collaboratively over the life of the contract to improve quality, and to explore design and process improvements to reduce the cost of production, service delivery, and the total cost of ownership. These benefits are shared both by SMUD and the Contractor.

l) **Supply Chain Risk:** SMUD’s procurement activities shall identify, manage, and mitigate supply chain risks through a coordinated effort across the enterprise.

m) **Protest Policy:** SMUD shall ensure that contractors are afforded the opportunity to have their grievances heard through a fair protest process.

n) **Delegation of Authority to the CEO:** The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager (CEO) is delegated authority to perform and approve the procurement activities in accordance with the below matrix. This delegation includes the authority to amend contracts for time extensions or other changes that create no additional cost to SMUD.

**FROM:** Claire Rogers (CR 5/23/24)  

**SUBJECT:** Audit Report No. 28007745  
Board Monitoring Report; SD-4: Reliability  

Internal Audit Services (IAS) received the SD-4 Reliability 2023 Annual Board Monitoring Report and performed the following:

- Selected a sample of statements and assertions in the report for review.
- Interviewed report contributors and verified the methodology used to prepare the statements in our sample.
- Validated the reasonableness of the statements in our sample based on the data or other support provided to us.

During the review, nothing came to IAS’ attention that would suggest the items sampled within the SD Board Monitoring report did not fairly represent the source data available at the time of the review.

1) Background

Strategic Direction SD-4 Reliability states that:

Meeting customer energy requirements is a core value of SMUD.

Therefore:

a) SMUD will assure all customer energy requirements are met. This will be accomplished through the use of: (i) its generation resources and purchase power portfolio 100 percent of the time; and (ii) its transmission assets to assure an overall availability of at least 99.99 percent.

b) SMUD will achieve distribution system reliability by:

Limiting the average frequency of outage per customer per year to:

With major event: 0.99 – 1.33  
Excluding major event: 0.85 – 1.14  

Limiting the average duration of outages per customer per year to:

With major event: 67.5 – 93.3 minutes  
Excluding major event: 49.7 – 68.7 minutes  

Ensuring that no individual circuits exceed these targets for more than two consecutive years. For circuits that exceed these targets for two consecutive years, a remedial action plan will be issued and completed within eighteen months.

c) SMUD will maintain the electric system in good repair and make the necessary upgrades to maintain load serving capability and meet regulatory standards.

2) Executive summary

Improving reliability is essential to meeting customer energy requirements and drives customer loyalty.

SMUD was in compliance for both generation and transmission availability. SMUD met all energy supply requirements 100% of the time through its generation resources and purchased power. At a peak load of 3,092 megawatts (MW) (which occurred on

Major events are defined as events caused by earthquake, fire, or storms of sufficient intensity which result in a state of emergency being declared by the government. Absent the declaration of a state of emergency, any other natural disaster may be excluded only if it affects more than 15% of the system facilities or 10% of the customers, whichever is less.

There are 763 distribution circuits of which 98.7%, or 753 circuits, met the SD-4 reliability criteria. Twenty projects (primarily cable replacement) were issued to improve reliability, of which eleven have been completed. The remaining nine projects are on schedule to be completed within the eighteen-month requirement. These projects include cable replacement, avian mitigation, tripsaver installations and other work.

**Generation**

**Hydro Generation Facilities**

The availability rate for SMUD’s hydro generation system in 2023 was 86.41% and for the June 1st through September 30th period, hydro generation availability was 88.11%. SMUD’s Upper American River Project (UARP) hydro system generated 2,375 gigawatt hours (GWh). The budgeted generation was 1,635 GWh.

The lower hydro availability rate was due to an unscheduled outage at Camino resulting from a transformer failure (T1). This outage began in June and extended through the end of the year. The failed transformer was replaced in March 2024.

Gas Pipeline Operations  
SMUD’s gas pipeline had a 100% availability rating in 2023 and provided a constant flow of gas to SMUD’s thermal generation facilities. All necessary maintenance activities were successfully completed in accordance with our operations and maintenance plans and procedures.

Thermal Generation Facilities  
The overall availability rate for SMUD’s thermal generation facilities in 2023 was 80.83% and for the June 1st through September 30th period, thermal plant availability was 96.55%. SMUD’s thermal generation facilities generated a net total of 4,442 GWh against the budgeted generation of 5,156 GWh.

Transmission and Distribution  
SMUD has approximately 488 miles of transmission lines and 10,882 miles of distribution lines including 69 kilovolt (kV). Approximately 40% of the distribution lines are installed overhead and 60% are installed underground. The transmission system is predominately overhead except for 19 miles of underground lines located in the Carmichael and downtown areas.

Staff monitors circuit reliability regularly to assess circuits that could potentially exceed the reliability limits. Outage causes, trends, and reliability impacts are analyzed to identify corrective actions that will bring the reliability of these circuits within the acceptable range.

Challenges  
On the evening of December 31, 2022, the first of nine atmospheric river storms hit northern California. The impact of these storms started in 2022 and carried over into 2023 causing significant damage to the grid, affecting approximately 264,000 customers, a SAIDI contribution of 242.6 minutes, and a SAIFI contribution of 0.41 in 2023. The unexpected storms brought over 60 miles per hour (mph) wind gusts, with 48 mph sustained winds, coupled with almost two inches of rain. With the ground saturated by heavy rains combined with high winds, over 1000 trees over several days were uprooted all over the Sacramento region with many trees falling onto SMUD’s overhead lines. These types of tree related outages take longer to resolve since the trees must be removed from the tangled powerlines prior to the start of rebuilding the lines.

# Drivers for Reliability Performance

The main drivers for the distribution system performance excluding major events, along with the mitigation measures for each, are summarized below.

## Non-Preventable Tree Outages

The leading cause of outages in 2023 was non-preventable tree outages. Overall, there was a 143% increase in the number of non-preventable tree outages, with a 609% increase in SAIDI minutes and a 285% increase in SAIFI, when comparing with 2022. This dramatic increase in non-preventable tree outages was caused by the numerous storm days in the first quarter of 2023 that did not qualify as major event days.

To further improve on the impact of non-preventable tree outages on the grid, SMUD’s vegetation management department continues to be proactive in our maintenance activities. This will improve the reduction of non-preventable tree outages.

## Equipment Failures

Equipment failures are associated with a wide variety of distribution line components, such as fuses, poles, wire hardware, broken connectors, broken jumpers, failed transformers, broken cutouts and more. Outages due to failed equipment continue to be evaluated to locate and address any systemic deficiencies.

Failed equipment was the second leading cause of outages in 2023. When compared to 2022, outages due to equipment failures increased by 17%, SAIDI minutes increased by 37% and SAIFI decreased by 12%. This decrease in SAIFI was caused by a reduction in the number of customers experiencing equipment related outages from 107,206 customers in 2022 to 95,915 customers in 2023.

Multiple inspection and maintenance programs are in place to identify and correct deficiencies before they result in failure. We have annual line patrols to detect obvious deficiencies. In addition, we perform detailed line inspections (DLI) every five years. During a DLI, the inspector examines every attachment on the pole and documents deficiencies found. The deficiencies are prioritized and repaired based upon predetermined schedules.

## Underground Cable Failures

In 2023, underground cable failures were the third leading driver to quantity of outage events. The number of outages due to cable failures decreased by 12% compared to 2022. Additionally, SAIDI and SAIFI values decreased by 1% and 7% respectively. Improved performance in this area is primarily driven by targeted selection of cables.

<!-- Page 23 -->
Furthermore, there has been a 15% reduction in number of single-phase circuit failures in 2023 compared to 2022, which has led to the reduction of overall cable outages. Additionally, cable injection work in 2024, will target 69kV circuits, which impact a large number of customers. Injection is expected to improve reliability of those lines for up to 25 additional years.

5) Recommendation

It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD-4 Reliability.

## Appendix 3: Reliability Comparison

Table 3 below provides a comparison between SMUD’s average distribution system performance compared to that of Pacific Gas and Electric’s (PG&E’s) distribution system. PG&E defines its distribution system as operating voltages less than 60kV and uses the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1366 standards to define major event days, while SMUD includes the 69kV operating voltage as part of the distribution system and uses an alternate method to determine major event days. The information regarding PG&E’s system average performance was obtained from the 2022 reliability report posted on the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) website. PG&E’s 2023 Reliability Report is not posted on the CPUC website yet.

### Table 3: Distribution System Reliability Comparison (excluding major events)

| Year | SAIDI (minutes) | SAIFI |
|------|------------------|-------|
|      | SMUD | PG&E | SMUD | PG&E |
| 2019 | 66.0 | 103.1 | 1.04 | 0.88 |
| 2020 | 47.6 | 111.2 | 0.90 | 0.93 |
| 2021 | 60.4 | 160 | 1.04 | 1.03 |
| 2022 | 53.7 | 184.5 | 0.93 | 1.28 |
| 2023 | 75.6 | N/A | 1.01 | N/A |

# ENERGY RISK MANAGEMENT AND ENERGY TRADING STANDARDS
## SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT

### PURPOSE
The wholesale energy markets are exposed to numerous risks including, but not limited to, market price risk, supply risk, credit risk and regulatory risk. The purpose of the Energy Risk Management and Energy Trading Standards (the “Standards”) is to establish protocols for prudent risk mitigation and management.

### SCOPE
The Standards apply to:
- The operation of SMUD-owned or controlled generation, transmission, natural gas and other fuel reserves and pipeline assets;
- Contracts for and related to the purchase and sale of wholesale electricity, electric capacity and storage, natural gas and clean and emissions-free fuel, and environmental products;
- Contracts for and related to transmission, natural gas and clean or emissions-free fuel transportation, and storage; and
- Contracts for and related to financially hedging or mitigating risks associated with wholesale electricity, electric capacity and natural gas and other fuel prices, supplies and markets.

### PRIORITIES
The Chief Executive Officer/General Manager (CEO/GM) implement the Standards in accordance with Board policies and with the following priorities, listed in order of importance:

**Priority 1.** Manage resource mix to comply with Board Strategic Direction (SD-4) Reliability.

**Priority 2.** Minimize net commodity energy purchase costs while operating within the targets established in Board Strategic Direction (SD-3) Access to Credit Markets.

**Priority 3.** Optimize SMUD-owned or controlled assets, including but not limited to, generation, transmission, fuel reserves, pipeline assets, fuel storage and contract resources to create additional value for SMUD and its customers, while complying with Board policies and all applicable laws and regulations.
<!-- Page 38 -->
![Priority 4. Provide our customers and community with a sustainable power supply in accordance with Board Strategic Direction (SD-9) Resource Planning.](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768)

**DIVERSIFICATION AND PORTFOLIO MIX**

SMUD will maintain a diverse portfolio of generation, transmission, fuel-related assets and contracts to reasonably mitigate risk and to support its clean energy goals. Risks associated with wholesale contracts will be mitigated through diversified terms and conditions, contract periods and durations, delivery points, counter-parties, and product types.

**PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES**

The CEO/GM will develop and maintain written procedures to implement the Standards and will ensure that appropriate internal controls and limits are in place to ensure compliance with Board policies, the Standards and applicable laws and regulations. Consistent with Board policies and the Standards, the CEO/GM will analyze and implement risk mitigation measures, as appropriate. For illustrative purposes, examples of identified risks and risk mitigation tools are as follows:

2. PROJECT, PURCHASE AND SALE OF PRODUCTS  
2.1 Project and Deliverability  
This Agreement governs Seller’s sale and delivery, and Buyer’s purchase and receipt, of Products from the Project. Seller agrees to request from the CAISO an allocation of TP  
25  
<!-- Page 80 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

Deliverability for the Project, which may be submitted as part of a request by Seller or its Affiliates for TP Deliverability for some or all of the capacity of the larger Grace Orchard Complex. Seller shall not be obligated to request an allocation of TP Deliverability for the Project more than one time, and such one-time request may be made before or after the Effective Date as long as Seller provides documentation to Buyer that reasonably substantiates the submission of the request. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that a certain amount (potentially as much as approximately 450 MW) of capacity at the Grace Orchard Complex is committed under offtake agreements executed before the Effective Date that may also require deliverability, and that such previously committed capacity therefore will have priority over the Project in apportioning any allocation of TP Deliverability for the Grace Orchard Complex. If Seller receives an allocation of TP Deliverability that can be apportioned to the Project based on its relative priority as acknowledged in the foregoing sentence, then Seller shall apportion such amount to the Project and notify Buyer of the amount of TP Deliverability that has been apportioned to the Project (the “Project Allocation Amount”). If Seller has not received an allocation of TP Deliverability for the Project by June 1, 2025, then Seller shall not have any further obligation to seek an allocation of TP Deliverability for the Project and the Products shall consist only of Energy and associated Environmental Attributes (not to exceed the Energy and associated Environmental Attributes available from the Contract Capacity), and Ancillary Services to the extent available from the Project without additional cost to Seller, and shall not include Capacity Attributes.

## 2.4 Payments and Charges

### 2.4.1 Monthly Energy Charge

2.4.1.1 Buyer shall pay Seller the Monthly Energy Charge for each MWh of Production, plus, for each MWh of Buyer Curtailed Production during the applicable invoice calculation period, an additional amount equal to the PTC Amount calculated by Seller for the relevant period.

2.4.1.2 On a monthly basis, beginning with deliveries of Energy on and after COD, Buyer shall pay Seller (a) the “Monthly Energy Charge”, calculated as the aggregate sum over the Month of the product of (i) the Contract Price, and (ii) the Production for each hour during the Month, plus (b) for each MWh of Buyer Curtailed Production during the Month, an additional amount equal to the PTC Amount calculated by Seller for such Buyer Curtailed Production during the Month.

2.4.1.3 Seller is responsible for all losses from the Project to the Delivery Point, including transformer losses, which will be calculated in accordance with CAISO's requirements for accounting for losses.

### 2.4.2 CAISO and Related Charges

Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, Buyer shall be responsible for CAISO costs (including penalties, Imbalance Energy costs, and other charges) and shall be entitled to all CAISO revenues (including credits, Imbalance Energy revenues, and other payments), including revenues associated with Dispatch Instructions and other CAISO dispatches, bid cost recovery, or other credits in respect of the Product that is Scheduled or delivered from the Project. Seller shall be responsible for (a) all CAISO penalties resulting from any failure by Seller or its Scheduling Coordinator to comply with the CAISO Tariff or the outage notification requirements set forth in this Agreement, (b) any administrative charges, penalties, or fees assessed by the CAISO to the Project solely in its capacity as a generator in the CAISO market (including the Forecast Fee(s) and Grid Management Charge(s)), (c) any CAISO charges, penalties, or fees related to Seller’s failure to comply with a Buyer Curtailment or Dispatch Down Instruction, and (d) negative pricing consequences as specified in Section 9.1.2.3.

31
<!-- Page 86 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

any CAISO revenues related to Uninstructed Imbalance Energy shall be split equally between the Buyer and Seller.

The Parties agree that any Availability Incentive Payments (as defined in the CAISO Tariff) are for the benefit of the Seller and for Seller’s account and that any Non-Availability Charges (as defined in the CAISO Tariff) are the responsibility of the Seller and for Seller’s account. In addition, if during the Delivery Term, the CAISO implements or has implemented any sanction or penalty related to scheduling, outage reporting, or generator operation, and any such sanctions or penalties are imposed upon the Project or to Seller or its designee as Scheduling Coordinator due to failure by Seller to comply with the CAISO Tariff or the outage notification requirements set forth in this Agreement, the cost of the sanctions or penalties shall be Seller’s responsibility.

Subject to the foregoing, Seller shall pass through to Buyer all applicable CAISO costs and revenues associated with the Project, which shall be reflected as a credit or charge (as applicable) on the monthly invoices provided to Buyer in accordance with the invoicing and payment provisions of Section 3, including the netting provisions of Section 3.1.3.

### 2.4.3 Timing of Imbalance Energy and CAISO Charges

The Parties acknowledge that due to the CAISO settlement timelines, the above-referenced CAISO charges, penalties or fees in Section 2.4.2 will not be passed through to Buyer in the same month that they are incurred. Instead, Seller shall pass-through such charges, penalties, or fees after receipt of the settlement invoices from the CAISO.

### 2.4.4 Adjustment for Non-Delivery of RECs

In the event that (a) SMUD fails to receive WREGIS Certificates associated with the amount of Energy delivered to the Delivery Point (other than any WREGIS Certificates that are not provided due to any compliance or conformance issues resulting from Buyer’s assignment to a Limited Assignee pursuant to Section 20.3) within one hundred ten (110) days after the end of the Month that the Energy was generated and delivered to SMUD at the Delivery Point, and (b) the cause of such failure is due to Seller’s actions or inactions that fail to comply with Seller’s obligations under this Agreement (subject to the exclusions

32
<!-- Page 87 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

referenced above, a “WREGIS Shortfall”), then Seller shall either (i) deliver to Buyer at no cost to Buyer, and Buyer shall accept delivery of, a quantity of Energy and PCC1 RECs equal to the WREGIS Shortfall (“Replacement Product”), or (ii) pay to Buyer a “Refund Payment” equal to the greater of (A) the PCC1 REC Price, and (B) the Contract Price, multiplied by the quantity of Energy previously delivered at the Delivery Point for which there is a WREGIS Shortfall (“Discounted Energy”). The “PCC1 REC Price” means the market value of PCC1 RECs of the same year that the WREGIS Shortfall is identified, determined by the average of three (3) broker quotes for such PCC1 RECs. SMUD will provide notice to Seller of any WREGIS Shortfall, including SMUD’s calculation and supporting evidence for such WREGIS Shortfall and PCC1 REC Price (including the three (3) broker quotes used to determine such PCC1 REC Price). Seller shall have the right to elect to provide Replacement Product, or pay a Refund Payment for Discounted Energy, in its sole discretion. If Seller elects to provide Replacement Product, Seller shall provide written notification to Buyer of the time, physical location, and generating resource from which Seller will provide the Replacement Product; provided, that the Parties agree that the Energy from such generating resource shall be resold into a California balancing authority at the time of delivery. Any disputes with respect to the cause of a WREGIS Shortfall or the calculation of the Replacement Product, Discounted Energy or Refund Payment will be resolved pursuant to the provisions of Section 22. Seller shall deliver the Replacement Product or pay the Refund Payment to SMUD, or, if Seller elects to pay the Refund Payment, SMUD may offset and credit the Refund Payment against SMUD’s payment to Seller in the next regular settlement. If Seller cures a WREGIS Shortfall after Seller has delivered Replacement Product or paid Buyer (directly or through an offset or credit against a monthly settlement), then SMUD shall pay Seller the lower of the Contract Price or the PCC1 REC Price (as calculated above) for the Replacement Product, or refund to Seller all or part of the Refund Payment associated with such cure, as applicable, in the next invoice after such WREGIS Shortfall is cured.

2.4.5 Annual Production Guarantee, Project Performance Adjustment

Seller shall follow Prudent Industry Practices in operating and maintaining the Project and shall make any needed and commercially reasonable repairs. 

33
<!-- Page 88 -->

identified through compliance with the foregoing requirements in a reasonably timely manner so as to maximize the Project’s availability for generation of electricity.

Within thirty (30) calendar days after the end of each Contract Year, Seller shall submit records of annual Project curtailment data (including Dispatch Down Periods, Buyer Curtailed Production, and other Deemed Delivered Energy) and any record of Force Majeure or Buyer’s failure to perform in a manner that directly affects the generation of Products by the Project, which Buyer shall reconcile with its own records of annual Project curtailment data (including Dispatch Down Periods, Buyer Curtailed Production, Deemed Delivered Energy, Force Majeure, and any such Buyer failure), in order to calculate AAEP.

If, at the end of any Contract Year, the AAEP for such Contract Year is less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the AAEP for such Contract Year, then Seller shall pay Buyer liquidated damages calculated as set forth below, which, except as set forth in Section 10.1.2.4, shall be Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedy in connection with Seller’s failure to achieve in any Contract Year an AAEP that is equal to or greater than eighty-five percent (85%) of the AAEP for such Contract Year.

Liquidated damages shall equal: [(A - B) * (C - D)], where:

A = Eighty-five percent (85%) of the AAEP for such Contract Year, in MWh;

B = the AAEP for such Contract Year, in MWh;

C = the replacement price for the Contract Year, in $/MWh, which is the sum of (a) the simple average of the Integrated Forward Market hourly price in the Contract Year, as published by the CAISO, for the Existing Zone Generation Trading Hub (as defined in the CAISO Tariff) for the Delivery Point, plus (b) the market value of Replacement Green Attributes, based on the average of three (3) broker quotes; and

D = the Contract Price, in $/MWh

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no payment shall be due from Seller under this Section 2.4.5 if (i) the calculation of (A - B) or (C - D) yields a

34
<!-- Page 89 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

negative number, or (ii) the result of the calculation of [(A – B) * (C – D)] results in a dollar amount that exceeds 100% percent of the Monthly Energy Charges paid by Buyer to Seller for the Contract Year for which the calculation is performed.

2.4.6 System Losses  
All Products specified herein are amounts as provided at the Delivery Point, and Seller is responsible for all losses to the Delivery Point.

2.4.7 Title and Risk of Loss  
Title to and risk of loss related to the Products produced from the Project shall transfer from Seller to Buyer at the Delivery Point, except that title to RECs shall transfer when the associated WREGIS Certificates are transferred to Buyer’s WREGIS account. Seller warrants that it shall deliver to Buyer all Products from the Project free and clear of all liens, security interests, claims and encumbrances, or any interest therein or thereto by any person.

2.5 Energy Market Participation  
The Parties acknowledge and agree that as of the date hereof, SMUD is participating in the EIM and/or other energy markets. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, SMUD’s joining or continued participation in such markets shall not require Seller to perform any additional measures or incur any additional or increased cost other than administrative expenses, liability or obligation, in each case other than what Seller is already otherwise expressly obligated under this Agreement to perform or incur, unless compensated by SMUD. If in the future, market rules or policies change, then the Parties shall meet and confer to discuss the new market rules and whether updates to the scheduling, settlements, or other procedures are required and to preserve the economic “benefit of the bargain” to both Parties to this Agreement.

<!-- Page 95 -->
# SMUD Power Purchase Agreement

## 4.9.1 Compliance Expenditure Cap
The Parties agree that expenditures to comply with the requirements of Sections 4.1 through 4.8 and Sections 5.1 through 5.3 are “Compliance Expenditures” and that the Compliance Expenditures that Seller shall be required to bear during the Term of this Agreement shall be capped at a total of one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000) per Contract Year and one million two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($1,250,000) in the aggregate over the Term (“Compliance Expenditure Cap”).

## 4.9.2 Change in Law
If a change in Law occurs after the Effective Date that affects Seller’s compliance with its obligations under any of Sections 4.1 through 4.8 and Sections 5.1 through 5.3, Seller shall not be in breach of such obligations if Seller has used commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such change in Law as it pertains to such obligations. For purposes of this Section 4.9, the term “commercially reasonable efforts” shall not require additional out-of-pocket expenditures in the aggregate in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap in complying with the changes in Law described in this Section 4.9 unless Buyer and Seller have agreed in writing for Buyer to reimburse Seller for or to pay directly such excess expenditures.

## 4.9.3 Excess Compliance Expenditures
### 4.9.3.1
Within thirty (30) calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, Seller shall provide Buyer with a report describing the Compliance Expenditures that Seller incurred during that calendar quarter and the total Compliance Expenditures incurred during the Contract Year that includes such calendar quarter. Prior to incurring Compliance Expenditures that are anticipated to exceed the Compliance Expenditure Cap in any Contract Year or over the Term, Seller shall notify Buyer of the expected Compliance Expenditures. Following such notice, the Parties shall attempt to agree to limit such Compliance Expenditures to the extent practicable; provided, however, that nothing herein limits Seller’s right to incur Compliance Expenditures that Seller believes in good faith must be incurred for Seller to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, as long as the above notification provisions are met.

10.1.2.5 Subject to Section 4.9, Seller’s failure after the Commercial Operation Date to maintain RPS Certification for the Project, if such failure is not cured within thirty (30) Days after written notice from Buyer; provided that during any period where Seller has not maintained RPS Certification for the Project, whether before or after written notice, Buyer shall not be obligated to purchase any Energy or other Products from Seller hereunder, but Seller may sell such Energy and other Products to third parties; or

10.1.2.6 With respect to any Surety Bond provided for the benefit of Buyer, the failure by Seller to provide for the benefit of Buyer either (1) cash, (2) a replacement Surety Bond from a different Surety Bond Provider, or (3) a replacement Letter of Credit from an issuer meeting the criteria set forth in the definition of Qualified Issuer, in each case, in the amount required hereunder within ten (10) Business Days after Seller receives notice of the occurrence of any of the following events:

(a) if any representation or warranty made by the Surety Bond Provider in connection with this Agreement is false or misleading in any material respect when made or when deemed made or repeated, and such default is not remedied within thirty (30) days after notice thereof; 

56

(b) the failure of the Surety Bond Provider to make any payment required in connection with this Agreement;

(c) the Surety Bond Provider becomes Bankrupt;

(e) the Surety Bond Provider shall repudiate, disaffirm, disclaim, or reject, in whole or in part, or challenge the validity of any Surety Bond.

## 10.2 Declaration of an Event of Default

If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the other Party (“Non-Defaulting Party”) shall have the right to: (a) send notice, designating a day, no earlier than five calendar days after such notice is deemed to be received and no later than twenty (20) calendar days after such notice is deemed to be received, as an early termination date of this Agreement (“Early Termination Date”) unless the Parties have agreed to resolve the circumstances giving rise to the Event of Default; (b) accelerate all amounts owing between the Parties; and (c) terminate this Agreement and end the Delivery Term effective as of the Early Termination Date. For all claims, causes of action and damages with respect to an Event of Default, in addition to the right to terminate this Agreement, the Non-Defaulting Party shall be entitled to recover actual damages allowed by law unless otherwise limited by this Agreement. Neither the enumeration of Events of Default in Section 10.1, nor the termination of this Agreement by a Non-Defaulting Party, shall limit the right of a Non-Defaulting Party to rights and remedies available at law, including claims for breach of contract or failure to perform by the other Party and for direct damages incurred by the Non-Defaulting Party as a result of the termination of this Agreement, subject in each case to any limitations in this Agreement.

## 10.3 Termination Payment Calculation

If an Event of Default occurs, ultimately resulting in termination of the Agreement, a “Termination Payment” shall be determined in accordance with this Section 10.3.

The “Termination Payment” payable by the Defaulting Party to the Non-Defaulting Party shall equal: (i) Non-Defaulting Party’s Loss as calculated under paragraph (a) below and discounted to present value as set forth under paragraph (b) below; plus (ii) Non-Defaulting Party’s Cost as calculated under paragraph (c) below; which will then be

57
<!-- Page 112 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

aggregated with any amounts owed to the Non-Defaulting Party as of the Early Termination Date and any set-offs to which Defaulting Party is entitled as set forth under paragraph (d) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the sum of the amounts calculated under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) below would be less than zero (i.e., if the calculation of the Non-Defaulting Party’s Loss plus its Costs yields a negative number under the calculation below), then the result of that calculation shall be deemed to be zero.

(a) The Parties intend that Non-Defaulting Party’s “Loss” shall be the economic loss (exclusive of Costs), if any, resulting from the termination of the Agreement, determined in a commercially reasonable manner as calculated in accordance with this Section 10.3. The Loss, if any, suffered by Non-Defaulting Party shall be determined by comparing the value of the remaining term, applying the Expected Annual Energy Production (EAEP) and the Contract Price for each year of the remaining term under the Agreement had it not been terminated to the equivalent quantity and each party obtaining, in good faith and from non-affiliated market participants in the relevant market, two quotes for prices of CA RPS PCC 1 bundled renewable energy and RECs for the affected period of a similar quality and quantity in the geographical location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point and averaging the four quotes. If either Party fails to provide two quotes then the average of the other party’s two quotes shall determine the replacement price. For clarity, if Buyer is the Non-Defaulting Party, the Non-Defaulting Party’s Loss equals the amount by which the market price of replacement Energy and Environmental Attributes exceeds the Contract Price therefor, and if the Seller is the Non-Defaulting Party, the Non-Defaulting Party’s Loss equals (A) the amount by which the Contract Price hereunder exceeds the market price of such Energy and Environmental Attributes, plus (B) the value of lost Production Tax Credits that Seller would have earned on such Energy and Environmental Attributes for the relevant years of the remaining term applying the Expected Annual Energy Production (EAEP) for each year of the remaining term, under Internal Revenue Code (Title 26 of the U.S. Code, Section 45 and Section 45Y), less any expenses saved by Seller due to Buyer’s default, which includes, but is not limited to, any cost of production of the Energy and Environmental Attributes not incurred by Seller. To ascertain the market price of a replacement contract, Non-Defaulting Party may consider, among other valuations, quotations from leading dealers in ERR contracts, and other bona fide third party offers, all adjusted for the length of the remaining term and differences in transmission. It is expressly agreed that the Non-Defaulting Party shall not be required to enter into replacement transactions in order to determine the Termination Payment.

58
<!-- Page 113 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

(b) The Loss calculated under paragraph (a) above shall be discounted to present value using the Present Value Rate as of the time of termination (to take into account the period between the time notice of termination was effective and when such amount would have otherwise been due pursuant to this Agreement).

(c) The Non-Defaulting Party’s “Costs” shall be calculated as the sum of the brokerage fees, commissions and other similar transaction costs and expenses reasonably incurred in terminating and replacing the Agreement, including reasonable transmission costs associated with any replacement contract, and reasonable attorneys’ fees, if any, incurred in connection with Non-Defaulting Party enforcing its rights with regard to the Agreement. Non-Defaulting shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate or eliminate Costs.

(d) The Non-Defaulting Party shall add any amounts owed by the Defaulting Party to the Non-Defaulting Party as of the Early Termination Date to, and shall set-off any amounts owing by the Non-Defaulting Party as of the Early Termination Date, against the Termination Payment so that all such amounts are aggregated and/or netted to a single amount. The net amount due shall be paid within thirty (30) Business Days following the effective date of termination, or, if the Parties disagree regarding the calculation of the Termination Payment pursuant to Section 10.4 below, the date that the Parties agree on the Termination Payment.

(e) In no event, however, shall the calculation of Loss or Costs include any penalties or similar charges imposed by the Non-Defaulting Party.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) Seller’s aggregate liability under this Agreement prior to the Commercial Operation Date, including arising out of a termination of this Agreement, shall not exceed an amount equal to the Damage Payment, and (ii) if an Event of Default by Seller has occurred prior to the Commercial Operation Date, and Buyer has not provided any reply regarding such Event of Default within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of such Event of Default by Seller, then, provided such Event of Default is then continuing, Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and pay the Damage Payment then owing hereunder to Buyer.

(g) Payment by the Defaulting Party of the Damage Payment or Termination Payment, as applicable, shall constitute liquidated damages and the Non-Defaulting Party’s sole and exclusive remedy for the Event of Default and declaration of an Early Termination Date related thereto, and further provided, promptly upon Buyer’s receipt of the Damage Payment or Termination Payment, as applicable, Buyer shall return to Seller the Development Security or the Performance Security to the extent either of them, as applicable, did not comprise (i.e., was not used as) the Damage. 

59

Payment or the Termination Payment, as applicable, and neither Party shall have any further obligation or liability to the other Party hereunder.

## 10.4 Disputes

If the Defaulting Party reasonably disagrees with the calculation of the Termination Payment and the Parties cannot otherwise resolve their differences, the calculation issue shall be resolved in accordance with Section 22 of this Agreement.

## 11. CREDITWORTHINESS

### 11.1 Project Development Security

Within ten (10) Business Days of execution of this Agreement by both Parties, Seller shall provide Buyer with one of the following: (a) cash (subject to an escrow agreement reasonably acceptable to each Party); (b) a letter of credit from a Qualified Issuer substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit K-1 (“Seller Letter of Credit”) in each case in the amount of forty-five dollars ($45) per kW of Contract Capacity (the “Project Development Security”), which shall be returned to Seller upon the COD. Seller shall have no obligation to replenish the Project Development Security after any draw thereon, no lien or other security shall be required, and Buyer’s recourse against Seller shall be limited to the Project Development Security provided.

Upon receipt of the Delivery Term Security, Buyer shall return to Seller the Project Development Security provided pursuant to Section 11.1. Seller shall maintain the applicable Delivery Term Security for the duration of the Term; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement, Seller’s replenishment obligation with respect to the Delivery Term Security shall be limited such that the total amount of any replenishments of the Delivery Term Security shall not exceed one (1) time the amount of the original Delivery Term Security. If Seller provides a Letter of
<!-- Page 115 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://example.com/image-url)

Credit, Seller shall renew or provide a new Letter of Credit or cash or a Surety Bond at least thirty (30) calendar days before the current Letter of Credit expiration date. A Letter of Credit must be in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit K-1 or any other form that is reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

No lien or other security shall be required and Buyer’s recourse against Seller shall be limited to the Delivery Term Security provided.

11.3 First Priority Security Interest in Cash or Cash Equivalent Collateral

To secure its obligations under this Agreement, and until released as provided herein, Seller hereby grants to Buyer a present and continuing first-priority security interest (“Security Interest”) in, and lien on (and right to net against), and assignment of, as applicable, the Project Development Security and Delivery Term Security, to the extent provided in the form of cash, and any other cash collateral and cash equivalent collateral posted pursuant to Sections 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3, and any and all interest thereon or proceeds resulting therefrom or the liquidation thereof, whether now or hereafter held by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of Buyer, and Seller agrees to take all action as reasonably requires in order to perfect the Security Interest in, and lien on (and right to net against), such collateral and any and all proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof.

61
<!-- Page 116 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

(a) Exercise any of its rights and remedies with respect to the Project Development Security or Delivery Term Security as applicable, including any such rights and remedies under Law then in effect;

(b) Draw on any outstanding Letter of Credit issued for its benefit and retain any cash held by Buyer as Project Development Security or Delivery Term Security, as applicable; and

(c) Liquidate all Project Development Security or Delivery Term Security (as applicable) then held by or for the benefit of Buyer free from any claim or right of any nature whatsoever of Seller, including any equity or right of purchase or redemption by Seller.

Buyer shall apply the proceeds of the collateral realized upon the exercise of any such rights or remedies to reduce Seller’s obligations under this Agreement (Seller remains liable for any amounts owing to Buyer after such application), subject to Buyer’s obligation to return any surplus proceeds remaining after these obligations are satisfied in full.

11.4 Letters of Credit

If the Project Development Security or Delivery Term Security is a Letter of Credit and the issuer of such Letter of Credit (a) fails to maintain the minimum Credit Rating set forth in the definition of Qualified Issuer, or (b) fails to honor the secured Party’s properly documented request to draw on such Letter of Credit by such issuer, then the posting Party shall have ten (10) Business Days to either post cash or deliver a substitute Letter of Credit that meets the requirements set forth in the definition of Seller Letter of Credit or Buyer Letter of Credit, as applicable.

If the Seller or issuer of such Letter of Credit indicates its intent not to renew such Letter of Credit, and the Letter of Credit will expire prior to the end of the Term, the Seller will provide a replacement security prior to the expiration of such Letter of Credit.

12. FORCE MAJEURE

12.1 Effect of Force Majeure

62
<!-- Page 117 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

A Party shall not be considered to be in default in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than the obligations of a Party to make payment of amounts due under this Agreement) when and to the extent such Party’s performance is prevented by a Force Majeure that, despite the exercise of due diligence, such Party is unable to prevent or mitigate; provided the Party has given a written detailed description of the full particulars of the Force Majeure that are then known to the other Party reasonably promptly after becoming aware thereof, or reasonably promptly after the date that such Party should have become aware of, the Force Majeure) (the “Force Majeure Notice”), which Force Majeure Notice shall include information with respect to the nature, cause and date and time of commencement of the Force Majeure, and the anticipated scope and duration of the delay. Failure of the claiming Party to provide written notice as required in the preceding sentence constitutes a waiver of a Force Majeure claim for all periods prior to other Party’s receipt of such written notice. The Party providing the Force Majeure Notice shall be excused from fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement until such time as the Force Majeure has ceased to prevent performance or other remedial action is taken, at which time the Party shall promptly notify the other Party of the resumption of its obligations under this Agreement. In no event shall either Party be obligated to compensate the other Party or any other Person for any losses, expenses or liabilities that such other Party or such other Person may sustain as a consequence of any Force Majeure.

### 12.2 Meaning of Force Majeure

The term “Force Majeure” means any act or event, including any act of God or the elements, strike or labor disturbance, act of the public enemy or criminal activity, sabotage, war, terrorism, blockade, insurrection, riot, civil disturbance, fire, storm or flood, lightning, hurricane, tornado, ice storm, hail, earthquake, volcanic eruption, extreme or unusual weather events, explosion not caused by the affected Party, epidemic or pandemic and the efforts of any Governmental Authority to combat such events including quarantine, change in law or any order, restraint, directive, regulation or restriction imposed by Governmental Authority or any military or lawfully established civilian authorities, landslide, mudslide, New PV Trade Measure Event, WRO Restraint, a delay in the issuance of any permits needed for the Project, including any rights-of-way by the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management for any Shared Facilities to be used by the Project, or any similar event or occurrence (i) which prevents one Party from performing any of its obligations under this Agreement or

63
<!-- Page 118 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

delays such performance, (ii) which could not reasonably be anticipated (other than New PV Trade Measure Events and WRO Restraints) and/or avoided as of the date of this Agreement, (iii) which is not within the reasonable control of, or the result of negligence, willful misconduct, breach of contract, intentional act or omission or wrongdoing on the part of the affected Party (or any subcontractor or Affiliate of that Party, or any Person under the control of that Party or any of its subcontractors or Affiliates, or any Person for whose acts such Affiliate or subcontractor is responsible), and (iv) which by the exercise of due diligence the affected Party is unable to overcome or avoid or cause to be avoided; provided nothing in this clause (iv) shall be construed so as to require either Party to accede or agree to any provision not satisfactory to it in order to settle and terminate a strike or labor dispute in which it may be involved. Any Party rendered unable to fulfill any of its obligations by reason of a Force Majeure shall exercise reasonable efforts to remove such inability with reasonable dispatch within a reasonable time period and mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure. The relief from performance shall be of no greater scope and of no longer duration than is required by the Force Majeure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a Force Majeure does not include any of the following (each an “Unexcused Cause”): (1) any requirement to meet a renewable portfolio standard or any change (whether voluntary or mandatory) in any renewable portfolio standard that may affect the value of the Energy purchased hereunder; (2) events arising from the failure by Seller to construct, operate or maintain the Project in accordance with this Agreement, unless such failure was itself caused by an event of Force Majeure; (3) any increase of any kind in any cost, except to the extent associated with a New PV Trade Measure; (4) delays in or inability of a Party to obtain financing or other economic hardship of any kind; (5) Seller’s ability to sell any Products at a price in excess of that provided in this Agreement or Buyer’s ability to purchase any Products at a price less than that provided in this Agreement; (6) failure of third parties to provide goods and services essential to a Party’s performance, unless such failure was itself caused by an event of Force Majeure; (7) Project or related equipment failure of any kind unless caused by a Force Majeure (8) any changes in the financial condition of Buyer, Seller, the Lender or any subcontractor or supplier affecting the affected Party’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement; or (9) a determination by either Party’s governing body.

12.3 Buyer Excuse
<!-- Page 119 -->
# SMUD Power Purchase Agreement

For purposes of this Agreement, a Force Majeure shall be deemed to excuse Buyer from receiving Energy at the Delivery Point if the Force Majeure is not related to the Project, is declared by Buyer, and prevents Buyer from receiving Energy from the Project.

## 12.4 Termination Due to Force Majeure Event

If based on a Force Majeure Notice provided by a Party (the “Claiming Party”), the other Party (the “Non-Claiming Party”) reasonably concludes that a Force Majeure or its impact on the Claiming Party affecting more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the Project will continue (i) for a period of three hundred and sixty-five (365) or more consecutive days, then the other Party (the “Non-Claiming Party”) shall have the right to terminate this Agreement effective upon notice to the Claiming Party provided, however, that if the Claiming Party provides documentation to the Non-Claiming Party reasonably demonstrating that the foregoing more than seventy-five percent (75%) for three hundred sixty-five (365) days or more consecutive days standard is satisfied, and if the Non-Claiming Party does not provide any response to the Claiming Party within ninety (90) days after receipt of such documentation, then the Claiming Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the Non-Claiming Party. Upon any termination pursuant to this Section 12.4, neither Party shall owe any damages, Damage Payment, or Termination Payment under this Agreement in respect of such termination or the Force Majeure, and Buyer shall return the Project Development Security or Delivery Term Security, as applicable, to Seller. Any termination of this Agreement in the circumstances described in this section shall be without prejudice to the rights and remedies of either Party for defaults occurring prior to such termination, if any.

## 13. INDEMNITY

### 13.1 Indemnity by Seller

Seller shall defend, release, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives against and from any and all losses, claims, demands, liabilities and expenses, actions or suits, including reasonable costs and attorney’s fees, resulting from, or arising out of or in any way connected with claims by third parties associated with the acts or omissions of Seller, its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives relating to this Agreement; excepting only such

THE AFTER-TAX VALUE OF ANY LOST TAX BENEFITS AND THE COSTS OF RECAPTURE OF ANY TAX BENEFITS OR CREDITS, IF ANY, ARE CONSIDERED DIRECT DAMAGES. UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, AND SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 13 (INDEMNITY), IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT THE LIMITATIONS HEREIN IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING THE

Any direct or indirect Change of Control of Seller (whether voluntary or by operation of law) is deemed an assignment and will require the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a Change of Control of Seller shall not require Buyer’s consent if (i) the Seller after such Change of Control is Controlled by any Lender, (ii) the entity that is the Seller at the conclusion of the Change of Control is a Permitted Transferee, or (iii) such Change of Control is, or is a result of, a direct or indirect Change of Control of NEOP or NEP. For avoidance of doubt, a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred as a result of a Permitted Transfer, and no consent is required under this Agreement with respect to a Permitted Transfer.

20.3 Buyer Limited Assignment  
Buyer may request that Seller enter negotiations to permit Buyer’s limited assignment in connection with a municipal prepayment transaction of all or a portion of Buyer’s rights to receive certain Products (which shall not be for a retail sale, and which shall not include the right to schedule or dispatch the Project or any portion of the Product, or any right to act as Scheduling Coordinator for the Project or to offer any portion of the Product into the CAISO markets) and Buyer’s obligations to make payments for such Product under this Agreement to J. Aron and Company, LLC (“J. Aron”) or other third party at any time (together with J. Aron, each a “Limited Assignee”) upon not less than thirty (30) days’ notice by delivering a written request for such assignment. The limited assignment shall not introduce, or purport to convey or otherwise allege, any right of

![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

**Buyer or Limited Assignee** to make any prepayment to Seller under the Agreement or to file or impose any lien on the Project, or otherwise modify any provision of this Agreement, and shall be expressly subject to the Limited Assignee’s timely payment of amounts due under this Agreement with respect to the assigned Product. Buyer shall pay Seller for any payments not timely made by Limited Assignee, and Buyer shall remain obligated to perform all of its obligations under this Agreement notwithstanding the limited assignment, including any credit-related requirements, and payment for all amounts due and owing under this Agreement, including the total gross amount due to Seller under each invoice. Any failure by the Limited Assignee to make payments to Seller when due hereunder shall be a Buyer Event of Default if not cured within the applicable cure period specified in this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, following any request by Buyer, (a) Seller, Buyer and the Limited Assignee shall negotiate in good faith the execution of a limited assignment agreement based on the form attached hereto as Exhibit O, (b) if requested by Seller, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith an indemnity and/or a legal opinion, to be provided by Buyer for the benefit of Seller, in form and substance satisfactory to Seller and its Lenders (if any), including that Seller shall not be required to agree to any terms or conditions which are reasonably expected to have an adverse effect on Seller or its Lenders, and (c) Limited Assignee shall provide such credit support or performance assurance for its obligations as Seller may reasonably require. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in connection with such limited assignment, if (1) the assignment, transfer or conveyance of the assigned Product pursuant to such limited assignment, or (2) Seller’s performance of any obligation under the assignment agreement, fails to meet any requirements of this Agreement, then Seller shall not be deemed to be in breach of any obligation in this Agreement, including without limitation any representation or warranty herein. Limited Assignee and Buyer shall comply with all reasonable requests received by Seller or any Lender in connection with such limited assignment, including providing any reasonably requested acknowledgments with respect to any Collateral Assignment Agreement.

**20.4 Lender Accommodations**

**20.4.1 Consents and Estoppel Certificates**  
To facilitate Seller’s efforts to obtain financing to construct and operate the Project, Buyer will, as soon as reasonably practicable after a reasonable request, cooperate reasonably with Seller and any Lender to provide such consents to

assignments, estoppels, certifications, representations, information or other documents as may be reasonably requested by Seller or such Lender in connection with any financing of the Project, including in connection with any pledge of the membership interests in Seller or its upstream Affiliates to a Lender as collateral for a financing involving the Project. Upon written request of Seller, Buyer agrees to execute a Consent to Collateral Assignment among Buyer, Seller, Seller’s Affiliate, and any Lenders substantially in the form attached as Exhibit L, with such additional changes thereto as such assignee parties may reasonably request and as to which the Buyer shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its agreement. Buyer also agrees to execute customary estoppel certificates for the benefit of Seller and/or any Lenders as reasonably requested from time to time substantially in the form attached as Exhibit P, with such additional changes thereto as such Lender parties may reasonably request and as to which the Buyer shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its agreement.

## 20.4.2 Portfolio Financing

Seller may, without the prior written consent of Buyer, finance all or any portion of the Project, interconnection facilities, or Shared Facilities utilizing debt financing, equity financing (including tax equity), lease financing, or any other form of financing or any combination thereof, including pursuant to a portfolio financing of multiple energy generation, storage, and transmission facilities and other assets of Seller or Seller’s Affiliates (which may include cross-collateralization or similar arrangements).

## 20.4.3 Lender Cure Rights

Buyer agrees that: (i) Buyer will provide the Lenders with notice of any Event of Default by Seller; (ii) for a period of thirty (30) days following the expiration of any cure period for a monetary Event of Default by Seller and ninety (90) days following the expiration of any cure period for a non-monetary Event of Default by Seller, such Lenders, or their designees, will have the right, but not the obligation, to perform any act required to be performed by Seller under this Agreement to prevent or cure the Event of Default and such act performed by the Lenders, or their designees will be as effective to prevent or cure an Event of Default as if done by Seller; and (iii) Buyer will not terminate this Agreement if any Lenders have provided notice to Buyer that they must foreclose on the

<!-- Page 159 -->
1. **Consent to Assignment.** The Contracting Party hereby acknowledges and consents to the pledge and assignment of all right, title and interest of the Project Owner in, to and under (but not its obligations, liabilities or duties with respect to) the Assigned Agreement by the Project Owner to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security Agreement.

2. **Representations and Warranties.** The Contracting Party represents and warrants as follows as of the date hereof:

   (a) **No Amendments.** [Except as described in Schedule I hereto,] there are no amendments, modifications or supplements (whether by waiver, consent or otherwise) to the Assigned Agreement, either oral or written.

   (b) **No Previous Assignments.** The Contracting Party affirms that it has no notice of any assignment relating to the right, title and interest of the Project Owner in, to and under the Assigned Agreement other than the pledge and assignment to the Collateral Agent referred to in Section 1 above.

   (c) **No Termination Event: No Disputes.** After giving effect to the pledge and assignment referred to in Section 1, and after giving effect to the consent to such pledge and assignment by the Contracting Party, there exists no event or condition (a “Termination Event”) that would, either immediately or with the passage of time or giving of notice, or both, entitle either the Project Owner or the Contracting Party to terminate the Assigned Agreement or suspend the performance of its obligations under the Assigned Agreement. [Except as set forth on Schedule III hereto,] there are no unresolved disputes between the parties under the Assigned Agreement. All amounts due under the Assigned Agreement as of the date hereof have been paid in full [, except as set forth on Schedule III hereto].

3. **Right to Cure.**

   (a) From and after the date hereof and unless and until the Contracting Party shall have received written notice from the Collateral Agent that the lien of the Security Agreement has been released in full, the Collateral Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, following an Event of Default by the Project Owner under the Assigned Agreement, to pay all sums due under the Assigned Agreement by the Project Owner and to perform any other act, duty or obligation required of the Project Owner thereunder as described in Section 3(c) below; provided, that no such payment or performance shall be construed as an assumption by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party of any covenants, agreements or obligations of the Project Owner under or in respect of the Assigned Agreement.

   (b) The Contracting Party agrees that it will not (i) terminate the Assigned Agreement or (ii) suspend the performance of any of its obligations under the Assigned Agreement without first giving the Collateral Agent notice and opportunity to cure as provided below. The Contracting Party further agrees that it will not assign any obligation under the Assigned Agreement without the prior consent of the Collateral Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, except to the extent the Contracting Party may subcontract such obligations to other parties.

(c) If a Termination Event shall occur, and the Contracting Party shall then be entitled to and shall desire to terminate the Assigned Agreement or suspend the performance of any of its obligations under the Assigned Agreement, the Contracting Party shall, prior to exercising such remedies or taking any other action with respect to such Termination Event, give written notice to the Collateral Agent of such Termination Event. Collateral Agent will have the right, but not the obligation, to cure a Termination Event on behalf of Project Owner, only if Collateral Agent sends a written notice to Contracting Party before the later of (i) the expiration of any cure period under this Agreement, and (ii) fifteen (15) Business Days after Collateral Agent’s receipt of notice of such Termination Event from Contracting Party, indicating Collateral Agent’s intention to cure. If the Collateral Agent elects to exercise its right to cure as herein provided, it shall have a period of thirty (30) days after receipt by it of notice from the Contracting Party referred to in the preceding sentence in which to cure the Termination Event specified in such notice if such Termination Event consists of a payment default, or if such Termination Event is an event other than a failure to pay amounts due and owing by the Project Owner (a “Non-monetary Event”) the Collateral Agent shall have a period of sixty (60) days after receipt by it of notice from the Contracting Party referred to in the preceding sentence in which to cure the Termination Event so long as the Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing appropriate action to cure such Termination Event (or such longer additional period if the Collateral Agent is unable to cure such Termination Event within such sixty (60) day period despite exercising commercially reasonable efforts, not to exceed a total of thirty (30) additional days); provided, however, that (i) if possession of the Project is necessary to cure such Non-monetary Event and the Collateral Agent has commenced foreclosure proceedings, the Collateral Agent will be allowed a reasonable time to complete such proceedings, and (ii) if the Collateral Agent is prohibited from curing any such Non-monetary Event by any process, stay or injunction issued by any governmental authority or pursuant to any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding or other similar proceeding involving the Project Owner, then the time periods specified herein for curing a Termination Event shall be extended for the period of such prohibition; provided, further, that in the event of items (i) or (ii) above, such time period shall not exceed one hundred eighty (180) days. Any cure period for the Collateral Agent shall not commence until the later of (i) the end of the cure period of the Project Owner under the Assigned Agreement and (ii) written notice from the Contracting Party to the Collateral Agent of a Termination Event.  
(d) Any curing of or attempt to cure any Termination Event shall not be construed as an assumption by the Collateral Agent or the other Secured Parties of any covenants, agreements or obligations of the Project Owner under or in respect of the Assigned Agreement.  
(e) Following a Termination Event by the Project Entity under the Assigned Agreement, the Contracting Party may require the Collateral Agent, if the Collateral Agent has provided the notice set forth in subsection (c) above, to provide to Contracting Party a report concerning:  
(i) The status of efforts by Collateral Agent to develop a plan to cure the Termination Event;

**PRINCIPLES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT**

SMUD is committed to developing carbon free Renewable Energy in a manner that supports the community, protects the environment, and respects human rights. This document provides guidance on the key objectives that SMUD expects to achieve associated with this commitment. Renewable energy projects engaged in a commercial relationship with SMUD such as a Power Purchase Agreement will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, implement, and maintain throughout the Term, a Community Benefits Plan that addresses how the project will achieve the key objectives identified herein.

**Key objectives:**

1. **Land Use:** Prioritize previously developed lands. Avoid or minimize impacts on sensitive environmental resources, including but not limited to cultural resources, Tribal cultural resources, and biological resources such as endangered species habitat, vernal pools and other sensitive habitats, Waters of the US, Waters of the State and waters identified by CDFW as Streambed. Provide additional mitigation measures if avoidance and minimization measures cannot fully eliminate impacts. Applicants are expected to discuss these topics with SMUD and the lead agency as early as possible to identify potential associated issues in advance of the purchase power agreement being finalized.

2. **Land Use:** All projects should employ techniques for maintaining and/or restoring ecosystem function to the site in conjunction with Renewable Energy outcomes, including establishment of native vegetation, restricting use of herbicides and pesticides, use of grazing for vegetation management and seasonally appropriate maintenance practices. Where development is on or surrounded by agricultural lands the project should also employ agricultural practices on the property during operations including sheep grazing, dry crop farming and irrigated food production where feasible.

3. **Land Use:** Employ design and construction practices that minimize ground disturbance to the maximum extent possible. This is especially critical in areas where cultural, Tribal and biological resources are of significant concern.

4. **Sustainable Life Cycle Management:** Include plans for sustainable life cycle management of construction materials and project components during construction and operation that provides for recycling and reuse of construction waste and waste during operation including but not limited to the solar panels.

5. **Community Benefits:**
   (a) **Inclusive Economic Development:** Leverage SMUD’s Supplier Education & Economic Development (SEED) team to connect with certified small business vendors/contractors in SMUD’s service territory to support the project. Submit requests to seed.mgr@smud.org.

**Exhibit Q - 1**
<!-- Page 186 -->
6. **Zero Carbon Workforce Development**: SMUD seeks to galvanize and prepare the region for an inclusive, diverse, creative, and empowered future workforce. Leverage SMUD’s existing workforce development agreements, programs, and partnerships throughout the Project to support the development of a clean energy labor force. The Project Team will work with SMUD to engage various elements of the labor supply chain via pre-apprentice and apprenticeship programs, internships, informational sessions, and mentorship opportunities.

7. **Sustainable Materials & Equipment**: Sourcing materials and equipment from companies that have a human rights policy and statement of supply chain ethics commitment that expresses the corporation’s commitment to meet the responsibility to respect human rights and uphold ethical business practices in their operations and value chains.

1. \( C_t = \) module power temperature coefficient \((-0.xxx\%/°C, \text{ Weighted Average})\)  
   \( T_M = \) mean module surface temperature (°C)

2. A plot of \( P_{STC} \) vs. mean Reference Module irradiance is created as shown in Figure 1.

3. A linear fit is then performed for all Valid Data Points (shown in BLUE) while all other data points (shown in RED) are excluded from the regression. These RED data points represent discrete times in the data set where one or more event is present as defined in Section 5 Table 3 of this procedure. The coefficient of determination (\( R^2 \)) for the capacity regression shall be at least 0.92. The linear fit yields an equation of the following form:

   \[
   y = N * x + b
   \]

   where:

Paul Lau, Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, reported on the following items:

1) PRIDE Month. I would like to start tonight’s report by recognizing June as PRIDE Month. Celebrating PRIDE Month promotes acceptance, equality and awareness of the issues the LGBTIQ+ community faces. I am proud of the work we are
<!-- Page 204 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/1265x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

1) **Pride Month**. We are proud of the work we are doing to foster diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging in all we do at SMUD. At the same time, I recognize there is much more work to do to create communities that are truly inclusive and equitable across our community, country and the world. Team SMUD has been busy with PRIDE Month celebrations, including, as you heard a moment ago, the Sacramento PRIDE parade with President Herber and Director Tamayo. As we celebrate PRIDE Month, I want to thank our PRIDE@SMUD Employee Resource Group and their Allies. They are doing great work to foster inclusion, equality and equity for our LGBTIQ+ employees.

2) **Juneteenth**. Juneteenth was officially celebrated yesterday. It commemorates the freedom finally granted to more than 250,000 enslaved black people in Texas in 1865. As Vice President Fishman stated, this was two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. The need to share the rich and often painful history of people of color in this country is critical. By honoring this history with occasions like Juneteenth, we remember the millions who were enslaved. And we remind ourselves that when any member of our community suffers, we all suffer. I want to say thank you to our SMUD Board members, leaders and staff who have represented SMUD at Juneteenth events over these past few weeks.

3) **Light Up Navajo Nation**. We recently sent a five-person line crew to work in Arizona for 12 days, helping bring electricity to those who have never had power. This crew joined others from 42 utilities in 16 states under the American Public Power Association’s (APPA’s) Light Up Navajo Nation initiative, which is in its fourth year. Our crew set 60 poles, five transformers and installed more than three miles of distribution lines. Thank you to the crew for helping electrify hundreds of rural.

4) **SMUD's Connecting Our Communities Expo.** Earlier this month, SMUD's Connecting our Communities Expo returned for a second year - and it was a huge success with a boost in attendance to over 400 attendees! Director Tamayo gave a great welcome, and I want to thank our Chief Customer Officer Brandy Bolden – she and her team were like rock stars. People were taking selfies with her, and people were coming up to, hugging me and saying what a great job they do. It is just wonderful to see people that really need those services connect with those organizations that provide those services – many of them do not know about. The event provided information on the Energy Assistance Program Rate (EAPR), Medical Discount Rate and Energy Saver Bundles. It gave customers who were there very good detail about the programs that we offer, but it also connected them with the organizations that provide services that can help them beyond what SMUD can.

5) **Diversity Day.** I am excited to report that SMUD's Employee Resource Groups celebrated worldwide Diversity Day together this past month with an opportunity to learn more about our ERGs! May 21st commemorated the many diverse cultures from around the world. Our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB) Council and Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) – including our new ERG, ADAPT (Allies and Diverse Abilities Partnering Together) - gathered during lunchtime to celebrate with music, food and games. Dozens of employees signed up to be new ERG members! Thanks to all who organized and attended this great event!
<!-- Page 206 -->
6) **Awards.** In the awards category, I have some great kudos to share: Congratulations to Director Bui-Thompson on being recognized as this year's Conference of Asian American Professionals (CAAPS) AMA Outstanding Woman Leader! This award recognizes Asian Americans leading the way as role models for future generations. Also, congratulations to Director Tamayo on receiving the Special Loyalty Award at this year's Filipino Fiesta of Sacramento in honor of his constant support over the years.

7) **Board Video.** Tonight’s video is about our Time-of-Day (TOD) cost estimator tool on smud.org. This tool was created in house by SMUD staff when we introduced TOD rates, and it received a recent overhaul. As you will see in the video, the tool makes it simple for customers to create a customized estimate of the cost to run different appliances in their homes. And, by seeing how much things cost to operate at different times of day, they can see a variety of easy ways to save energy and money on their bills.

President Herber requested the Summary of Board Direction, but there were no items.

No further business appearing, President Herber adjourned the meeting at 5:43 p.m.

To: Public Comment  
Subject: [EXTERNAL] FIC unfair  
Date: Friday, May 24, 2024 2:55:06 PM  

CAUTION: This email originated from outside of SMUD. Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe.  

This, again, is a comment about the unfairness of the fixed infrastructure charge (FIC). While the FIC is 24.15, my actual April 2024 energy use charge is 7.84. Last month a board member responded "In the past--before the FIC--the p;er kWh rate covered that cost...but that meant that people who used a lot of energy were paying far more than their share of the fixed costs." What?, how is it fair to put a greater burden on those who seek to conserve energy and subsidize the cost to those who live in large houses, or just make no effort to conserve. Further, most aspects of operating a business might be viewed as a fixed cost. Salaries of your employees likely among users by fairly distributing TOTAL cost per kWh. Otherwise, the result is subsidization of higher energy users by those who consume less energy. I note that PG&E recently got approval from the PUC to get on the bandwagon for billing of a FIC rate + a rate for usage. Monkey see . . . monkey do. Public utilities like SMUD that devote a great deal of effort toward convincing the community of users about forward thinking approaches should wake-up and lead the way toward true fairness in the distribution of costs.

SoftwareAG negotiated a sale of its software (which included the functionality SMUD uses) to IBM effective July 1, 2024. The terms of the deal included IBM’s intent to cancel and renegotiate any new contracts or contract renewals that were not executed prior to July 1, 2024.  

The CEO executed the contract to ensure continuity of service. The contract renewal included provisions for new outage management system (OMS) integration environment, options for early termination, and a cost savings of a minimum of $2.7 million over the five-year duration of the contract.  

**Board Policy:**  
Governance Process GP-3, Board Job Description: i) Take such other actions as may be required by law.  

**Benefits:**  
Execution of the renewal resulted in substantial cost savings pursuant to completed negotiations and avoided costly and time-consuming disruption associated with transition to another product.  

**Cost/Budgeted:**

**License Metrics**

**Instance:**  
Products licensed by 'Instance' are limited to use by a total number of instances that does not exceed the licensed quantity above. For this purpose, an 'instance' is either a single installation of the executable software, running on one server, or a set of containers containing data on a disk array managed by a server. Each additional installation of the executable software running on the same or different disk or array, requires a license for additional Instances.

**Metered Add-On:**  
Products licensed by 'Metered Add-On' may be installed on any number of servers or containers, provided such Product is directly installed within or connected to a Product that is Metered. Such Products may not be used on a stand-alone basis.

**Metered:**  
Products licensed by 'Metered' may be installed on any number of servers or containers, provided such Product is configured for the metered collection of usage data. Customer will either (i) allow such Products to automatically report usage to Supplier on an hourly basis by providing an outbound internet connection for all such Products and installing versions of such Products that support metering or (ii) report usage of such Products to Supplier at least once per month, using tools or processes provided or approved by Supplier.

**Named User:**  
Products licensed by 'Named User' are limited to use by a total number of users that does not exceed the licensed quantity above. For these purposes, a 'user' means a uniquely identified individual, entity (e.g., interface), device or process that accesses, operates, or maintains such Product.

**Processor Core Type:**  
Software licensed by 'Processor Core Type' is limited to use on the licensed number of physical Processor Cores above in the licensed Processor Core Type above. A Processor Core is a collection of one or more processor threads and a set of shared execution resources on a processor and a Processor Core Type is the performance class of the processor as determined by Supplier from time to time (a copy of the current version of which is available at [https://empower.softwareag.com/sl2sec/SecuredServices/Announcement/Processor/table.htm](https://empower.softwareag.com/sl2sec/SecuredServices/Announcement/Processor/table.htm) and is copied below). Customer is permitted to use virtualization technology (e.g., creating virtual machines that act like a separate computer with its own operating system). Each virtual processor core is equal to one physical processor core. Only (virtual) processor cores that are configured within the virtual machine, container or similar partitioning technology running the Software are counted. The quantity of Software required to be licensed is based on the lower of the sum of virtual capacity (in whole numbers) or the full physical capacity of the hardware. (For example, (i) if the Software is running on 2 virtual machines with 5 virtual cores each and is hosted on physical hardware with a maximum physical capacity of 16 physical cores, then 10 Processor Cores must be licensed and (ii) if the Software is running on 4 virtual machines with 5 virtual cores each and is hosted on physical hardware with a maximum physical capacity of 16 cores, then 16 Processor Cores must be licensed.)

# SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT  
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
### For the Five Months Ended May 31, 2024  

**Net Position**  
- The change in net position is an increase of $34.9 million compared to a budgeted decrease of $59.3 million, resulting in a favorable variance of $94.2 million.  

**Revenues**  
- Revenues from sales to customers were $570.2 million, which was $2.4 million higher than planned. The increase is primarily due to:  
  - Higher commercial sales of $7.0 million primarily due to higher customer usage.  
  - Lower residential sales of $6.1 million primarily due to lower customer usage.  
  - No actual provision for uncollectible accounts compared to a budget of $1.3 million. The current balance of the accumulated provision is sufficient to cover write-offs of arrears.  
- Revenues under the California Global Warming Solutions Act (Assembly Bill [AB] – 32) were $19.7 million. This is due to carbon allowances sold through the state sanctioned quarterly auctions.  
- Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) revenues were $3.4 million due to LCFS credit sales.  
- Other electric revenues were $3.6 million higher due to higher unplanned interconnection fees, transmission revenue, and Sacramento Power Academy revenue.  
- Non-cash revenues transferred to the rate stabilization fund were $32.4 million, of which $19.7 million was for AB-32, $3.9 million was for the annual WAPA Hydro Generation Adjustment and $3.4 million was for LCFS. Funds are deferred until SMUD has qualified program expenses (projects that reduce carbon emissions or electric vehicle programs) to recognize revenue.  
- Non-cash revenues transferred from the rate stabilization fund were $36.0 million, which is $26.1 million higher than plan. The increase is primarily due to $23.4 million of revenue recognized for AB-32 and $8.3 million for revenue recognized for the annual Hydro Generation Adjustment.  

**Commodities, Purchased Power, and Production**  
- SMUD’s generation was lower by 204 GWh (6.6 percent); JPA and other generation was lower by 236 GWh (10.4 percent); and Hydro generation was higher by 32 GWh (3.9 percent).  
- Purchased power expense of $126.6 million, less surplus power sales of $49.3 million was $77.3 million, which was $4.0 million higher than planned. This increase is due to lower thermal generation that led to increased market purchases at favorable market prices.  
- Production operations cost of $144.8 million, less surplus gas sales of $37.3 million, was $107.5 million, which was $23.8 million lower than planned.  
  - Fuel costs of $90.9 million less surplus gas sales of $37.3 million, was $53.6 million, which was $19.9 million lower than planned. Thermal generation has decreased due to an unplanned outage for the steam turbine generator repair at the Carson plant and it was more economical to replace with hydro generation and market purchases.  
- The “power margin”, or sales to customers less cost of purchased power, production operations costs and gas hedges included in investment revenue was $384.3 million, which was $21.1 million higher than planned. The power margin as a percentage of sales to customers was 67.4 percent, which was 3.4 percent higher than planned. This is primarily due to lower production costs due to lower fuel costs.  

**Other Operating Expenses**  
- All other operating expenses were $435.0 million, which was $7.0 million higher than planned.  
  - Transmission and distribution operations expenses were down $7.2 million primarily due to lower transmission fees as a result of using more hydro generation and higher WAPA purchases than planned.  
  - Customer service and information expenses were down $3.9 million due to lower participation in My Energy Optimizer Partner and Peak Conserve programs and lower participation in the Commercial and Residential Greenergy programs.  
  - Administrative & General expenses were up $7.2 million primarily due to bond issuance costs and costs related to the February storm.  
<!-- Page 226 -->
- Public Good expenses were $2.9 million higher than planned primarily due to increased HVAC and rebate volume in the Advanced Homes Solutions program. Also, higher than planned project completions in Smart Homes and earlier start in low income building electrification program initiatives.
- Production maintenance expenses were $1.3 million higher than planned due to unplanned major repair at the Carson plant.
- Transmission and distribution maintenance expenses were $2.2 million higher than planned primarily due to higher costs related to the February storm response, offset by lower expenses than planned related to vegetation maintenance of transmission and distribution lines.
- Non-cash depreciation and amortization is higher by $4.2 million primarily due to the unplanned amortization of software subscription assets.

Non-operating Revenues and Expenses
- Other revenue, net, was $58.3 million higher than planned primarily due to a business interruption insurance recovery payment of $51.4 million related to the Cosumnes Power Plant and a settlement payment of $5.8 million related to the Rancho Seco annual spent fuel settlement, and higher interest income.
