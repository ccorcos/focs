![Required communication](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=Required+communication)

**Consideration of fraud**

Under AICPA audit standards we are required to make inquiries of management, and those charged with governance to obtain their views about the risk of fraud and how those risks are addressed. Questions we must ask include:

- Does the Committee or Management have knowledge of any fraud or suspected fraud?
- Were any items reported under the Organization’s whistleblower policy in the past year?
- What are the Committee’s and Management’s views about the risks of fraud within the Organization and grant compliance (any areas of concern or focus)?
- Are there any matters that the members of the Committee or Management believe warrant attention by the auditors?

# Areas of audit emphasis:

## Federal award programs audit
