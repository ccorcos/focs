Procurement  

**NARRATIVE:**  
**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and execute a sole source contract with Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to provide market and technical research services to SMUD for the five-year period from January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2029, for a not-to-exceed amount of $6 million.

**Summary:**  
EPRI is a non-profit organization, funded by utility membership participation in its research activities. EPRI members represent more than 90% of the electricity generated and delivered in the U.S. In 2022, SMUD entered into a Master Agreement for EPRI Membership Participation, the terms of which govern the research selected under the 2025-2029 Research Portfolio Agreement. SMUD is a member of EPRI and has for many years evaluated EPRI's annual programs to determine if they will bring value to SMUD and are aligned with SMUD research plans for that given year. Past research areas that SMUD joined have included renewable resources and integration, electric transportation and energy storage. This request is to authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and execute a sole source contract with EPRI over multiple years (2025-2029) for a not-to-exceed amount of $6 million. Under the existing Master Agreement with EPRI, these may include elements necessary to participate in EPRI's Annual Research Portfolio and EPRI’s supplemental projects and to procure EPRI’s services. In the past, SMUD has taken one-year agreements with EPRI to the Board, but this five-year approach results in a 25% discount on the EPRI program prices to SMUD. For 2025, SMUD Research & Development (R&D) staff have selected the following EPRI collaborative research, development and demonstration (R&D) programs. Over the next five years, SMUD retains flexibility to add additional programs of value and R&D will help the enterprise assess the optimal portfolio of programs for each year. The following table contains the program selections identified by SMUD R&D staff for 2025. Specific program areas for subsequent years will be determined by SMUD staff based on value to SMUD and alignment with SMUD research plans:

| Research Area | Program | Program Description | Price |
|---|---|---|---|
| Advanced Generation | 221 | Bulk Energy Storage | $32,480 |
| Advanced Generation | 222 | Advanced Generation & Carbon Capture and Storage | $32,480 |
| Renewable Energy | 208 | Hydropower Generation | $32,480 |
| Thermal Optimization and Emissions Controls | 223 | Heat Rate and Flexibility | $32,479 |
| Transmission and Substations | 34 | Transmission Asset Management | $29,513 |
| Transmission and Substations | 173 | Bulk System Integration of Renewables and DERS | $70,425 |
| Transmission and Substations | 37.11 | Substation Physical Security | $6,875 |

**2025 Total Cost to SMUD:** $693,865

**Recommendation:** Issue a Sole Source contract

**Award to:**  
Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)  
3420 Hillview Ave  
Palo Alto, CA 94304  

**Board Policy:**

Supports: Strategic Direction SD-9, Resource Planning; Strategic Direction SD-6 Safety Leadership; Strategic Direction SD-7, Environmental Leadership; Strategic Direction SD-2, Competitive Rates

**Benefits:**  
EPRI is the only known source in the United States providing this collaborative service where SMUD can leverage significant research funds with other utilities around the country. The SMUD cost share is just a percentage of the actual value (cost) of each program and program development allows for SMUD input. The resulting products could not be consistently obtained by SMUD at a comparable price. This research supports SMUD’s Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) and Zero Carbon goals.

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
$6,000,000; Budgeted for 2025-2029 by the Research and Development team.

**Alternatives:**  
Do not approve and lose the ability to leverage the ability to conduct research activities with the EPRI membership providing cost share.

**Affected Parties:**  
Research & Development, Distributed Energy Solutions, Grid Planning & Operations, IT Strategic Initiatives, Environmental Services, Vegetation Management, Sustainable Communities, Health & Safety Services, Government Affairs, Generation Management, Resource Planning, Customer Solutions, Supply Chain Services, and EPRI

  - Higher commercial sales of $17.3 million primarily due to higher customer usage.  
  - No actual provision for uncollectible accounts compared to a budget of $2.5 million. The current balance of the accumulated provision is sufficient to cover write-offs of arrears.  

- Revenues under the California Global Warming Solutions Act (Assembly Bill [AB] – 32) were $27.3 million. This is due to carbon allowances sold through the state sanctioned quarterly auctions.  
- Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) revenues were $7.0 million due to LCFS credit sales.  
- Other electric revenues were $9.9 million higher due to higher unplanned interconnection fees, transmission revenue, Sacramento Power Academy revenue, and miscellaneous service revenue.  
- Non-cash revenues transferred to the rate stabilization fund were $46.1 million, of which $29.8 million was for AB-32, $9.3 million was for the annual WAPA Hydro Generation Adjustment and $7.0 million was for LCFS. AB-32 and LCFS funds are deferred until SMUD has qualified program expenses (projects that reduce carbon emissions or electric vehicle programs) to recognize revenue.  
- Non-cash revenues transferred from the rate stabilization fund were $42.0 million, of which $21.5 million was for revenue recognized for AB-32, $12.3 million was for LCFS and Community Impact Plan, and $8.3 million was for revenue recognized for the annual Hydro Generation Adjustment.  

**Commodities, Purchased Power, and Production**  
- SMUD’s generation was lower by 1,082 GWh (15.1 percent); JPA and other generation was lower by 880 GWh (15.5 percent); and Hydro generation was lower by 202 GWh (13.3 percent).  
- Purchased power revenue of $360.2 million, less surplus power sales of $115.4 million was $244.8 million, which was $55.0 million higher than planned. This increase is due to lower hydro and thermal generation that led to increased market purchases at favorable market prices.  
- Production operations cost of $282.4 million, less surplus gas sales of $74.5 million, was $207.9 million, which was $80.9 million lower than planned.  
  - Fuel costs of $162.3 million less surplus gas sales of $74.5 million, was $87.8 million, which was $65.9 million lower than planned. Fuel costs were lower due to decrease in thermal generation from unplanned major overhauls costs at the Carson and Procter & Gamble plants and it was more economical to replace the thermal generation with market purchases.  
- The “power margin”, or sales to customers less cost of purchased power, production operations costs and gas hedges included in investment revenue was $1,085.0 million, which was $72.8 million higher than planned. The power margin as a percentage of sales to customers was 70.4 percent, which was 2.5 percent higher than planned. This is primarily due to lower production costs due to lower fuel costs and higher customer sales.  

**Other Operating Expenses**  
- All other operating expenses were $856.4 million, which was $13.1 million lower than planned.  
  - Transmission and distribution operations expenses were down $8.3 million primarily due to lower cost of transmission fees than planned.  
  - Customer account expenses were over $1.5 million primarily due to higher labor due to new customer representative class in contact center operations.  
  - Customer service and information expenses were down $6.9 million due to lower participation in EV equity incentive programs, My Energy Optimizer Partner, and Peak Conserve programs.  
  - Public Good expenses were $5.1 million higher than planned primarily due to more participation in energy efficiency programs and low income building electrification program initiatives.  
<!-- Page 18 -->
- Production maintenance expenses were $2.1 million lower than planned. This is primarily due to lower hydro maintenance costs offset by higher power plant overhaul expenses.
- Transmission and distribution maintenance expenses were $5.8 million lower than planned. This is primarily due to the recent operational changes in the vegetation maintenance of transmission and distribution lines.
- Non-cash depreciation and amortization is higher by $3.4 million primarily due to the unplanned amortization of software subscription based assets.

### Non-operating Revenues and Expenses
- Other revenue, net, was $118.7 million higher than planned primarily due to a business interruption insurance recovery payment of $88.9 million related to the Cosumnes Power Plant outage claim, a settlement payment of $7.5 million related to Substation A fire claim, $5.8 million related to the Rancho Seco annual spent fuel settlement, grant revenue of $2.8 million, and higher interest income of $14.2 million, all offset by higher investment expense of $3.1 million due to natural gas hedging activity.
- Interest charges were $2.3 million lower than planned due to lower commercial paper interest expense due to early repayment in May.
