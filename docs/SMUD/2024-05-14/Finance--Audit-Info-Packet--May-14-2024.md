**NARRATIVE:**  
**Requested Action:** Adopt the 2024 Update to SMUD’s 2023-2025 Wildfire Mitigation Plan.  

**Summary:**  
Senate Bill 201 (2018) and Assembly Bill 1054 (2019) revised Public Utilities Code section 8387 to require that before January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter, every publicly owned electric utility prepare a wildfire mitigation plan (WMP), present it in a noticed public meeting, and accept comments. Section 8387 also requires that the utility contract with a qualified independent evaluator experienced in assessing the safe operation of electrical infrastructure to review and assess the comprehensiveness of the utility’s WMP. The evaluator shall issue a report and present the report at a public meeting. On or before July 1 of each year public owned electric utilities must submit their approved WMPs to the California Wildfire Safety Advisory Board (WSAB) for review, comment, and advisory opinion. At least once every three years, the submission shall be a comprehensive revision of the plan.  

By Resolution 19-10-09, the Board adopted SMUD’s initial Wildfire Mitigation Plan and authorized the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to make future changes to the WMP that further the primary purpose of the WMP and provide a net benefit to SMUD. By Resolution each year following, the Board adopted SMUD’s annual WMP update. In 2023 SMUD conducted a comprehensive review and revision of its WMP, which was adopted by Board Resolution 23-06-05 after an extensive public outreach effort. The 2023-2025 WMP was reviewed by a qualified independent evaluator, and their report was presented to the Board. The 2023-2025 WMP was duly submitted to the WSAB prior to July 1, 2023.  

In accordance with Section 8387, SMUD staff has completed its annual review and update of SMUD’s WMP. The 2024 update to SMUD’s 2023-2025 WMP provides an update on SMUD’s wildfire prevention and mitigation programs and efforts. The draft 2024 WMP update was offered for public comment for thirty days, following normal process. The 2024 update does not include any significant updates, and an update to the independent evaluation was deemed not necessary.  

**Board Policy (Number & Title):**  
Strategic Direction SD-4, Reliability; Strategic Direction SD-6, Safety Leadership; Strategic Direction SD-15, Outreach and Communication; Strategic Direction SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management  

**Benefits:**  
The WMP Update is in alignment with SD-4, Reliability, that SMUD will maintain the electric system in good repair, and SD-6, Safety Leadership, that SMUD will implement measures to protect the public from injuries related to SMUD operations or facilities. Additionally, this item is consistent with SD-15, Outreach and Communication, that SMUD will ensure all groups are aware of SMUD’s major decisions and programs. This item is consistent with SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management, in maintaining an integrated enterprise risk management process.  

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
The programs outlined in the WMP are budgeted in separate processes by the sponsoring departments.  

**Alternatives:**  
California law requires the WMP to be presented to the Board in a noticed public meeting.

# 1 Executive Summary

SMUD adopted a three-year Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP) in 2023. This 2023-2025 WMP was a comprehensive update of SMUD's WMP and included a risk assessment, analysis on the impact of climate change, descriptions of prevention and mitigation initiatives, discussion of project updates and outcomes, and metrics to evaluate the WMP performance. This 2024 update to the 2023-2025 WMP outlines progress made on several multi-year projects and provides other minor updates to reported initiatives.

## Projects
The multi-year projects outlined in SMUD’s 2023 comprehensive update are complete or on-track with one exception. Although SMUD’s service territory is outside the CPUC’s High Fire Threat District (HFTD), SMUD has been installing Cal FIRE exempt arrestors, connectors, and fuses in the Pole Clearing Area (PCA). In late 2023, a manufacturer of a particular fuse holder halted production and shipments to utilities. This has caused a slight disruption in the overall project. SMUD staff and vendors are exploring alternatives in addition to working with the vendor to see if production will be resumed with a design change. SMUD staff have adjusted the plan to continue installing other hardware that have not been impacted. Overall project completion target remains the same, however, this target may be adjusted if hardware remains unavailable.

## Risk management
The bulk of SMUD’s efforts continue to be reducing fuel around our facilities to reduce ignition risk. Winter season arrived late in 2022. The late winter season allowed vegetation contractors to continue working in our highest fire risk Upper American River Project (UARP) area late into the fall of 2022, enabling us to get ahead of the scheduled 2023 work. As a result of this accelerated work, 2023 vegetation removal activities in the UARP concluded much earlier than planned. Earlier completion allowed SMUD to lower its wildfire risk in the UARP prior to the hot-dry months of August and September.

Northern CA has benefited from atmospheric rivers and snowpacks that have delivered above average rain and water totals in 2023 and 2024. The late wet winter/spring resulted in a shortened and mild wildfire season for Northern CA in 2023. The outlook for wildland fire potential in Northern California looks similar for 2024¹.

The various programs and projects described in the 2023-2025 WMP continue to provide a comprehensive and innovative approach to SMUD’s wildfire risk reduction.

### 1.1 Document Introduction
The numbered sections in this 2024 WMP update are intended to replace the respective numbered sections within the 2023 – 2025 WMP published in July 2023.

5.1 CAL FIRE Fire Resource and Assessment Program (FRAP)  
CAL FIRE publishes multiple maps related to fire threat throughout the state. SMUD refers to the Fire Hazard Severity Zone (FHSZ) for many years to inform and plan maintenance activities. CAL FIRE published new FHSZ map in April 2024. The new map depicts slight changes in fire hazard severity in the PCA. SMUD staff have begun the process of importing the map data. SMUD staff will analyze the impacts of the new map and adjust SMUD’s mitigation programs as needed. However, CAL FIRE has not published a new map depicting FHSZ for Local Responsibility Area (LRA) and Federal Responsibility Area (FRA). The LRA and FRA depict fire hazard within Sacramento County areas, and portions of the UARP where SMUD has transmission lines respectively. SMUD staff will continue monitoring CAL FIRE’s website for updates to these two maps.

Although SMUD takes CAL FIRE’s FHSZ mapping into consideration as part of its wildfire mitigation planning, SMUD’s Wildfire Mitigation Plan references the CPUC Fire Threat Map that focuses on the risk of utility associated wildfires.

6.2 Transmission grid operational practices

6.2.1 Disabling reclosing  
All Valley 115 kV, 230 kV and UARP 69 kV, 230 kV transmission auto reclosers are disabled and will remain disabled to mitigate wildfire risks. The disabling of reclosing follows fire season described in 6.1.1.

6.2.2 Planned de-energization during fire season  
SMUD’s Power System Operators (PSO) have the authority to de-energize portions or all the Valley and UARP transmission line(s) for safety, reliability, conditions beyond design criteria, threat of wildfires and during emergency conditions when requested by local law enforcement or fire officials. Per existing protocols, de-energizations are coordinated with interconnected agencies.

During active fire season as declared by CAL FIRE the PSO is authorized to de-energize portions or all the Valley and UARP transmission line(s) when there is imminent fire danger, mandatory fire orders are in effect, and/or the transmission system is experiencing conditions beyond design criteria. The PSO will take a combination of many factors into consideration when implementing de-energization procedures, which include the triggers listed below, as well as power system knowledge and potential community impacts. De-energization decisions require a balancing of all these factors as well as a knowledge of the area and operation of the power system. No single element is determinative.

- Extreme fire danger threat levels, as classified by the National Fire Danger Rating System
- A RFW declaration by the National Weather Service
- Low humidity levels lower than what is required for a RFW
- Sustained winds exceeding design standards
- Site-specific conditions such as temperature, terrain, and local climate
- Critically dry vegetation that could serve as fuel for a wildfire
- On-the-ground, real-time observation from SMUD or other agency field staff

The PSO utilizes various operational and situational awareness tools to determine when de-energization is appropriate. The tools are listed below:

### 6.6 Enhancement and mitigation projects
SMUD forecasts and plans for upcoming work several years in advance. This planning process allows adequate level of staffing and funding for needed projects. This section identifies the specific upcoming projects that help reduce SMUD’s wildfire risk.

#### 6.6.2 Replace #6 Copper conductors in PCA
- **Status:** Completed 2023
- **Start Date:** 2021
- **Expected Completion:** 2023

This project targets SMUD’s PCA for removal of #6 copper conductors and replacement with heavier gauge aluminum. The project was proposed in conjunction with Eagle Take Permit mitigation work to reduce avian contacts issued in connection with the expansion of SMUD’s Wind Farm in Solano County. The mitigation activity involves re-framing approximately 185 poles to increase overhead conductor spacing.

#### 6.6.4 UARP Fuels Reduction
- **Status:** Completed 2023
- **Start Date:** 2019
- **Expected Completion:** 2023

This project is designed to help protect the UARP transmission lines and strengthen the fire break value it provides. The project area includes the entire length of SMUD’s UARP transmission line within the existing right-of-way corridor plus approximately 200 feet on each side. Project treatments are designed to increase the area of forest lands treated for fuels reduction and prescribed fire and contribute to the longer-term restoration of the Crystal Basin forested landscape. Implementation measures will reduce the density of surface and ladder fuels by mechanical thinning, masticating, and hand crew work as part of a larger suite of silvicultural prescriptions that restore mixed conifer composition, health, and vigor. The project seeks to establish conditions that allow for a mosaic of multiple age class forest stands, variation in tree size, density, and species composition through treatments that retain the largest trees while establishing conditions that allow for safe and efficient fire suppression, especially around private inholdings of Sierra foothill communities.

### 6.6.5 Install SCADA reclosers in PCA

**Status:** Deferred 2025 to 2027 due to unforeseen design and supply chain constraints  
**Start Date:** 2025  
**Expected Completion:** 2027  

The existing 12kV feeders serving PCA customers are non-SCADA. This project will install SCADA enabled reclosers on feeders that serves SMUD’s PCA customers. The SCADA reclosers will provide distribution operators visibility to the circuits and ability to operate the recloser remotely, including remotely disabling the reclosing function. The SCADA enabled reclosers will have modern microprocessor-based controllers, which will provide SMUD engineers the flexibility of fast-trip settings during fire season, and normal settings for improved reliability during storm season. Visibility to circuit’s measured values will provide distribution operators the ability to remotely de-energize the circuit(s) when conditions warrant or when requested by emergency response personnel.

### 7.2 Public and agency communications for a potential wildfire

Public safety is a guiding principle at SMUD. While SMUD's WMP activities are designed to mitigate wildfire danger, in instances of high fire threat conditions, interruption of electrical service by de-energizing powerlines may be necessary as a last resort. De-energizing powerlines may be the safest approach and makes sense if the risk of a wildfire starting and spreading is severe. SMUD proactively communicates with customers and key stakeholders through multiple channels about preparing for potential power outages, and the power restoration process. SMUD recognizes that many entities and individuals are particularly vulnerable during, to, during and after an event.

This proactive communication is utilized for:

1. A wildfire threat to localized circuits within the SMUD service territory that results in localized de-energization.
2. A wildfire threat to SMUD’s UARP hydroelectric generation and transmission system that results in a de-energization event causing a capacity/energy shortage (rotating outages).
3. A wildfire threat to a major shared transmission line(s) that impacts the statewide grid or parts of it and creates a resource shortage for the utilities, including SMUD, that rely on the resources the line(s) provides.

SMUD has implemented an opt-in program on smud.org that allows for vulnerable populations to receive additional information or notifications in the unlikely event of a wildfire in SMUD service territory.

Among SMUD’s most vulnerable customers are those enrolled in the Medical Equipment Discount Rate program (MED rate). These customers rely on specialized medical equipment that may require power. SMUD also has a Vulnerable Customer program which allows customers to self-identify as vulnerable for concerns not covered by our MED Rate, we include our Energy Assistance Program Rate (EAPR) and 3rd Party/Senior Id customers in this group. SMUD has more than 13,000 customers who rely on specialized medical equipment and who are enrolled in the MED rate program, 3rd Party/Senior ID program or enrolled in our Vulnerable Customer program. Additionally, SMUD has nearly 90,000 customers participating in our EAPR program. SMUD will send these customers an email or letter each year to remind them of the risk of wildfire danger, to have an emergency back-up plan if an outage occurs, to update their contact information and refer them to [Smud.org/wildfiresafety](https://smud.org/wildfiresafety) for more information.

All SMUD customers can visit the [smud.org/wildfiresafety](https://smud.org/wildfiresafety) webpage where they’ll be able to find:

# WMP 2023 – 2025 | 2024 Update | Public Review Draft

## 9.1 Effectiveness of the WMP

In the initial WMP, SMUD staff identified metrics that met the criteria of PUC 8387. These identified metrics were general in nature. Since those initial metric criteria were identified, the wildfire planning process has continued to develop, and SMUD has received independent evaluation of its WMP. In response to the industry’s maturing understanding of wildfire metrics and recommendations received, SMUD undertook a multi-step effort to identify new metrics that can better gauge the success of its many programs and mitigation activities outlined in the WMP.

The first step in this multi-step effort was to assess, identify and establish useful metrics that best measure the activities related to minimizing the probability that SMUD’s transmission and distribution system may be the origin or contributing source for the ignition of a wildfire. Metrics identified in this section are measures of quantitative assessment that will be used for assessing, comparing, and tracking performance of the programs and efforts identified in this WMP. This step was completed and reflected in the metrics identified in this WMP.

The second step is to define the benchmarks associated with the metrics. The purpose of these benchmarks is to establish criteria to measure performance of the various activities. Some activities can be measured with specific units of work that are forecasted at the beginning of a year, such as quantities of inspected units etc. Progress towards these forecasted units would indicate on- or off-track completion cadence, which can be adjusted as needed during the year. Other metrics are identified to count uncontrollable units that indicate performance of the grid, such as outage event counts or number of corrective action findings. Development of these benchmarks will require several years of data to determine trendlines and averages. Data collection for the new metrics began in 2021. Following existing practices, SMUD anticipates five years of data will be required to establish the benchmarks, with a target period in 2026.

The third and final step is to determine or define the percentage reduction targets against the benchmarks. Percent reductions against benchmarks would need to be realistic, and not easily achievable. SMUD anticipates the initial benchmarks would require fine adjustments periodically to ensure continued effort towards risk reduction activities. These benchmarks and adjustments will be reflected in SMUD’s annual WMP updates.

### 9.1.1 Metrics and assumptions for measuring WMP performance

SMUD will track the following metrics to measure the performance of this WMP, and its effectiveness in reducing catastrophic wildfire. These new set of metrics are more granular and targeted towards specific maintenance activities that can more closely be tied to performance of the WMP.

Work is identified in annual work plans authorized on an executive level, and work that remains incomplete will be flagged in future work plans. Work may be field-verified and open work notifications are regularly reviewed to allow management to prioritize work in accordance with current risks. SMUD’s target is always to complete 100 percent of the work within the initially scheduled time frame. However, emergencies or other unforeseen contingencies can occur that require material and labor resources to be otherwise assigned. In this instance delayed work will be prioritized in following time periods. All work is completed within time periods to allow for the safe and reliable operation of the electric system in accordance with applicable requirements and industry standards.

The Inspection Program Performance metrics shown in Table 88 are based on inspection activities for targeted areas. These are key performance indicators (KPI) based metrics, with specific targets for completion within a year.

## 9.1.2 Outcome Metrics

Two sets of outcome metrics were identified that measure performance of the grid. These metrics replace the more general “ignition events” identified in previous WMPs, which couldn’t directly be tied to risk categories. The outcome metrics shown in Table 9 are consistent with GO95 Rule 181¹ repair priority levels.

### Table 9 Grid Condition Findings

| Grid Condition Findings (Non KPI) |
|-----------------------------------|
| Number of GO95 Rule 18 Level 1 findings, Distribution, PCA |
| Number of GO95 Rule 18 Level 1 findings, Transmission, PCA |

# SMUD BOARD POLICY
**Category:** Board-Staff Linkage  
**Policy No.:** BL-8  
**Title:** Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Procurement  

The procurement of goods and services is an integral part of SMUD operations. SMUD’s procurement activities shall take place in accordance with the following principles:

a) **Competition:** SMUD’s procurement activities shall be competitive whenever practical.

b) **Direct Procurement:** Direct procurement may be utilized when it is in SMUD’s best interest. Direct procurement is the purchase of goods or services without competition when multiple sources of supply are available.

c) **Sole Source Procurement:** Sole source procurement shall be performed only in the case of emergency or when a competitive process would be an idle act.

d) **Inclusiveness:** SMUD’s procurement practices shall promote inclusiveness of the entire supplier community in its contracting opportunities.

e) **Economic Development:** SMUD’s procurement practices shall promote the economic development of the community we serve.

f) **Environmental Procurement:** SMUD shall minimize the impact on the environment through its procurement practices. In making procurement decisions, staff shall consider the environmental impacts in assessing total cost and benefits.

g) **Responsible Bidder:** SMUD shall only do business with reputable and responsible suppliers. A Responsible Bidder demonstrates trustworthiness, quality, capacity, financial capability, fair labor practices, and experience to satisfactorily perform SMUD work through the bidding and evaluation process. In addition, SMUD will determine Responsible Bidders by considering a supplier’s social, environmental ethical, and safety accountability where applicable.

h) **Supplier Code of Conduct:** SMUD shall set minimum expectations or standards for all suppliers to follow in the course of doing business with SMUD (in some cases by submitting data and reporting annually) including but not limited to, labor and human rights, environmental, social, governance (ESG), health and safety accountability, ethics and compliance, and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging practices.

i) **Best Value Procurement:** SMUD may procure goods and services by the best value at the lowest cost methodology, where cost and other factors are used to obtain the maximum value while ensuring a fair and equitable process.
<!-- Page 26 -->
j) Leveraged Procurement Agreement (LPA): SMUD may procure goods and services where another lead public agency or organization competitively procures the same goods or services under applicable state and federal laws to streamline procurement processes and leverage collective buying power of multiple agencies to achieve cost savings and other benefits to SMUD. Leveraged procurement agreements are generally referred to by other public agencies as “Cooperative Purchasing Agreements.”

k) Strategic Alliances: SMUD may enter into strategic alliance contracts for the procurement of goods or services. A Strategic Alliance is a competitively bid multi-year contract for goods and/or services in which the Supplier and SMUD work collaboratively over the life of the contract to improve quality, and to explore design and process improvements to reduce the cost of production, service delivery, and the total cost of ownership. These benefits are shared both by SMUD and the Supplier.

l) Supply Chain Risk: SMUD’s procurement activities shall identify, manage, and mitigate supply chain risks through a coordinated effort across the enterprise.

m) Protest Policy: SMUD shall ensure that suppliers are afforded the opportunity to have their grievances heard through a fair protest process.

n) Delegation of Authority to the CEO: The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager (CEO) is delegated authority to perform and approve the procurement activities in accordance with the below matrix. This delegation includes the authority to amend contracts for time extensions or other changes that create no additional cost to SMUD.

TO: Distribution  
DATE: April 30, 2024  
FROM: Kathy Ketchum / Lisa Limcaco  

SUBJECT: MARCH 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OPERATIONS DATA  

We are attaching the financial and operating reports for the three months of 2024. They include sales and generation statistics and other selected data.  

The change in net position is an increase of $51.0 million compared to a budgeted decrease of $38.8 million, resulting in a favorable variance of $89.8 million.  

We prepared these statements on the accrual basis of accounting, and they conform to generally accepted accounting principles. The bases for the budget amounts are:  

1) Budgeted electric revenues are based on the Forecast of Revenues by the Pricing Department, adjusted for unbilled revenues; and  

2) Budgeted operating expenses reflect the 2024 Budget approved by the Board of Directors on December 14, 2023.

# SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT  
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
### For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024  

**Net Position**  
- The change in net position is an increase of $51.0 million compared to a budgeted decrease of $38.8 million, resulting in a favorable variance of $89.8 million.  

**Revenues**  
- Revenues from sales to customers were $338.7 million, which was $3.4 million lower than planned. The decrease is primarily due to:  
  - Lower residential customer revenue of $7.9 million primarily due to lower customer usage.  
  - Higher commercial sales of $3.7 million primarily due to higher customer usage.  
  - Lower provision for uncollectible accounts of $0.8 million.  
- Revenues under the California Global Warming Solutions Act (Assembly Bill [AB] – 32) were $10.4 million. This is due to carbon allowances sold through the state sanctioned quarterly auctions.  
- Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) revenues were $3.4 million due to LCFS credit sales.  
- Other electric revenues were $2.5 million higher due to higher interconnection fees, transmission revenue, and Sacramento Power Academy revenue.  
- Non-cash revenues transferred to the rate stabilization fund were $13.9 million, of which $10.4 million was for AB-32 and $3.4 million was for LCFS. AB-32 and LCFS funds are deferred until SMUD has qualified program expenses (projects that reduce carbon emissions or electric vehicle programs) to recognize revenue.  
- Non-cash revenues transferred from the rate stabilization fund were $17.3 million, which is $11.9 million higher than plan. The increase is primarily due to $13.9 million of revenue recognized for AB-32 and $3.0 million of revenue recognized for LCFS.  

**Commodities, Purchased Power, and Production**  
- SMUD’s generation was lower by 149 GWh (7.3 percent); JPA and other generation was lower by 216 GWh (12.4 percent); and Hydro generation was higher by 67 GWh (22.4 percent).  
- Purchased power expense of $72.6 million, less surplus power sales of $37.8 million, was $34.8 million, which was $0.5 million higher than planned. This increase is due to lower thermal generation that led to increased market purchases at favorable market prices.  
- Production operations cost of $102.7 million, less surplus gas sales of $22.1 million, was $80.6 million, which was $19.1 million lower than planned.  
  - Fuel costs of $73.0 million less surplus gas sales of $22.1 million, was $50.9 million, which was $15.5 million lower than planned. Thermal generation has decreased due to an unplanned outage at the Carson plant and it was more economical to replace with hydro generation and market purchases.  
- The “power margin”, or sales to customers less cost of purchased power, production operations costs and gas hedges included in investment revenue was $224.2 million, which was $16.1 million higher than planned. The power margin as a percentage of sales to customers was 66.2 percent, which was 5.4 percent higher than planned. This is primarily due to lower production costs due to lower fuel costs offset by lower sales to customers.  

**Other Operating Expenses**  
- All other operating expenses were $249.9 million, which was $0.1 million lower than planned.  
  - Transmission and distribution operations expenses were down $4.1 million primarily due to lower transmission fees as a result of using more hydro generation than plan.  
  - Customer service and information expenses were down $2.7 million due to lower participation in My Energy Optimizer Partner and Peak Conserve programs and lower participation in the Commercial Greenergy program.  
  - Administrative & General expenses were $1.9 million primarily due to write-off of uncollectible non-electric billings, administrative costs related to the February storm, bond issuance costs, offset by a slower start to projects such as Agile product teams, Digital platform and SAP S4 HANA.  
<!-- Page 32 -->
- Public Good expenses were $1.0 million higher than planned primarily due to increased HVAC and rebate volume in the Advanced Homes Solutions program. Also, higher than planned project completions in Smart Homes and earlier start in low income building electrification program initiatives.
- Production maintenance expenses were $2.1 million lower than planned due to shifting from planned maintenance to unplanned major repair at the Carson plant.
- Transmission and distribution maintenance expenses were $3.3 million higher than planned primarily due to higher costs related to the February storm response, offset by lower expenses than planned related to SMUD’s Wildfire Mitigation Plan.
- Non-cash depreciation and amortization is higher by $2.6 million primarily due to amortization of software subscription assets.

Non-operating Revenues and Expenses
- Other revenue, net, was $59.5 million higher than planned primarily due to a business interruption insurance recovery payment of $51.4 million related to the Cosumnes Power Plant and a settlement payment of $5.8 million related to the Rancho Seco annual spent fuel settlement, and higher interest income.
