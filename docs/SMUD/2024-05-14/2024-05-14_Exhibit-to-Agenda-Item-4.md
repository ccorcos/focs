**Customer Revenue**  
$339 Million  
$3M or 1.0% lower customer revenues than budgeted (unfavorable)  
• Customer revenue is below target primarily due to lower customer usage from our residential customers offset by higher customer usage from our commercial customers.

**Commodity**  
$126 Million  
$21M or 14.1% lower commodity expenditures than budgeted (favorable)  
• Production costs were under target due to increase hydro generation and lower fuels costs from the reduction in thermal generation.

**Other Operating Expenses**  
$240 Million  
$2M or 0.8% higher expenditures than budgeted (unfavorable)  
• Public good expenses $1.0M higher due to higher than planned rebate volume in Advanced Home Solutions and building electrification programs.  
• Administrative & general expenses $1.9M higher due to storm response expense and bond issuance costs  
• Customer service & information expenses $2.7M lower due to updated planned rollout schedule for My Energy Optimizer Partner and Peak Conserve programs.

**Other Non-Operating Revenues**  
$74 Million  
$59M or 417.4% higher than budgeted (favorable)  
• Primarily due to insurance recovery payment on Cosumnes power plant business interruption insurance claim, Rancho Seco settlement payment and interest income.

*There are $4M other net revenues not included in the highlights above*
