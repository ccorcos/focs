| Natural gas generation repurposing |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Renewable generation prerequisites |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Annual Reliability Studies |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  | McClellan | Campbell |  |  |  |  |  |
| Country Acres: 344 MW solar + 172 MW storage |  |  |  |  | Coyote Creek: 200 MW solar + 100 MW storage |  |  |  |  |  |
| Replacement Projects Delayed to 2026 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Project Schedule Update:**
- Country Acres and Coyote Creek: online dates delayed to late 2026.
- McClellan and Campbell: transition is delayed since required replacements are delayed.
- New reliability studies are needed given these delays and new resources being evaluated.
- A new schedule will be shared in the 2025 update.

# New Technology Update
## Sutter Carbon Capture and Sequestration Project

- **Update:** Calpine was awarded up to $270 million in Q4 2023 by the U.S. Department of Energy to add carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to the existing Sutter Energy Center.

- SMUD’s interest is to potentially purchase clean energy under a power purchase agreement (PPA).

- Up to 1.7 million metric tons of GHG stored annually.

- Calpine is working to complete the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) study which will inform PPA pricing.

- **Next Steps:** SMUD to discuss a potential PPA with the Board in 2025.

# New Technology Update
## Hydrogen Grants through ARCHES*

### Concept 1: Electrolytic Hydrogen Production
- Partnership with Air Products and Chemical, Inc, Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD), and ARCHES.
- **Focus:** demonstrate & deploy hydrogen production for use at CPP.
- Continue to participate in ARCHES stakeholder meeting to represent SMUD's interest and prepare Tier 1 project detail requirements.
- Perform Feasibility Study to establish a high-level overview of technical and economic viability including a Pre-Front End Engineering Design Study (FEED).

### Concept 2: Thermochemical Biomass Gasification to Hydrogen
- Partnership with Mote, Inc., SMAQMD, and El Dorado Forest Working Group.
- **Focus:** convert wood waste to hydrogen fuel and carbon sequestration producing ~60 TPD of hydrogen fuel, and annual carbon reduction of up to 400k tons. SMUD would be off-taker of hydrogen fuel.
- Site Locations being explored.
- Continue to participate in stakeholder meeting in ARCHES to represent SMUD's interest and prepare Tier 1 project detail requirements.
