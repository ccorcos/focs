1. Background  
   Strategic Direction SD-6, Safety Leadership states that:  
   Creating a safe environment for employees and the public is a core value of SMUD.  
   Through best practice methods and continuous improvement, SMUD will be recognized as a leader in employee safety while also assuring the safety of the public related to SMUD operations and facilities. SMUD commits to a proactive approach, including the active involvement of SMUD leadership, employees, contractors, and the community, as well as comprehensive monitoring of organizational and public safety performance.  
   Therefore, SMUD will continuously improve safety results related to:  
   a) Workplace Safety  
   i) Reduce SMUD’s injury severity incidents to 13 or less than by 2025, as measured by OSHA’s Days Away Restricted Time (DART), a rate that demonstrates top quartile safety performance for similar size utilities using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) work-related safety data.  
   ii) Provide timely, quality health care for injured employees that aids their recovery while maintaining positive financial performance of the workers’ compensation program.  
   b) Contractor Safety  
   i) Support contractors to reduce and eliminate potential hazards for Serious Injuries and/or Fatality (SIF) when conducting high risk work.  
   c) Public Safety  
   i) Track and report injuries to the public related to SMUD operations or facilities.  
   ii) Implement measures to protect the public from injuries related to SMUD operations or facilities.  

2. Executive Summary  
   a) SMUD is in compliance with the SD-6 direction and is in alignment with SMUD’s new 5-year strategy of working toward a zero-incident culture.  
   Workplace Safety  
   SMUD recorded 42 OSHA Recordables injuries in 2023. Seventeen of the 42 OSHA injuries (10 Lost Time & 7 Modified Duty cases) resulted in a 0.79 DART rate. Ergonomic injuries in the field contributed to 45% of all injuries. Knee, shoulder, and back have been identified as the most common injured body parts for the field.

**Contractor Safety**  
SMUD continues to utilize ISN to evaluate safety records and performance for high-risk contractors. This evaluation focuses on Contractor Fatality History, OSHA Citation History, DART, and Total Recordable Incident Rates (TRIR), Insurance Experience Ratio, Safety Culture Questions, and Safety Program Review. Currently, SMUD has 110 contractors in the ISN system.

This past year substantially increased the number of site safety evaluations for high-risk contractors to validate safety performance on the jobsites. Safety completed 454 site safety visits through the 4th Quarter of 2023 and exceeded the 2023 goal of 200 evaluations. These site visits focused on SMUD contractors who work with Power Generation, Environmental Services, Line, Substation, Facilities and Vegetation Management on projects where high-risk work is performed. This work includes high voltage work, working at heights, vegetation management, confined spaces, excavations, etc. Additionally, we have fully integrated the use of the Safety Management System (SMS) for inspections, incident tracking, reporting and investigations of SMUD contractors. This allows SMUD to verify safe working practices by our contractors to reduce the potential for serious injuries or property damage. Contractor reported incidents which required an investigation to be completed, and typically will warrant additional site safety visits to verify corrective measures have been put into place to reduce further occurrences. 

In addition, SMUD Procurement and Safety have partnered to enhance contract language as it relates to contractor safety requirements, Request for Proposal (RFP).

**templates for high-risk work and incorporating contractor safety as part of the onboarding process.**

**Public and Community Safety**  
SMUD tracks public and community incidents in the Safety Incident Tracking System (SITS) involving car-pole, electrical contact, dig-in incidents, and injuries to the public that are related to SMUD’s operations or facilities. For the entire year of 2023, there were 253 incidents where the public struck a SMUD asset with a vehicle, with four fatalities from such events. Seventy-two dig-ins have been reported with no injuries. Two electrical contacts with one minor injury. Public safety has partnered with local agencies to expand knowledge of the dig in and electrical safety response programs.

**3. Additional Supporting Information**  
The new SD-6 Safety Direction became effective February 2021. Our goal is to achieve the desired performance objectives by year-end 2025. This report summarizes the first half of the 2023 safety performance.

**Safety Leadership.**  
The Safety Team continues with its integration efforts to support Executive Leadership’s 5-year plan that emphasizes zero incidents and injuries and a focus on a zero-incident safety culture. SMUD’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Paul Lau, re-emphasized the need to improve safety at SMUD with a greater focus on improving our “Safety for Life” culture, reducing the risk of serious injuries and fatalities, implementing a safety management system (SMS), and improving the analysis of injury and incident trends. These goals and strategies are outlined in SMUD’s Safety Road Map and Enterprise Strategy, which was revised in 2023.

**Safety Management System (SMS).**  
During 2023, Safety continued to focus on optimization of Benchmark Gensuite the new Safety Management System (SMS). The Safety team continue to enhance applications within the system to better fit SMUD needs. New processes are being automated and introduced to employees within various applications in SMS. This includes the recording of field tailboards, safety inspections, supervisor employee interactions, EMF meter loans, contractor safety audits and injuries, office, and field ergonomics, and more. Customized dashboards have been created for field tailboards and Supervisor employee interactions.

**Safety Standards Development.**  
SMUD’s safety team continues to update Health & Safety Standards, as an on-going continuous improvement process, to provide a foundation for the organization’s World Class Safety initiatives.

The SMUD’s safety team also updated the COVID-19 IIPP Appendix, due to regulatory updates from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and Cal/OSHA regulations, which were minimized the COVID-19 requirements. This ensures compliance for our Injury Illness Prevention Program (IIPP) and COVID-19 protocols. Information on the updates is continuing to be provided to all SMUD personnel in various formats, including Safety Meetings, ENN’s, on-site electronic monitors, and drop-in meetings.

**process to the Safety Management System (SMS).** Emphasis is placed on field visits for work with the highest hazard potential. SMUD’s safety team continues our efforts in visiting crews throughout SMUD, to assist with employee safety concerns, processes, procedures, and equipment. For office personnel, an emphasis is placed on observing personnel pertaining to ergonomic risk, and slip/trip/fall hazards in walking areas. During 2023, a total of 11,008 Supervisor-Employee interactions were complete that resulted in a 133% percentage observed.

**Near Miss Reporting.** Leadership continues to support and encourage near miss and positive observation/good catch reporting. The goal of this process is to identify opportunities for learning, to prevent incidents from occurring. During 2023, 180 near miss and positive observation/good catch reports were recorded in the Safety Management System (SMS).

**Safely Conducted Observations Reduce Common Hazards (SCORCH). Engagement & Trending Data**  
Throughout the second half of 2023, a total of 2217 employees were observed under the Office & Professional process. Head/Neck posture was the top safe and at-risk behavior during this time frame. Our Behavior Highlights acknowledge the good job employees showed for keeping head in neutral postures in alignment with ears over shoulders at a high percentage. Risk Reduction Reminders stressed the importance of proper monitor height settings to avoid sustained awkward postures (chin to chest and/or chin to sky) of the head/neck area. The value of micro breaks, frequent stretching, and elevated awareness towards the later part of the day or work week was also part of the conversation.

Under the Electrical Trades and CFAS-Field process, a total of 2202 field employees were observed. Behavior Highlights were related to the high consistency employees showed for protecting their head and neck while performing job tasks. Hard Hat and Footwear tied as the top safe behaviors. Risk Reduction Reminders focused on the at-risk behavior of Situational Awareness. Guidance was provided related to the behavioral benefits of constantly updating information pertaining to surroundings for potential moving and changing hazards to the work area (e.g., stray dogs, agitated people, unlawful activity). Positively promoted how preparing for the unexpected aids in making informed decisions to successfully address events, should they occur.

**SCORCH Safety for Life promotions included the following:**
- After attending Dekra’s 2023 Safety in Action Conference in April. Committee members held a two-day (In-person/virtual) SCORCH Mini Conference to share best practice. Presentations were provided to all employees highlighting personal ownership and awareness for working safely. Topic shares ranged from Accountability for Yourself & Others, Stuff Happens and Fending off Fatigue. Positive feedback related to the relevancy of topics was received from employees and leadership in attendance.
- Digital Campaigns - Highlighting the ease and efficiency in which observations can be completed via the Safety Management System “7 Minutes for Safety” continued.
- SCORCH successfully expanded its behavior influencing ability through the promotion of two photo contest events. It was a fun way for employees to include family members as well as demonstrate awareness for demonstrating safe behaviors at home and at play. SMUD employees are engaged in a wide variety of activities and hobbies, with the

4. Challenges

COVID-19. The safety of our employees is of utmost importance, so we continue to monitor SMUD COVID-19 cases and manage prevention efforts. In 2023 SMUD Safety, People, Services, & Strategies, and the Communications updated the COVID-19 guidance to meet regulatory changes within the Cal-OSHA Emergency Temporary Standard for facial coverings, testing programs, quarantine, and isolation guidelines to protect employees, contractors, and the public. SMUD continues to provide employees with COVID-19 antigen testing at our EC-OC Med Services clinic. Our third-party vendor Axiom Medical continues to handle employee contact tracing and this process has been working well. In order to improve our employee experience, the Safety dept. led the roll out of a new mobile app that allows employees to log positives cases and receive guidance at any time. During Q3/Q4 2023, SMUD has received notifications of 151 COVID positive cases from staff. As required both contact tracing and notification of potential exposures have occurred with all personnel impacted.

Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs). The SMUD Safety Team continues to partner with business units to reduce all WMSD’s. Ergonomic evaluations are conducted in the office, field, and virtually to meet the needs of the workforce. From July through December the Ergonomics Team conducted 186 ergonomic evaluations that were requested through Concern Reporting for a total of 369 for the year. Data collection enhancements to the Ergonomic Evaluator application went live in the 3rd quarter and will provide insight on ergo trends across SMUD. The Ergonomic Initial and Refresher Training for office employees was updated to reflect the new hybrid workforce. In addition, Safety continues to partner with SCORCH to utilize data to reduce potential soft tissue injuries.

Injury Prevention Outpost (IPO) program also known as Field Ergo program continues to show improve with field forces. After an initial group training during the monthly safety meetings for the various work groups to share the program details, our ergonomic experts continue to visit job sites and provide the field crew(s) with specific or personal, one-on-one assistance, covering stretching techniques; providing ergo support tools; identifying awkward postures, excessive/forceful exertions, and repetitive motions. This program originally started within Line Division and has been also requested by operational areas.

5. Recommendation

SMUD is committed to becoming a recognized leader in safety. Both SMUD’s leadership team and employees recognize that to achieve success we must integrate safety into all that we do. It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD-6.
<!-- Page 21 -->
6.  Appendices - Business Segment Safety Program Improvement Initiatives

**Energy Delivery and Operations.** The SMUD’s safety team started a “World Class Safety” program in 2023, utilizing the Energy Delivery & Operation Strategic Plan’s Key Objectives, as the messaging, to “drive a culture of safety in pursuit of zero accidents.” Utilizing the 2023 Safety and Reliability tactics, the Safety Team worked with the smaller field-based work groups (i.e., Meter Shop, Veg Management, Telecom, Haz Mat/Network/Substations, and CMI/Survey), and other teams, such as Fleet and Warehouse, to identify foundational Leading Indicators to track progress throughout the year. These included: Monthly Vehicle Inspections (ensuring a vehicle is road-worthy), Supervisor Crew Visits and Safety Team Crew Visits (putting eyes on work and having safety conversations with field crews), SCORCH observations (providing the time and support to field crews for participation and identifying barriers) and ensuring field crew members completed their annual bundled safety training, resulting in the following: 916 Monthly Vehicle Inspections completed; 469 Crew Visits; and 110 Bulk Substation Inspections being completed. In 2024, the safety team will continue to work with business units on the foundational efforts above and continue to build a World Class Safety Program. The original foundational efforts were chosen, as they reflected employee accountability and safe behaviors in which to improve on. In 2024, the safety team added activities focusing on the employee and the Supervisor working together on safety improvements and collaboration. For example, Safety Risk Assessment (SRAs) usage will be added; Supervisor and Safety Crew visits will focus on quality, not just quantity, to identify potential safety hazards, process improvements, and good catches, which will be shared during safety meetings and other communication methods. The safety team will also focus on improvements of the Lock Out/Tag Out (LOTO) Programs for each of the work groups, which requires LOTO. This will include a review of the program, ensure the proper locks are available to the employees, and the programs are being correctly adhered to.

The quarterly World Class Safety meetings with work group leadership, will continue to provide a regular cadence to review our collaborative safety efforts, seek additional opportunities and topics to focus and improve upon, and SMUD to become the leader in World Class Safety.

In continuing our collaboration with the Sacramento Power Academy, the safety team has continued to identify opportunities to improve our internal safety training and ensure continued and consistency quality. Recently, the safety team identified opportunities to include custom videos into training to enhance the end user experience. Technology continues to advance in the training spectrum and utilization of videos will provide the opportunity to include examples from Subject Matter Experts (SME’s) performing work safely in “classroom” or safety meeting presentations as well as enhance the delivery of safety content, throughout the organization.

Joint Labor Management Safety Committees (JLMSC) continue to evolve with an “All field teams’ approach” which allows for the sharing of safety and equipment ideas and mitigation controls, programs, and procedures re-development within our organization. In addition, the JLMSC affords SMUD employees to review utility best practices by benchmarking and/or lessons learned.

SMUD’s Flame Retardant (FR) Clothing program continues to help our employees stay safe while perform high risk task. SMUD’s vendor continues to deliver on a regular basis for the field forces in our EC-OC yard, which reduces our field forces from driving to and from the vendor many store locations. This continues to provide a significant cost savings (time, gas, and driver risk reduction) for SMUD. Our safety efforts helped eliminate hundreds of individual driver trips back and forth. The Field forces feedback and response continues to be positive and appreciative.

**Safety for Life.** SMUD’s Safety and Environmental Day returned this past year after postponing for three years during the COVID-19 pandemic. The event took place at Safety Center in the Safetyville town. The highlighted events we scheduled were pedestrian safety, bicycle safety, a driving simulator as well as a CPR class. There were over 145 attendees which included SMUD employees and their families.

Sparky’s Crew continues to get families involved in safety by sending postcards and quarterly newsletters to SMUD families enrolled.

We continue to place emphasis on personal shares in our Safety for Life communications. In 2023, 23 different articles were shared across SMUD. Examples of article topics include: winter driving, heart health, eyes on path, mental health and eye protection. Quarterly Safety for Life meetings have returned to in-person with the option for Teams as well as an online meeting that can be taken at the employees’ convenience.

**Zero Carbon Energy Solutions (ZCES).** Power Generation has continued to prioritize employee safety while ensuring critical work is completed. In addition to Power Generation employees continue with their Daily Dozen morning stretches for soft tissue injury reduction, the safety team is also working with them to revamp their Quarterly Safety Meetings, their Leadership Meetings; and their annual bundled safety training (with the SPA Team).

Currently, our OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Site Safety Coordinator continues to work as a liaison between the contractor and the Hydro Operations crews, to ensure the findings are being addressed and completed, as a requirement to maintain the Cal/OSHA VPP status. As a reminder: VPP is designed to recognize employers and their employees who have implemented safety and health programs which effectively prevent and control occupational hazards. These programs go beyond the minimum required Cal/OSHA regulations and provide the best feasible protection at the site. Achieving this status ensures Hydro Operations will continue with safety process improvements as the annual comprehensive safety audits are performed by the third-party contractor.

VPP establishments are considered leaders in the field of workplace safety and health. The management commitment and employee participation are key elements in achieving VPP recognition. Applications within the Safety Management System are being utilized by Hydro Operations to ensure employees have a convenient avenue to participate in safety related activities and to track improvement.

![Customer & Community Services (CCS)](https://example.com/image.png)

**Customer & Community Services (CCS)**  
Safety continues to work closely with Customer & Community Services to maintain safe operations of the CSC lobby. Safety, Facilities, and the lobby leadership team have been collaborating on ergonomic design improvements of the customer cashier lobby to better accommodate staff to serve our customers. CCS client support continues to be our goal, so we have increased our visibility through in-person meetings, safety walk-throughs and discussions with supervisors as more staff come on campus after being fully remote to ensure we are meeting their needs. CCS leadership started entering Supervisor Interactions in SMS under ACE forms. Training was provided on how to navigate the tool and application for better quality interactions through eyes on work engagement and safety communications. CCS entered over 400 interactions since the start of this new process.

**Corporate Financial and Administrative Services (CFAS)**  
Facilities continues to support Home-Based Agent workspace installations to ensure ergonomic comfort for employees working at home. Facilities had a major project of demolishing and demolishing the modulars at the HQ campus. This endeavor caused a mass collaboration of all facilities as Buildings & Grounds had to move the existing occupants into their new workspace throughout the FRF and HQ. Buildings & Grounds also had to unpack and clean areas throughout the campus that had sat unoccupied to provide a refreshed and cleaned area for the new occupants. Facilities electricians and stationary engineers collaborated in shutting down fire systems, electrical, and plumbing of the modulars to prepare for the removal of the modulars. Safety observed several lockout tagout procedures performed by electricians and FSEs as disconnections were performed. Facilities carpenters played a role in creating more storage space for the previous occupants of the modulars by building a new storage space in the HQ basement level. Facilities and Safety collaborated in holding the first Facilities Hands-On Training Hoedown which included a total of 3 stations focused on hands-on fire extinguisher training, a fall protection demonstration in partnership with one of our vendors, and a hands-on confined space rescue training. Facilities continues to support the SMUD 2030 Zero Carbon goal of supporting EV Charging infrastructure throughout SMUD campuses as a united effort with SMUD contractors.

**Warehouse and Safety**  
Warehouse and Safety collaborated in rolling out electronic monthly vehicle inspections on SMS for warehouse assigned vehicles. In addition to vehicle inspections, housekeeping inspections have been added and implemented on the Inspection Tool app on SMS. For 2023, Warehouse completed 100% of their bundled training for warehouse employees. Warehouse also completed development of their standard operating procedures. Safety and Warehouse continue to collaborate on purchasing personal protective equipment and tools for field forces while building relationships with our local vendors in discussing the latest technology in PPE and various tools.

Warehouse, Fleet, and Safety continue to collaborate in encouraging an increase in employee engagement during monthly safety meetings. Warehouse and Fleet continue to implement employee Safety for Life presentations in which employees receive the opportunity to present a personal safety share relevant to their personal lives both at work or outside of work. Warehouse, Fleet, and Safety also continue to collaborate on implementing the Injury Prevention Outpost (IPO) program with our designated vendor, ROC Physical Therapy to address employee ergonomic concerns and prevent possible injuries.

Ergonomic injuries. Fleet switched to Geotab as their new fleet tracking system. To improve safe driving awareness, Fleet developed a dashboard to share metrics of assigned fleet vehicles with various business units. Fleet began electronic monthly vehicle inspections on SMS for fleet-assigned vehicles. Fleet also rolled out electronic housekeeping inspections on Inspection Tool on SMS. Fleet completed 100% of their bundled training in October. Fleet employees continue to participate in EV training courses customized to suit SMUD’s needs in preparation for the transition to an all-electrified fleet by 2030.

All business units continue to partner in a consultative collaborative development of a World Class Safety program as OneSMUD with quarterly meetings addressing leading and lagging indicators and the latest safety observation trends across the enterprise.

**Driver Safety.** Supervisors are conducting side-by-side ride alongs to provide coaching and safe driving skills guidance. While Safety was able to provide additional in-person classroom and behind the wheel Smith System training, Driving Rodeos continue to be in high demand and the new partnership with Safety Center turned out to be a big success. In 2023 Safety hosted Driving Rodeo events for Substation, Network, Elec. Techs., and Revenue Operations. Safety has increased the sharing of driving-safety related topics at ED&O Safety meetings this year and is working on new safe-driving messaging materials for the ECCO Yard, HQ and Fresh Pond parking areas, as well as for digital displays at each location. Additionally, a refresh of the safe driving decals on Fleet vehicles is under way. Safe driving is being emphasized in vehicle reports that are provided to directors and managers who have frequent drivers. The reports are focused on speeding as well as seatbelt violations with the potential of more driving details to be added. Driving Rodeo planning for Line Division is currently underway for 2024.

Sales Certificates to be executed and delivered concurrently with the sale of the applicable series or subseries of 2024 Bonds (collectively, the “Sales Certificates”). If all or any portion of the 2024 Bonds are to bear interest at variable rates of interest, not exceeding the maximum rate permitted by law, the manner of determining such variable rates of interest shall be as set forth in the applicable Sales Certificate. In addition to the provisions required pursuant to the terms of this Resolution to be specified in the Sales Certificates, the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager of the District, any Member of the Executive Committee of the District, the Treasurer of the District, the Secretary of the District, or the Chief Financial Officer of the District or the designee of any of them (each an “Authorized Officer”), on behalf of the District, may set forth in the Sales Certificates such provisions, in a form approved by its bond counsel and the District’s counsel, as such Authorized Officer may deem necessary or desirable and consistent with the purpose of this Resolution, including provisions (i) adding additional covenants and agreements to be observed by the District, (ii) curing, correcting, amending or supplementing any ambiguous, defective or ineffective provision contained in the Resolution, or (iii) amending or supplementing any provision contained herein to the extent necessary to obtain one or more bond insurance policies, to obtain a rating on any of the 2024 Bonds, or to provide for the issuance of any of the 2024 Bonds if, in the judgment of any Authorized Officer, after consulting with its municipal advisor, bond counsel and District counsel, such insurance, rating or provision is reasonable. Any Authorized Officer, acting alone, is hereby authorized and instructed to execute and deliver the Sales Certificates and, upon execution and delivery thereof, the Sales Certificates shall be incorporated herein and in the Master Resolution by reference. The execution and delivery of the Sales Certificates shall be conclusive evidence that, where any judgment or determination of reasonableness is required to be made by the person signing said Sales Certificates, such judgment or determination has been made.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Sales Certificate shall specify (i) a true interest cost on the applicable 2024 Bonds bearing interest at fixed rates of interest in excess of 5.50%; or (ii) a maturity date for any 2024 Bond later than forty (40) years after the date dated of such 2024 Bond.

(e) Interest on the 2024 Bonds shall be calculated on the basis and be payable on the dates set forth in the Sales Certificates, to the registered owners thereof as of the record dates specified in the Sales Certificates.

(f) Pursuant to Section 5.04 of the Master Resolution, the Sales Certificates shall specify whether the 2024 Bonds or any series or subseries thereof are to be secured by (A) the Reserve Fund, (B) a separate debt service reserve fund, or (C) neither (A) nor (B). If the Sales Certificates provide that the 2024 Bonds or any series or subseries thereof are to be secured by a separate debt service reserve fund, such Sales Certificates may provide for the creation of such funds or accounts in furtherance thereof as may be deemed appropriate in the Treasurer’s discretion, and such funds or accounts shall be held in trust by the District or the Trustee, as specified in the Sales Certificates, solely for the benefit of the Holders of the 2024 Bonds or applicable series or subseries thereof, and is hereby pledged solely to the payment of the 2024 Bonds or applicable series or subseries thereof, subject to the application thereof for the purposes set forth in the Sales Certificates.

balance required to be maintained on deposit therein, the purposes for which moneys on deposit therein may or shall be applied, the terms on which any deficiencies therein are to be replenished, additional limitations concerning investment of moneys therein and the valuation thereof, and provisions concerning the deposit of credit instruments in lieu of each therein.

(g) The Sales Certificates shall designate the series, amounts and maturity or sinking fund payment dates of the Refunded Bonds.

Section 146.02 Redemption of 2024 Bonds. The 2024 Bonds or any series or subseries thereof shall be subject to redemption on the terms set forth below and in the Sales Certificates (which may specify that some or all of the 2024 Bonds will not be subject to redemption).

(a) Notice of Redemption. If any of the 2024 Bonds are subject to redemption, then in addition to the notice of redemption required to be given pursuant to Article IV of the Master Resolution, the Trustee shall mail, by first class mail, postage prepaid, notice of redemption of any 2024 Bond to the Securities Depositories. Failure of the Trustee to give notice of redemption to any Securities Depository, or any defect therein, however, shall not affect the sufficiency of the proceedings of redemption with respect to any 2024 Bond. For purposes of this paragraph, the following term shall have the following meaning:

“Securities Depositories” means DTC, 55 Water Street, 50th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10041-0099 Attn. Call Notification Department, Fax (212) 855-7232; or, in accordance with the current guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to such other address and/or such other securities depositories as the District may designate to the Trustee in writing.

Notwithstanding any contrary provision of Article IV of the Master Resolution or this Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution, (1) publication of any notice of redemption shall not be required with respect to the 2024 Bonds, so long as such 2024 Bonds are in full book-entry form, (2) any notice of redemption of the 2024 Bonds shall be mailed not less than twenty (20) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption date, and (3) any notice of optional redemption of 2024 Bonds may be made conditional on the receipt of money or any other condition.

Section 146.03 Deposits to Interest Fund and Principal Account. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Resolution, the Treasurer, out of Net Revenues received by the District, shall set aside in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account, respectively, such amounts as may be required so that an amount equal to the amount of principal and/or interest becoming due and payable on the 2024 Bonds on each interest payment date and principal payment date is on deposit in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account.

**Section 146.04 2024 Sinking Fund.**

(a) An account is hereby established within the Sinking Fund created by Section 5.02 of the Master Resolution to be designated the “2024 Sinking Fund.” On or before each minimum sinking fund payment date for any 2024 Bonds set forth in the Sales Certificates, the Treasurer shall deposit in the 2024 Sinking Fund, out of Net Revenues received by the District, such amounts as may be required to cause the balance therein to be equal to the amount of the minimum sinking fund payment due and payable on the 2024 Bonds on such minimum sinking fund payment date as set forth in the Sales Certificates.

(b) The District shall apply all such minimum sinking fund payments, as rapidly as practicable, to the purchase of 2024 Bonds at public or private sale, as and when and at such prices (including brokerage and other expenses, but excluding accrued interest, which is payable from the Interest Fund) as the District may in its discretion determine.

(c) If on the first day of the month preceding the month in which a minimum sinking fund payment date occurs, as set forth in the Sales Certificates, the moneys in the 2024 Sinking Fund equal or exceed $25,000, such moneys shall be applied by the District to the redemption on such minimum sinking fund payment date of as many 2024 Bonds as such moneys in the 2024 Sinking Fund shall suffice to redeem at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof (except that accrued interest on such 2024 Bonds so called for redemption shall be paid from the Interest Fund). All 2024 Bonds purchased or redeemed under the provisions of this Section shall be delivered to, and canceled by, the Trustee and shall not be reissued.

(d) No application of any moneys to the retirement of 2024 Bonds shall operate to impair or affect the obligation of the District to make minimum sinking fund payments for 2024 Bonds in the amounts and at the times provided in this Section; however, the District shall not be deemed to be in default with respect to any 2024 Bonds minimum sinking fund payment for any minimum sinking fund payment date if at all times prior to such minimum sinking fund payment date the District shall have fixed rates and charges as required by Section 6.08 of the Master Resolution, and if at such minimum sinking fund payment date the aggregate principal amount of all 2024 Bonds theretofore purchased or redeemed through the operation of the 2024 Sinking Fund or otherwise (together with any moneys then in the 2024 Sinking Fund) equals or exceeds the aggregate amount of minimum sinking fund payments for 2024 Bonds then and theretofore required to be made pursuant to this Section.

(e) Any moneys remaining in the 2024 Sinking Fund after all 2024 Bonds have been retired shall be returned to the District for any lawful District use.

rates, redemption provisions and other terms of the 2024 Bonds shall be inserted therein in conformity with the Sales Certificates.

Section 146.06 Issuance of 2024 Bonds.

(a) At any time after the adoption of this Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution and the execution and delivery of the applicable Sales Certificate, the District may execute and deliver 2024 Bonds in the aggregate principal amount set forth in the applicable Sales Certificate, but not to exceed the aggregate principal amount described in Section 146.01(c).

(b) The Trustee shall authenticate and deliver the 2024 Bonds upon written order of the District.

(c) The proceeds of the sale of the 2024 Bonds shall be set aside and applied by the Treasurer as set forth in the Sales Certificates.

Section 146.07 Refunding of 2024 Bonds. If Refunding Bonds are issued for the purpose of refunding 2024 Bonds, then, in addition to any other provisions of Section 3.05 of the Master Resolution, the District is authorized to apply proceeds of the sale of such Refunding Bonds to the payment of the purchase price of direct non-callable obligations of the United States of America (“Treasury Obligations”) to be held by the Trustee to insure the payment or retirement at or before maturity of all or a portion of the outstanding 2024 Bonds. Upon deposit with the Trustee, in trust, of money or Treasury Obligations (including, but not limited to, direct obligations of the United States of America issued in book-entry form on the books of the Department of the Treasury of the United States of America), or any combination thereof, sufficient, together with the interest to accrue on any such Treasury Obligations, to pay or redeem all or a portion of 2024 Bonds which are to be redeemed prior to maturity date, provided that, in the case of 2024 Bonds which are to be redeemed prior to maturity, notice of such redemption shall have been given as provided in Article IV of the Master Resolution or provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been made for the giving of such notice, all liability of the District in respect of such 2024 Bonds shall cease, determine and be completely discharged, and the holders thereof shall thereafter be entitled only to payment by the District out of the money and Treasury Obligations deposited with the Trustee as aforesaid for their payment, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 10.03 of the Master Resolution.

depository”); provided that any successor of DTC or substitute depository shall be qualified under any applicable laws to provide the service proposed to be provided by it;

(ii) To any substitute depository not objected to by the Trustee, upon (1) the resignation of DTC or its successor (or any substitute depository or its successor) from its functions as depository or (2) a determination by the District that DTC or its successor (or any substitute depository or its successor) is no longer able to carry out its functions as depository; provided that any such substitute depository shall be qualified under any applicable laws to provide the services proposed to be provided by it; or

(iii) To any person as provided below, upon (1) the resignation of DTC or its successor (or substitute depository or its successor) from its functions as depository; provided that no substitute depository which is not objected to by the Trustee can be obtained or (2) a determination by the District that it is in the best interests of the District to remove DTC or its successor (or any substitute depository or its successor) from its functions as depository.

(b) In the case of any transfer pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii) of Section 140.08(a) hereof, upon receipt of all outstanding 2024 Bonds by the Trustee, together with a Certificate of the District to the Trustee, a single new 2024 Bond shall be executed and delivered for each maturity of each series of 2024 Bonds then outstanding registered in the name of such successor or such substitute depository, or their nominees, as the case may be, all as specified in such Certificate of the District. In the case of any transfer pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 146.08(a) hereof, upon receipt of all outstanding 2024 Bonds by the Trustee together with a Certificate of the District to the Trustee, new 2024 Bonds shall be executed, authenticated and delivered in such denominations and registered in the names of such persons as are requested in such a Certificate of the District, subject to the limitations of Section 146.08(a) hereof, provided the Trustee shall not be required to deliver such new 2024 Bonds within a period less than 60 days from the date of receipt of such a Certificate of the District. Subsequent to any transfer pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 146.08(a) hereof, the 2024 Bonds shall be transferred as provided in Article II of the Master Resolution.

(c) In the case of partial redemption or refunding of the 2024 Bonds of a series evidencing all or a portion of the principal maturing in a particular year, DTC shall make an appropriate notation on such 2024 Bonds indicating the date and amounts of such reduction in principal. The Trustee shall incur no liability for the failure or any error by DTC in making such notation and the records of the Trustee shall be determinative of the outstanding principal amount of 2024 Bonds.

(d) The District and the Trustee shall be entitled to treat the person in whose name any 2024 Bond is registered as the Bondholder thereof for all purposes of the Master Resolution and any applicable laws, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary received by the Trustee or the District; and the District and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for transmitting payments to, communicating with, notifying, or otherwise dealing with, any beneficial owners of the 2024 Bonds.

including DTC or its successor (or substitute depository or its successor), except for the holder of any 2024 Bond.

(e) So long as the outstanding 2024 Bonds are registered in the name of Cede & Co. or its registered assigns, the District and the Trustee (to the extent funds are provided to it by the District) shall cooperate with Cede & Co., as sole registered Bondholder, and its registered assigns, in effecting payment of the principal of and redemption premium, if any, and interest on the 2024 Bonds by arranging for payment in such manner that funds for such payments are properly identified and are made immediately available on the date they are due.

Section 146.09 Tax Covenants.

(a) The District shall at all times do and perform all acts and things permitted by law which are necessary or desirable in order to assure that interest paid on the 2024 Bonds (or any of them) will be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and shall take no action that would result in such interest not being excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the District agrees to comply with the provisions of each Tax Certificate of the District, dated the date of issuance of the applicable 2024 Bonds, as amended from time to time in accordance with its terms (collectively, the “Tax Certificate”). This covenant shall survive payment in full or defeasance of the 2024 Bonds.

The District specifically covenants to pay or cause to be paid the Rebate Requirement as provided in the Tax Certificate to the United States of America from any Net Revenues lawfully available to the District. This covenant shall survive payment in full or defeasance of the 2024 Bonds. Capitalized terms in this Section not otherwise defined in the Master Resolution or this Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Tax Certificate.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section, if the District shall obtain an opinion of counsel of recognized national standing in the field of obligations the interest on which is excluded from gross income for purposes of federal income taxation to the effect that any specified action required under this Section is no longer required, or to the effect that some different action is required, to maintain the exclusion from gross income of the interest on the 2024 Bonds under Section 103 of the Code, the District may rely conclusively on such opinion in complying with the provisions hereof, and the agreements and covenants hereunder shall be deemed to be modified to that extent without the necessity of an amendment of the Master Resolution or this Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution or the consent at any time of the Bondholders.

(d) This Section 146.09 shall be inapplicable to the 2024 Bonds, if any, issued bearing interest included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, as set forth in the applicable Sales Certificate.

**REGISTERED OWNER:** CEDE & CO.

**PRINCIPAL AMOUNT:**

SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT, a municipal utility district duly organized and existing under and pursuant to the laws of the State of California (hereinafter called the “District”), for value received, hereby promises to pay (but only out of the Net Revenues hereinafter referred to) to the registered owner named above or registered assigns, on the maturity date specified above, the principal sum specified above together with interest thereon from the date of initial delivery hereof, until the principal hereof shall have been paid, at the interest rate per annum specified above, payable on [__] and [__] of each year, commencing [__]. Interest hereon is payable in lawful money of the United States of America by check or draft mailed on each interest payment date to the registered owner as of the first day of the month (whether or not a business day) in which an interest payment date occurs. Interest hereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. At the option of the owners of $1,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of Bonds of this series, interest hereon is also payable in lawful money of the United States of America by wire transfer to such address as has been furnished to the Trustee in writing by the registered owner hereof at least 15 days prior to the interest payment date for which such payment by wire transfer is requested. The principal hereof is payable at the designated corporate trust office of U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, the Trustee, in lawful money of the United States of America.

![Bond Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Bond+Document)

Bond is issued pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors of the District, adopted January 7, 1971, providing for the issuance of the Bonds, as amended and supplemented (the “Resolution”), including as amended and supplemented by a Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution, adopted March 21, 2024, authorizing the issuance of the 2024 Series [__] Bonds. Reference is hereby made to the Resolution and the Act for a description of the terms on which the Bonds are issued and to be issued, the provisions with regard to the nature and extent of the Revenues, as that term is defined in the Resolution, and the rights of the registered owners of the Bonds; and all the terms of the Resolution and the Act are hereby incorporated herein and constitute a contract between the District and the registered owner from time to time of this Bond, and to all the provisions thereof the registered owner of this Bond, by its acceptance hereof, consents and agrees. Additional bonds may be issued on a parity with the Bonds of this authorized issue, but only subject to the conditions and limitations contained in the Resolution.

The Bonds and the interest thereon (to the extent set forth in the Resolution), together with the Parity Bonds (as defined in the Resolution) heretofore or hereafter issued by the District, and the interest thereon, are payable from, and are secured by a charge and lien on, the Net Revenues derived by the District from the Electric System (as those terms are defined in the Resolution). The District hereby covenants and warrants that for the payment of the Bonds and interest thereon, there have been created and will be maintained by the District special funds into which there shall be deposited from Net Revenues available for that purpose sums sufficient to pay the principal of, and interest on, all of the Bonds, as such principal and interest become due, and as an irrevocable charge the District has allocated Net Revenues to such payment, all in accordance with the Resolution.

The Bonds are special obligations of the District, and are payable, both as to principal and interest, out of the Net Revenues pertaining to the Electric System, and not out of any other fund or moneys of the District. No holder of this Bond shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the District to pay this Bond or the interest hereon.

[The 2024 Series [__] Bonds are not subject to redemption.] Redemption Terms to be Determined at Time of Sale and Conformed to the applicable Official Statement and applicable Sales Certificate.

This Bond is transferable by the registered owner hereof, in person or by the attorney of such owner duly authorized in writing, at the designated corporate trust office of the Trustee but only in the manner, subject to the limitations and upon payment of the charges provided in the Resolution, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Bond. Upon such transfer a new fully registered Bond or Bonds without coupons, of authorized denomination or denominations, for the same aggregate principal amount and maturity will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor. No transfer of this Bond will be made during the 15 days next preceding each interest payment date.

The District, the Trustee and any paying agent may deem and treat the registered owner hereof as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, and the District, the Trustee and any paying agent shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.

then to be performed and all conditions then to be satisfied by the District in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Resolution and the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement.

If any of the conditions to the obligations of the Underwriters contained in this Section or elsewhere in this Contract of Purchase with respect to the Bonds shall not have been satisfied when and as required herein, all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder with respect to the Bonds may be terminated by the Underwriters at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by written notice to the District.

4. Offering. The obligations of the District to sell and to deliver the Bonds on the Closing Date to the Underwriters shall be subject to the following conditions:

(a) The entire $[PAR] aggregate principal amount of the Bonds shall be purchased, accepted and paid for by the Underwriters on the Closing Date; and

(b) The District shall receive an Issue Price Certificate of the Senior Underwriter substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F with respect to the Bonds.

5. Issue Price of the Bonds. The Senior Underwriter, on behalf of the Underwriters, agrees to assist the District in establishing the issue price of the Bonds and shall execute and deliver to the District at Closing an “issue price” or similar certificate substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F, together with the supporting pricing wires or equivalent communications, with modifications to such certificate as may be deemed appropriate or necessary, in the reasonable judgment of the Senior Underwriter, the District and Bond Counsel, to accurately reflect, as applicable, the sales price or prices or the initial offering price or prices to the public of the Bonds.

(b) [Except for the maturities set forth in Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto,] the District will treat the first price at which 10% of each maturity of the Bonds (the “10% test”) is sold to the public as the issue price of that maturity; if different interest rates apply within a maturity, each separate CUSIP number within that maturity will be subject to the 10% test.

(c) [The Senior Underwriter confirms that the Underwriters have offered the Bonds to the public on or before the date of this Contract of Purchase at the offering price or prices (the “initial offering price”), or at the corresponding yield or yields, set forth in Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto. Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto sets forth, as of the date of this Contract of Purchase, the maturities, if any, of the Bonds for which the 10% test has not been satisfied and for which the District and the Senior Underwriter, on behalf of the Underwriters, agree that the restrictions set forth in the next sentence shall apply, which will allow the District to treat the initial offering price to the public of each such maturity as of the sale date as the issue price of that maturity (the “hold-the-offering-price rule”). So long as the hold-the-offering-price rule remains applicable to any maturity of the Bonds, the Senior Underwriter will neither offer nor sell unsold Bonds of that maturity to any person at a price that is higher than the initial offering price to the public during the period starting on the sale date and ending on the earlier of the following:

(1) the close of the fifth (5th) business day after the sale date; or

11  
4859-9712-9641.3
<!-- Page 68 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image) 

(2) the date on which the Underwriters have sold at least 10% of that maturity of the Bonds to the public at a price that is no higher than the initial offering price to the public.

The Senior Underwriter shall promptly advise the District or the District’s municipal advisor when the Underwriters have sold 10% of that maturity of the Bonds to the public at a price that is no higher than the initial offering price to the public, if that occurs prior to the close of the fifth (5th) business day after the sale date.

The District acknowledges that, in making the representation set forth in this subsection, the Senior Underwriter will rely on (i) the agreement of each Underwriter to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in an agreement among underwriters and the related pricing wires, (ii) in the event a selling group has been created in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, the agreement of each dealer who is a member of the selling group to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in a selling group agreement and the related pricing wires, and (iii) in the event that an Underwriter is a party to a retail distribution agreement that was employed in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, the agreement of each broker-dealer that is a party to such agreement to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in the retail distribution agreement and the related pricing wires. The District further acknowledges that each Underwriter shall be solely liable for its failure to comply with its agreement regarding the hold the offering price rule and that no Underwriter shall be liable for the failure of any other Underwriter, or of any dealer who is a member of a selling group, or of any broker-dealer that is a party to a retail distribution agreement to comply with its agreement regarding the hold-the-offering-price rule as applicable to the Bonds.

(d) [The Senior Underwriter confirms that:

(1) any agreement among underwriters, any selling group agreement and each retail distribution agreement (to which the Senior Underwriter is a party) relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together with the related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each Underwriter, each dealer who is a member of the selling group, and each broker-dealer that is a party to such retail distribution agreement, as applicable, to (A)(i) report the prices at which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each maturity allotted to it until it is notified by the Senior Underwriter that either the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity or all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public and (ii) comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable, in each case if and for so long as directed by the Senior Underwriter and as set forth in the related pricing wires, (B) promptly notify the Senior Underwriter of any sales of the Bonds that, to its knowledge, are made to a purchaser who is a related party to an underwriter participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (each such term being used as defined below) and (C) acknowledge that, unless otherwise advised by the Underwriter, dealer or broker-dealer, the Senior Underwriter shall assume that each order submitted by the Underwriter, dealer or broker-dealer is a sale to the public; and

12  
4859-9712-9641.3
<!-- Page 69 -->
(2) any agreement among underwriters relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together with the related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each Underwriter that is a party to a retail distribution agreement to be employed in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public to require each broker-dealer that is a party to such retail distribution agreement to (A) report the prices at which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each maturity allotted to it until it is notified by the Senior Underwriter or the Underwriter that either the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity or all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public and (B) comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable, in each case if and for so long as directed by the Senior Underwriter or the Underwriter and as set forth in the related pricing wires.]

(e) The Underwriters acknowledge that sales of any Bonds to any person that is a related party to an Underwriter shall not constitute sales to the public for purposes of this section. Further, for purposes of this section:

(1) “public” means any person other than an underwriter or a related party,

(2) “underwriter” means (A) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract with the District (or with the lead underwriter to form an underwriting syndicate) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public and (B) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract directly or indirectly with a related party described in clause (A) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (including a member of a selling group or a party to a retail distribution agreement participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public),

(3) a purchaser of any of the Bonds is a “related party” to an underwriter if the underwriter and the purchaser are subject, directly or indirectly, to (i) more than 50% common ownership of the voting power or the total value of their stock, if both entities are corporations (including direct ownership by one corporation of another), (ii) more than 50% common ownership of their capital interests or profits interests, if both entities are partnerships (including direct ownership by one partnership of another), or (iii) more than 50% common ownership of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation or the capital interests or profit interests of the partnership, as applicable, if one entity is a corporation and the other entity is a partnership (including direct ownership of the applicable stock or interests by one entity of the other), and

(4) “sale date” means the date of execution of this Contract of Purchase by all parties.

6. Termination. The Underwriters shall have the right to terminate their obligations under this Contract of Purchase to purchase, accept delivery of and to pay for the Bonds, if,

(2) Legislation enacted (or resolution passed) by the Congress or a final order, ruling, regulation or official statement is issued or made by or on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other governmental agency having jurisdiction of the subject matter, to the effect that obligations of the general character of the Bonds are not exempt from registration under other requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or are not exempt from qualification under, or other requirements of, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or that the issuance, offering or sale of the Bonds or obligations of the general character of the Bonds, including any or all underlying arrangements, as contemplated hereby or by the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement, otherwise is or would be in violation of the federal securities laws as amended and then in effect;

(3) Any new material outbreak or escalation of hostilities having a material effect on the financial markets of the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or the occurrence of any other local, national or international calamity, crisis or event relating to the effective operation of the government of or the financial community in the United States or an escalation thereof, including, without limitation, a downgrade of the sovereign debt rating of the United States by any major credit rating agency or payment default on United States Treasury obligations;

**Selection of Bonds for Redemption.** If less than all of a maturity of the Bonds is to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed, from the Outstanding Bonds of such maturity not previously called for redemption, by lot in any manner the Trustee deems fair.

**Notice of Redemption.** Notice of redemption for the Bonds will be given by publication at least once in financial newspapers or journals, selected by the Trustee, of general circulation in San Francisco, California, Chicago, Illinois, and New York, New York, each such publication to be not less than 20 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption, if at any time the Bonds are not in book entry form. Notice also will be mailed to the registered owners of any Bonds designated for redemption, but failure to mail such notice or any defect therein with respect to any particular Bond will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Bonds. For so long as the book-entry-only system is in effect with respect to the Bonds, the Trustee will mail notice of redemption solely to DTC or its nominee or its successor. Any failure of DTC or its successor, or of a direct or indirect DTC participant, to notify a beneficial owner of a Bond of any redemption will not affect the sufficiency or validity of the redemption of any Bond. The District may instruct the Trustee to give conditional notice of optional redemption, which may be conditioned upon the receipt of moneys or any other event.

*(Opinion of General Counsel to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District)*

[**CLOSING DATE**]  
[**TO BE UPDATED**]  

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC  
[________]  
[________]  

Re: Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
$[PAR] Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series M  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Paragraph 3(d)(6) of the Contract of Purchase (the “Contract of Purchase”), dated [SALE DATE], between J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as Senior Managing Underwriter named therein (the “Senior Underwriter”), and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (the “District”) relating to the above-captioned bonds (the “Bonds”).

As counsel to the District, I have reviewed (i) Resolution No. 6649 of the District, adopted on January 7, 1971, as amended and supplemented to date, including as amended and supplemented by Resolution No. [RESO NO.], adopted on March 21, 2024 (as so amended and supplemented, the “Resolution”); (ii) the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, dated the date hereof (the “Undertaking”), between the District and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”); (iii) the Preliminary Official Statement of the District, dated [POS DATE] (the “Preliminary Official Statement”); (iv) the Official Statement of the District, dated [SALE DATE] (the “Official Statement”); and (v) such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent I deemed necessary to provide the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. I have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures presented to me (whether as originals or as copies) and the due and legal execution and delivery by, and validity against, any parties other than the District. I have not undertaken to verify independently, and have assumed, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents referred to in the second paragraph hereof. I have further assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in such documents.

I call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the Resolution, the Undertaking, and the Contract of Purchase may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or  

C-1  
4859-9712-9641.3  
<!-- Page 79 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, and to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against municipal utility districts in the State of California. I express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, choice of law, choice of forum or waiver provisions contained therein.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, I am of the opinion that:

1. The District is a political subdivision of the State of California duly organized and validly existing under the Act, as amended, and has full legal right, power and authority to execute and deliver (or adopt, as the case may be), and to perform its obligations under, the Resolution, the Undertaking and the Contract of Purchase.

2. The Contract of Purchase and the Undertaking have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the District, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the parties thereto other than the District, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the District, enforceable against the District in accordance with their respective terms.

3. The District is not in breach of or default under any existing constitutional provision, applicable law or administrative regulation of the State of California or the United States or any applicable judgment or decree or any loan agreement, indenture, bond, note, resolution, agreement or other instrument known to me after reasonable inquiry to which the District is a party or to which the District or any of its property or assets is otherwise subject which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District, and no event has occurred and is continuing which with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default or event of default under any such instrument which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District; and the execution and delivery of the Bonds, the Undertaking and the Contract of Purchase and the adoption of the Resolution, and compliance with any existing constitutional provision, law, administrative regulation, judgment, decree, loan agreement, indenture, bond, note, resolution, agreement or other instrument known to me after reasonable inquiry to which the District is a party or to which the District or any of its property or assets is otherwise subject will not, as of the date hereof, conflict with or constitute a breach of or default under any such instrument which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District, nor will any such execution, delivery, adoption or compliance result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or other security interest or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any of the property or assets of the District or under the terms of any such law, regulation or instrument, except as expressly provided by the Bonds and the Resolution.

4. The statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement which purport to describe certain provisions of the Bonds, the Undertaking, and the Resolution present a fair and accurate summary of such provisions for the purpose of use in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement.

5. Except as described or referred to in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement, as of the date hereof, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or

investigation, at law or in equity, before or by any court, government agency, public board or body, pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened against the District affecting the corporate existence of the District or the titles of its officers to their respective offices, or affecting or seeking to prohibit, restrain or enjoin the sale, issuance or delivery of the Bonds or the collection of the Revenues (as defined in the Resolution) or the Net Revenues (as defined in the Resolution) pledged or to be pledged to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds or contesting or affecting as to the District the validity or enforceability of the Act, the Bonds, the Resolution, the Contract of Purchase or the Undertaking, or contesting the tax exempt status of interest on the Bonds, or which may result in any material adverse change relating to the District, other than routine litigation of the type which normally accompanies its operation of its generation, transmission and distribution facilities, or contesting the completeness or accuracy of the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement or any supplement or amendment thereto, or contesting the powers of the District or any authority for the issuance of the Bonds, the adoption of the Resolution, or the execution and delivery by the District of the Contract of Purchase, or the Undertaking, nor, to the best of my knowledge, is there any basis for any such action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation wherein an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding would materially adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Act or the authorization, execution, delivery or performance by the District of the Bonds, the Resolution, the Undertaking, or the Contract of Purchase.

6. Based upon my review of the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement as General Counsel to the District and without having undertaken to determine independently the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement (except as specifically set forth in paragraph 4 hereof), I have no reason to believe that the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement (except for information relating Cede & Co., DTC or the operation of the book-entry system, the Appendices (except Appendix A) to the Preliminary Official Statement, and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to all of which I express no view) as of its date and as of the date of the Contract of Purchase contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and the Official Statement (except for information relating Cede & Co., DTC or the operation of the book-entry system, the Appendices (except Appendix A) to the Official Statement, and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to all of which I express no view) (A) as of the date of the Official Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (B) as of the date hereof contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

For purposes of the opinions expressed herein, I have assumed that an agreement or other document is “material” to the District if it involves amounts in excess of $10,000,000 and that a matter would result in a “material adverse change” to the District if the financial consequences involved would exceed $10,000,000.

I understand that you are relying upon the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel, with respect to the validity of the Bonds and the exclusion of interest on the

C-3  
4859-9712-9641.3
<!-- Page 81 -->
Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes and the Bonds for purposes of State of California income taxation and, accordingly, render no opinion with respect thereto.

1. **Sale of the [General Rule Maturities][Bonds].** As of the date of this Certificate, for each Maturity of the [General Rule Maturities][Bonds], the first price at which at least 10% of such Maturity was sold to the Public is the respective price listed in Schedule A.

A copy of the pricing wire or equivalent communication for the Bonds is attached to this Certificate as Schedule B.

   (b) As set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement for the Bonds, the Representative has agreed in writing that for each Maturity of the Hold-the-Offering-Price Maturities, it would neither offer nor sell any of the unsold Bonds of such Maturity to any person at a price that is higher than the Initial Offering Price for such Maturity during the Holding Period for such Maturity (the “hold-the-offering-price rule”). Pursuant to such agreement, the Representative has not offered or sold any unsold Bonds of any Maturity of the Hold-the-Offering-Price Maturities at a price that is higher than the respective Initial Offering Price for that Maturity of the Bonds during the Holding Period.

the-Offering-Price Maturity to the Public at prices that are no higher than the Initial Offering Price for such Hold-the-Offering-Price Maturity.]

(d) Issuer means Sacramento Municipal Utility District.

(e) Maturity means Bonds with the same credit and payment terms. Bonds with different maturity dates, or Bonds with the same maturity date but different stated interest rates, are treated as separate maturities.

(f) Public means any person (including an individual, trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation) other than an Underwriter or a Related Party (as such terms are defined below) to an Underwriter.

(g) A purchaser of any of the Bonds is a Related Party to any Underwriter if the Underwriter and the purchaser are subject, directly or indirectly, to (i) at least 50% common ownership of the voting power or the total value of their stock, if both entities are corporations (including direct ownership by one corporation of another), (ii) more than 50% common ownership of their capital interests or profits interests, if both entities are partnerships (including direct ownership by one partnership of another), or (iii) more than 50% common ownership of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation or the capital interests or profit interests of the partnership, as applicable, if one entity is a corporation and the other entity is a partnership (including direct ownership of the applicable stock or interests by one entity of the other).

Nothing in this certificate represents the Representative’s interpretation of any laws, including specifically Sections 103 and 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. The undersigned understands that the foregoing information will be relied upon by the Issuer with respect to certain of the representations set forth in the Tax Certificate and with respect to compliance with the federal income tax rules affecting the Bonds, and by Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to the Issuer, in connection with rendering its opinion that the interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, the preparation of the Internal Revenue Service Form 8038-G, and other federal income tax advice that it may give to the Issuer from time to time relating to the Bonds.

(15) A copy of the Blanket Letter of Representations to DTC relating to the Bonds signed by DTC and the District; and

(16) Such additional legal opinions, certificates, instruments and other documents as the Underwriters may reasonably request to evidence the truth and accuracy and completeness, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, of the District’s representations and warranties contained herein and of the statements and information contained in the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement, and the due performance or satisfaction by the District at or prior to the Closing Date of all agreements then to be performed and all conditions then to be satisfied by the District in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Resolution and the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement.

If any of the conditions to the obligations of the Underwriters contained in this Section or elsewhere in this Contract of Purchase with respect to the Bonds shall not have been satisfied when and as required herein, all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder with respect to the Bonds may be terminated by the Underwriters at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by written notice to the District.

4. Offering. The obligations of the District to sell and to deliver the Bonds on the Closing Date to the Underwriters shall be subject to the following conditions:

(a) The entire $[PAR] aggregate principal amount of the Bonds shall be purchased, accepted and paid for by the Underwriters on the Closing Date; and

(b) The District shall receive an Issue Price Certificate of the Senior Underwriter substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F with respect to the Bonds.

5. Issue Price of the Bonds. The Senior Underwriter, on behalf of the Underwriters, agrees to assist the District in establishing the issue price of the Bonds and shall execute and deliver to the District at Closing an “issue price” or similar certificate substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F, together with the supporting pricing wires or equivalent communications, with modifications to such certificate as may be deemed appropriate or necessary, in the reasonable judgment of the Senior Underwriter, the District and Bond Counsel, to accurately reflect, as applicable, the sales price or prices or the initial offering price or prices to the public of the Bonds.

(b) [Except for the maturities set forth in Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto,] the District will treat the first price at which 10% of each maturity of the Bonds (the “10% test”) is sold to the public as the issue price of that maturity (if different interest rates apply within a maturity), each separate CUSIP number within that maturity will be subject to the 10% test.

(c) [The Senior Underwriter confirms that the Underwriters have offered the Bonds to the public on or before the date of this Contract of Purchase at the offering price or prices (the “initial offering price”), or at the corresponding yield or yields, set forth in Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto. Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto sets forth, as of the date of this Contract of Purchase, the maturities, if any, of the Bonds for which the 10% test has not been satisfied and

11
4870-5972-9833.3
<!-- Page 104 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
for which the District and the Senior Underwriter, on behalf of the Underwriters, agree that the restrictions set forth in the next sentence shall apply, which will allow the District to treat the initial offering price to the public of each such maturity as of the sale date as the issue price of that maturity (the “hold-the-offering-price rule”). So long as the hold-the-offering-price rule remains applicable to any maturity of the Bonds, the Senior Underwriter will neither offer nor sell unsold Bonds of that maturity to any person at a price that is higher than the initial offering price to the public during the period starting on the sale date and ending on the earlier of the following:

(1) the close of the fifth (5th) business day after the sale date; or

(2) the date on which the Underwriters have sold at least 10% of that maturity of the Bonds to the public at a price that is no higher than the initial offering price to the public.

The Senior Underwriter shall promptly advise the District or the District’s municipal advisor when the Underwriters have sold 10% of that maturity of the Bonds to the public at a price that is no higher than the initial offering price to the public, if that occurs prior to the close of the fifth (5th) business day after the sale date.

The District acknowledges that, in making the representation set forth in this subsection, the Senior Underwriter will rely on (i) the agreement of each Underwriter to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in an agreement among underwriters and the related pricing wires, (ii) in the event a selling group has been created in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, the agreement of each dealer who is a member of the selling group to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in a selling group agreement and the related pricing wires, and (iii) in the event that an Underwriter is a party to a retail distribution agreement that was employed in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, the agreement of each broker-dealer that is a party to such agreement to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in the retail distribution agreement and the related pricing wires. The District further acknowledges that each Underwriter shall be solely liable for its failure to comply with its agreement regarding the hold the offering price rule and that no Underwriter shall be liable for the failure of any other Underwriter, or of any dealer who is a member of a selling group, or of any broker-dealer that is a party to a retail distribution agreement to comply with its agreement regarding the hold-the-offering-price rule as applicable to the Bonds.]

(d) [The Senior Underwriter confirms that:

(1) any agreement among underwriters, any selling group agreement and each retail distribution agreement (to which the Senior Underwriter is a party) relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together with the related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each Underwriter, each dealer who is a member of the selling group, and each broker-dealer that is a party to such retail distribution agreement, as applicable, to (A)(i) report the prices at which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each maturity allotted to it until it is notified by the Senior Underwriter that either the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity or all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public and (ii) comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable, in each case if and for**

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
so long as directed by the Senior Underwriter and as set forth in the related pricing wires, (B) promptly notify the Senior Underwriter of any sales of the Bonds that, to its knowledge, are made to a purchaser who is a related party to an underwriter participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (each such term being used as defined below) and (C) acknowledge that, unless otherwise advised by the Underwriter, dealer or broker-dealer, the Senior Underwriter shall assume that each order submitted by the Underwriter, dealer or broker-dealer is a sale to the public; and

(2) any agreement among underwriters relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together with the related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each Underwriter that is a party to a retail distribution agreement to be employed in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public to require each broker-dealer that is a party to such retail distribution agreement to (A) report the prices at which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each maturity allotted to it until it is notified by the Senior Underwriter or the Underwriter that either the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity or all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public and (B) comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable, in each case if and for so long as directed by the Senior Underwriter or the Underwriter and as set forth in the related pricing wires.

(e) The Underwriters acknowledge that sales of any Bonds to any person that is a related party to an Underwriter shall not constitute sales to the public for purposes of this section. Further, for purposes of this section:

(1) “public” means any person other than an underwriter or a related party,

(2) “underwriter” means (A) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract with the District (or with the lead underwriter to form an underwriting syndicate) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public and (B) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract directly or indirectly with a person described in clause (A) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (including a member of a selling group or a party to a retail distribution agreement participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public),

(3) a purchaser of any of the Bonds is a “related party” to an underwriter if the underwriter and the purchaser are subject, directly or indirectly, to (i) more than 50% common ownership of the voting power or the total value of its stock, if both entities are corporations (including direct ownership by one corporation of another), (ii) more than 50% common ownership of their capital interests or profits interests, if both entities are partnerships (including direct ownership by one partnership of another), or (iii) more than 50% common ownership of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation or the capital interests or profit interests of the partnership, as applicable, if one entity is a corporation and the other entity is a partnership (including direct ownership of the applicable stock or interests by one entity of the other), and

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
(4) “sale date” means the date of execution of this Contract of Purchase by all parties.

6. Termination. The Underwriters shall have the right to terminate their obligations under this Contract of Purchase to purchase, accept delivery of and to pay for the Bonds, if,

(a) between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the market price or marketability, or the ability of the Underwriters to enforce contracts for the sale, at the initial offering prices set forth in the Official Statement, of the Bonds have been materially adversely affected, in the judgment of the Underwriters, (evidenced by a written notice to the District terminating the obligation of the Underwriters to accept delivery of and pay for the Bonds), by reason of any of the following:

(1) (x) any legislation which is (A) enacted by Congress, (B) favorably reported for passage to either House of the Congress of the United States by any Committee of such House to which such legislation has been referred for consideration, or (C) recommended to the Congress for passage by the President of the United States or the Treasury Department, but only, however, if the occurrence of any of the foregoing events is generally accepted by the municipal bond market as potentially affecting the federal tax status of the District, its property or income or the interest on its bonds or notes (including the Bonds), (y) any decision rendered by a court established under Article III of the Constitution of the United States or the Tax Court of the United States, or (z) a final order, ruling, regulation or official statement issued or made by or on behalf of the Treasury Department of the United States or the Internal Revenue Service with the purpose or effect, directly or indirectly, of imposing federal income taxation upon such interest as would be received by the holders of the Bonds, or upon such revenues or other income of the general character expected to be received by the District; provided, however, that the enactment of legislation which only diminishes the value of, as opposed to eliminating the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes will not give the Underwriters the right to terminate their obligations hereunder;

(2) Legislation enacted (or resolution passed) by the Congress or a final order, ruling, regulation or official statement is issued or made by or on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other governmental agency having jurisdiction of the subject matter, to the effect that obligations of the general character of the Bonds are not exempt from registration under or other requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or are not exempt from qualification under, or other requirements of, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or that the issuance, offering or sale of the Bonds or obligations of the general character of the Bonds, including any or all underlying arrangements, as contemplated hereby or by the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement, otherwise is or would be in violation of the federal securities laws as amended and then in effect;  
14  
4870-5972-9833.3
<!-- Page 107 -->
(3) Any new material outbreak or escalation of hostilities having a material effect on the financial markets of the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or the occurrence of any other local, national or international calamity, crisis or event relating to the effective operation of the government of or the financial community in the United States or an escalation thereof, including, without limitation, a downgrade of the sovereign debt rating of the United States by any major credit rating agency or payment default on United States Treasury obligations;

(4) the declaration of a general banking moratorium by federal, New York or California authorities, or the general suspension of trading on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange, or any material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or payment services or clearing services;

(5) the imposition by the New York Stock Exchange or other national securities exchange, or any governmental authority, of any material restrictions not now in force with respect to the Bonds or obligations of the general character of the Bonds or securities generally, or the material increase of any such restrictions now in force, including those relating to the net capital requirements of the Underwriters;

(6) the adoption of any amendment to the federal or California Constitution, decision by any federal or California court, or enactment by any federal or California legislative body materially adversely affecting (i) the District or the District to receive or to pledge any of the Net Revenues, or (ii) the validity or enforceability of this Contract of Purchase, the Bonds or the Resolution;

(7) the adoption of any amendment to the California Constitution, decision by any California court, or enactment by any California legislative body adversely affecting the exemption of state or local income tax upon such interest as would be received by the holders of the Bonds, or

(8) (i) a downgrading or suspension of any rating (without regard to credit enhancement) by Moody’s, S&P, or Fitch of any debt securities issued by the District, or (ii) there shall have been any official statement as to a possible downgrading (such as being placed on “credit watch” or “negative outlook” or any similar qualification) of any rating by Moody’s, S&P or Fitch of any debt securities issued by the District, including the Bonds.

(b) an event occurs, or information becomes known, which, in the judgment of the Underwriters, makes untrue in any material respect any statement or information contained in the Official Statement, or has the effect that the Official Statement contains any untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

**Selection of Bonds for Redemption.** If less than all of a maturity of the Bonds is to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed, from the Outstanding Bonds of such maturity not previously called for redemption, by lot in any manner the Trustee deems fair. For so long as the book-entry only system is in effect with respect to the Bonds, DTC shall select the Bonds to be redeemed in accordance with the procedures of DTC.

**Notice of Redemption.** Notice of redemption for the Bonds will be given by publication at least once in financial newspapers or journals, selected by the Trustee, of general circulation in San Francisco, California, Chicago, Illinois, and New York, New York, each publication to be not less than 20 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption, if at any time the Bonds are not in book entry form. Notice also will be mailed to the registered owners of any Bonds designated for redemption, but failure to mail such notice or any defect therein with respect to any particular Bond will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Bonds. For so long as the book-entry-only system is in effect with respect to the Bonds, the Trustee will mail notice of redemption solely to DTC or its nominee or its successor. Any failure of DTC or its successor, or of a direct or indirect DTC participant, to notify a beneficial owner of a Bond of any redemption will not affect the sufficiency or validity of the redemption of any Bond. The District may instruct the Trustee to give conditional notice of optional redemption, which may be conditioned upon the receipt of moneys or any other event.

Re: Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
$[PAR] Electric Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2024 Series N  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Paragraph 3(d)(6) of the Contract of Purchase (the “Contract of Purchase”), dated [SALE DATE], between BofA Securities, Inc., as Senior Managing Underwriter named therein (the “Senior Underwriter”), and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (the “District”) relating to the above-captioned bonds (the “Bonds”).

As counsel to the District, I have reviewed (i) Resolution No. 6649 of the District, adopted on January 7, 1971, as amended and supplemented to date, including as amended and supplemented by Resolution No. [RESO NO.], adopted on March 21, 2024 (as amended and supplemented, the “Resolution”); (ii) the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, dated the date hereof (the “Undertaking”), between the District and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”); (iii) the Preliminary Official Statement of the District, dated [POS DATE] (the “Preliminary Official Statement”); (iv) the Official Statement of the District, dated [SALE DATE] (the “Official Statement”); (v) the escrow agreement, dated the date hereof (the “Escrow Agreement”), between the District and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as escrow agent (in such capacity, the “Escrow Agent”), and (vi) such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent I deemed necessary to provide the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by authorities. I have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures presented to me (whether as originals or as copies) and the due and legal execution and delivery by, and validity against, any parties other than the District. I have not undertaken to verify independently, and have assumed, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents referred to in the second paragraph hereof. I have further assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in such documents.

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

I call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the Resolution, the Escrow Agreement, the Undertaking, and the Contract of Purchase may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights, to the application of equitable principles, and to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against municipal utility districts in the State of California. I express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, choice of law, choice of forum or waiver provisions contained therein.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, I am of the opinion that:

1. The District is a political subdivision of the State of California duly organized and validly existing under the Act, as amended, and has full legal right, power and authority to execute and deliver (or adopt, as the case may be), and to perform its obligations under, the Resolution, the Escrow Agreement, the Undertaking and the Contract of Purchase.

2. The Contract of Purchase, the Escrow Agreement, and the Undertaking have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the District, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the parties thereto other than the District, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the District, enforceable against the District in accordance with their respective terms.

3. The District is not in breach of or default under any existing constitutional provision, applicable law or administrative regulation of the State of California or the United States or any applicable judgment or decree or any loan agreement, indenture, bond, note, resolution, agreement or other instrument known to me after reasonable inquiry to which the District is a party or to which the District or any of its property or assets is otherwise subject which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District, and no event has occurred and is continuing which with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default or event of default under any such instrument which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District; and the execution and delivery of the Bonds, the Escrow Agreement, the Undertaking and the Contract of Purchase and the adoption of the Resolution, and compliance with any existing constitutional provision, law, administrative regulation, judgment, decree, loan agreement, indenture, bond, note, resolution, agreement or other instrument known to me after reasonable inquiry to which the District is a party or to which the District or any of its property or assets is otherwise subject will not, as of the date hereof, conflict with or constitute a breach of or default under any such instrument which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District, nor will any such execution, delivery, adoption or compliance result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or other security interest or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any of the property or assets of the District or under the terms of any such law, regulation or instrument, except as expressly provided by the Bonds and the Resolution.

4. The statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement which purport to describe certain provisions of the Bonds, the Escrow Agreement, the Undertaking and the Contract of Purchase are accurate in all material respects.

**C-3**

5. Except as described or referred to in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement, as of the date hereof, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, at law or in equity, before or by any court, government agency, public board or body, pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened against the District affecting the corporate existence of the District or the titles of its officers to their respective offices, or affecting or seeking to prohibit, restrain or enjoin the sale, issuance or delivery of the Bonds or the collection of the Revenues (as defined in the Resolution) or the Net Revenues (as defined in the Resolution) pledged or to be pledged to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds or contesting or affecting as to the District the validity or enforceability of the Act, the Bonds, the Resolution, the Escrow Agreement, the Contract of Purchase or the Undertaking, or contesting the tax exempt status of interest on the Bonds, or which may result in any material adverse change relating to the District, other than routine litigation of the type which normally accompanies its operation of its generation, transmission and distribution facilities, or contesting the completeness or accuracy of the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement or any supplement or amendment thereto, or contesting the powers of the District or any authority for the issuance of the Bonds, the adoption of the Resolution, or the execution and delivery by the District of the Contract of Purchase, the Escrow Agreement, or the Undertaking, nor, to the best of my knowledge, is there any basis for any such action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation wherein an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding would materially adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Act or the authorization, execution, delivery or performance by the District of the Bonds, the Resolution, the Escrow Agreement, the Undertaking, or the Contract of Purchase.

6. Based upon my review of the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement as General Counsel to the District and without having undertaken to determine independently the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement (except as specifically set forth in paragraph 4 hereof), I have no reason to believe that the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement (except for information relating Cede & Co., DTC or the operation of the book-entry system, the Appendices (except Appendix A) to the Preliminary Official Statement, and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to all of which I express no view) as of its date and as of the date of the Contract of Purchase contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and the Official Statement (except for information relating Cede & Co., DTC or the operation of the book-entry system, the Appendices (except Appendix A) to the Official Statement, and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to all of which I express no view) (A) as of the date of the Official Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (B) as of the date hereof contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

For purposes of the opinions expressed herein, I have assumed that an agreement or other document is "material" to the District if it involves amounts in excess of $10,000,000 and
<!-- Page 117 -->
that a matter would result in a “material adverse change” to the District if the financial consequences involved would exceed $10,000,000.

I understand that you are relying upon the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel, with respect to the validity of the Bonds and the exclusion of interest on the Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes and the Bonds for purposes of State of California income taxation and, accordingly, render no opinion with respect thereto.

Very truly yours,

**NEW ISSUE - FULL BOOK-ENTRY**

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to SMUD, based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and, assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series M Bonds. See “TAX MATTERS.”

**ELECTRIC REVENUE BONDS, 2024 SERIES M**  
**[(GREEN BONDS – CLIMATE BOND CERTIFIED)]**

Dated: Date of Delivery  
Due: [_____] , as shown on the inside cover

The Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series M (the “2024 Series M Bonds”) will be issued pursuant to the provisions of Resolution No. 6649 of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”), as amended and supplemented, and will be payable from the Net Revenues of the Electric System of SMUD, as described herein. The 2024 Series M Bonds are being issued to (i) finance and refinance certain improvements and additions to SMUD’s Electric System, including by paying the outstanding principal amount of SMUD’s commercial paper notes at maturity, and (ii) pay certain costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds. See “PLAN OF FINANCE.”

The 2024 Series M Bonds will mature in the years and amounts as shown on the inside cover. Interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds will accrue at the rates set forth on the inside cover and be payable on [_____] , 2024, and semiannually thereafter on each [_____] and [_____] .

The 2024 Series M Bonds are subject to redemption prior to maturity as described herein. See “THE 2024 SERIES M – Redemption Provisions.”

The 2024 Series M Bonds have been designated as “Green Bonds – Climate Bond Certified.” Kestrel has provided an independent external review and opinion that the 2024 Series M Bonds conform with the Climate Bonds Standard (Version 4.0), and therefore qualify for Climate Bonds designation. See “DESIGNATION OF 2024 SERIES M BONDS AS GREEN BONDS – CLIMATE BOND CERTIFIED” herein and APPENDIX G – “CLIMATE BOND VERIFIER’S REPORT” hereto for more information.

The 2024 Series M Bonds will be issued in fully registered form and, when issued, will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). DTC will act as securities depository (the “securities Depository”) for the 2024 Series M Bonds. Individual purchases of interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds may be made in book-entry form only, in the principal amount of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. Purchasers of such interests will not receive certificates representing their interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds. Principal and interest are payable directly to the Securities Depository by U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, Trustee and Paying Agent. Upon receipt of payments of principal and interest, the Securities Depository will in turn remit such principal and interest to the Securities Depository’s Direct Participants (as such term is herein-defined) for subsequent distribution to the purchasers of interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds, as described herein. See APPENDIX C – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.”

The principal of and interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds, together with the debt service on other Parity Bonds (as defined herein), are payable exclusively from and secured by a pledge of the Net Revenues of the Electric System of SMUD. Neither the credit nor the taxing power of SMUD or the State of California is pledged to the payment of the 2024 Series M Bonds.

Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $[________] are expected to be outstanding under the Resolution. See "PLAN OF FINANCE."

Although the Resolution establishes an “Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund” (the “Reserve Fund”), the Reserve Fund does not secure and will not be available to pay debt service on the 2024 Series M Bonds. The Reserve Fund secures all Bonds issued prior to January 1, 2004 that are currently outstanding (and not otherwise deemed to be paid and discharged under the Resolution) and may secure additional Bonds issued in the future.

U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association serves as trustee and paying agent under the Resolution (in such capacities, the “Trustee” and the “Paying Agent” respectively).

From time to time, SMUD issues Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Subordinated Bonds”) pursuant to Resolution No. 85-11-1 of SMUD, adopted on November 7, 1985, as amended and supplemented (the “Subordinate Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, Subordinated Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $332,020,000 were outstanding. The Subordinated Bonds are payable solely from the Net Subordinated Revenues of the Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series M Bonds).

SMUD also issues commercial paper notes (the “Notes”) from time to time. As of December 31, 2023, Notes in the principal amount of $150,000,000 were outstanding. Currently, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 may be outstanding at any one time, but SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be outstanding at any one time in the future. The Notes are secured by letters of credit issued by commercial banks. The Notes (and SMUD’s obligations to repay drawings under the letters of credit) are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal, premium if any, and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series M Bonds) and the Subordinated Bonds. Drawings under the letters of credit, to the extent not repaid immediately from the proceeds of commercial paper or other available SMUD funds, are repayable with interest over a period of five years. The letters of credit currently expire in August of 2025 and March of 2027. SMUD expects to pay all $150,000,000 of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes with a portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series M Bonds. See "PLAN OF FINANCE."

SMUD has also previously issued its taxable and tax-exempt revolving notes pursuant to a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank (collectively, the “Revolving Credit Facility”). As of December 31, 2023, no principal amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Currently, the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at any one time is limited to $100,000,000. However, SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the Revolving Credit Facility in the future. SMUD’s payment obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series M Bonds) and the Subordinated Bonds. The current term of the Revolving Credit Facility expires in February 2026.

SMUD is responsible for the acquisition, generation, transmission and distribution of electric power to its service area, which includes most of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. For the year ended December 31, 2023, SMUD served a population of approximately 1.5 million with a total annual load of approximately 10,104 million kilowatt hours (“kWh”). SMUD owns and operates an electric system which, as of December 31, 2023, included generating facilities owned and operated by SMUD with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 775 megawatts (“MW”), local gas-fired plants owned and operated by a joint powers authority and managed by SMUD.
<!-- Page 137 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 1,087 MW, over which SMUD has exclusive control of dispatch, and purchased power with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 1,590 MW and transmission and distribution facilities. SMUD’s power requirements exceed its generating capacity and thus SMUD has agreements with others (including the Local Gas-Fired Plants as defined in APPENDIX A) for the purchase of a portion of its power requirements. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Supply Resources.” Continuing development of SMUD’s business strategy in response to changing environmental and regulatory requirements has had, and is expected to continue to have, a major effect on SMUD’s power supply planning. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – BUSINESS STRATEGY.”

Pursuant to a Continuing Disclosure Agreement, dated the date of issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds (the “Continuing Disclosure Agreement”) between SMUD and the Trustee, SMUD will covenant for the benefit of the holders of the 2024 Series M Bonds and owners of beneficial interest in the 2024 Series M Bonds to provide certain financial information and operating data and to provide certain notices. See “CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING” and APPENDIX F – “FORM OF CONTINUING DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT.”

This Official Statement, including the Appendices, summarizes the terms of the 2024 Series M Bonds, the Resolution and certain agreements, contracts and other arrangements, some of which currently exist and others of which exist in the future. The summaries of and references to all documents, statutes, regulations and other instruments referred to herein are not to be complete, comprehensive or definitive, and each summary and reference is qualified in its entirety by reference to each such document, statute, regulation or instrument.

**PLAN OF FINANCE**

**Issuance of 2024 Series M Bonds**

The proceeds of the 2024 Series M Bonds will be used to (i) finance and refinance certain improvements and additions to SMUD’s Electric System, including by paying the outstanding principal amount of SMUD’s commercial paper notes at maturity, [and (ii) pay certain costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds]. The issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds is a component of the Plan of Finance, as further described below. The issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds is not contingent upon the implementation of the other components of the Plan of Finance, and SMUD is not obligated to implement any of the components of the Plan of Finance.

**Issuance of 2024 Series N Bonds and Refunding of Refunded Bonds**

Concurrently with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds, SMUD expects to issue approximately $[_____]† aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Series N Bonds to (i) refund the  
* Preliminary, subject to change.
<!-- Page 138 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

$200,000,000 outstanding principal amount of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Bonds, 2009 Series V (the “2009 Series V Bonds”), (ii) refund the $250,000,000 outstanding principal amount of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Bonds, 2010 Series W (the “2010 Series W Bonds” and, together with the 2009 Series V Bonds, the “Refunded Bonds”) [and (iii) pay certain costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds].

The Refunded Bonds were issued as bonds designated as “Build America Bonds” under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “Recovery Act”). At the time the Refunded Bonds were issued, SMUD expected to receive cash subsidy payments from the United States Treasury equal to 35% of the interest payable on the Refunded Bonds as required by sections 54AA and 6431 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (as such sections were added to the Code by the Recovery Act). However, as a result of the enactment of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “Budget Control Act”) and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the “Taxpayer Relief Act”) the subsidy payments for the Refunded Bonds became subject to sequestration and have been reduced to an amount less than 35% of the interest payable on the Refunded Bonds as originally required by sections 54AA and 6431 of the Code. See also APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments.”

The 2009 Series V Bonds are subject to extraordinary optional redemption upon the occurrence of an “Extraordinary Event.” Pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions for the 2009 Series V Bonds, an “Extraordinary Event” will have occurred if SMUD determines that a material adverse change has occurred to Section 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as such Sections were added by Section 1531 of the Recovery Act), pertaining to Build America Bonds, or if the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury makes a determination by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury with respect to such Sections or any other determination by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury, which determination is not the result of an act or omission by SMUD to satisfy the requirements to receive the 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury, pursuant to which SMUD’s 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury is reduced or eliminated.

The 2010 Series W Bonds are subject to extraordinary optional redemption upon the occurrence of a “Tax Law Change.” Pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions for the 2010 Bonds, “Tax Law Change” means legislation has been enacted by the Congress of the United States or passed by either House of the Congress, or a decision has been rendered by a court of the United States, or an order, ruling, regulation (final, temporary or proposed) or official statement has been made by or on behalf of the Treasury Department of the United States, the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental agency of appropriate jurisdiction, the effect of which, as reasonably determined by SMUD, would be to suspend, reduce or terminate the payment from the United States Treasury to SMUD with respect to the 2010 Series W Bonds, or to state or local government issuers generally with respect to obligations of the general character of the 2010 Series W Bonds, pursuant to Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code of an amount equal to 35% of the interest due thereon on each interest payment date (the “Subsidy Payments”); provided, that such suspension, reduction or termination of the Subsidy Payments is not due to a failure by the District to comply with the requirements under the Code to receive such Subsidy Payments.

The extraordinary optional redemption provisions for each series of the Refunded Bonds are described in the related Official Statement for such series of Refunded Bonds. The Official Statements for the Refunded Bonds can be found at the following links:

2009 Series V Bonds: [https://emma.msrb.org/FP520561-EP406639-EP803941.pdf](https://emma.msrb.org/FP520561-EP406639-EP803941.pdf)  
2010 Series W Bonds: [https://emma.msrb.org/EA393164-EA308929-EA704612.pdf](https://emma.msrb.org/EA393164-EA308929-EA704612.pdf)  

The foregoing links are provided for reference and convenience only. The Official Statements for the Refunded Bonds are not incorporated herein by reference and do not constitute part of this Official Statement.

For various reasons, including but not limited to, the enactment of the Budget Control Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act and the resulting reduction of the cash subsidy payments required to be paid by the United States Treasury to SMUD with respect to the Refunded Bonds pursuant to section 6431 of the Code, SMUD has determined that an “Extraordinary Event” has occurred with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and that a “Tax Law Change” has occurred with respect to the 2010 Series W Bonds. Therefore, SMUD expects to redeem the Refunded Bonds pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions applicable to each series of the Refunded Bonds.

[If the 2024 Series N Bonds are issued, then a portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds, [together with other available funds], will be deposited in one or more escrow funds (the “Escrow Funds”) established under one or more escrow agreements between SMUD and the Trustee. The moneys so deposited will be invested in direct obligations of the United States of America (the “Federal Securities”), the interest on and principal of which, together with other moneys held in the Escrow Funds, are expected to be in an amount sufficient to pay the interest on the Refunded Bonds due on [____] (the “Redemption Date”) and to redeem the Refunded Bonds on the Redemption Date at their respective redemption prices. [Upon deposit, all liability of SMUD with respect to the Refunded Bonds (except for the obligation of SMUD to pay the interest on and redemption price of the Refunded Bonds from moneys in the Escrow Fund) will cease. The Refunded Bonds will be entitled to payment from SMUD solely from moneys or Federal Securities on deposit in the Escrow Fund, and the Refunded Bonds will no longer be outstanding under the Resolution.] [Notwithstanding the depositing of the Escrow Funds, the Refunded Bonds will remain outstanding, and SMUD will remain liable for the payment of the principal and redemption price of and interest on the Refunded Bonds, until the Refunded Bonds are actually redeemed in full on the Redemption Date.] The Federal Securities and moneys in the Escrow Funds will not secure the 2024 Series M Bonds and will not be available to pay the principal of or interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds.]

[If the 2024 Series N Bonds are issued, then a portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds, [together with other available funds], will be used to pay the interest on the Refunded Bonds due on [____] (the “Redemption Date”) and to redeem the Refunded Bonds on the Redemption Date at their respective redemption prices.]

# THE 2024 SERIES M BONDS

The 2024 Series M Bonds will mature in the years and amounts and bear interest at the rates set forth on the inside cover page hereof. Interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds will accrue from the date of delivery of the 2024 Series M Bonds, and will be payable on [____], 2024, and semiannually thereafter on each [____] and [____] (each, an “Interest Payment Date”) to the owners thereof as of the first day of the month (whether or not such day is a Business Day) in which an Interest Payment Date occurs (each, a “Record Date”).

The 2024 Series M Bonds will be issued in fully registered form and, when issued, will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). DTC will act as securities depository (the “Securities Depository”) for the 2024 Series M Bonds. Individual purchases of interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds will be made in book-entry form only, in the principal amount of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. Purchasers of such interests will not receive certificates representing their interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds. Principal and interest are payable directly to the Securities Depository by the Trustee. Upon receipt of payments of principal and interest, the Securities Depository will in turn remit such principal and interest to the Securities Depository’s Direct Participants (as such term is hereinafter defined) for subsequent disbursement to the purchasers of interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds. See APPENDIX C – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.”

## Redemption Provisions*

### Optional Redemption.
On any date on or after [____], 20__, the 2024 Series M Bonds maturing on and after [____], 20__ are subject to redemption prior to their stated maturities at the option of the Issuer, from any source of available funds, as a whole or in part, at the principal amount thereof, without premium, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption.

### Mandatory Redemption.
The 2024 Series M Bonds maturing on [____], 20__, are subject to mandatory redemption prior to maturity, in part, by lot, from sinking fund payments required for the 2024 Series M Bonds by the Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution at the principal amount thereof together with the accrued interest thereon to the date fixed for redemption, without premium, as shown below:

**Selection of Bonds for Redemption.** If less than all of a maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds is to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the 2024 Series M Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed, from the Outstanding 2024 Series M Bonds of such maturity not previously called for redemption, by lot in any manner the Trustee deems fair. For so long as the book-entry only system is in effect with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds, DTC shall select the 2024 Series M Bonds to be redeemed in accordance with the procedures of DTC.

**Notice of Redemption.** Notice of redemption for the 2024 Series M Bonds will be given by publication at least once in financial newspapers or journals, selected by the Trustee, of general circulation in San Francisco, California, Chicago, Illinois, and New York, New York, each such publication to be not less than 20 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption, if at any time the 2024 Series M Bonds are not in book entry form. Notice also will be mailed to the registered owners of any 2024 Series M Bonds designated for redemption, but failure to mail such notice or any defect therein with respect to any particular 2024 Series M Bonds will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other 2024 Series M Bonds. For so long as the book-entry-only system is in effect with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds, the Trustee will mail notice of redemption solely to DTC or its nominee or its successor. Any failure of DTC or its successor, or of a direct or indirect DTC participant, to notify a beneficial owner of a 2024 Series M Bond of any redemption will not affect the sufficiency or validity of the redemption of any 2024 Series M Bond. See APPENDIX C – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.” SMUD may instruct the Trustee to give conditional notice of optional redemption, which may be conditioned upon the receipt of moneys or any other event.

# SECURITY FOR THE BONDS

## General

The principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds, together with other Parity Bonds, are payable exclusively from, and are secured by a pledge (effected in the manner and to the extent provided in the Resolution), of the Net Revenues of the Electric System of SMUD.

Neither the credit nor the taxing power of SMUD is pledged to the payment of the Bonds and the general fund of SMUD is not liable for the payment thereof. The owners of the Bonds cannot compel the exercise of any taxing power of SMUD or the forfeiture of any of its property. The Bonds are not a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien or encumbrance upon any of SMUD’s property (including the Electric System) or upon any of its income, receipts or revenues except the Net Revenues of the Electric System to the extent of the pledge thereof contained in the Resolution.

## Consent to Amendments to the Resolution

The purchasers of the 2024 Series M Bonds, by virtue of their purchase of the 2024 Series M Bonds, will consent to certain amendments to the Resolution (the “Proposed Amendments”). Such amendments are described in **bold italic** font herein under “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Rates and Charges” and “– Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues” and in APPENDIX D – “SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION – Certain Definitions” and “– Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds.” The written consents to the Proposed Amendments of the holders and registered owners of at least 60% of the Bonds outstanding have been filed with SMUD or the Trustee, as required by the Resolution. However, while certain Bonds remain outstanding, SMUD must also obtain the written consents of certain bond insurers to implement the Proposed Amendments. SMUD expects to implement the Proposed Amendments when the written consents of such bond insurers are obtained or
<!-- Page 145 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

when the Bonds insured by such bond insurers are no longer outstanding. The final maturity date of the insured Bonds is July 1, 2024.

**Allocation of Revenues**

After making an allocation of Revenues to Maintenance and Operation Costs and to Energy Payments not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs, the Treasurer of SMUD is required (subject to the last paragraph of this section) to set aside, on an equal priority with sums set aside for all other Parity Bonds, Net Revenues as follows:

**First:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Interest Fund, in approximately equal monthly installments on or before the first day of each month, an amount equal to at least one-fifth (1/5) of the aggregate amount of interest becoming due on the Bonds on the next succeeding semiannual interest payment date, until an amount sufficient to meet said interest payment is accumulated.

**Second:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Redemption Fund, to be set aside in the Principal Account and Sinking Fund, respectively, in approximately equal monthly installments on or before the first day of each month, an amount equal to at least one-tenth (1/10) of the aggregate amount of principal becoming due on serial Bonds and the aggregate minimum sinking fund payments required to be made with respect to term Bonds during the next ensuing 12 months, until an amount sufficient to meet the principal and sinking fund requirements on all Bonds outstanding is accumulated in said accounts, respectively.

**Third:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund, such amounts as any supplemental resolution authorizing the issuance of a series of Bonds may require to build up and maintain said fund.

If interest on Bonds of a series or maturity is payable more frequently than semiannually, the Treasurer of SMUD shall set aside out of Net Revenues in the Interest Fund such amounts as may be required to pay interest on the Bonds of such series or maturity on each interest payment date at least one month prior to such interest payment date. Allocation to the Electric Revenue Bond Redemption Fund and Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund shall be made as set forth above.

All remaining Revenues, after making the foregoing allocations, will be available to SMUD for all lawful SMUD purposes.

From time to time, SMUD may deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund from such remaining Revenues such amounts as SMUD shall determine, provided that deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund from remaining Revenues in any fiscal year may be made until (but not after) the date 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. SMUD may withdraw amounts from the Rate Stabilization Fund only for inclusion in Revenues for any fiscal year, such withdrawals to be made until (but not after) 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. All interest or other earnings upon deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund shall be withdrawn therefrom and accounted for as Revenues. No deposit of Revenues to the Rate Stabilization Fund may be made to the extent such Revenues were included in any certificate submitted in connection with the issuance of additional bonds and withdrawal of the Revenues from the Revenues employed in rendering said certificate would have caused noncompliance with the additional bond provisions or to the extent withdrawals of the Revenues for any fiscal year would have reduced the debt.
<!-- Page 146 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)  

service ratio for such fiscal year to or below 1.40:1.00. See APPENDIX A – “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges” for a description of the balance in the Rate Stabilization Fund.

With respect to Bonds of a series issued on or after October 1, 2003 (including the 2024 Series M Bonds), notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Bonds of such series or maturity are outstanding, the supplemental resolution authorizing the issuance of such series shall require the Treasurer, out of Net Revenues received by SMUD, to set aside in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account, respectively, such amounts as may be required so that an amount equal to the amount of principal and/or interest becoming due and payable on the Bonds of such series or maturity on each interest payment date and principal payment date is on deposit in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account, respectively, at such time on or prior to such interest payment date or principal payment date as shall be specified in the supplemental resolution authorizing such Bonds.

**Rates and Charges**

SMUD has covenanted in the Resolution to establish and at all times maintain and collect rates and charges for the sale or use of electric energy generated, transmitted, distributed or furnished by SMUD which, together with certain items of other income permitted under the Resolution, will yield Revenues at least sufficient, with respect to the ensuing 12 months, to pay and provide for all sums required for Maintenance and Operation Costs and Energy Payments not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs and, in addition, to provide an aggregate sum equal to at least 1.20 times the total amount required for the payment of principal and interest, together with any sinking fund or reserve fund payments, on the Bonds and all Parity Bonds, in each case during such 12 months.

For purposes of the calculations of payments to be made pursuant to the Resolution, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal and interest on Parity Bonds, if a Financial Products Agreement has been entered into by SMUD with respect to any Parity Bonds, interest on such Parity Bonds shall be included in the calculation of such principal and interest by including for each fiscal year or period an amount equal to the amount of interest payable on such Parity Bonds in such fiscal year or period at the rate or rates stated in such Parity Bonds plus any Financial Product Payments payable in such fiscal year or period minus any Financial Product Receipts receivable in such fiscal year or period; provided that in no event shall any calculation made pursuant to this clause result in a number less than zero being included in the calculation of such principal and interest.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal and interest on Parity Bonds, Excluded Principal Payments shall be disregarded (but interest on the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payments relate shall be included until but not after the stated due date when principal payments on such Parity Bonds are scheduled by their terms to commence) and Assumed Principal Payments and Assumed Interest Payments shall be included; and for purposes of the above calculations of interest on Parity Bonds, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

SMUD has full power to establish rates and charges for all SMUD services, and the levels of such rates are not subject to review or regulation by any other governmental agency, either federal or state.

For purposes of the calculations specified in this section: (1) any calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy that SMUD receives or expects to receive during such period of time relating to or in connection with such Parity Bonds; and (2) to the extent the calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds is reduced by the Subsidy as provided in clause (1) of this paragraph, any calculation of Revenues for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy received or expected to be received by SMUD with respect to or in connection with such Parity Bonds during such period of time.

See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments” for a description of the current Subsidy that SMUD receives with respect to the Refunded Bonds.

### Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues

The Resolution provides that SMUD will not, so long as any Bonds are outstanding, issue any obligations payable in whole or in part from Revenues except the following:

1. Refunding bonds issued solely to refund all or part of the Bonds or Parity Bonds;

2. General obligation bonds or other securities secured by the full faith and credit of SMUD;

3. Additional revenue bonds (including additional Bonds under the Resolution and additional Parity Bonds), payable on a parity with the Bonds, with an equal lien and charge upon the Revenues, but only subject to the following conditions:

   (a) Such additional revenue bonds shall have been authorized for the proceeds therefrom required to be applied to additions, betterments, extensions or improvements to the Electric System (and necessary costs of issuance, interest during construction and reserve funds);

   (b) The proceedings for the issuance of such additional revenue bonds shall require SMUD to fix and collect rates and charges in an amount not less, with respect to such bonds, than the amounts required with respect to Bonds issued under the Resolution;

   (c) SMUD shall not then be in default under the Resolution or other resolutions authorizing the issuance of Parity Bonds; and

   (d) The Trustee shall receive a certificate of SMUD to the effect (i) that Net Revenues, after completion of the improvements proposed to be financed by such additional revenue bonds, will be sufficient to pay the principal of and interest (and bond reserve fund requirements) on all Bonds and Parity Bonds then outstanding and on such additional revenue bonds; and (ii) that for a period of 12 consecutive months during the 24 months immediately preceding the issuance of the additional revenue bonds the Net Revenues have been at least equal to 1.25 times maximum annual debt service on all Bonds and Parity Bonds then outstanding and on such additional revenue bonds (after adjusting Net Revenues to include 75 percent of the estimated additional Net Revenues to be derived from an increase in rates and charges or from the acquisition of an existing revenue producing electric system); and
<!-- Page 148 -->
4. Revenue bonds junior and subordinate to the Bonds and Parity Bonds.

For purposes of the above calculations, Excluded Principal Payments shall be disregarded (but interest on the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payments relate shall be included until but not after the stated due date when principal payments on such Parity Bonds are scheduled by their terms to commence) and Assumed Principal Payments and Assumed Interest Payments shall be included; and for purposes of the above calculations of interest on Parity Bonds, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds, if a Financial Products Agreement has been entered into by SMUD with respect to any Parity Bonds, interest on such Parity Bonds shall be included in the calculation of such principal and interest by including for each fiscal year or period an amount equal to the amount of interest payable on such Parity Bonds in such fiscal year or period at the rate or rates stated in such Parity Bonds plus any Financial Product Payments payable in such fiscal year or period minus any Financial Product Receipts receivable in such fiscal year or period; provided that in no event shall any calculation made pursuant to this clause result in a number less than zero being included in the calculation of such principal and interest.

For purposes of the calculations specified in this section: (1) any calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy that SMUD receives or expects to receive during such period of time relating to or in connection with such Parity Bonds; and (2) to the extent the calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds is reduced by the Subsidy as provided in clause (1) of this paragraph, any calculation of Net Revenues for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy received or expected to be received by SMUD with respect to or in connection with such Parity Bonds during such period of time.

See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Estimated Capital Requirements” for a description of SMUD’s projected capital requirements. Such capital requirements may be satisfied through the issuance of additional Bonds or Parity Bonds.

See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments” for a description of the current Subsidy that SMUD receives with respect to the Refunded Bonds.

See APPENDIX D hereto for the definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this section.

**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

SMUD’s audited, consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are included in APPENDIX B attached to this Official Statement. These financial statements have been audited by Baker Tilly US, LLP, Madison, Wisconsin (the “Auditor”), for the periods indicated and to the extent set forth in their report thereon and should be read in their entirety. SMUD has not requested nor did it obtain permission from the Auditor to include the audited, consolidated financial statements as an appendix to this Official Statement. Accordingly, the Auditor has not performed any procedures to review the financial condition or operations of SMUD subsequent to the date of its report included therein, nor has it reviewed any information contained in this Official Statement.

**TAX MATTERS**

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to SMUD (“Bond Counsel”), based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series M Bonds. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in APPENDIX E hereto.

To the extent the issue price of any maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds is less than the amount to be paid at maturity of such 2024 Series M Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least annually over the term of such 2024 Series M Bonds), the difference constitutes “original issue discount,” the accrual of which, to the extent properly allocable to each Beneficial Owner thereof, is treated as interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and exempt from State of California personal income taxes. For this purpose, the issue price of a particular maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds is the first price at which a substantial amount of such maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds is sold to the public (excluding bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). The original issue discount with respect to any maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds accrues daily over the term to maturity of such 2024 Series M Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded semiannually (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). The accruing original issue discount is added to the adjusted basis of such 2024 Series M Bonds to determine taxable gain or loss upon trade or business disposition (including sale, redemption, or payment at maturity) of such 2024 Series M Bonds. Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series M Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of 2024 Series M Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of Beneficial Owners who do not purchase such 2024 Series M Bonds in the original offering to the public at the first price at which a substantial amount of such 2024 Series M Bonds is sold to the public.

2024 Series M Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount higher than their principal amount payable at maturity (or, in some cases, at their earlier call date) (“Premium Bonds”) will be treated as having amortizable bond premium. No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the case of bonds, like the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is
<!-- Page 152 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Page+18) 

**Page 18**

The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the 2024 Series M Bonds. SMUD has made certain representations and covenanted to comply with certain restrictions, conditions and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds will not be included in federal gross income. Inaccuracy of these representations or failure to comply with these covenants may result in interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants. Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken), or events occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond Counsel’s attention after the date of issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the 2024 Series M Bonds. Accordingly, the opinion of Bond Counsel is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon in connection with any such actions, events or matters.

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of amounts treated as interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds may otherwise affect a Beneficial Owner’s federal, state or local tax liability. The nature and extent of these tax consequences depend upon the Beneficial Owner or the Beneficial Owner’s other items of income or deduction. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences.

Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Code or court decisions may cause interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to federal income taxation or to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent Beneficial Owners from realizing the full current benefit of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals or clarification of the Code or court decisions may also affect, perhaps significantly, the market price for, or marketability of, the 2024 Series M Bonds. Prospective purchasers of the 2024 Series M Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential impact of any pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment of the 2024 Series M Bonds for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of SMUD, or about the effect of future changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the IRS. SMUD has covenanted, however, to comply with the requirements of the Code.

Bond Counsel’s engagement with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds ends with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds and, unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to defend SMUD or the Beneficial Owners regarding the tax-exempt status of the 2024 Series M Bonds in the event of an audit examination by the IRS. Under current procedures, Beneficial Owners would have little, if any, right to participate in the audit examination process. Moreover, because achieving judicial review in
<!-- Page 153 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)

connection with an audit examination of tax-exempt bonds is difficult, obtaining an independent review of IRS positions with which SMUD legitimately disagrees may not be practicable. Any action of the IRS, including but not limited to selection of the 2024 Series M Bonds for audit, or the course or result of such audit, or an audit of bonds presenting similar tax issues may affect the market price for, or the marketability of, the 2024 Series M Bonds, and may cause SMUD or the Beneficial Owners to incur significant expense.

Payments on the 2024 Series M Bonds generally will be subject to U.S. information reporting and possibly to “backup withholding.” Under Section 3406 of the Code and applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, a non-corporate Beneficial Owner of 2024 Series M Bonds may be subject to backup withholding with respect to “reportable payments,” which include interest paid on the 2024 Series M Bonds and the gross proceeds of a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of the 2024 Series M Bonds. The payor will be required to deduct and withhold the prescribed amounts if (i) the payee fails to furnish a U.S. taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) to the payor in the manner required, (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect, (iii) there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in Section 3406(c) of the Code or (iv) the payee fails to certify under penalty of perjury that the payee is not subject to withholding under Section 3406(a)(1)(C) of the Code. Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a Beneficial Owner’s federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Certain Beneficial Owners (including among others, corporations and certain tax-exempt organizations) are not subject to backup withholding. The failure to comply with the backup withholding rules may result in the imposition of penalties by the IRS.

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING

Pursuant to the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, SMUD will covenant for the benefit of the holders and the “Beneficial Owners” (as defined in the Continuing Disclosure Agreement) of the 2024 Series M Bonds to provide certain financial information and operating data relating to SMUD by not later than 180 days after the end of each SMUD’s fiscal years (presently, each December 31), commencing with the report for the year ending December 31, 2024 (the “Annual Report”), and to provide notices of the occurrence of certain listed events with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds. The Annual Report will be filed by or on behalf of SMUD with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the “MSRB”) through its Electronic Municipal Market Access system (“EMMA”) and any notices of such listed events will be filed by or on behalf of SMUD with the MSRB through EMMA. The specific nature of the information to be contained in the Annual Report and the notices of listed events are set forth in the form of the Continuing Disclosure Agreement which is included in its entirety in APPENDIX F hereto. SMUD’s covenant will be made in order to assist the Underwriters in complying with Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12.

[UPDATE/CONFIRM] [In a limited number of circumstances, certain of the annual reports, audited financial statements or listed event filings required to be made by SMUD during the last five years under its continuing disclosure undertakings were not connected to all of the CUSIP numbers of the bonds subject to the continuing disclosure undertakings. In addition, SMUD entered into two subordinated forward starting interest rate swaps in December 2019 and filed a notice of the interest rate swaps with the MSRB through EMMA in April 2020. A notice of rating upgrade on October 6, 2020, by Moody’s Investors Service of the Northern California Gas Authority No. 1 Gas Project Revenue Bonds, Series 2007B, was also not filed until October 28, 2020.]

# RATINGS

Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”) and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) have assigned ratings of “[AA (stable outlook)]” and “[Aa2 (stable outlook)],” respectively, to the 2024 Series M Bonds. Such ratings reflect only the views of such organizations and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the 2024 Series M Bonds. Explanations of the significance of such ratings may be obtained only from the respective rating agencies. SMUD has furnished to Fitch and Moody’s certain information and materials concerning the 2024 Series M Bonds and itself. Generally, a rating agency bases its rating on the information and materials furnished to it and on investigations, studies and assumptions of its own. There is no assurance that such ratings will continue for any given period or that they will not be revised downward, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the respective rating agencies, if in the judgment of such rating agency, circumstances so warrant. SMUD has not, other than as described under “CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING” above, and the Underwriters have not undertaken any responsibility either to bring to the attention of the holders or beneficial owners of the 2024 Series M Bonds any proposed revision, suspension or withdrawal of any rating on the 2024 Series M Bonds or to oppose any such proposed revision, suspension or withdrawal. Any such downward revision, suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price or marketability of the 2024 Series M Bonds.

# INTRODUCTION

## General

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) owns and operates an electric system that has provided retail electric service since 1946. SMUD’s current service area is approximately 900 square miles, and includes the principal parts of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. See “THE SERVICE AREA AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM – The Service Area.”

## Independent Governance

SMUD is an independently run community-owned organization. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government.

SMUD is governed by a Board of Directors (the “Board”), which consists of seven directors elected by ward for staggered four-year terms. The Board determines policy and appoints the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, who is responsible for SMUD’s overall management and day-to-day operations. The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager is responsible for the hiring and removal of all employees, other than the Chief Legal and Government Affairs Officer and General Counsel, the Internal Auditor and the Special Assistant to the Board, who are hired and may be removed only by the Board. The employment status of nearly all SMUD employees is governed by a civil service system administered by the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager.

The Board elects its President and Vice President annually to take office in January. The current members of the Board are as follows:

| Name                     | Occupation                                               | Ward  | Term Expires     |

# THE SERVICE AREA AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM

## The Service Area

SMUD is the primary distributor of electric power within an area of approximately 900 square miles in central California. The service area includes the State Capital, Sacramento, the populous areas principally to the northeast and south of the City of Sacramento (the “City” or “Sacramento”) and the agricultural areas to the north and south. The City is located 85 miles northeast of San Francisco.

SMUD’s electric system supplies power to a population of approximately 1.5 million with a total annual retail load of approximately 10,104 million kilowatt-hours (“kWh”) for the year ended December 31, 2023. As the capital of the nation’s most populous state, Sacramento benefits from the historically stabilizing influence of a large government sector. Sacramento is home to the State government headquarters, the Sacramento County seat, the City government and various special districts that combine to make government the largest single employment sector in the Sacramento area. Information technology, transportation, education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and construction round out the other major sectors of employment and industry in the area.

SMUD’s annual peak load has averaged 3,045 Megawatts (“MW”) over the last three years, with SMUD’s record peak load of 3,299 MW occurring on July 24, 2006. In 2022, SMUD recorded its second highest peak load of 3,263 MW. SMUD reviews its load forecast, at a minimum, on an annual basis.

**The Electric System**

SMUD owns and operates an integrated electric system that includes generation, transmission and distribution facilities.

SMUD supplies power to its bulk power substations through a 230 kilovolt (“kV”) and 115 kV transmission system. This system transmits power from SMUD’s generation plants and interconnects with Pacific Gas & Electric (“PG&E”) and the Western Area Power Administration (“WAPA”). Power is distributed throughout Sacramento County via a 69 kV sub-transmission system with the exception of the City’s downtown area, which is served from the 115 kV transmission system. The downtown area is served from 115/12 kV and 115/21 kV substations. The distribution system serving the remainder of SMUD’s service territory is comprised of 69/12 kV substations with overhead and underground 12 kV distribution circuits.

**BUSINESS STRATEGY**

**General**

SMUD’s Board of Directors has established the following purpose and vision statements: “SMUD’s purpose is to enhance the quality of life for our customers and community by providing reliable and affordable electricity, and leading the transition to a clean energy future. SMUD’s vision is to be a trusted and powerful partner in achieving an inclusive, zero carbon economy. SMUD will leverage its relationships to accelerate innovation, ensure energy affordability and reliability, protect the environment, eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, catalyze economic and workforce development, promote environmental justice, and enhance community vitality for all.” The Board has adopted a set of Strategic Directions with related metrics, which it considers essential for the success of SMUD and for serving SMUD’s customers. These include competitive rates, access to credit markets, reliability, customer relations, environmental leadership, resource planning, enterprise risk management and safety. Some of the general elements in SMUD’s business strategy are:

- developing and maintaining a sustainable and reliable power supply to meet demand growth consistent with State mandates and the Board’s directions for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions to zero by 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan”;
- working closely with customers to provide the information, tools and incentives to assist them to more efficiently manage energy use, which will contribute to meeting greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission targets and managing needle peak demand requirements (those 40 or so hours of the year with extreme temperatures when customer demand surges by up to 400 additional MW);
- managing price, volumetric and credit risks associated with energy and natural gas procurement;
- attracting, developing and retaining a diverse, skilled and engaged workforce that reflects SMUD’s values and is committed to achieving SMUD’s mission;
- retaining local decision making authority and operational independence; and
- collaborating regionally to attract new businesses and grow existing business to diversify and strengthen the Sacramento economy.

SMUD’s long-range business strategy focuses in part on ensuring financial stability by establishing rates that provide an acceptable fixed charge coverage ratio on a consolidated basis, taking into consideration the impact of capital expenditures and other factors on cash flow.

with current energy market prices. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges.”

**Renewable Options.** SMUD’s customers have been increasingly interested in distributed energy resources, mainly through the installation of solar systems. As of December 2023, approximately 51,374 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, approximately 8% of retail customers, had installed solar systems, representing approximately 360 MW of solar installations.

As the cost of energy storage continues to decline, SMUD anticipates an increase in behind-the-meter energy storage, mainly through the installation of battery storage systems. As of December 2023, approximately 1,532 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, had installed storage systems, representing approximately 10 MW of storage.

As another option for solar, SMUD’s SolarShares® pilot program (the “SolarShares Pilot”) was established as a cost-effective and convenient way for commercial customers to meet their energy needs from solar power. The SolarShares Pilot offered SMUD commercial customers the opportunity to receive solar power without upfront costs or equipment installation through 5-, 10- or 20-year purchase contracts. Customers that entered into purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot receive up to half of their power from a utility-scale solar system. SMUD supplies solar power for the SolarShares Pilot either by building and maintaining utility-scale solar systems or by procuring solar power from third parties through power purchase agreements. The SolarShares Pilot generation was approximately 3.2% of retail sales in 2023. As of April 30, 2021, SMUD had completed the SolarShares Pilot and is not entering into new purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot.

Since January 2020, the California Building Code has required all new constructed residential buildings under three stories to be powered by photovoltaic solar systems. A new home satisfies this requirement if it installs on-site solar or participates in an approved community solar or energy storage program. In February 2020, SMUD obtained approval from the California Energy Commission (“CEC”) to administer its own community solar program, called Neighborhood SolarShares® (“Neighborhood SolarShares”). SMUD’s Neighborhood SolarShares program can be used by developers of new low-rise residential buildings to satisfy the mandatory solar requirement. See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Rooftop Solar Mandate.” Starting in 2023, the California Building Code’s mandatory solar requirement extends beyond low-rise residential properties, and other changes to the California Building Code’s community solar regulations took effect. SMUD revised its program to align with the new regulations and, in May 2023, obtained approval from the CEC to continue offering its Neighborhood SolarShares compliance option to newly constructed low rise residential homes in its service territory.

In addition to the SolarShares Pilot and Neighborhood SolarShares, SMUD maintains a voluntary green energy pricing program called Greenergy® (“Greenery”). The Greenery program allows customers the opportunity to pay an additional amount per month to ensure that either all or part of their electricity comes from green or carbon free energy sources. In 2023, the program allocated Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”) equivalent to approximately 4.2% of retail sales to its participating customers.

**Energy Efficiency.** To further assist customers in managing energy use and reducing regional carbon emissions and air pollution, SMUD offers an extensive array of energy efficiency and building electrification programs and services including financial incentives, loans, energy audits and education. In addition, SMUD has partnered with local developers to incorporate energy efficiency and all-electric construction measures into new residential and commercial construction, which helps developers plan and design efficient, cost-effective and low or zero-emission buildings. As part of SMUD’s 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”), SMUD set a goal for regional carbon emissions through transport and building

# Electrification and Sustainable Power Supply

**Electrification Goals**  
SMUD’s electrification aims to reduce carbon emissions in buildings and transport by 64% over the next 20 years. SMUD’s focus on electrification is continued in the Zero Carbon Plan (defined and discussed below). SMUD was the first electric utility in the country to set its efficiency goals based on carbon reductions, allowing building electrification and energy efficiency to both count toward meeting SMUD’s efficiency goals. This is a significant opportunity, as converting a typical home today to all-electric saves more than three times the carbon emissions compared to doing a major energy efficiency upgrade alone to the same building. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources.”

## Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission

Maintaining a sustainable power supply entails focusing efforts on researching, promoting and implementing new renewable energy technologies and sources to meet SMUD’s long-term commitment to reducing carbon emissions and providing a reliable energy supply. SMUD defines a sustainable power supply as one that reduces SMUD’s GHG emissions to serve retail customer load to zero by 2030. See “– 2030 Zero Carbon Plan”. SMUD is planning to achieve zero GHG emissions to serve retail customer load through investments in energy efficiency, clean distributed energy resources, renewables portfolio standard (“RPS”) eligible renewables, energy storage, large hydroelectric generation, clean and emissions free fuels, carbon capture and sequestration, and new technologies and business models. Additionally, SMUD plans to continue pursuing GHG emissions reductions through vehicle, building and equipment electrification. At the same time, SMUD’s plans for maintaining a sustainable power supply include assuring the reliability of SMUD’s electric system, minimizing environmental impacts on land, habitat, water and air quality, and maintaining competitive rates relative to other electric providers in the State.

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills regulate GHG emissions and promote the development of sustainable generation alternatives, principally through more stringent RPS. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings” herein.

### 2030 Zero Carbon Plan

In July 2020, the Board declared a climate emergency and adopted a resolution calling for SMUD to take significant and consequential actions to reduce its carbon footprint by 2030. On April 28, 2021, the Board approved SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan (the “Zero Carbon Plan”). The Zero Carbon Plan is intended to be a flexible roadmap for SMUD to eliminate carbon emissions from its electricity production by 2030 while maintaining reliable and affordable service. To achieve these goals the Zero Carbon Plan is focused on four main areas: natural gas generation repurposing, proven technologies, new technologies and business models and financial impacts and options. SMUD plans to revisit the Zero Carbon Plan annually.

The natural gas generation repurposing focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for exploring the replacement of two of SMUD’s five Local Gas-Fired Plants (as defined herein) and the retooling of the other three Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” Based on SMUD’s studies to date, SMUD estimates that McClellan (as defined herein) and the Campbell Soup Project (as defined herein) can be replaced in the next several years depending on SMUD’s success with replacement resources. Final decisions about the replacement of these two Local Gas-Fired Plants will be based on additional reliability studies and engagement with the community. As part of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is also exploring converting the Carson Project (as defined herein) and the Procter & Gamble Project (as defined herein) to reliability use operations only and investigating the use of alternative fuels like Renewable Natural Gas-biomethane (RNG-biomanthene), hydrogen and other biofuels for the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, and the Consumers Power Plant (as defined herein). In addition, SMUD is investigating new technologies such as long duration energy storage, carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen and other clean fuel alternatives to help support.

the reduction of GHG emissions in SMUD’s energy supply. All final generator configurations are subject to reliability assessments.

The proven clean technologies focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for SMUD to procure approximately 1,100 to 1,500 MW of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (“PV”) generating capacity, 700 to 1,100 MW of local utility-scale battery storage, 300 to 500 MW of wind generating capacity, and 100 to 220 MW of geothermal generating capacity. The Zero Carbon Plan also estimates that customer installation of approximately 500 to 750 MW of behind-the-meter solar PV generating capacity and approximately 50 to 250 MW of behind-the-meter battery storage will assist SMUD with achieving the Zero Carbon Plan goals.

With respect to new technologies and business models, the Zero Carbon Plan focuses on evaluating, prioritizing and scaling the emerging technologies that SMUD expects will have the largest impact on reducing carbon in SMUD’s 2030 resource mix. SMUD is currently focused on various areas of technology and customer-focused programs, including electrification, demand flexibility, virtual power plants, vehicle-to-grid technology, and new grid-scale technologies. The Zero Carbon Plan forecasts that customer-owned devices and SMUD customer-focused programs will contribute between 360 and 1,300 MW of capacity to SMUD’s grid by 2030.

The financial impacts and options focus of the Zero Carbon Plan aims to keep SMUD rate increases at or below the rate of inflation while achieving SMUD’s goal of eliminating carbon emissions from its power supply by 2030. To pay for the expected costs of the Zero Carbon Plan and keep rate increases at or below the rate of inflation, the Zero Carbon Plan estimates the need for SMUD to realize between $50 million and $150 million of sustained annual savings. SMUD currently plans to achieve these sustained annual savings by exploring the implementation of operational savings and pursuing partnership and grant opportunities.

While the ultimate impacts of the Zero Carbon Plan on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy from clean technologies, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers, such impacts could be material.

Renewable Energy and Climate Change. The California Renewable Energy Resources Act, established by Senate Bill X1-2 (“SBX1-2”) and the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015, enacted by Senate Bill 350 (“SB 350”) require that SMUD meets 33% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2020 and 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2030. Senate Bill 100 (“SB 100”), passed by the legislature and approved by then-Governor Brown on September 10, 2018, accelerates the RPS targets and establishes a new 60% target by 2030. The bill also created a planning goal to meet all of the State’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Renewables Portfolio Standards” for a discussion of the State RPS requirements.

SMUD’s compliance with State RPS requirements is evaluated over 3- or 4-year compliance periods. SMUD met the State RPS requirements for the first compliance period (2011-2013) and second compliance period (2014-2016). The third compliance period (2017-2020) required SMUD to source one-third of its energy from renewable resources, and SMUD had sufficient RECs to meet the third compliance period requirements. SMUD filed its 2020 and third compliance period RPS compliance report with the CEC in the second quarter of 2021 and the CEC adopted SMUD’s third compliance period verification report in December 2023. SMUD expects the confirmation letter from the CEC indicating that SMUD was A-9

in full compliance with its third compliance period RPS obligations in the first quarter of 2024. As of the end of the third compliance period (2020), SMUD had approximately one million surplus RECs available to help meet future RPS targets. SMUD expects to file its 2023 RPS compliance report by July 1, 2024, showing that SMUD will have provided approximately 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources in 2023, which is greater than the interim 2023 RPS target of 41.25%. RPS compliance is determined by compliance period and not by individual years and SMUD anticipates having sufficient surplus procured and/or under contract resources in the fourth compliance period (2021-2024) to be in compliance with the RPS requirements. In addition to meeting RPS standards, SMUD serves an additional 7.4% of its customer load with renewable energy through its voluntary SolarShares and Greenergy pricing programs described above. SMUD estimates that it has sufficient renewable energy deliveries, new power supply contract commitments, new power supply commitments under active discussion, and RPS-eligible surplus carryover to meet its RPS requirements through 2025. Additional resources have been identified that are expected to provide sufficient RPS-eligible resources to cover most of SMUD’s RPS requirements through 2030. Future solicitations may be needed to fill any remaining gaps. The following chart illustrates SMUD’s current RPS requirements through 2030 and its existing and committed resources utilized to meet those requirements.

In addition to procuring new sources, meeting the RPS requirements will require replacement of certain existing renewable contracts which expire in future years. While SMUD anticipates it will meet much of its renewable resource requirements through purchased contracts with third parties, it continues to explore additional options, including wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal developments, partnering with other utilities on future projects, and local development options. SMUD’s resource forecast (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources”) accounts for future renewable resources as a component of “Uncommitted Purchases.” To meet SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan goals, SMUD anticipates meeting loads in 2030 with approximately 70-80% renewable resources, in addition to hydro and other new zero carbon technologies. See “– 2030 Zero Carbon Plan” above.

Given the intermittent nature of power from renewable resources such as wind and solar, SMUD is exploring and investing in options that provide the flexibility to manage the intermittency of such renewable resources. Potential options include energy storage resources, which SMUD has committed to as part of the Zero Carbon Plan, and expanding load management resources. Additionally, on April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its membership in BANC, a joint exercise of powers agency formed in 2009, and currently comprised of SMUD, the Modesto Irrigation District (“MID”), the City of Roseville (“Roseville”), the City of Redding (“Redding”), the City of Shasta Lake and the Trinity Public Utilities District, commenced participation in the California Independent System Operator Corporation (“CAISO”) western energy imbalance market (“WEIM”). Participation in the WEIM benefits SMUD by providing it with broader access to balancing resources within the region to help manage its expanding renewable portfolio. In addition, other entities within the BANC Balancing Authority Area began participation in the WEIM on March 25, 2021. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Operational Independence and Local Control” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

In 2022, SMUD’s Board formally adopted the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan as SMUD’s updated IRP. SMUD filed the approved IRP update with the CEC on September 14, 2022, pursuant to the CEC’s guidelines, which called for updating SMUD’s IRP filing within five years of SMUD’s previous filing of April 29, 2019. SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan built upon the April 2019 IRP and set a goal for zero carbon emissions by 2030. SMUD’s next formal IRP process is expected to be completed and filed with the CEC in 2027. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

The State’s carbon cap-and-trade market established pursuant to Assembly Bill 32 (“AB 32”) began in 2013. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Greenhouse Gas Emissions” for a discussion of AB 32 and the State’s cap-and-trade program. SMUD anticipates that allowances allocated to SMUD will nearly equal SMUD’s compliance obligations under normal water year conditions. Under low water year conditions, SMUD may need to purchase additional allowances to cover its compliance obligations, including carbon obligations related to wholesale energy sales from SMUD’s natural gas power plants. As SMUD implements its clean power goals, SMUD expects its need for these allowances to decline.

There is scientific consensus that increasing concentrations of GHG have caused and will continue to cause a rise in temperatures in the State and around the world. The change in the earth’s average atmospheric temperature, generally referred to as “climate change,” is, among other things, expected to result in a wide range of changes in climate patterns, including increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including droughts and heat waves, more frequent incidences of wildfires, changes in wind patterns, sea level rise and flooding, any of which alone or in combination could materially adversely affect SMUD’s financial results or operations. See also “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION” and “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY – Other Factors.” As described above, SMUD is actively working to meet its sustainable power supply goals.

reduce its own GHG emissions, and assist the local governments in the territory it serves with their desired GHG reductions. In 2016, SMUD introduced the Pilot Natural Refrigerant Incentive Program, its first customer program providing incentives for GHG reduction in addition to kWh savings. SMUD is a founding member and active participant in the Capital Region Climate Readiness Collaborative, a public-private partnership formed to better understand and plan for climate impacts expected in the region. SMUD is also an active member of the United States Department of Energy (the “DOE”) Partnership for Energy Sector Climate Resilience. SMUD regularly reviews scientific findings related to climate change and in 2016 published its Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan. In 2024, SMUD is planning to update the Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan along with other climate resiliency actions.

Energy Storage Systems. Assembly Bill 2514 (“AB 2514”) requires the Board to re-evaluate energy storage goals every three years. In compliance with AB 2514, the Board established a target of 9 MW of energy storage procurement by December 31, 2020, which SMUD has procured. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Energy Storage Systems” for further discussion of AB 2514. In September 2020, the Board directed that energy storage forecasts be implemented through SMUD’s IRP process going forward. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” above for a discussion of SMUD’s IRP. SMUD is also evaluating how to couple utility-scale solar with utility-scale storage to support future system reliability needs and enable energy goals.

Meeting Peak Load. A significant consideration for SMUD will be how it addresses its system peak load. SMUD has implemented programs and tools, such as advanced metering, energy efficiency options, and TOD rates for residential customers, to help customers manage their costs while helping SMUD reduce its peak load. Analysis of 2022 data showed a reduction of approximately 108 MW, weather continue to monitor the progress and results of the implementation of TOD rates and will use this information to inform future rate actions and load forecasts. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Time-of-Day Rates.”

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved an optional residential Critical Peak Pricing rate (the “Peak Pricing Rate”), which went into effect June 1, 2022. The Peak Pricing Rate is designed to reduce load by increasing the price of energy when the grid is most impacted, up to 50 hours per summer. In exchange, customers on the rate will receive a per kWh discount on summer Off-Peak and Mid-Peak rates. SMUD is also exploring the use of more distributed energy resources and demand response programs that could further reduce SMUD’s system peak.

Operational Independence and Local Control. A key component of SMUD’s business strategy is focused on maintaining its independence in operating and maintaining its resources. As such, SMUD has taken a number of actions to mitigate the potential impacts of various federal and state regulatory actions. For example, in 2002 SMUD established itself as an independent control area (now termed “Balancing Authority”) within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (“WECC”) region. By removing itself from CAISO’s Balancing Authority area, SMUD became responsible for balancing electric supply and demand within its own service territory. This move substantially reduced fees paid to CAISO, preserved operational flexibility and helped to insulate SMUD from the uncertain regulatory environment and tariff structure of CAISO. In addition to decreased financial risks, this independence also reduced SMUD’s exposure to the impacts of capacity and energy shortages in the CAISO Balancing Authority area. Further, as an independent Balancing Authority, SMUD continued to support the statewide electric grid in events of electrical emergencies requiring rotating outages, such as loss of major transmission lines or equipment, as provided in the statewide emergency plan. By 2006, the SMUD Balancing Authority footprint expanded north to the California-Oregon border and south to Modesto, to include the service areas of the WAPA, MID, Redding and Roseville, and TANC-owned 340-mile 500-kV California-Oregon Transmission Project.

(“COTP”). In October 2009, SMUD, with the coordination and cooperation of WAPA, joined the Western Power Pool Reserve Sharing Group, which supports reliability and reduces operating costs. In May 2011, BANC assumed the role of the Balancing Authority, though SMUD continues to oversee operation of the grid on behalf of BANC. BANC members share cost responsibility for balancing authority-related compliance obligations, liabilities, and operations. BANC also serves as an important venue for SMUD and other BANC members to collaborate with respect to operational and market improvements inside the BANC footprint and to preserve their operational independence. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.” On April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its participation in BANC, began operating in the CAISO WEIM, which helps SMUD better manage the integration of renewable energy resources. The CAISO WEIM is a voluntary market, which allows SMUD to maintain its operational independence from the CAISO, while providing SMUD greater access to balancing resources throughout the western region. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

Electricity, Natural Gas, and Related Hedging

SMUD continues to utilize a comprehensive and integrated power and fuel supply strategy to acquire a reliable and diversified portfolio of resources to meet existing and future needs. This strategy includes a combination of both physical supply and financial hedging transactions to reduce price risk exposure over a five-year horizon. SMUD’s physical supply arrangements include ownership of power generating resources, as well as a diversified portfolio of power and fuel supply purchase contracts that range in duration, with a mixture of fixed and variable pricing terms.

With regard to the power purchase contracts, SMUD has entered into a series of contracts for the purchase of electricity to meet its resource needs. SMUD also actively manages its exposure on variable rate electricity purchases, and at times may enter into financial contracts to fix prices by using options to reduce price risk, in each case when warranted by economic conditions. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements.”

With regard to fuel supply contracts, SMUD utilizes a similar strategy of employing financial contracts of various durations to hedge its variable rate fuel supply contracts. As of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply – Supply.”

As provided in SMUD’s natural gas contracts, SMUD may be required to post collateral to various counterparties. As of February 29, 2024, SMUD did not have any collateral posting obligations. A decrease in natural gas prices could result in a collateral posting by SMUD. While the posting of collateral is not an expense for SMUD, it does temporarily encumber unrestricted cash balances.

To hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a pass-through rate component called the Hydro Generation Adjustment (the “IGA”), and established a Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund (the “HRSF”). Similarly, to hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a HGA and established a WAPA Rate Stabilization Fund (“WRSF”). These rate stabilization funds and rate pass through mechanisms help to offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs in years where precipitation levels at SMUD-owned and non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities are low. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

![Managing Risks](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Managing+Risks)

**Managing Risks**  
SMUD maintains an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program, a strategic approach to managing enterprise-wide risks as a portfolio, to help reduce the chance of loss, create greater financial stability and protect SMUD resources. It is designed to maintain an early warning system to monitor changes in, and the emergence of, risks that affect the organization’s business objectives. Under the purview of the Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee, composed of executive members and chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, ERM conducts ongoing risk identification, assessments, monitoring, mitigation, risk-based budgeting and reporting. To ensure accountability and oversight, each identified risk is assigned to an executive-level risk owner. Risk status and mitigation efforts are reported monthly to the Board.

**Competitive Challenges**  
In the coming decade, utilities like SMUD may face competition from companies in other industries looking to diversify into the energy sector. Examples of developing competitive areas include retail sale of electricity, distributed electric storage resources, renewable distributed generation (mostly solar in Sacramento), customer installation of fuel cells, third-party electric vehicle charging, home or business automation that enables greater customer participation in energy markets, and third-party provision of energy management software and solutions.

SMUD has a wide range of initiatives to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions and new industry participants. Key areas of focus include:

- **Enhancing customer experience.** Recognizing the importance of meeting customer expectations, SMUD introduced the Customer Experience Strategy in 2016 to provide customers “value for what they pay” and further strengthen customer loyalty. The initiative is focused on ensuring SMUD has the people, systems, technology, programs and services to consistently meet or exceed customers’ changing expectations. The customer experience is measured via surveys with the goal of achieving 80% of customers agreeing that SMUD provides them with value for what they pay by 2030.

- **Restructuring electric rates.** In 2017, the Board approved TOD rates as the standard rate for residential customers. The residential rate transition began in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the full transition was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. All of SMUD’s business customers are also on time-based rates. In 2019, the Board approved a restructuring of commercial rates to collect a greater portion of fixed costs through fixed charges and to better align time periods and prices with energy markets. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges” and “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

- **Ongoing integrated resource planning.** SMUD monitors and updates its integrated resource planning to ensure future sources of energy balance cost, reliability and environmental requirements with the flexibility to meet challenges of changing market and regulatory conditions, customer energy resources, and emerging technologies.

**Leveraging Core Competencies**  
In addition to these initiatives, SMUD is leveraging core competencies to improve industry safety and help communities serve their customers’ energy needs.

![Sacramento Power Academy](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**Sacramento Power Academy.** The Sacramento Power Academy is SMUD’s operational training center providing training support for all of SMUD’s skilled trades professionals. Operating on a 10-acre training facility the academy oversees SMUD’s 14 skilled trades apprenticeships. The academy’s experienced training professionals serve as liaisons and mentors to apprentices progressing through on-the-job training, program testing, night schooling, and extensive training components. The academy also ensures SMUD’s skilled trades professionals are safe and compliant by coordinating and delivering annual regulatory and safety training. The academy is also a workforce development hub utilized by SMUD to increase awareness of and interest in skilled trades careers at SMUD, in SMUD’s community, and in the utility industry.

**Community Energy Services.** In 2002, Assembly Bill 117 was passed to establish Community Choice Aggregation in the State by authorizing Community Choice Aggregators (“CCAs”) to aggregate customer electric load and purchase electricity for customers. SMUD’s Community Energy Services department was established in 2017 to support organizations with values closely aligned with SMUD’s values, while also generating additional revenue for SMUD. CCA programs are proliferating in the State thanks to support for expanding renewable energy use and desire for local control particularly for electricity procurement. There are numerous CCAs operating in the State, and more are anticipated to launch in the future. CCAs are responsible for procuring wholesale power, setting the generation rate, and staffing a call center to handle opt-outs and questions about the power portfolio. The local investor-owned utility (“IOU”) continues to deliver electricity from the electric grid, maintain its electric infrastructure, bill customers and collect payments.

In October 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Valley Clean Energy (“VCE”) to provide technical, energy and support services, including data management and call center services, wholesale energy services, and business operations support, to VCE for a term set to end in 2023. SMUD and VCE recently executed a new contract for data management, contact center, consulting and debt collection services that expires on December 31, 2028. VCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the City of Woodland, the City of Davis and Yolo County to implement a local CCA program. The service territory expanded to include the City of Winters in 2021. The mission of VCE is to deliver cost-competitive clean electricity, product choice, price stability, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions reductions to its customers in Yolo County. VCE began electric services to its customers in the summer of 2018, giving Yolo County residents a choice between two electricity providers, VCE and PG&E.

In November 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of East Bay Community Energy (“EBCE”) to provide call center and data management services for a three-year term beginning in January 2018. SMUD signed a new contract with EBCE in January 2022 for call center and data management services for an additional three-year term. EBCE recently changed its name to Ava Community Energy (“Ava”). Ava is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Oakland, Piedmont, San Leandro and Union City in Alameda County to implement a local CCA program. Ava expanded its territory to the cities of Pleasanton, Newark, and Tracy in April 2021.

In June 2019, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Silicon Valley Clean Energy (“SVCE”) to provide program services to help local SVCE communities reduce carbon pollution while delivering engaging customer experiences. SVCE programs are focused on grid integration, as well as electrifying transportation, buildings and homes. This contract was extended through September of 2024. In June 2023, SMUD was selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s concierge service vendor for three years. In December 2023, SMUD was again selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s programs administrator for five years. SVCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Campbell, Cupertino, Gilroy, Lost Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos, Milpitas, Monte Sereno, Morgan Hill,

Mountain View, Saratoga, Sunnyvale and Unincorporated Santa Clara County to implement a local CCA program.

In July 2022, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Marin Clean Energy (“MCE”) to provide data management, billing, data analytic and system assessment services to MCE. MCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2010 and represents 37 member communities across four Bay Area counties: Contra Costa, Marin, Napa and Solano.

In September 2022, SMUD was selected through a competitive process by the governing board of Sonoma Clean Power (“SCP”) to provide market research services to SCP. In January of 2023, SMUD was selected to provide strategic consulting services, providing recommendations related to programs and marketing. SCP is a joint powers agency that serves Sonoma and Mendocino counties.

While CCAs have had success in the State, they are susceptible to business, regulatory and other risks that could lead to a financial loss and/or result in a cessation of operations for the CCA. These risks could extend to a CCA’s counterparties, including SMUD. SMUD has made an effort to identify and mitigate potential counterparty risks to the extent possible in service agreements with the CCAs described above. SMUD may pursue opportunities to provide similar services to additional CCAs in the future. SMUD management does not expect its current arrangements to have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

## FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION

### Precipitation Variability

SMUD uses a precipitation measuring station located at Fresh Pond, California to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s Upper American River Project (the “UARP”) hydropower reservoir. As of January 31, 2024, precipitation at Fresh Pond, California totaled 21 inches for the October-September hydropower water supply period. This is 75% of the 50-year rolling median of 28 inches. Total reservoir storage in the UARP hydropower reservoirs was 238 thousand acre-feet as of January 31, 2024, which was about 63% of capacity and approximately 6% above the historical average. SMUD manages its reservoirs to maximize water storage going into the summer season, which preserves generating capacity during SMUD’s high load months and ensures that SMUD meets its UARP FERC license requirements, including requirements for recreational and environmental flows.

There can be wide swings in precipitation from year to year. In years with below average rainfall, SMUD may have to generate or purchase replacement energy at additional cost. To hedge against variations in the volume of energy received from SMUD-owned UARP hydroelectric resources, SMUD uses the HRSF to help offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

SMUD is also exposed to precipitation variability through its contract with the WAPA. In an average water year this contract provides roughly 661 gigawatt hours (“GWh”) of power. WAPA’s actual deliveries are based on hydroelectric generation (minus energy used for pumping) at Central Valley Project reservoirs in Northern California, which varies based on annual precipitation patterns, water deliveries for agriculture, and flow requirements in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Unlike the UARP, SMUD does not monitor precipitation stations to approximate power deliveries under the WAPA contract, and instead relies on a forecast of power deliveries from WAPA. As of January 31, 2024, WAPA has forecasted power deliveries of 703 GWh for 2024, approximately 6% more than an average water year. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration.”

# Wildfires

## General
Wildfires in the State have become increasingly common and destructive. Frequent drought conditions and unseasonably warm temperatures have increased, and could further increase, the possibility of wildfires occurring in areas where SMUD maintains generation, transmission and distribution facilities. The number of diseased and dead trees has increased, and could further increase, this possibility. As a result, SMUD faces an increased risk that it may be required to pay for wildfire related property damage or
<!-- Page 177 -->
![Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory)](https://example.com/image.png)

**Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory).** In 2018, the CPUC approved a new statewide fire map that identifies areas of elevated and extreme wildfire risk from utility-associated assets located throughout the State. SMUD directly participated in the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map. In connection with the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map, a peer review and a team of independent nationwide experts led by Cal Fire affirmed that SMUD’s electric service area is properly located outside of these elevated (“Tier 2”) and extreme (“Tier 3”) high fire threat areas; however, SMUD’s UARP facilities are located within both Tier 2 and Tier 3 areas. According to the CPUC, Tier 2 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an elevated wildfire risk from utility assets and Tier 3 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an extreme risk from utility assets. As of June 8, 2021, approximately 37 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 19 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. SMUD is also a member of TANC. As of July 2022, approximately 116.3 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 4.5 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. In accordance with its FERC license, SMUD adheres to a FERC-approved Fire Prevention and Response Plan for its UARP facilities. On May 17, 2018, in accordance with State law, SMUD’s Board of Directors determined that the UARP area may have a “significant risk of catastrophic wildfire” resulting from overhead electric facilities and that SMUD’s FERC-approved UARP Fire Prevention and Response Plan meets requirements for presenting wildfire mitigation measures to the Board for its approval.

**Wildfire Mitigation.** In response to potential wildfire risk, SMUD has implemented and is continuing to implement a series of measures intended to prevent wildfires from occurring, minimize the spread of any fire that does occur and improve the resiliency of its system. These measures include an increase in the number of inspections for fuel reduction inside and adjacent to rights-of-ways, utilization of Cal Fire-approved operational material to reduce the risk of sparking; enhanced inspection and maintenance programs; increased use of ignition reduction techniques, including undergrounding of conductors; increased monitoring of identified responses to fire conditions, including operational procedures for the de-energization of lines during high fire conditions; and elimination of automatic reclosing on SMUD’s transmission lines and on SMUD’s distribution lines in certain areas during fire season.

SMUD’s proactive approach to vegetation management has been expanded to include the use of advanced technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (“LiDAR”), ortho and oblique imagery that is used to pinpoint tree health and/or condition that may not yet be visible to the naked eye. In addition, SMUD has installed additional weather stations in transmission corridors and substations for increased situational awareness and has continued coordination and collaboration with local agencies and first responders as well as vulnerable populations.

State legislation enacted in 2018 and 2019 (SB 901 and AB 1054, respectively) requires publicly owned utilities (“POUs”) to prepare and present Wildfire Mitigation Plans to their governing boards by January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter. SB 901 requires POUs, including SMUD, before January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter, to prepare a wildfire mitigation plan and present it in a public meeting to their governing board. SB 901 requires POU’s to accept comments on the wildfire mitigation plan from the public, other local and State agencies, and interested parties, and to verify that the plan complies with all applicable rules, regulations, and standards, as appropriate. The bill requires a qualified independent evaluator to review and assess the comprehensiveness of its wildfire mitigation plan and present its report to the board in a public meeting. AB 1054 created a new Wildfire Safety Division within the CPUC to prioritize wildfire safety throughout the State, and established an appointed Wildfire Safety Advisory Board (“WSAB”) to advise and make recommendations relating to wildfire safety to this new Division. For POUs, the bill requires submittal of annual wildfire mitigation plans to the WSAB for review and advisory opinions relating to the content and sufficiency of the plans.

<!-- Page 178 -->
SMUD assembled an enterprise-wide team of subject-matter experts to prepare its plan in compliance with this legislation. SMUD’s initial Wildfire Mitigation Plan (“WMP”) was adopted by the Board in the fourth quarter of 2019, after circulation for public comment and review of the comprehensiveness of the plan by a qualified independent evaluator. The WMP and evaluator’s report were submitted to the WSAB in 2020.

SMUD reviews its WMP each year, presenting the updated plan to the Board for adoption at duly noticed public meetings. The updated plans and evaluator reports are submitted to the WSAB for advisory opinion and recommendations. SMUD responds to the WSAB’s comments regarding SMUD’s WMP as part of its WMP process. SMUD will continue to annually review and update its WMP, conducting a comprehensive review at least every third year.

SMUD recently completed a comprehensive review and update of its WMP after soliciting public input and independent evaluation. The 2023-2025 WMP was adopted by the Board on June 15, 2023, and duly submitted to the WSAB.

**Wildfire Insurance.** Wildfires both in California and nationally have not only increased potential liability for utilities, but have also adversely impacted the insurance markets, leading to higher costs for coverage; coverages becoming prohibitively expensive; limited or restricted coverage to certain types of risks; or coverage at insufficient levels. SMUD most recently renewed its general and wildfire liability insurance coverage on June 15, 2023, increasing the coverage limit by $25 million to $275 million. SMUD increased the commercially insured portion of its wildfire coverage program from $176 million to $212.5 million and maintained the self-insured layers and quota share portions of the coverage at $6.5 million.

In addition, it is expected that SMUD will have a portion of the $500 million aggregate limit amount of its commercial paper and line of credit program to provide operational flexibility in the event of the occurrence of a wildfire or other operational event. However, SMUD has not covenanted to maintain the availability of the commercial paper program and line of credit program for these purposes and no assurances can be given that the commercial paper and line of credit program will be available at the time of, or during, such an event.

**August 2020 Heat Wave**

The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from August 14, 2020 through August 18, 2020. The CAISO was forced to institute rotating electricity outages in the State during this extreme heat wave. SMUD, as a member of BANC, and being outside of the CAISO did not have to implement any planned power disruptions. Additionally, SMUD was able to support the CAISO during some hours of the heat wave with both requested emergency assistance and wholesale market sales. SMUD’s peak demand between August 14, 2020 and August 18, 2020, varied between 2,874 MW and 3,057 MW, well below SMUD’s record peak of 3,299 MW.

**September 2022 Heat Wave**

The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from September 5, 2022 through September 8, 2022. On September 6, 2022, SMUD experienced its second highest peak demand of 3,263 MW. SMUD did not have to implement any planned power disruptions.

**Storm Damage**

In January 2023, SMUD experienced a series of winter storms that brought heavy rains and high winds causing damage to SMUD’s grid and widespread outages for SMUD’s customers. By the time the  
A-19

**storm response was complete, SMUD had experienced the largest mobilization of personnel and restoration crews in its history. SMUD incurred costs related to removing downed trees, restoring power from downed poles and broken lines, replenishing inventory, communicating with and providing assistance to customers, maintaining IT systems, and coordinating with local emergency agencies. SMUD is pursuing claims with Federal and State agencies to attempt to recover certain of SMUD’s costs related to the storms. The material financial impacts have been reflected in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, [which are included in APPENDIX B].**

**Cosumnes Power Plant Outage**

On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant (as defined herein) was shut down due to a ground fault in the Steam Turbine Generator (“STG”) stator. The ground fault was caused by delamination of the insulation on one of the through bolts. Damage from the ground fault resulted in a full rewind and restack of the stator core, replacement of all stator through bolts, and a full rewind of turbine rotor. The Cosumnes Power Plant repairs were completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. During the extended outage, SMUD shifted generation to the other local gas-fired plants and the Sutter Energy Center and procured additional energy and resource adequacy capacity. SMUD also requested and received approval from the California Air Quality Board and California Energy Commission to operate one or both of the gas turbines without the STG. During the September 2022 heatwave, both of the gas turbines at the Cosumnes Power Plant were operated without the STG, providing 270 MW at peak.

To mitigate the financial impact of unplanned outages from its thermal assets, SMUD carries commercial property insurance with a business interruption endorsement. At the time of the loss, the coverage provided up to $30.8 million of business interruption recovery per month at the Cosumnes Power Plant, with a sub-limit of $310 million over any 18-month period. During the period of loss, claims were subject to a $5 million equipment damage deductible and a 60-day business interruption claims waiting period.

SMUD has settled the equipment damage portion of the loss for $18.6 million, resulting in a $13.6 million recovery. The business interruption portion of the claim remains in process, with SMUD receiving a $50 million advance in December of 2022. As of January 2024, the carriers have confirmed an additional $51 million in undisputed recovery, which is anticipated to be received in the first quarter of 2024. Thus far, SMUD has recovered $114.6 million of the loss and will continue to work toward full settlement of the disputed portion of the claim, which is approximately $68 million.

**Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic**

While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD has lessened since the height of the pandemic in 2020, SMUD is still experiencing impacts from the pandemic. However, compared to weather adjusted load levels, SMUD’s overall load is near or above pre-pandemic levels.

Part of the governmental response to the economic consequences of the pandemic required utility providers (including SMUD) to provide additional grace periods and flexible payment plans for the payment of utility bills or to refrain from pursuing collection remedies for unpaid bills for a period of time. SMUD also implemented a no-shutoff policy through January 2022 under which SMUD did not disconnect power to a customer for non-payment of their electric bill. Beginning in February 2022, SMUD resumed its normal payment, late fee, and disconnection process and began disconnections of unpaid accounts in late April 2022. As a result, SMUD has experienced an increase in delinquencies for customer electric accounts versus pre-pandemic levels. In December 2021, SMUD received $41 million from the California Arrearage Payment Program (“CAPP”) initial funding, and an additional $9.9 million in 2022. All funds were applied to delinquent balances. As of December 31, 2023, the total delinquencies for customer electric

**A-20**
<!-- Page 180 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

accounts were $38.2 million, after the CAPP credit, which is an increase from the February 2020 balance of total delinquencies for customer electric accounts of $16.9 million. The financial impacts stemming from delinquent accounts have been accounted for in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the preceding years. Any successful recovery of delinquent accounts will contribute to an increase in net income.

SMUD also paused the recertification process for existing customers in SMUD’s low-income discount program during the pandemic. The number of customers participating in the low-income assistance program increased by 16,407, or approximately 22% from February 2020 to December 2023. SMUD has resumed the recertification process for existing customers in the low-income discount program in 2023.

While the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD have lessened, if the pandemic and its consequences again become more severe or another similar event occurs, the impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations could be material.

## RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE

### Rates and Charges

SMUD’s Board of Directors has autonomous authority to establish the rates charged for all SMUD services. Unlike IOUs and some other municipal utility systems, retail rate and revenue levels are not subject to review or regulation by any other federal, State or local governmental agencies. Changes to SMUD rates only require formal action by the Board of Directors after two public workshops and a public hearing. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government. SMUD typically reviews and sets rates on a two-year cycle.

### 2019 Rate Action.

On June 24, 2019, the Board approved a 3.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2020, a 3.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2020, a 2.50% rate increase effective January 1, 2021, and a 2.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2021, for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved a restructuring of the commercial rates, including new time periods and an overall increase in the fixed bill components, such as the System Infrastructure Fixed Charge and demand charges, and a corresponding decrease in energy charges, making the restructuring revenue neutral by rate category. To minimize bill impacts, rate categories will be restructured over an eight-year period.

### 2021 Rate Action.

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved a 1.5% rate increase effective March 1, 2022 and a 2.0% rate increase effective January 1, 2023 for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved the Solar and Storage Rate, the optional residential Peak Pricing Rate, and updates to certain schedules of SMUD’s Open Access Transmission Tariff (“OATT”). The Board also approved a new timeline for the commercial rate restructure transition, and all impacted commercial customers were transitioned to the new rates by the end of the first quarter of 2022.

SMUD also implemented a solar interconnection fee based on the size of solar interconnection and supporting programs such as battery incentives, incentives to enroll in SMUD’s Peak Pricing Rate, battery incentives for Virtual Power Plants, and a program to bring the benefits of solar to under-resourced multi-family communities. These programs and fees are not subject to Board approval.

![2023 Rate Action](https://example.com/image.png)

**2023 Rate Action**

On September 21, 2023, the Board approved a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2025, and a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2025 for all customer classes. The Board also approved establishing the Energy Assistance Program Rate (“EAPR”) Rate Stabilization Fund, which will provide an additional discount to those low-income customers with the greatest need. The discount will be funded with discretionary, non-retail rate revenue, as to not have an impact on any future required rate changes. There is currently pending litigation concerning the adoption of the 2023 rates. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”

**Rate Stabilization Funds**

The Rate Stabilization Fund (“RSF”) is maintained by SMUD to reduce the need for future rate increases when costs exceed existing rates. At the direction of the Board, amounts may be either transferred into the RSF (which reduces revenues) or transferred out of the RSF (which increases revenues). The Board authorizes RSF transfers on an event driven basis. The RSF includes funds to hedge variations in the volume of energy received from WAPA hydroelectric generation, variation in AB 32 revenue and variations in Low Carbon Fuel Credit (“LCFS”) revenue. As of December 31, 2023, the balance in the RSF was $115.8 million, which is approximately 7.2% of annual retail revenue.

Effective July 2008, SMUD implemented the HGA, which is a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from the UARP (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric”). The HGA is designed to increase the deposits to the HRSF in wet years when SMUD has more hydroelectric generation than expected. Each year SMUD determines the impact of precipitation variances on projected hydroelectric generation from the UARP. When the precipitation variance results in a deficiency of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, transfers from the HRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is zero. When the precipitation variance results in a projected surplus of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, deposits will be made into the HRSF in an amount approximating the positive impact to SMUD from the surplus hydroelectric generation (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is not sufficient to cover transfers that would otherwise be made in the event of a projected deficiency in UARP hydroelectric generation, a 12-month HGA surcharge will automatically be included on customers’ electric bills at a level that generates up to 4% of retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue on any precipitation variance calculation date and the precipitation variance results in a projected UARP hydroelectric generation surplus, the positive impact of the surplus may be used for other purposes at staff’s recommendation, with the approval of the Board, including returned to customers through an electric bill discount up to 4% of retail revenue. SMUD calculates HRSF transfers based on an April-March (water year) precipitation period at Fresh Pond, California. This precipitation station is used to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s UARP hydropower reservoirs. As of January 31, 2024, and based on the current HRSF water year precipitation forecast, SMUD anticipates transferring $20.8 million out of the HRSF in April 2024.

In September 2023, SMUD added a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from WAPA. Each year SMUD determines the WAPA Energy Delivery Variance (“EDV”) based on forecasted energy delivery minus the actual energy delivery. When the EDV variance is positive, transfers from the WRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 2% of cash).

**Low Income Discount**

As of December 2023, approximately 91,407 customers received the low-income discount offered by SMUD, which represents approximately 16% of all residential customers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, SMUD suspended recertification during the pandemic. In 2023, the total discount was approximately $32.7 million. As a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn, SMUD experienced an increase in low-income discount applicants. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

While the low-income discount has provided substantial benefits to low-income customer bills for years, multiple economic variables, such as inflation and rate increases, have had disproportionately negative impacts on low-income customers, particularly those in the 0-50% Federal Poverty Level (“FPL”). In 2023, SMUD established an EAPR Rate Stabilization Fund (“ERSF”) to provide an additional discount to the electricity usage charge up to an established maximum discount (“ERSF Additional Discount”) for customers in the 0-50% FPL. The ERSF is funded by discretionary non-retail rate revenue, reviewed on an annual basis, and the specific monthly ERSF Additional Discount is set before the year the value is in effect. SMUD expanded its programs and services starting in 2016 to help customers with energy assistance, home improvement packages, and education. SMUD is creating tailored solutions to best meet the needs of low-income customers. These solutions include free solar panels and inspecting homes to identify energy saving and fuel switching opportunities. As of December 2023, SMUD has performed 30,000 energy retrofits and, in partnership with Grid Alternatives (a non-profit organization that focuses on implementing solar power and energy efficiency for low-income families), 230 customers have benefited from free solar installations. Forty-eight additional homes received solar and energy efficiency through a partnership with Habitat for Humanity of Greater Sacramento. As part of SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan and the focus on building electrification, SMUD has also been ramping up electrification investments for low-income customers. Additionally, since 2019, SMUD has assisted more than 2,600 households with electrification upgrades. Furthermore, SMUD has installed nearly 450 electric vehicle chargers and more than 400 electric vehicle circuits in low-income households or areas that serve low-income customers.

# Customer Base; Largest Customers

A stabilizing influence on SMUD’s revenues is that a substantial proportion is derived from residential customers (49.2% in 2023). Historically, revenue from commercial and industrial consumption has been more sensitive to economic fluctuation. Furthermore, SMUD has no dominant customers that account for a significant percentage of annual revenues. In 2023, no single customer contributed more than 3% of revenues. The top ten customers generated approximately 9% of revenues and the top 30 generated approximately 15% of revenues. The following table presents information on SMUD’s top ten customers as of December 31, 2023.

# Power Generation Facilities

## Hydroelectric
The UARP consists of three relatively large storage reservoirs (Union Valley, Loon Lake and Ice House) with an aggregate water storage capacity of approximately 400,000 acre-feet and eight small reservoirs. Project facilities also include eight tunnels with a combined length of over 26 miles and eight powerhouses containing 11 turbines. In addition to providing clean hydroelectric power and operating flexibility for SMUD, the UARP area provides habitat for fish and wildlife and a variety of recreational opportunities, including camping, fishing, boating, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking and cross-country skiing.

The combined capacity of the UARP is approximately 685 MW at SMUD’s load center in Sacramento. Under current licensing and mean water conditions, these facilities are expected to generate approximately 1,600 GWh of electric energy annually, which represents approximately 15% of SMUD’s current average annual retail energy requirements. In 1957, the Federal Power Commission (predecessor agency to FERC) issued a license to SMUD for the UARP. This 50-year license was subsequently amended to add and upgrade facilities and now includes all segments of SMUD’s hydroelectric facilities located on the South Fork of the American River and its tributaries upstream from the Chili Bar Project (described below). On July 23, 2014, FERC issued to SMUD a new 50-year license for the UARP.

On November 9, 2016 FERC issued an Order authorizing SMUD to construct the South Fork Powerhouse downstream of the UARP’s Slab Creek Dam. Construction was substantially completed in the fall of 2020, and the new powerhouse was placed into operation on October 25, 2022, adding 1.8 MW of generation to the UARP’s overall capacity.

On June 16, 2021, pursuant to Board authorization, SMUD approved the Chili Bar Hydroelectric Project which consists of a 7 MW powerhouse, reservoir, dam and spillway, north of Placerville on the South Fork of the American River for approximately $10.4 million (the “Chili Bar Project”). The Chili Bar Project is immediately downstream from the UARP and operates as the regulating reservoir for the UARP’s largest powerhouse. Owning the UARP and the Chili Bar Project enables SMUD to operate the two projects with a holistic approach to license compliance and generation efficiency.

## Solano 2 Wind Project
SMUD owns and operates an 87 MW wind project, located in Solano County, known as Solano 2. Solano 2 consists of 29 wind turbine generators (“WTGs”) rated at 3.0 MW. Energy from the project is collected at 21 kV and transmitted over a dedicated 3-mile overhead system to the SMUD-owned Russell substation. At the Russell facility, the energy is transformed to 230 kV and interconnected to PG&E’s Birds Landing Switching Station. Energy deliveries are scheduled through the CAISO.

## Solano 3 Project
In 2011 and 2012, SMUD constructed a 128 MW wind project adjacent to Solano Phase 2, known as Solano 3. The Solano 3 project consists of 31 WTGs rated at 1.8 MW and 24 WTGs rated at 3.0 MW. The project interconnects through a 34.5 kV underground collection system to the Russell substation. Like the Solano Phase 2 project, this energy is transformed to 230 kV and delivered through the CAISO.

## Solano 4 Project
SMUD has developed the Solano 4 Wind Project on land with a wind easement owned by SMUD near the Solano 3 project, known as the Collinsville and Roberts properties, to install 10 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW, and to remove the Solano 1 turbines and replace them with 9 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW. SMUD has met all of the CAISO requirements and has executed a Large Generator Interconnection Agreement (“GLIA”) as of June 2021 that will allow for 90.8 MW of capacity at the point of interconnection. In April 2021, SMUD submitted an application for advisory review by the Solano County Airport Land Use Commission (the “Solano ALUC”) of the Solano 4 Wind Project’s consistency.

with the 2015 Travis Air Force Base Land Use Compatibility Plan (the “Travis Plan”). In May 2021, the Solano ALUC purported to resolve that the Solano 4 Wind Project was inconsistent with the Travis Plan. In August 2021, the Board approved the Project Environmental Impact Report, made findings overriding the Solano ALUC’s finding of inconsistency, made findings there was no alternative to the project, and approved the Solano 4 Wind Project. In September 2021, Solano County filed a writ petition challenging SMUD’s approval of the Solano 4 Wind Project based on procedural, environmental, zoning and land use grounds. The parties entered into a settlement agreement on December 14, 2022, and the suit was dismissed on January 10, 2023. The settlement agreement allows for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project as planned.

In addition, SMUD applied for and obtained extensions of the Federal Aviation Administration Determinations of No Hazard allowing for construction of the turbines. A contract for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project was awarded to Vestas Corporation and the Solano 4 Wind Project is currently under construction. The expected operation date for the Solano 4 Wind Project is May 2024. PG&E identified upgrades needed to interconnect the Solano 4 Wind Project that will not be complete before the expected Solano 4 commercial operation date. PG&E has an approved project and expects to complete the needed upgrades by May of 2025. Realization of the full capacity of the Solano 4 Wind Project may be delayed into the second quarter of 2025 due to the timeframe established for the PG&E required transmission upgrades. SMUD has developed a mitigation plan for the limited interconnection capacity for the first year of operation, in coordination with CAISO and PG&E, of using all of the existing SMUD Solano Russell substation interconnection capacity combined for the dispatch of all the Solano Wind Project. SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process, which combines all phases of the Solano 4 Wind Project so it may operate as one project. This was fully executed by SMUD, CAISO, and PG&E on February 27, 2023.

As of the end of 2023, all of the turbine site delivery roads and foundations for the Solano 4 Project have been completed, all of the turbine components have been delivered to the Solano 4 Project site and 10 of the Solano 4 Project turbines have been fully erected.

At the completion of the Solano 4 project, SMUD will have an installed wind capacity of 303 MW in connection with the overall Solano Wind Project, leaving 18 MW at the point of interconnection for future development.

**Distributed Solar Photovoltaic.** SMUD owns and operates approximately 2 MW of solar photovoltaic generating facilities. These facilities include installations at the Hedge Substation property, SMUD Headquarters, the East Campus Operations Center, and other smaller photovoltaic systems throughout the service area on parking lots.

**Hedge Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 4 MW, 8 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached commercial operation in January 2023.

**ESS Flow Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 0.45 MW, 3 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached test operation in September 2023, and commercial operation is planned for March 2024.

**Local Gas-Fired Plants.** SMUD constructed five local natural gas-fired plants in its service area: the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, the Campbell Soup Project, McClellan and the Cosumnes Power Plant (each defined below). These five plants are referred to collectively as the “Local Gas-Fired Plants.” These plants are a strategic component of SMUD’s resource mix. In addition to providing SMUD a total capacity of approximately 1,139 MW, the Local Gas-Fired Plants provide SMUD with needed

**A-31**

**Local Gas-Fired Plants Overview**

SMUD has entered into long-term agreements with SFA providing for the purchase by SMUD of all of the power from each of the Local Gas-Fired Plants on a take-or-pay basis. This consolidation created operational and administrative efficiencies without changing any of the functionality of the power plants. Although the Local Gas-Fired Plants are owned by SFA, SMUD has exclusive control of their dispatch and manages their operations as part of its overall power supply strategy.

Payments under the power purchase agreements are payable from the revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of the principal of or interest on SMUD’s Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the caption “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below), as are other maintenance and operation costs and energy payments. For further discussion of SMUD’s obligations to make these payments to SFA, see “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Joint Powers Authorities.”

**Description of the Five Local Gas-Fired Plants:**

1. **The Cosumnes Power Plant (the “Cosumnes Power Plant”)**  
   The Cosumnes Power Plant is a 612 MW natural gas-fired, combined cycle plant located in the southern portion of Sacramento County adjacent to SMUD’s decommissioned Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant. Commercial operation of the Cosumnes Power Plant commenced on February 24, 2005. SFA increased the net generating capacity of the facility by 81 MWs via an Advanced Gas Path (“AGP”) upgrade. The additional AGP generation was realized after hardware and software upgrades were completed. The Cosumnes Power Plant is owned by SFA, a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and MID. The existing take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA expires no earlier than when the related bonds have been paid in full (the outstanding related bonds are scheduled to mature on July 1, 2030). On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant was shut down due to a ground fault in the STG stator. The repair was completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Cosumnes Power Plant Outage”.

2. **The Carson Cogeneration Project (the “Carson Project”)**  
   The Carson Project, a 103 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project consisting of separate cycle and peaking plants, provides steam to the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) wastewater treatment plant adjacent to the site. The Carson Project was originally owned by the Central Valley Financing Authority (“CVFA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and the SRCSD. Construction of the Carson Project was completed and the plant began commercial operation on October 11, 1995. The CVFA bonds issued to finance the Carson Project were defeased in September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Carson Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

3. **The Procter & Gamble Cogeneration Project (the “Procter & Gamble Project”)**  
   The Procter & Gamble Project, a 182 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, is located in an established industrial area of Sacramento. The initial combined cycle portion of the plant began commercial operation on March 1, 1997. Construction of the peaking plant portion of the Procter & Gamble Project commenced during 2000 and the unit achieved commercial status on April 24, 2001. The Procter & Gamble Project produces steam for use in Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Company’s oleochemical manufacturing processes and electricity for sale to SMUD. The Procter & Gamble Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Cogeneration Authority (“SCA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA, a separate joint powers authority. The SCA bonds issued to finance the Procter & Gamble Project were defeased in
<!-- Page 191 -->

September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Procter & Gamble Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Procter & Gamble Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

**The Campbell Soup Cogeneration Project (the “Campbell Soup Project”).** The Campbell Soup Project, a 170 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project, was completed and began commercial operations on December 4, 1997. Upgrades were implemented during 2000, which increased the plant’s peaking capacity to 180 MW, well above its net demonstrated capacity of 159.8 MW. The plant is located in south Sacramento adjacent to the Capital Commerce Center (formerly the Campbell Soup Company food processing facility). The Campbell Soup Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Power Authority (“SPA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA. The SPA bonds issued to finance the Campbell Soup Project were redeemed in July 2015. In late 2021, ownership of the Campbell Soup Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Campbell Soup Project (the “Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA”) covers both the Campbell Soup Project and McClellan and will be in effect until terminated by SMUD. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing the Campbell Soup Project in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

**The McClellan Gas Turbine (“McClellan”).** McClellan is a 72 MW natural gas-fired simple cycle combustion turbine generating plant at McClellan Business Park in Sacramento. This turbine is connected to SMUD’s electric system and is operated to meet SMUD’s peak-load requirements. McClellan is aligned for remote starting and operation with black start and fast start capabilities. SMUD constructed the McClellan unit in 1986 as a 50 MW emergency power source for the McClellan Air Force Base. In 2001, following the closure of the Air Force base, McClellan was repurposed for SMUD’s use. In May 2007, SMUD transferred ownership of McClellan to SPA for more efficient operation. SPA did not issue debt related to McClellan. In late 2021, ownership of McClellan was transferred to SFA. SFA pays all costs of operations and maintenance through to SMUD in accordance with the terms of the Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA. In exchange for paying all costs related to McClellan, SMUD receives all of the power generated thereby on a take-or-pay basis. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing McClellan in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

**Fuel Supply**

**General.** SMUD is obligated to arrange for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Management of the natural gas procurement and delivery process is a key focus of SMUD’s reliability and risk policies. Although the natural gas consumption of the power plants for SMUD’s load can vary significantly depending on the season, precipitation, and the market price of power and natural gas, the plants are forecasted to need, on average in 2024, a total of approximately 91,000 Decatherms per day (“Dth/day”) with a daily peak slightly more than 171,000 Dth/day of natural gas. SMUD has implemented a comprehensive strategy to secure a reliable and diversified fuel supply through a variety of agreements for the supply, transportation, and storage of natural gas.

**Supply.** SMUD hedges a significant portion of its expected gas needs to meet customer power requirements. This includes gas for the Local Gas-Fired Plants and for the Sutter Energy Center. See “Power Purchase Agreements – Sutter Energy Center”. This is accomplished through a combination of long-term supply arrangements and an exposure reduction program. The program consists of a primarily rolling three-year exposure reduction component, a fuel hedging component on a rolling three-year basis, as well as supplemental fixed calendar year components reaching out up to five calendar years. Long-term

A-32

arrangements may consist of a combination of physical commodity supply contracts, financial hedges, or options. Natural gas is purchased from a wide variety of producers and marketers at the northern and southern California borders, and from the San Juan and the Rocky Mountain supply basins. SMUD has a number of both fixed-price supply agreements and financial hedging contracts to fix gas costs ranging from one month to several years in duration. Including fixed price biogas contracts as of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted.

SMUD has contracted with NCGA to purchase an approximate average of 8,700 Dth/day over the remaining life of a contract expiring May 31, 2027 (the “NCGA Contract”). Under the NCGA contract, SMUD pays a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. Until November 1, 2023 the delivery point for the NCGA Contract was the AECO hub in Alberta. Starting November 1, 2023, to increase delivery efficiencies, SMUD has exchanged the gas delivered at the AECO hub under the NCGA Contract with gas delivered at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border. From there SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants.

SMUD has also contracted with NCEA to purchase an approximately 22,000 Dth/day on average, or to be converted to the appropriate cash flow value in Megawatt-hours (“MWh”) of electricity over the remaining life of a contract expiring on May 31, 2049. The gas will be delivered to the SMUD system via the Malin receipt point on the PG&E backbone system. SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants. SMUD will pay a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. In connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement), SMUD expects to amend and restate the contract with NCEA in connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement). [adjust for 2024 Senior Bonds offering documents]

**Renewable Natural Gas Supply.** As a component of meeting SMUD’s RPS goals, SMUD procures renewable natural gas and digesters gas as fuels to generate renewable electricity from the Cosumnes Power Plant. Descriptions of the renewable natural gas supply agreements are provided below.

In March 2009, SMUD entered into a 15-year contract (that qualifies as renewable energy) with Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. (“Shell Energy”) to purchase up to 6,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from a landfill project in Texas. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in April 2009. In March 2012, SMUD amended the contract with Shell Energy to increase the maximum volumes to 7,300 Dth/day and extended the term by 10 years to March 31, 2034. Currently, the delivery point is PG&E Topock and SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In 2016, SMUD entered into a 3-year contract with Shell Energy to sell back the entire volume of renewable natural gas purchased, less 500 Dth/day, to be sold into the vehicle transportation markets. Upon expiration of the initial 3-year contract for the sale of biogas to Shell Energy, SMUD extended the sell back of the entire volume of biogas twice for an additional three years with Element Markets (now RNG, LLC), starting in 2020 and 2023. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

SMUD contracted with Heartland Renewable Energy, LLC (“HRE”) in December 2009 for a 20-year supply of up to 7,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas from a digester facility in Colorado. Deliveries began in March of 2014. Currently, the delivery point is Opal, Wyoming and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. HRE has not delivered volumes from the project to SMUD since December 2016 due to litigation with Weld County, Colorado regarding odor and

permit issues. EDF Renewables, the majority owner of HRE, notified SMUD in August of 2017 that it is in discussions with a short list of bidders to sell its interests in the facility. In June of 2020, the project was purchased and SMUD’s contract was assigned to the new owner, Platte River Biogas, LLC (“PRB”). SMUD and PRB reached a settlement in the third quarter of 2021 that could lead to terminating the contract.

In September 2011, SMUD and CVFA entered into a “Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement” through which the Carson Project cleans nearly all of the digester gas received from Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) and sells it to SMUD for delivery to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In return, SMUD pays all of the Carson Project’s costs in acquiring, cleaning and making the gas available to SMUD. The Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement, along with the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The Carson Project is currently receiving, processing and selling up to 1,500 Dth/day with provisions for volume increases over time to 2,500 Dth/day. Digester gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations.

In December 2011, SMUD entered into a 20-year agreement with EIF KC Landfill Gas LLC (“EIF”) to purchase up to 7,050 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from multiple landfill projects. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in January 2014. Currently the delivery point is Kern River – Opal and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. Renewable natural gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations. In April 2022, SMUD entered into a transaction to sell the renewable natural gas purchased into the renewable natural gas markets. The transaction expires in March 2025. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

AB 2196 is a law that defines the criteria by which existing and future renewable natural gas contracts will qualify for the State RPS program. The CEC adopted a RPS Eligibility Guidebook on April 30, 2013, which includes detailed rules for implementation of AB 2196. SMUD received an updated certificate of eligibility from the CEC in July 2014 for the Cosumnes Power Plant that included the quantities of renewable natural gas from all contracts. The CEC adopted a revised RPS Eligibility Guidebook (Ninth Edition) on April 27, 2017. This latest guidebook did not change the RPS eligibility of any of the above SMUD renewable natural gas and digester gas contracts, but did simplify reporting requirements for these contracts.

Gas Transmission

SMUD has satisfied its obligation to deliver natural gas to its power plants by constructing a natural gas pipeline, purchasing an equity interest in two PG&E backbone gas transmission lines, and contracting for capacity on a number of existing interstate natural gas transmission lines.

The Local Pipeline. SMUD constructed and owns a 20-inch, 50-mile natural gas pipeline in the greater Sacramento area (the “Local Pipeline”) that transports gas to all of the Local Gas-Fired Plants except McClellan. The Local Pipeline is interconnected with PG&E’s major State gas transmission lines 300 and 401. Additionally, it may be interconnected with one or more private gas gathering pipelines located in the area, a gas storage project and/or other FERC approved pipelines that may be built in the local area. In conjunction with the construction of the Cosumnes Power Plant, SMUD extended the Local Pipeline to the plant site. The 26-mile extension was completed in 2004. The extension is 24 inches in diameter and was designed to serve both the Cosumnes Power Plant and an additional second phase, if constructed.

![PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401](https://example.com/image.png)

**PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401.** In 1996, SMUD purchased an equity interest in PG&E’s backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 (referred to as the PG&E backbone). The total capacity acquired at that time was approximately 85,000 Dth/day and consisted of approximately 43,600 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, Oregon and 44,700 Dth/day from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California. SMUD was also entitled to a share of non-firm capacity, which was approximately 4,360 Dth/day; making the total capacity potentially available to SMUD almost 90,000 Dth/day. This purchase made SMUD a co-owner of the PG&E backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 and obligated SMUD to pay PG&E to operate the pipelines on its behalf subject to the terms of the purchase agreement and operating protocols. PG&E reduced operating pressures on Line 300 after PG&E suffered a natural gas explosion in San Bruno, CA in September of 2010. Operating pressures and capacity may also fluctuate due to regulatory and other changes. As of December 1, 2021, SMUD holds a total capacity of approximately 87,000 Dth/day, consisting of approximately 47,572 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, and 39,193 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California.

**Kern River Gas Transmission Company Long Term Agreement.** SMUD has an agreement with Kern River Gas Transmission Company for 200,000 Dth/day of firm capacity through April 30, 2028. This capacity gives SMUD access to the Rocky Mountain supply basin at Opal, Wyoming, and connects to PG&E Line 300 (owned in part by SMUD) at Daggett, California.

SMUD’s diversified portfolio of gas transmission arrangements allows for the purchase of gas from a variety of suppliers and locations, and the opportunity to capitalize on regional price differentials where possible. In addition, it ensures diversity in the SMUD/PG&E backbone and enhances the reliability of SMUD’s gas supply.

**Gas Storage**

SMUD also employs gas storage as part of its overall fuel supply strategy. Gas storage is useful in helping to balance gas supply, mitigate market price volatility, and provide a reliable supply to meet peak day delivery requirements.

SMUD has a contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2023 and expires in March 2026, for capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity.

SMUD also has a second contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2022 and expires in March 2024, for additional capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity. SMUD does not plan to renew this contract upon expiration.

SMUD has a contract with Wild Goose Storage LLC, that will begin in April 2024 (but which allows for early injection (December 2023 – March 2024)) for capacity in the Wild Goose Storage project located near Gridley in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 0.2 million Dth of storage inventory, ratcheted (12,500-14,000 Dth/day) volumes of injection rights and ratcheted (10,000 – 24,000 Dth/day) volumes of withdrawal capacity.

# Power Purchase Agreements

SMUD has a number of power purchase agreements to help meet its power requirements. Some of these agreements are described below.

## Western Area Power Administration
Effective January 1, 2005, SMUD entered into a 20-year contract with WAPA. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement extending the term by 30 years for the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2054. Power sold under this contract is generated by the Central Valley Project (“CVP”), a series of federal hydroelectric facilities in northern California operated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. The contract provides WAPA’s CVP Base Resource customers (including SMUD) delivery of a percentage share of project generation in return for reimbursement of an equivalent share of project costs. SMUD’s CVP Base Resource share is roughly 25% of project generation and costs. This is expected to be approximately 318 MW of capacity and 661 GWh of energy in an average water year but will vary depending on precipitation. Energy available under the contract is determined by water releases required for water supply and flood control and is then shaped into higher value periods within other CVP operating constraints. More capacity and energy are typically available in spring and summer months and less in fall and winter.

SMUD also has a contract with WAPA expiring December 31, 2024, by which WAPA delivers an additional 200-300 MW per hour from projects located in the Pacific Northwest based on certain contractual parameters. In 2022, SMUD received 1,913 GWh of energy under this contract. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement for the period January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2030.

## Avangrid (formerly Iberdrola Renewables (“Iberdrola”))
SMUD has a contract with Iberdrola for 126 GWh of wind power generated in Solano County, California. The SMUD Board approved an extension of the wind contract through June 30, 2025.

## Patua Project LLC
In April 2010, SMUD entered into a power purchase agreement with Patua Project LLC (“Patua”), a subsidiary of Gradient Resources, for the delivery of up to 132 MW (expected to be 120 MW nominal power output) of renewable energy from geothermal generation being developed in north central Nevada, from a Gradient Resources project known as the Patua Project. The Patua Project was to have been developed in three phases. Since 2010, the agreed upon capacity has been reduced several times. In December 2013, Phase 1 of the project, which had been reduced to 30 MW, finally achieved commercial operation. In 2014, the parties concluded negotiations on the fourth amendment to the power purchase agreement with Patua, which reduced the total capacity down to 40 MW, extended the commercial operation date of Phase 2 to January 1, 2016, and allowed Patua to add up to 13 MW of solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production. In addition, this amendment shifted responsibility to Patua for a portion of the long-term transmission service agreements that have been underutilized due to the project not meeting its targets. In November 2015, the Patua Project was acquired by TL Power, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cyrq Energy, Inc. (“Cyrq”). In December 2015, Cyrq terminated Phase 2. Upon termination of Phase 2, the contractual right for Cyrq to add solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production was reduced to 10 MW. As a result of poor performance during the first year of operation, SMUD reduced its obligation to take power from 30 MW to 25 MW. Performance continued to lag in 2015 and 2016 and SMUD further reduced its obligation to take power from 25 MW to 19 MW.

## Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff
In September 2009, SMUD’s Board authorized a feed-in tariff program for the purchase of renewable energy from local renewable energy projects connected to SMUD’s distribution system. SMUD’s Board authorized connection of up to 100 MW under the feed-in tariff which included standard payment rates and standard purchase terms for power. The feed-in tariff program became effective on January 1, 2010. Under the feed-in tariff, SMUD has executed 20-year term power purchase agreements. 

A-36

agreements for solar projects totaling 98.5 MW. Construction and start-up were completed on all projects between 2010 and 2012.

**CalEnergy LLC.** In August 2014, SMUD entered into a 22-year power purchase agreement with CalEnergy LLC for the purchase of 30 MW per year of renewable energy from its Salton Sea geothermal facilities. As of July 1, 2017, SMUD began receiving up to 10 MW from the CalEnergy portfolio, which escalated to the full 30 MWs on May 1, 2020.

**Rancho Seco Solar.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Rancho Seco Solar LLC for the purchase of energy from a 10.88 MW solar PV project sited on SMUD’s property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station. Commercial operation was achieved in August of 2016. Rancho Seco Solar LLC leased the property from SMUD under a land lease agreement. The output of this project directly serves two large commercial customers that executed agreements with SMUD for retail supply of solar power.

In May 2019, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement for an additional 160 MW solar PV project with Rancho Seco Solar II, LLC. The project is located on SMUD-owned property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station, adjacent to the existing 10.88 MW solar PV project. Construction began in 2019, and the project became commercially operable in February 2021.

**Grady Wind Energy.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Grady Wind Energy LLC (“Grady”) for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW wind project located in New Mexico (the “Grady Project”). The Grady Project began commercial operations on August 5, 2019. Energy from the Grady Project is delivered to CAISO. SMUD purchases 100% of the Grady Project output, which includes energy, renewable energy credits, and capacity attributes.

**Great Valley Solar 2, LLC.** In January 2017, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Great Valley Solar 2, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 60 MW solar PV project located in Fresno County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was December 28, 2017.

**ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC.** On September 14, 2016, Senate Bill 859 (“SB 859”) was signed into law. Under SB 859, a POUs must procure its proportionate share of 125 MW of renewable energy from biomass plants burning high hazard forest fuels, subject to terms of at least five years. Seven POUs (SMUD, MID, Turlock Irrigation District (“TID”), Anaheim Public Utilities, Imperial Irrigation District, Los Angeles Department of Water & Power and Riverside Public Utilities, collectively described herein as the “ARP-Loyalton POUs”) jointly solicited proposals for up to 29 MW of contract capacity for renewable energy to meet the requirements of SB 859. In January 2018, SMUD entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC to fulfill 18 MW of the required 29 MW with SMUD’s share being just over 23 percent (the “ARP-Loyalton PPA”). See “—Roseburg Forest Products Co.” below for a discussion of the remaining SB 859 capacity. The contract became effective on April 1, 2018. On February 18, 2020, ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and stopped producing and selling energy from the biomass plant. On May 7, 2022, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the Loyalton facility to Sierra Valley Enterprises, LLC (“SVE”). SVE initially expressed interest in bringing the facility back into service; however, the bankruptcy trustee requested requested extension of the deadline for SVE to accept or reject the ARP-Loyalton PPA. The latest deadline was April 19, 2023, the date of expiration of the ARP-Loyalton PPA terms. SVE did not resume operations before the end of the ARP-Loyalton PPA term, the ARP-Loyalton POUs have negotiated a settlement agreement with the bankruptcy trustee (the “ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement”). The ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement, which SMUD executed and is filed with the court, defines funds from the performance security that the ARP-Loyalton POUs will keep to cover legal and administrative fees, along with a contingency amount to cover potential risk of future damages. Since the ARP-Loyalton POUs entered into a five-year agreement to

A-37

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

procure compliant biomass and provided SVE the opportunity to accept the ARP-Loyalton PPA and restart operations, the ARP-Loyalton POUs consider their statutory obligations to have been fulfilled.

**Roseburg Forest Products Co.** For the remaining SB 859 biomass obligation of 11 MW, SMUD and the other ARP-Loyalton POUs have entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with Roseburg Forest Products Co. SMUD’s share of the contract capacity is 2.5795 MW, and the plant began operating under the contract on February 26, 2021.

**Sutter Energy Center.** SMUD entered into an initial two-year contract (with a third-year exercisable option) with Calpine Energy Services, L.P. (“Calpine”) for the ability to schedule up to 258 MW of energy from Sutter Energy Center. The Sutter Energy Center is a natural gas-fired, combined-cycle facility located in Yuba City, California. The initial contract became effective on April 1, 2018. SMUD exercised its option to extend the contract, which expired November 1, 2020. SMUD entered into a new contract with Calpine for the same 258 MW of energy that became effective January 1, 2021, and had an original expiration date of January 1, 2024. In December 2021, SMUD extended this contract through December 31, 2026.

**Drew Solar, LLC.** In June 2018, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Drew Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 100 MW solar PV project located in Imperial County, California. The project’s scheduled commercial operation date was set to be December 31, 2021. The commercial operation date was delayed due to Force Majeure claims surrounding the COVID pandemic and supply chain constraints caused by changes in Federal regulatory requirements. The project began commercially operating on November 3, 2022.

**Wildflower Solar, LLC.** In October 2018, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Wildflower Solar I, LLC, for the purchase of energy, capacity, and RECs from a 13 MW solar PV project located in Rio Linda, California. The project began commercially operating on December 18, 2020.

**Coyote Creek (Formerly Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC.)** In August 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW solar PV and 100 MW four-hour Battery Energy Storage System (“BESS”) capacity project located in Sacramento County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was originally expected to be December 31, 2023, but has been delayed to 2026 due to ongoing development and permitting delays.

**SloughHouse Solar, LLC.** In September 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with SloughHouse Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 50 MW solar PV project located in Sacramento County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was originally expected to be December 31, 2023, but the commercial operation date has been delayed to March 31, 2025 due to ongoing development and permitting delays.

**Country Acres Solar.** In November 2023, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Country Acres Clean Power LLC for the purchase of energy from a 344 MW solar PV project, with a 20-year term for 172 MW four-hour BESS capacity, located in Placer County, California. The project’s commercial operation is expected to be December 15, 2026.

**Geysers Power Company, LLC.** In March 2021, SMUD executed a 10-year power purchase agreement with Geysers Power Company, LLC for 100 MW of energy and capacity from the Geysers geothermal energy plant located in Lake and Sonoma Counties, California. SMUD started to receive deliveries on January 1, 2023.

# Transmission Service Agreements

## TANC California-Oregon Transmission Project
The 340-mile COTP is one part of a three 500-kV line coordinated system known as the California-Oregon Intertie (“COI”). The COTP is allocated one-third of the 4,800 MW capability of the COI system (see related agreements below). TANC is entitled to 1,390 MW and is obligated to pay approximately 80% of the operating costs of the COTP. SMUD is a member of TANC and a party to Project Agreement No. 3 (“PA3”), under which it is entitled to 378 MW and obligated to pay on an unconditional take-or-pay basis about 27.5% of TANC’s COTP debt service and operations costs, subject to a “step-up” obligation of up to 25% of its entitlement share upon the unremedied default of another TANC member-participant. In 2009, SMUD entered into a long-term layoff agreement with certain members that increased SMUD’s entitlement by 35 MW. In 2014, SMUD entered into another long-term layoff agreement with certain other members that increased SMUD’s COTP entitlements by 128 MW and amended the 2009 layoff agreement that returned 13 MW to a member. In January 2024, SMUD entered into an agreement to extend the 2009 long-term layoff agreement with certain members to January 31, 2034. As of January 31, 2024, SMUD was entitled to approximately 528 MW of TANC’s transfer capability for imports and 405 MW for exports, and is obligated to pay approximately 38.6% of COTP debt service and operations costs. SMUD’s payments under this contract, like SMUD’s payments under its other power purchase and transmission service agreements, are treated as “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the resolutions securing the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the section “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below). SMUD relies on its COTP rights to purchase power, access contingency reserves through the Western Power Pool, and obtain renewable resources to supplement its own resources to serve its load. TANC maintains insurance coverage on a property/casualty insurance program. TANC’s budget for COTP costs, support services and advocacy expenses is about $45.4 million for 2023. SMUD’s obligation on the TANC budget is about $16.5 million for 2023.

## TANC Tesla-Midway Transmission Service
TANC has a long-term contract with PG&E to provide TANC with 300 MW of transmission service between PG&E’s Midway Substation and the electric systems of the TANC Members (the “Tesla-Midway Service”). SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service had been 46 MW. As part of the 2009 long-term layoff agreement, SMUD acquired an additional 2 MW of South-of-Tesla Principles (“SOTP”) transmission rights for 15 years starting February, 2009 from another TANC member, bringing SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service to 48 MW.

## Bonneville Power Administration
In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with the Bonneville Power Administration (“BPA”) for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service from BPA’s Hilltop substation in northeastern California to the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua geothermal project over BPA’s 230kV transmission lines. In early 2013, in accordance with BPA’s transmission tariff, the transmission service was split into two 30 MW services and deferred as appropriate to better fit the timing of expected commercial operation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Patua Project LLC.” SMUD submitted another request for the 30 MW of transmission procured for Phase 2 of the Patua Project to split the service into a 10 MW and a 20 MW service, with the 10 MW service deferred and timed with the originally expected commercial operation date of Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 1 of the Patua Project and SMUD’s reduced obligation due to the poor performance of Phase 1 of the Patua Project, much of the transmission reserved for it will no longer be needed. BPA does not have a provision in its transmission tariff for early termination of transmission service. However, the power purchase agreement with Patua requires Patua to cover unused transmission that SMUD has procured for the Patua purchases. On January 1, 2020, SMUD’s transmission rights with BPA were reduced to 19 MW. This now aligns with SMUD’s PacifiCorp transmission rights of 19 MW described in the immediately following paragraph.

A-39
<!-- Page 199 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**PacifiCorp.** In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with PacifiCorp for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service across PacifiCorp’s high voltage step-up transformer at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In early 2013, in accordance with PacifiCorp’s transmission tariff, the commencement of the 60 MW of transmission service was deferred to fit the timing of first deliveries expected from the 30 MW of Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In 2013, SMUD terminated the 60 MW of transmission service and requested two new transmission services of 30 MW each, with service start dates timed to better fit with the expected start dates of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the reduction in expected output of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the second 30 MW transmission agreement, and replaced it with a 10 MW transmission service agreement for Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 2 of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the 10 MW PacifiCorp transmission service agreement and as a result of the reduced obligation to take power from the Patua Project, SMUD has reduced its remaining PacifiCorp transmission service from 30 MW to 19 MW.

**Western Area Power Administration.** SMUD does not have a direct interconnection of its power system to the COTP. To receive power deliveries that use its COTP rights, SMUD has a long-term transmission service agreement with WAPA for transmission of 342 MW of power from the COTP line (received at WAPA’s Tracy or Olinda substations) to SMUD’s system. In May of 2011, WAPA completed the Sacramento Voltage Support Transmission Project. Completion of this project has given SMUD an additional 165 MW of transmission service rights on WAPA’s system from the COTP at the Olinda Substation to SMUD’s system at the Elverta Substation.

**Projected Resources**

The following tables titled “Projected Requirements and Resources to Meet Load Requirements Energy Requirements and Resources” (the “Energy Table”) and “Capacity Requirements and Resources Net Capacity – Megawatts” (the “Capacity Table”) describe SMUD’s contracted commitments and owned resources available to meet its forecasted load requirements through the year 2033. Resources are shown on an annualized basis with market purchases netted against surpluses to arrive at a single net position for each year. Because SMUD’s available resources do not exactly match its actual load requirements on an hourly basis, there are times during a year when resources available will either exceed or be insufficient to meet SMUD’s needs. Expected actual capacity values are included in the tables. These values may differ from measured net demonstrated capacity values of the Local Area Gas-Fired Plants. The table below also includes the impact energy efficiency has on resources requirements as discussed below under “Demand Side Management Programs.” See “BUSINESS STRATEGY” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.”

Resources listed in both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table are listed as either renewable or non-renewable. Generally, SMUD follows the CEC guidelines for eligibility requirements. Some of SMUD’s renewable resources listed include solar, wind, geothermal, small hydroelectric facilities with a capacity of 30 MW or less, and biomass (representing generation from a fuel comprised of agricultural wastes and residues, landscape and tree trimmings, wood and wood waste).

As in any forecast, assumptions are made. In both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table the WAPA and UARP forecasts assume average water conditions throughout the period. On the capacity table, WAPA and Cosumnes Power Plant renewable capacity is estimated based on the ratio of renewable energy to total WAPA or Cosumnes Power Plant energy. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric.”

A-40
<!-- Page 200 -->
The Uncommitted Purchases (Sales) on the tables represent either anticipated future needs or surpluses. Future needs are met well in advance of delivery. They also include both renewable and non-renewable resources.

The Transmission Losses represent reductions in the amount of energy or capacity from the location it was purchased to the point of entering SMUD’s electrical system. This amount reduces the Total Resources available to meet the Total Projected Energy Requirements of the electrical system.

## Demand Side Management Programs

SMUD’s demand-side management initiatives represent an integral element of its total resource portfolio, and are organized into two major components: energy efficiency and load management programs. Energy efficiency offerings include a wide variety of programs and services to customers to retrofit or upgrade existing equipment and fixtures and to install new energy efficiency measures in existing and new construction facilities. Load management allows SMUD to reduce the load on the electric system by cycling residential air conditioning, and calling upon commercial/industrial customers to curtail energy usage when energy is constrained during the summer or system emergencies. Load management programs are projected to allow SMUD to shed approximately 60 MW of peak load in an emergency on a hot day, representing about 2% of SMUD’s maximum system peak demand.

The customer “smart meter” system with 2-way communication capability provides information regarding customer usage patterns, which is expected to help SMUD tailor rate designs that provide customers with both the information and ability to manage their energy usage around high energy cost periods.

# Balancing Authority Area Agreements

## Background
SMUD began operating as an independent control area, later termed a Balancing Authority, on June 18, 2002 within the WECC reliability organization’s region. This reduced SMUD’s exposure to the costs and reliability risks of the CAISO’s markets. SMUD expanded its operational footprint beyond SMUD’s service territory to include WAPA’s electric system, including the MID, Roseville, and Redding service areas (on January 1, 2005) and the COTP (on December 1, 2005). As described further below, SMUD ceased to be the Balancing Authority on April 30, 2011, as BANC took SMUD’s place as the Balancing Authority. SMUD remains the operator of the Balancing Authority through a contract with BANC. SMUD administers the contracts with WAPA and TANC to provide specified Balancing Authority-related and other services, and is compensated by WAPA and TANC. TANC recovers such Balancing Authority services costs as a part of its annual operating budget from the COTP Participants and WAPA recovers its Balancing Authority services costs through its rates for power and transmission service. The agreement with WAPA, among other terms, establishes operating procedures and reserve obligations between the parties and terminates on December 31, 2024. BANC, SMUD and WAPA will develop successor agreements in 2024 to take effect upon expiration of the existing contract. WAPA in turn has agreements with electric systems connected to it to assure that such systems also operate reliably (i.e., MID, Roseville and Redding). As a result of the transition to BANC as the Balancing Authority, SMUD assigned or terminated its interconnection and operations agreements with other connecting Balancing Authority areas (i.e., CAISO, BPA and TID). BANC is now the party to these agreements as they primarily address only Balancing Authority matters required for compliance with the reliability standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”), such as emergency assistance arrangements. See also “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY” – Western Energy Imbalance Market.”

## Reliability Standards
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave FERC authority to enforce reliability standards for the bulk electric system. In June 2007, these standards became mandatory for SMUD and BANC.

In 2022, SMUD and BANC underwent a combined NERC/WECC audit to evaluate compliance with applicable reliability standards. These audits occur every three years. At the conclusion of the audit, regulators determined that neither entity had any compliance violations related to the Operations and Planning or Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards. SMUD and BANC will undergo another NERC/WECC audit sometime in 2025.

## Balancing Authority of Northern California
SMUD, MID, Redding and Roseville executed a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement (the “BANC JPA Agreement”) creating BANC on May 8, 2009. BANC became operational on May 1, 2011 as a Balancing Authority and replaced SMUD as the entity responsible for Balancing Authority-related reliability standards. Since that time, the Trinity Public Utilities District and the City of Shasta Lake have also become members of BANC. As provided in the BANC member agreement, liability for penalties associated with such Balancing Authority-related reliability standards are shared on a pro rata basis among the members of BANC. SMUD is the Balancing Authority operator under contract and performs Balancing Authority operational functions on behalf of BANC, much as it did when it was the Balancing Authority. The BANC JPA Agreement assigns cost responsibility based on member load within the BANC Balancing Authority, with SMUD representing approximately 70% of the total load.

## Power Pool and Other Agreements

### Western Power Pool Agreement
The Western Power Pool (“WPP”) is an agreement among over 30 utilities and public agencies in the western United States to coordinate contingency reserve sharing.

**TANC-SMUD OASIS Administration Agreement.** SMUD entered into an agreement with TANC to provide OASIS services (transmission sales and scheduling related services in the BANC BA of TANC members’ COTP rights) on September 29, 2005. SMUD is compensated for performing these services. TANC and SMUD entered into a letter agreement dated October 25, 2010 to clarify each party’s role for regulatory reliability standards compliance responsibilities and take into account SMUD’s increased efforts related to supporting TANC’s compliance requirements. SMUD and TANC entered into an agreement to transition this service to the Western Area Power Administration, effective on May 1, 2023. Going forward, SMUD will only have a minor role in receiving payments and distributing revenues to the TANC members.

**Other Interconnection Agreements**

**Background.** SMUD’s electric system was originally purchased from PG&E in 1947. SMUD’s service area is mostly surrounded by PG&E’s and WAPA’s service areas. The SMUD and PG&E electric systems are interconnected at SMUD’s Rancho Seco and Lake 230-kV substations. SMUD and WAPA are interconnected at SMUD’s Hurley, Elverta, Natomas and Folsom 230-kV substations.

**PG&E Interconnection Agreement.** PG&E and SMUD executed a Replacement Interconnection Agreement (“RIA”) which became effective on January 1, 2010. The RIA provides that SMUD and PG&E operate their interconnections reliably, plan their electric systems to meet their load requirements, and avoid or mitigate impacts the cause by certain electric system modifications. The agreement has a termination date of December 31, 2024, subject to FERC approval. SMUD and other Northern California utilities have similar interconnection agreements with PG&E, albeit with different expiration dates. PG&E filed a successor interconnection agreement with one of these utilities, TID, on November 1, 2023, to become effective on January 1, 2024. Many interconnection customers, including SMUD, intervened and submitted comments or protests in the FERC docket. FERC accepted the filing and TID and PG&E are now in a settlement process, pending litigation of the parties action and resolve the disputed items. SMUD anticipates that PG&E will seek to negotiate a successor interconnection agreement with SMUD which will be informed by the TID settlement or litigation process. While some functional mechanisms in the interconnection agreement may change, SMUD expects that its successor interconnection agreement will substantially preserve the balance of burdens and benefits consistent with FERC’s standard of requiring rates and terms of service that are just and reasonable. SMUD expects this process to be completed by the current expiration date of the RIA.

**PG&E Generator Interconnection Agreements.** SMUD signed a LGIA with CAISO and PG&E for the Solano 3 Wind Project, effective December 16, 2008, with a 50-year term. The Solano 2 Wind Project has interconnection rights granted through a LGIA, also with the CAISO and PG&E. The agreement became effective in January 2010 and has a term of 20 years. On June 3, 2021, SMUD entered into a LGIA with the CAISO and PG&E, for the planned 90.8 MW Solano 4 Wind project with a 10-year term and automatic renewal for successive one-year terms thereafter. On February 27, 2023, SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process which combines the Solano 2, 3 & 4 projects into one Solano Wind Project. The original agreement conditions for the individual projects are carried forward with
<!-- Page 205 -->
a new combined project maximum production limit of 320.8 MW at the point of interconnection at the Russell Substation.

Other PG&E generator interconnection agreements include a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for Slab Creek with a 22-year term which became effective on January 14, 2010, and a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for the Chili Bar Project with a 10-year term which became effective on June 2, 2021.

WAPA Interconnection Agreement and other WAPA Agreements. SMUD and WAPA executed an interconnection agreement on May 8, 2008 for a term of 40 years which establishes the terms and conditions under which the SMUD and WAPA transmission systems are interconnected and memorializes related understandings. SMUD is working with WAPA on a reconfiguration at the shared Elverta interconnection to increase reliability and accommodate new generation interconnection in the area. SMUD has other agreements with WAPA including for operation of the Sutter Energy Center generating facility, communication systems terms and fiber optic access, training and for use of WAPA labor and heavy equipment to assist SMUD’s maintenance activities on an as-available basis.

![Management's Discussion of SMUD's Operating Results](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Management's+Discussion+of+SMUD's+Operating+Results)

**Year Ended December 31, 2023.** For the year ended December 31, 2023, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $218.1 million as compared to an increase of $70.7 million for 2022.

Operating revenues were $228.5 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower sales of surplus gas ($118.3 million), transfers to the RSF ($67.2 million), sales to customers ($28.3 million), transfers from the RSF ($21.9 million), and LCFS revenue ($3.9 million), partially offset by higher sales of surplus power ($136.6 million), AB 32 revenue ($3.7 million), customer fees ($1.1 million), and lower transmission revenue ($2.3 million).

Operating expenses were $292.8 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower purchased power expenses ($175.5 million), production operating expenses ($146.4 million), depreciation expenses ($22.7 million), production maintenance expenses ($12.3 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($7.2 million), partially offset by higher administrative and general expenses ($33.4 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($15.8 million), public good expenses ($8.8 million), and customer service and information expenses ($6.6 million).

Non-Operating income increased by $55.2 million primarily due to fair market value assessment and gain on sale of land ($33.3 million), higher interest income ($21.7 million), higher unrealized holding gains ($11.4 million), higher CCA revenue ($5.7 million), partially offset by lower investment income ($39.1 million).

Interest expense decreased $27.9 million from 2022.

**Year Ended December 31, 2022.** For the year ended December 31, 2022, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $70.7 million as compared to an increase of $347.3 million for 2021.

Operating revenues were $363.0 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher sales to customers ($130.7 million), sales of surplus gas ($96.0 million), sales of surplus power ($62.2 million), transfers to the RSF ($28.9 million), transfers from the RSF ($24.3 million), customer fees ($9.5 million), AB 32 revenue ($4.9 million) and LCFS revenue ($2.2 million), partially offset by lower gain on sale of carbon allowance futures ($3.7 million).

Operating expenses were $601.2 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher purchased power expenses ($263.6 million), amortization of pension and OPEB ($126.9 million), production operating expenses ($125.1 million), depreciation expenses ($49.5 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($22.1 million), production maintenance expenses ($18.4 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($8.1 million), public good expenses ($7.4 million), and customer service and information expenses ($4.5 million), partially offset by lower administrative and general expenses ($27.4 million).

Non-Operating income decreased by $19.0 million primarily due to lower grant revenue ($39.6 million), unrealized holding losses ($3.7 million), partially offset by higher investment income ($19.7 million), closeout of escrow account ($2.8 million), and loss on asset retirements ($1.9 million).

Interest expense increased $19.5 million from 2021.

**Regulatory Assets.** In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” SMUD defers, as regulatory assets, certain types of expenditures. These assets are amortized and collected through future rates.

As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had a total of $916.1 million recorded for regulatory assets. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 68 which requires SMUD to record a net pension liability was $323.5 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 68 was $174.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 75 which requires SMUD to record a net Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) liability was $268.2 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 75 was $39.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with Rancho Seco decommissioning costs totaled $108.0 million at December 31, 2023. Nuclear fuel storage costs and non-radiological decommissioning costs have been collected in rates since 2009. For a complete description of these regulatory assets, see Note 8 (Regulatory Deferrals) to SMUD’s financial statements.

The Board has authorized the deferral of any charges or credits that result from the change in valuation of ineffective hedges that should be reported as Investment Revenue/Expense on the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and changes in net position. The Board’s resolution establishes that such charges or credits are not included in rates based on market value changes but are included in rates when the underlying transactions occur. Therefore, under GASB No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” any such changes are included in the Statement of Net Position as regulatory assets or liabilities. For a complete description of these derivative financial instruments, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s financial statements.

RANCHO SECO DECOMMISSIONING

Overview. The 913 MW Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant (“Rancho Seco”) began operation in 1970 and was licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) in 1980. In June 1989, the Board voted against allowing SMUD to continue to operate Rancho Seco as a nuclear generating facility, and the plant was shut down. In 1991, SMUD submitted a report (the “Financial Assurance Plan”) providing financial assurance to the NRC that SMUD will have sufficient funds available to pay for the cost of decommissioning. On March 17, 1992, the NRC granted SMUD a change from operating to a possession-only license for Rancho Seco that relieved SMUD from compliance with a number of NRC regulations applicable to operating nuclear power plants. SMUD also filed a proposed decommissioning plan with the NRC (the “Decommissioning Plan”), which was approved in March 1995.

After the decommissioning efforts began, no suitable disposal option was available to SMUD for the Class B and Class C low level radioactive waste generated during the plant decommissioning. With the used nuclear fuel stored onsite requiring oversight staff, SMUD opted to store the Class B and Class C radioactive waste in an existing interim onsite storage building until a suitable disposal option was available. In November 2007, the possession-only license for Rancho Seco was amended to update the Decommissioning Plan to terminate the possession-only license for the Class B and Class C waste in two phases. Phase I of the decommissioning was completed at the end of 2008. Following verification of the site conditions, SMUD submitted a request to the NRC to reduce the licensed facility from 2,480 acres to the interim onsite storage building and about one acre surrounding it. The request was approved by the NRC in September 2009. Phase II of decommissioning included the approximately two-acre interim storage building containing the Class B and Class C radioactive waste and surrounding area. In September 2013, SMUD entered into a contract with the operator of the low-level radioactive waste disposal facility located in Andrews, Texas. Shipment of the Class B and Class C radioactive waste for disposal was completed in November 2014. SMUD conducted additional clean-up activities and radiological surveys, which were followed by NRC confirmatory surveys. The results of these surveys demonstrated unit dose criteria well below NRC release criteria, and the NRC approved the Phase II area for unrestricted use. On September 21, 2017, SMUD formally requested the termination of the possession-only license. On August A-51
<!-- Page 211 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

31, 2018, the NRC officially terminated SMUD’s possession-only license for the remaining Class B and Class C waste at Rancho Seco.

As part of the Decommissioning Plan, the nuclear fuel and Greater Than Class C (“GTCC”) radioactive waste is being stored in a dry storage facility (the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation or “ISFSI”) constructed by SMUD, adjacent to the former reactor facility. The NRC has separately licensed this facility. The DOE, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, is responsible for permanent disposal of used nuclear fuel and GTCC radioactive waste. SMUD has a contract with the DOE for the removal and disposal of this waste. The DOE was to have a waste repository operating by 1998, but has experienced significant and ongoing delays. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act designates Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the final and exclusive repository for the nation’s used nuclear fuel. The DOE discontinued the Yucca Mountain license review activities in 2010, but after a court ordered the NRC to resume its review in 2013, the NRC published its final safety evaluation report in 2015. The final safety report, and the final environmental impact statement, concluded that the proposed repository would be safe and environmentally sound for one million years.

Nevertheless, seeking alternatives to Yucca Mountain, the Blue-Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future delivered its final report in January 2012 with several recommendations. The DOE responded to the recommendations by issuing a report in January 2013 (Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste). Key to both documents is a focus on used fuel from decommissioned sites including Rancho Seco. The DOE report accepts most of the Blue-Ribbon Commission recommendations, and contains timelines for fuel management options which proposed removing the fuel from Rancho Seco as early as 2021. However, any progress on the strategies proposed by the DOE is dependent on legislative action by Congress. With no legislative action taken to date, the 2021 projected date for removal slips year-for-year. Therefore, SMUD continues to incur costs at approximately $5 to $7 million per year for storage of used nuclear fuel at the ISFSI. SMUD has filed a series of successful lawsuits against the federal government for recovery of past spent fuel costs. SMUD last recovered over $14 million in 2023. SMUD plans to continue pursuing cost recovery claims to ensure it is reimbursed for all such costs in the future. The ISFSI will be decommissioned, and its license terminated after the fuel and GTCC is removed.

Financial Assurance Plan. In accordance with the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD established and funded an external decommissioning trust fund currently held by Computershare Corporate Trust (the “Decommissioning Trust Fund”). Pursuant to the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD made the final deposit into the Decommissioning Trust Fund in 2008. Additional deposits are not expected but will be made if increased cost estimates or reduced fund interest earnings require it. In 2011, the NRC began requiring that SMUD demonstrate financial assurance for decommissioning the ISFSI as well as the former power facility, increasing the overall cost for decommissioning Rancho Seco. The estimated total cost for decommissioning the ISFSI was approximately $7.1 million on December 31, 2023. The decommissioning cost estimate is required to be updated every three years. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of the Decommissioning Trust Fund was $9.4 million, excluding unrealized gains and losses. Based on the current decommissioning cost estimate and the value of the fund, SMUD’s existing Decommissioning Trust Fund provides sufficient funds to complete decommissioning and terminate the ISFSI license.

In addition to these costs, SMUD also estimates that it would cost approximately $13.1 million to restore the site to make it available for other SMUD uses with some major structures remaining intact. Site restoration is not a legal requirement. No site restoration is currently underway.

# EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

SMUD has approximately 2,334 employees, most of whom are covered by a civil service system. SMUD is a contracting member of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“PERS”). Approximately 50% of SMUD’s work-force is represented as to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment, by one of three recognized employee organizations, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”) Local 1245, the Organization of SMUD Employees (“OSE”), and the SMUD Public Safety Officers’ Association (“PSOA”). The remaining 50% of SMUD’s workforce, which includes managers, professional, administrative, supervisory, confidential and security staff, is unrepresented.

SMUD negotiated a four-year Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with IBEW and the OSE, effective January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2025. Both contracts contain a no-strike/no-lockout clause effective during the life of the agreements. SMUD has an MOU with PSOA effective through December 31, 2026. SMUD has experienced only one labor interruption, which occurred in January 1980 that lasted four days.

# RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POST-EMPLOYMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

## Pension Plans

SMUD participates in PERS, an agent multiple-employer public employee defined benefit pension plan. PERS provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. PERS acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating public entities within the State. Benefit provisions are established by State statute and SMUD policies. The pension plan provides retirement benefits, survivor benefits, and death and disability benefits based upon employees’ years of credited service, age, and final compensation.

As of June 30, 2022, the last actuarial valuation date for SMUD’s plan within PERS, the market value of the SMUD plan assets was $2.32 billion. The plan is 87.8% funded on a market value of assets basis, a decrease of 12.3% compared to the June 30, 2021 funded status based on the market value of assets.

As an employer, SMUD is required to contribute a percentage of payroll each year to PERS to fund SMUD’s plan based on actuarial valuations performed by PERS. PERS collects the normal cost based on a percentage of payroll and the unfunded liability portion is based on a dollar amount. SMUD also makes partial contributions required of SMUD employees on their behalf and for their account. At the PERS fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, SMUD’s required employer contribution rate for normal cost was 9.8% of payroll and the unfunded liability contribution was $22.4 million. During 2023, SMUD contributed $37.4 million to PERS (including SMUD’s contributions to cover required employee contributions), and SMUD employees paid $18.3 million for their share of the PERS contribution.

For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2025, SMUD is required to contribute 9.6% and 9.5% of payroll for normal costs and $10.7 million for fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 for the unfunded liability contribution. There is no estimated employer contribution to the unfunded liability for fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Assuming no amendments to the plan and no liability gains or losses (which can have a significant impact), PERS has projected that SMUD will be required to contribute 9.4% of payroll to the plan for normal costs and $15.7 million for the unfunded liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026, not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions. The amount SMUD is required to contribute to PERS is expected to increase in the future. The actual amount of such increases
<!-- Page 213 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+not+displayed)

SMUD has the option to prepay an annual lump sum payment to PERS for the unfunded accrued liability portion only (not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions). SMUD made an annual lump sum prepayment of $19.5 million, and also voluntarily made an additional payment of $47.3 million, for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. SMUD was not required to make an annual lump sum prepayment and, to date, has not voluntarily made additional payments for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.

While SMUD has some ability to adjust the retirement benefits provided to its employees, PERS determines the actuarial methods and assumptions used with respect to assets administered by PERS (including the SMUD plan assets) and makes the investment decisions with respect to such assets. For a description of such actuarial methods and assumptions (including the smoothing conventions used by PERS when setting employer contribution rates) and investments, see the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS (SMUD’s plan is part of the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund of PERS) available on its website at www.calpers.ca.gov. SMUD cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information and neither the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS nor any other information contained on the PERS website is incorporated by reference in or part of this Official Statement. Actuarial assessments are “forward-looking” information that reflect the judgment of the fiduciaries of the pension plans, and are based upon a variety of assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be inaccurate or be changed in the future. Actuarial assessments will change with the future experience of the pension plans.

GASB issued Statement No. 68 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – An Amendment of GASB Statement No. 27” (“GASB No. 68”). The primary objective of GASB No. 68 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for pensions. Under GASB No. 68, SMUD is required to report the net pension asset or net pension liability (i.e., the difference between the total pension liability and the pension plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of investment gains and losses. GASB No. 68 separates financial reporting from funding requirements for pension plans. The pension liability as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is $259.0 million and $235.5 million, respectively.

SMUD provides its employees with two cash deferred compensation plans: one pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 401(k) (the “401(k) Plan”) and one pursuant to IRC Section 457 (the “457 Plan” and collectively, the “Plans”). The Plans are contributory plans in which SMUD’s employees contribute the funds. Each of SMUD’s eligible full-time or permanent part-time employees may participate in either or both Plans, and amounts contributed by employees are vested immediately. Such funds are held by a trustee in trust for the employees upon retirement from SMUD service and, accordingly, are not subject to the general claims of SMUD’s creditors. SMUD makes annual contributions to the 401(k) Plan on behalf of certain employees pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with both of its collective bargaining units. SMUD matches the non-represented employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to a set amount. SMUD also makes limited discretionary contributions to non-represented employees hired after January 1, 2013, which contributions fully vest after five years. Prior to 2022, SMUD did not match employee contributions, nor make contributions on behalf of its employees to the 457 Plan. Beginning in 2022, SMUD makes annual contributions to the 457 Plan on behalf of certain employees and matches employee contributions up to a set amount pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with one of its collective bargaining units. SMUD made contributions to both Plans of $6.9 million in 2023 and to the 401(k) Plan of $7.0 million in 2022. Participating employees made contributions into both Plans totaling $34.3 million in 2023 and $32.4 million in 2022.

# Other Post-Employment Benefits

SMUD provides post-employment healthcare benefits, in accordance with SMUD policy and negotiated agreements with employee representation groups in a single employer defined benefit plan, to all employees who retire from SMUD, and their dependents. SMUD also provides post-employment healthcare benefits to covered employees who are eligible for disability retirement. SMUD contributes the full cost of coverage for retirees hired before January 1, 1991, and a portion of the cost based on credited years of service for retirees hired after January 1, 1991. SMUD also contributes a portion of the costs of coverage for these retirees’ dependents. Retirees are required to contribute the portion that is not paid by SMUD. The benefits, benefit levels, retiree contributions and employer contributions are governed by SMUD and can be amended by SMUD through its personnel manual and union contracts.

SMUD’s post-employment health care benefits are funded through the PERS California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust (“CERBT”), an agent multiple-employer plan. The funding of a plan occurs when the following events take place: the employer makes payments of benefits directly to or on behalf of a retiree or beneficiary; the employer makes premium payments to an insurer; or the employer irrevocably transfers assets to a trust or other third party acting in the role of trustee, where the plan assets are dedicated to the sole purpose of the payments of the plan benefits, and creditors of the government do not have access to those assets.

SMUD has elected to contribute the normal costs to the CERBT but annually receive reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT. In 2024, SMUD’s contribution for the normal costs to CERBT is $10.6 million. In 2023, SMUD made a contribution to the CERBT for normal costs in the amount of $8.6 million. In 2022, SMUD decided to forgo making a contribution for the normal costs to the CERBT because there was a net OPEB asset as of December 31, 2021. SMUD made additional contributions to the trust. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD made healthcare benefit contributions by paying actual medical costs of $24.7 million and $24.5 million, respectively. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD received $24.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively, reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT.

At June 30, 2023 and 2022, SMUD estimated that the actuarially determined accumulated post-employment benefit obligation was approximately $403.6 and $381.7 million, respectively. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the plan was 92.3% and 97.9% funded, respectively.

SMUD’s actuary uses PERS economic and other assumptions as the basis for the calculation of the post-employment benefit obligation. The actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will vary substantially if such PERS assumptions, such as interest rate and life expectancy, among others, prove to be inaccurate or different than SMUD’s actual experience. Although SMUD believes that such assumptions and estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that any such assumptions will prove to be accurate, or that SMUD’s actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will not materially exceed its estimates. Additional information is available in Note 15 (Other Postemployment Benefits) and “Required Supplementary Information” to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

GASB previously issued SGAS No. 75 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions”. The primary objective of GASB No. 75 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for post-employment benefits other than pensions (“OPEB”). Under GASB No. 75, SMUD is required to report the net OPEB asset or net OPEB liability (i.e., the difference between the total OPEB liability and the OPEB plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of

![Estimated Capital Requirements](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Estimated+Capital+Requirements)

**CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS**

**Estimated Capital Requirements**

SMUD has a projected capital requirement of approximately $2.8 billion for the period 2024 through 2028 as shown in the table below. Approximately 60% of this requirement is anticipated to be funded with internally generated funds and cash on hand.

Special projects include costs relating to construction of large substations and the construction of Solano Phase 4. The Estimated Capital Requirements table below includes $51 million for Solano Phase 4. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Solano 4 Project.”

**Outstanding Indebtedness**

**General.** SMUD typically finances its capital requirements through the sale of revenue bonds, the sale of commercial paper, from draws on its Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and from internally generated funds. With the enactment of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and the 2024 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, SMUD is monitoring and exploring new methods of financing, including those afforded under these two federal laws, that provide not-for-profit public power utilities with direct federal incentive payments.

SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Senior Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 (the “Senior Resolution”) adopted in 1971, as amended and supplemented (the “Senior Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Senior Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $1,783,965,000 outstanding. The Senior Bonds are payable solely from the Net Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Senior Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of “Maintenance and Operation Costs” and “Energy Payments” as defined in the Senior Resolution, including payments by SMUD to TANC under PA3, payments by SMUD under power purchase agreements related to the Authorities and payments by SMUD to NCGA and NCEA under their respective gas supply contracts. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD’s Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Subordinated Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 85-11-1 of SMUD, adopted on November 7, 1985, as amended and supplemented (the “Subordinated Resolution”).
<!-- Page 216 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

“Subordinate Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Subordinated Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $332,020,000 outstanding. The Subordinated Bonds are payable solely from the Net Subordinated Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Subordinated Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds.

SMUD issues commercial paper notes (the “Notes”) from time to time. As of March 21, 2024, SMUD’s Notes were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000. Currently, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 may be outstanding at any one time, but SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be outstanding at any one time in the future. The Notes are secured by letters of credit issued by commercial banks. The Notes (and SMUD’s obligations to repay drawings under the letters of credit) are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. Drawings under the letters of credit, to the extent not repaid immediately from the proceeds of commercial paper or other available SMUD funds, are repayable with interest over a period of five years. The letters of credit currently expire in August of 2025 and March of 2027. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD also entered into a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank and issued its taxable and tax-exempt revolving notes thereunder (collectively, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in February 2022. As of December 31, 2023, no principal amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Currently, the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at any one time is limited to $100,000,000. However, SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the Revolving Credit Facility from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. The current term of the Revolving Credit Facility expires in February 2026.

Joint Powers Authorities. SMUD has entered into long-term take-or-pay purchase agreements with SFA relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Under such agreements, SMUD has exclusive control of the dispatch of all five of the Local Gas-Fired Plants and takes all of the power produced by the Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” The Authorities are each treated as component units of SMUD for accounting purposes. Only SFA has outstanding debt, which relates solely to the Cosumnes Power Plant and is payable solely from capacity payments made by SMUD under the related power purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2023, bonds issued by SFA to finance the Cosumnes Power Plant were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $87,890,000. SMUD’s payments under the power purchase agreements relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal of and interest on the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and Subordinate Resolution.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCGA as a joint powers authority. NCGA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCGA issued $757,055,000 in bonds in May 2007 for the purpose of paying Morgan Stanley Capital Group in advance for natural gas to be delivered to NCGA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas supplies delivered by NCGA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the
<!-- Page 217 -->
![NCGA bonds](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=NCGA+bonds)

NCGA bonds. As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $120,070,000 remain outstanding.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCEA as a joint powers authority. NCEA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCEA issued $539,615,000 in bonds in December 2018 for the purpose of paying J. Aron & Company LLC in advance for natural gas or electricity to be delivered to NCEA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas or electricity supplies delivered by NCEA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the NCEA bonds. [As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $537,295,000 remain outstanding. As described in the forepart of this Official Statement, the bonds issued by NCEA in 2018 are expected to be refunded with proceeds of the Bonds (as defined in the forepart of this Official Statement.)] [to be revised for 2024 Senior Bond offering documents]

**Interest Rate Swap Agreements.** SMUD has two interest rate swap agreements relating to previously or currently outstanding Subordinated Bonds, as shown in the following table. For more information, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

| Effective Date | Termination Date | SMUD Pays | SMUD Receives | Notional Amount (000's) | Counterparty |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 7/2/1997       | 7/1/2024         | Floating  | SIFMA          | 5.154%                  | $19,570      | J Aron & Company LLC |
| 07/12/2023     | 08/15/2041       | Fixed     | 0.718%         | [70% of 1M SOFR]       | 132,020      | Barclays Bank |

The obligations of SMUD under the swap agreements are not secured by a pledge of revenues of SMUD’s electric system or any other property of SMUD. SMUD does not currently have any collateral posting requirements with respect to the interest rate swap agreements, but SMUD may be required to post collateral under certain circumstances.

**Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments.** SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds, 2009 Series V (the “2009 Series V Bonds”) and Electric Revenue Bonds, 2010 Series W (the “2010 Series W Bonds”) were issued as “Build America Bonds” under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. At the time the 2009 Series V Bonds and 2010 Series W Bonds were issued, SMUD expected to receive an annual cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury equal to 35% of the interest payable on the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. However, as a result of the federal budget process, many payments from the federal government, including Build America Bonds subsidy payments, have been reduced. Absent the federal budget reductions, the aggregate annual cash subsidy payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds would be approximately $9.8 million. With the current federal budget reductions, SMUD has typically been receiving aggregate annual cash subsidy payments with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds of approximately $9.2 million. It is possible that future federal budget actions could further reduce, or eliminate entirely, the annual cash subsidy payments with respect to Build America Bonds, including the annual cash subsidy payments payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. SMUD cannot predict the likelihood of the further reduction or elimination of the Build America Bonds subsidy payments. A significant reduction or elimination of the cash subsidy.

# INSURANCE

SMUD maintains a comprehensive property/casualty insurance program designed to protect against catastrophic losses that would have an adverse effect on its financial position or operational capabilities. Insurance programs are continuously reviewed and modified when construction, operational exposures, or developments in the insurance industry so warrant. Long-term relationships with a variety of insurers minimize SMUD’s susceptibility to the effects of market cycles. SMUD budgets reserves to meet potential insurance deductibles and self-insured liability claims.

SMUD safeguards assets with all-risk property and boiler/machinery insurance with limits of $800 million per occurrence for physical damage and business interruption combined. Various coverage sublimits and deductibles apply to losses arising from certain perils, such as business interruption, earthquake, or flood, respectively. Liability insurance is in effect to defend and indemnify SMUD against third party claims, including general, automobile and sudden and accidental pollution claims with policy limits of $140 million, and wildfire coverage with policy limits of $275 million, all of which include a variety of self-insured retentions.

Nuclear property and liability insurance policies are maintained in accordance with the NRC’s requirements for decommissioned nuclear plants that maintain dry storage of spent fuel on-site. This includes $100 million in first party property damage and decontamination, $100 million for nuclear liability arising from accidents on-site, $200 million for supplier’s and transporter’s nuclear liability, and $300 million for nuclear worker liability. SMUD is exposed to possible retrospective assessments for nuclear property events occurring at other nuclear facilities in the United States capped at ten times SMUD’s annual nuclear property premium (currently the maximum retrospective assessment is approximately $1,000,000).

Other types of insurance include non-owned aircraft liability, workers’ compensation, crime, cyber security, fidelity, fiduciary liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, professional errors and omissions, transportation, and builder’s risk for major facilities under construction.

# LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

SMUD is a party to numerous actions arising out of the conduct of its business and affairs, some of which are discussed below. SMUD believes that any losses or adverse financial results it may suffer in these current actions, to the extent not covered by insurance, would not, in the aggregate, have an adverse material impact on SMUD, its business and affairs, or results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

## Environmental Litigation

SMUD was one of many potentially responsible parties that had been named in a number of actions relating to environmental claims and/or complaints. SMUD has resolved these environmental claims and/or complaints and entered into settlement agreements and/or consent orders. These settlement agreements and consent orders have statutory reopener provisions which allow regulatory agencies to seek additional funds for environmental remediation under certain limited circumstances. While SMUD believes it is unlikely that any of the prior settlements or consent orders will be reopened, the possibility exists. If any of the settlements or consent orders were to be reopened, SMUD believes that the outcome will not have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

## Proposition 26 Lawsuit

In October 2019, two SMUD customers jointly filed a complaint against SMUD (subsequently one of the customers removed themselves from the complaint), which stated that SMUD’s Board violated

A-60
<!-- Page 220 -->
![Proposition 26](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Proposition+26)

**Proposition 26** (see “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Proposition 26” for a description of Proposition 26) when on June 24, 2019, it adopted rate increases for 2020 and 2021. The plaintiff contended the rates did not reflect SMUD’s reasonable cost of service because they included a 9.2% scalar that SMUD applies to its TOD residential rate restructure adopted by SMUD’s Board in the 2017 rate process. SMUD viewed the lawsuit as having little merit and while SMUD anticipated the court would rule in SMUD’s favor on substantive grounds, the plaintiff in early 2024 agreed to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice due to their failure to diligently prosecute the case. On January 16, 2024, the court approved the dismissal.

On January 19, 2024, the same plaintiff, along with a second SMUD residential customer, jointly filed a new complaint challenging the September 21, 2023, SMUD Board adoption of 2024 and 2025 rate increases. The plaintiffs make a similar claim regarding the TOD scalar as the prior lawsuit. Given the little merit behind the lawsuit, SMUD believes the court will rule in its favor. However, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the case or, if to the extent SMUD ultimately is not successful in the litigation, what remedies against SMUD may be available. SMUD believes that if it is not successful in the litigation, and to the extent the outcome would have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, the Board would make appropriate rate modifications based on an evidentiary record consistent with guidance from a judicial decision in the case.

**Other Litigation Matters**

Currently, SMUD is party to various claims, legal actions and complaints relating to its operations, including, but not limited to, property damage, personal injury, contract disputes, and employment matters. SMUD believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

**FERC Administrative Proceedings**

SMUD is involved in a number of FERC administrative proceedings related to the operation of wholesale energy markets, regional transmission planning, gas transportation and NERC reliability standards. These proceedings generally fall into the following categories: (i) filings initiated by the CAISO (or other market participants) to adopt/modify the CAISO Tariff and/or establish market design and behavior rules; (ii) filings initiated by existing transmission owners (i.e., PG&E and the other IOUs) to pass-through costs to their existing wholesale transmission customers; (iii) filings initiated by FERC to market participants to establish market design and behavior rules or investigate market behavior by certain market participants; (iv) filings initiated by transmission owners under their transmission owner tariffs to establish a regional transmission planning process; (v) filings initiated by providers of firm gas transportation services under the Natural Gas Act; and (vi) filings initiated by NERC to develop reliability standards applicable to owners, users, and operators of the bulk electric system. In addition, SMUD is an active participant in other FERC administrative proceedings, including those related to reliability, variable resource integration and the changing resource mix, and transmission planning and cost allocation. SMUD believes that determinations of these FERC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

**CPUC Administrative Proceedings**

Periodically, PG&E seeks to update its gas transmission and storage (“GT&S”) revenue requirements and rate designs. These applications are litigated at the CPUC and affect SMUD through several tariff rates SMUD pays to move natural gas along PG&E’s backbone transmission lines. In the 2019 GT&S rate case (the “2019 GT&S Case”), the CPUC affirmed the application in GT&S rates of cost causation principles to prevent excessive and unreasonable costs being shifted to electric generator. 

A-61
<!-- Page 221 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

backbone customers like SMUD, either through proposed changes in PG&E’s natural gas storage strategy or through cost shifts within the electric generator customer class.

PG&E filed its 2023 General Rate Case (the “GRC”) in June 2021 which includes its gas transmission and storage revenue requirements. In September 2021, PG&E filed an application for approval of its Gas Cost Allocation and Rate Design Proposals (“CARD”). The CPUC issued a decision in the GRC in November 2023 authorizing PG&E’s revenue requirements for the four-year rate period of 2023-2026. SMUD is a party to the comprehensive all-party settlement agreement submitted to the CPUC for approval in June 2023 which, if approved, would resolve all open issues in the CARD proceeding. SMUD does not believe that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. SMUD will continue to actively participate in PG&E’s GRC and CARD proceedings to ensure that costs are fairly allocated to non-core customers, including electric generator backbone customers.

In the GRC, the CPUC directed PG&E to submit an application to revise its natural gas curtailment procedures “similar to the curtailment procedures of other large energy utilities”. SMUD will actively participate in this future proceeding.

Separately, SMUD continues to participate and monitor a proceeding at the CPUC concerning long-term gas system planning. At this point in these proceedings, SMUD does not anticipate that the resolution of such cases will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

SMUD monitors a number of other CPUC proceedings. These proceedings generally fall into three categories: (i) filings initiated by PG&E to adopt/modify its tariffs and/or rules; (ii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish market design and behavior rules or program rules affecting SMUD customers; and (iii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish electric and/or gas system safety design and maintenance rules. SMUD believes that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR

California Electric Market

In 1996, the State partially deregulated its electric energy market and the CAISO was established in 1998. Since the CAISO’s formation, the State has experienced episodes of higher and more volatile prices for natural gas and wholesale electricity. In reaction to such conditions, SMUD made significant changes to its business strategy to mitigate the impacts of the more volatile and unpredictable energy markets. Volatility in energy prices in the State are always a potential risk due to a variety of factors which affect both the supply and demand for electricity in the western United States. These factors include, but are not limited to, the implementation of the CAISO market design changes, insufficient generation resources, the increase in intermittent renewable energy resources, natural gas price volatility, fuel costs and availability, weather and natural disasters, transmission constraints and levels of hydroelectric generation within the region. While SMUD has taken a number of steps to mitigate its exposure to price volatility associated with these factors, this price volatility under extreme conditions may contribute to greater volatility in SMUD’s net revenues from the purchase and sale of electric energy and, therefore, could materially adversely affect the financial condition and liquidity of SMUD. For a discussion of SMUD’s current resource planning activities and risk management strategies, see “BUSINESS STRATEGY” above.

# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity continues to be a top priority for SMUD. Attacks or threats directed at critical electric or energy sector operations could damage or cause the shut-down of generation, transmission or distribution assets that are essential to SMUD’s ability to serve its customers, cause operational malfunctions and outages affecting SMUD’s electric system, and result in costly recovery and remediation efforts. The costs of security measures or of remedying breaches could be material.

SMUD participates in sharing and receiving information about cyber security threats in real-time through the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (“E-ISAC”), the central hub for such data to actively manage risk related to potential cyber intrusion. SMUD also participates in NERC’s development of mandatory, enforceable cyber security standards to address vulnerabilities in electric utility systems. SMUD also adopts voluntary measures suggested as best practices by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) in its national framework.

SMUD’s prudent response to this ever-changing threat requires constant monitoring and frequent updates to implement new regulatory requirements as they are developed. SMUD manages risk related to frequently changing regulatory requirements by participating in the development of standards at NERC and NIST and through active engagement in the cyber security policy dialogue in Congress.

# Physical Security

Physical security is a critical concern for electric utilities as they seek to protect their infrastructure from a range of threats. The electric utility infrastructure is complex and consists of multiple components, such as power plants, substations, transmission and distribution lines, and other facilities. SMUD employs a dedicated physical security team that is deployed 24/7 and allows SMUD to respond to emergent events in a safe, coordinated, efficient, and cohesive manner, protecting the lives of its employees, customers, community, properties and assets. SMUD has policies, processes and procedures in place that outline the access controls and restrictions for its properties. SMUD restricts access based on need as it determines, while adhering to applicable laws, regulations and standards such as NERC Reliability Standards and NRC regulations. SMUD also maintains a Utility Security Plan adopted by the Board representing SMUD’s compliance with the CPUC’s Safety and Enforcement Division six-step security plan process described in CPUC Decision 19-01-018.

During times of elevated, imminent threats, safety and/or security concerns, SMUD’s Security Operations team, under the direction of the Chief Financial Officer or delegate, reserves the right to deploy additional security measures, controls, and further restrict or limit access to its properties to increase its security posture.

SMUD operates a 24/7 security operations center which monitors and coordinates responses to situations reported by internal and external stakeholders, or which are detected by SMUD’s security technology. The technology includes access control, video surveillance, and various types of intrusion detection solutions. The security operations center is a central hub for initial contact for physical security calls from employees of suspicious events and initiates incident responses as needed.

# Federal Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings

## Energy Policy Act of 2005

On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct of 2005”) was signed into law. The law includes a number of energy-related provisions, including among other things limited FERC jurisdiction over interstate transmission assets of municipal utilities, cooperatives and federal utilities to order these entities to provide transmission services on rates and terms. 

A-63

**Federal Regulation of Transmission Access.** The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the “Energy Policy Act”) made fundamental changes in the federal regulation of the electric utility industry, particularly in the area of transmission access. The Energy Policy Act provided FERC with the authority to require a transmitting utility to provide transmission services at rates, charges, terms and conditions set by FERC. The purpose of these changes, in part, was to bring about increased competition in the electric utility industry. Under the Energy Policy Act, electric utilities owned by municipalities and other public agencies which own or operate electric power transmission facilities which are used for the sale of electric energy at wholesale are “transmitting utilities” subject to the requirements of the Energy Policy Act.

Since the Energy Policy Act, FERC has adopted a series of rules to implement competitive open access to transmission facilities and regional transmission planning. Order No. 888, issued in 1996, requires the provision of open access transmission services on a nondiscriminatory basis by all “jurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does not include municipal entities like SMUD) by requiring all such utilities to file OATTs. Order No. 888 also requires “nonjurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does include SMUD) that purchase transmission services from a jurisdictional utility under an open access tariff and that owns or controls transmission facilities to provide open access service to the jurisdictional utility under terms that are comparable to the service that the nonjurisdictional utility provides itself. Section 211A of the EPAct of 2005 authorizes, but does not require, FERC to direct transmission utilities to provide transmission services, including rates and terms and conditions, that are comparable to those under which the unregulated transmitting utility provides transmission services to itself that are not unduly discriminatory or preferential – often referred to as the reciprocity rule.

In Order 890, issued in 2007, FERC stated that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis and retain the current reciprocity provisions.

In 2011, FERC issued Order 1000, which among other things requires public utility (jurisdictional) transmission providers to participate in a regional transmission planning process that produces a regional transmission plan and that incorporates a regional and inter-regional cost allocation methodology. Similar to Order 890, FERC states that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis. However, in Order 1000, FERC appears to expand upon the current reciprocity provisions and states that it has the authority to allocate costs to beneficiaries of services provided by specific transmission facilities even in the absence of a contractual relationship between the owner of the transmission facilities and the identified beneficiary.

SMUD, individually, and through the Large Public Power Council (“LPPC”), appealed Order 1000, but in 2014 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected all of the arguments raised on appeal, upholding the entirety of Order 1000.

The jurisdictional members of WestConnect filed their proposed regional planning process and cost allocation methodology through a series of compliance filings at FERC. FERC accepted binding cost allocation for jurisdictional transmission providers of WestConnect and mandated that non-jurisdictional transmission providers (such as SMUD) identified as beneficiaries of a project have the ability to not accept the cost allocation. WestConnect’s Order 1000 planning process began with the 2016-2017 planning cycle.
<!-- Page 224 -->
However, in response to FERC’s WestConnect orders on compliance, El Paso Electric Company (“El Paso”), a jurisdictional transmission provider, petitioned to the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. El Paso contends that FERC’s WestConnect orders violate Order 1000’s cost causation principle because WestConnect’s binding cost allocation applies only to the jurisdictional transmission providers and thus forces jurisdictional transmission providers to subsidize projects benefiting non-jurisdictional transmission providers that opt-out of projects. The non-jurisdictional transmission providers agreed on a settlement with the jurisdictional transmission providers to resolve the matters on appeal in the 5th Circuit, but FERC ultimately did not accept the settlement. On August 2, 2023, the court reversed FERC’s orders implementing Order No. 1000 for WestConnect concerning cost allocation of regional transmission projects to non-jurisdictional transmission providers. The court found that the WestConnect orders are incompatible with Order No. 1000’s application of the cost causation principle to address free ridership. There is uncertainty at this time on the future of WestConnect’s regional planning process. FERC has not yet acted on its own in light of the Fifth Circuit’s decision, and it is uncertain whether it will act while it is working on an updated transmission planning and cost allocation proposal that could change the Order 1000 process (as further discussed below regarding the April 21, 2022 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking). It is also uncertain if and/or the extent to which the jurisdictional transmission providers in WestConnect will file revisions to the regional transmission planning provisions in their OATTs. In the meantime, the WestConnect planning has continued under the existing framework and SMUD, along with the other non-jurisdictional transmission providers, continue to participate in the WestConnect process. SMUD’s longstanding objective is to comply with open access requirements necessary to achieve reciprocity, including through participation in a regional planning process while binding itself to mandatory cost allocation. Thus, SMUD has an interest in continuing to explore options for participation in a regional transmission planning process if the WestConnect rules are modified to permit SMUD to reasonably participate consistent with its business and jurisdictional interests.

SMUD is unable to predict at this time the full impact that Order 1000, or the 5th Circuit’s August decision, will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the WestConnect process generally. However, WestConnect has conducted multiple planning cycles under its Order 1000 planning process and has not identified any project eligible for cost allocation. SMUD will continue to take any action necessary, including withdrawing from a cost allocation determination or planning region, and engaging in FERC proceedings, to ensure that it is not required to pay for transmission costs in the absence of an agreement or service relationship.

On April 21, 2022, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Building for the Future Through Electric Regional Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation and Generator Interconnection (the “NOPR”). The NOPR seeks input on proposals that would impact the Order 1000 planning and cost allocation process. SMUD has been engaged in the proceeding, providing input and helping draft comments with trade organizations, including LPPC. FERC has not issued any subsequent order. SMUD will continue to monitor and be engaged in any developments at FERC that impact the Order 1000 process and its regional transmission planning participation.

NERC Reliability Standards. The EPAct of 2005 required FERC to certify an electric reliability organization (“ERO”) to develop mandatory and enforceable reliability standards, subject to FERC review and approval. On February 3, 2006, FERC issued Order 672, which certified NERC as the ERO. Many reliability standards have since been approved by FERC, including those aimed at protecting the bulk electric system from physical and cyber threats.

The ERO or the regional entities, such as WECC, may enforce the reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight or FERC may independently enforce reliability standards. Potential monetary sanctions include fines of up to $1,544,521 per violation per day. Order 693 provides ERO and regional entities with 

A-65
<!-- Page 225 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

the discretion necessary to assess penalties for such violations, while also having discretion to calculate a penalty without collecting the penalty if circumstances warrant.

**Anti-Market Manipulation Rules.** EPAct of 2005 gave FERC the authority to issue rules to prevent market manipulation in jurisdictional wholesale power and gas markets, and in jurisdictional transmission and transportation services. These anti-market manipulation rules apply to non-jurisdictional entities such as SMUD. Further, EPAct of 2005 provided FERC civil penalty authority, which the Commission has stated that it will exercise carefully by assuring that its market manipulation rules are clear.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions.** Since 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions from different sources, including from the electric sector.

In 2014, EPA issued a proposed rule under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) called the Clean Power Plan (the “CPP”) that projected power sector emissions reductions of 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The proposed CPP would have established a rate-based emissions goal for each state, providing states the responsibility to develop a State Implementation Plan (“SIP”) describing how each will meet the goal assigned by EPA using the “Best System of Emissions Reduction” (“BSER”) established by EPA. The rule was finalized in October 2015.

In November 2015, 27 states and numerous corporations challenged the CPP in court, alleging that EPA had exceeded its authority under the CAA; however, before the issue could be decided by the court, the 2016 presidential election resulted in a change of administration. The new administration quickly moved for an abeyance (or stay) of the case for as long as the agency needed to review and withdraw the CPP. The U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP pending disposition in the D.C. Circuit and any subsequent review by the Supreme Court. In August 2018, EPA proceeded to withdraw the CPP and the D.C. Circuit ultimately dismissed the case on September 17, 2019. EPA proposed a different rule under the same provision of the CAA, known as the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, which would have established a BSER that only includes measures that can be undertaken at an individual power plant, rather than the broader suite of measures envisioned under the CPP. The ACE rule was challenged in court by environmental groups and states alleging that the revised rule inadequately responds to EPA’s responsibility to protect public health and welfare. SMUD joined in this litigation along with other challengers. The D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule on January 19, 2021, and remanded it to the EPA for review and revision, just days before a new presidential administration took office. Several states led by West Virginia and coal industry members appealed the decision.

In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in West Virginia v. EPA, striking down the CPP and foreclosing any future regulations of “significant political and economic significance” if Congress has not expressly authorized them. While the decision does not restrict EPA to only requiring measures “inside the fence line” at an individual power plant to control GHGs, it appears unlikely that the EPA will be able to require material reductions in GHGs to mitigate climate change through section 111(d) of the CAA.

Under the new presidential administration, in May 2023, the EPA issued a proposed rule under Section 111(d) of the CAA to reduce GHG emissions from existing and new power plants. The four-part proposed rule, **New Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Existing Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; and Repeal of the Affordable Clean Energy Rule**, would set both GHG emission standards for certain subcategories of new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants operating greater than 50% of the time and generating more than 300 MW per turbine. In the proposed rule, EPA determined the BSER is either deploying carbon capture and storage

technology to capture 90% of emissions or co-firing 96% hydrogen produced through a low-emission process (“low-GHG hydrogen”). If finalized, compliance is required by 2032. SMUD has filed comments as part of several trade groups and coalitions in response to the proposed rule. SMUD’s internal analysis shows the rule as proposed would not require changes at any of its currently-operating fossil-fueled power plants and therefore will not have a material impact on SMUD’s financial position, operations, or liquidity.

**Federal Communications Commission**

The 1978 Pole Attachment Act added section 224 to the Communications Act of 1934, authorizing the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) to regulate attachments by cable television systems or providers of telecommunications service to utility poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way. Under Section 224(a)(1), public power entities are exempt from FCC pole attachment regulations, as municipally-owned poles are already subject to local decision-making processes and governance. The municipal exemption from FCC pole attachment regulations was further codified through the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. However, over the past decade, this exemption has been continuously eroded.

Various actions by the FCC have limited the exemption in support of a “uniform policy for broadband access to privately-owned physical infrastructure.” Through four orders issued between 2017 and 2018, the FCC set strict time limits for the review of pole attachment applications and preempted state and local agreements on pole attachments. In 2020, in *City of Portland v. United States*, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the FCC’s Small Cell Order, which adopted new time limits for municipal utilities’ review of wireless infrastructure siting applications and preempted access for small cell installations. In November 2023, the FCC adopted its Fourth Report and Order, Declaratory Ruling, and Third Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which established new rules and the fast-track approval process for pole attachment applications, among other things. SMUD will monitor this proceeding for any potential impact to SMUD.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new FCC rulemakings will impact the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system.

**Federal Clean Energy Legislation.** SMUD actively participates in discussion at the federal level regarding legislation that would meaningfully impact SMUD’s existing GHG reduction strategies or impose new requirements for electric generators, including a proposed federal clean energy standard. In the 117th Congress, a clean electricity performance program was considered but ultimately lacked support to pass. Instead, Congress extended and expanded clean energy tax credits and created new grant and rebate programs to incentivize clean energy investments in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While it is possible that a future Congress may revisit the concept of a clean energy standard or other GHG reduction regime, it is possible that the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will diminish the likelihood of a new regulatory framework being enacted in the near future.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new EPA rulemakings will be undertaken, and what the full impact of the reduction of fossil-based generation over time will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the electric utility industry generally.

**State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings**

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills provide for reduced GHG emission standards and greater investment in energy efficient and environmentally friendly generation alternatives through more stringent RPS. Additionally, ongoing regulatory proceedings address the implementation of these bills as well as water flow and quality.

![Greenhouse Gas Emissions Summary](https://example.com/image.png)

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**  
On September 27, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (“AB 32”). AB 32 requires the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) to adopt enforceable GHG emission limits and emission reduction measures in order to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In addition, AB 32 establishes a mandatory reporting program for all IOUs, local, publicly-owned electric utilities and other load-serving entities (electric utilities providing energy to end-use customers) (“LSEs”). The AB 32 reporting program allows CARB to adopt regulations using market-based compliance mechanisms such as a “cap-and-trade” system.

On December 16, 2010, CARB approved a resolution adopting cap-and-trade regulations for the State. The regulations became effective on January 1, 2012. As adopted, the cap-and-trade program covers sources accounting for 85% of the State’s GHG emissions, the largest program of its type in the United States. In November of 2012, CARB conducted its first allowance auction and auctions now occur on a quarterly schedule.

The cap-and-trade program introduced a hard emissions cap that declines over time on the combined electric utility and large industrial sectors, covering all sources emitting more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases (“CO2e”) per year, and was subsequently expanded to cover distributors of transportation, natural gas, and other fossil fuels. The cap-and-trade program requires covered entities to retire compliance instruments (allowances and carbon offsets) for each metric ton of CO2e they emit. CARB has allocated allowances to LSEs to mitigate the compliance cost burden on ratepayers. The value of allowances must be used to benefit ratepayers and achieve GHG emission purposes (not exceeding 8% of a regulated entity’s compliance obligation through 2020, 4% from 2021 through 2025, and 6% from 2026 through 2030). Offsets must be obtained from certified projects in sectors that are not regulated under the cap-and-trade program and are subject to other restrictions.

The State's cap-and-trade program was briefly linked to companion program in the Canadian province of Ontario during 2018 but was de-linked following a political change. In 2021, the Washington state legislature passed a cap-and-trade bill, which is expected to interact with the State’s markets. Future potential near-term links to the CARB cap-and-trade program also include the states of Oregon, which has adopted a cap-and-trade program, and New Mexico, which is considering the adoption of a cap-and-trade program.

On October 7, 2015, SB 350 was enacted, containing aggressive goals for reducing carbon emissions by 2030, including raising the proportion of renewable energy to 50%, reducing the use of petroleum fuel in cars and trucks by up to 50%, and doubling the energy efficiency of existing buildings. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” for additional information. In addition, SB 350 established requirements for larger POUs to adopt and file with the CEC Integrated Resource Plans (“IRPs”) by April 2019 that should planned procurement to achieve the 50% RPS and State GHG goals established by CARB. The CEC developed “guidelines” for these IRPs for POUs in 2017, updated them in 2018, and proposed additional updates in 2022. CARB established specific GHG target ranges for these IRPs in summer 2018, which were revised in 2023 following the adoption of CARB’s 2022 Scoping Plan. SMUD developed and adopted an IRP in 2018 through a comprehensive public process and filed the adopted IRP with the CEC in April 2019. SMUD adopted an updated IRP in June 2022 and filed the updated IRP with the CEC in September 2022, but the CEC has not yet completed its review of SMUD’s 2022 IRP. SMUD’s updated IRP plans for a greater than 92% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 relative to 1990 levels, which equals approximately

250,000 metric tons of GHG emissions in 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change.”

On April 29, 2015, the Governor of the State signed Executive Order B-30-15, establishing a goal for the State to reduce GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2016, the State Legislature passed Senate Bill 32 (“SB 32”), which codified then-Governor Brown’s goal of reducing the State’s GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2017, the State Legislature passed Assembly Bill 398 (“AB 398”), explicitly authorizing the continuation of the cap-and-trade program, with designated changes, through 2030. Subsequently, CARB adopted an initial set of regulatory changes extending the cap-and-trade program, including establishing utility sector allowance allocations through 2030. In 2018, CARB completed a rulemaking to implement the cap-and-trade program changes designated by AB 398. These changes include development of a hard price ceiling for the cap-and-trade program and two price-containment points below that ceiling, in an attempt to ensure stable prices in the program. CARB adopted final regulations on December 13, 2018.

In addition, any new projects constructed in the State, including power plants, that may cause a significant adverse impact on the environment must be analyzed under CEQA. Some State agencies have begun using CEQA in novel ways to require mitigation of “significant” GHG emissions caused, either directly or indirectly, by a project. Pursuant to Senate Bill 97 passed in 2007, CARB will assist the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research in setting thresholds of significance under CEQA of GHG impacts from new projects. This is an area of State law that is evolving and unsettled in the courts. However, there is a risk that any project proponent of an electric system infrastructure project might have to mitigate such potential impacts to a level of less than significant.

On December 3, 2012, the Superior Court issued a ruling in Environmental Defense Fund v. San Diego Association of Governments (“SANDAG”), Case No. 2100-00101593, that sided with the State Attorney General and the other petitioners stating that SANDAG did not follow CEQA when it adopted a $257 billion regional transportation plan in 2011. The ruling expressly invalidated the certification of the Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) on the grounds that the EIR should have analyzed the plan’s consistency with the governor’s policy goal to reduce GHG emissions by 80% by 2050 as articulated in the 2005 Executive Order S-03-05. On November 24, 2014, the Fourth Appellate District upheld the trial court in a published decision, and SANDAG appealed to the State Supreme Court. On July 13, 2017, the Supreme Court reversed and held that SANDAG’s decision to not adopt the 2050 goal was not an abuse of discretion. Nevertheless, the Court articulated three clear principles for agencies to follow in their CEQA review of planning documents: 1) agencies must take seriously the significance of even small increases in GHG emissions; 2) they must consider science-based State policy guidance in their decision-making; and 3) they are required to use the best scientific information available to determine whether their planning decisions are consistent with the State’s goals. These principles will apply to SMUD in CEQA reviews of future projects.

On September 29, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law Senate Bill 1368 (“SB 1368”), the GHG Emissions Performance Standard (“EPS”). SB 1368 limits long-term investments in baseload generation by the State’s utilities to power plants that meet an EPS jointly established by the CEC and the CPUC. The agencies have set the EPS at 1,100 pounds CO2 per MWh, which is roughly half of the CO2 emissions rate of a conventional coal-fired power plant. CEC regulations to implement the law for POUs were approved by the Office of Administrative Law on October 16, 2007.

SMUD’s primary supply and demand-side resources need to meet customers’ electric usage patterns over the next 10 years. Currently there is a ban in the State that prohibits the development of nuclear power plants until there is a permanent storage solution for spent fuel rods. With the effective ban on new coal power imports under SB 1368, natural gas-fired, combined cycle power plants would appear

A-69
<!-- Page 229 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

to be the primary viable option for fossil fuel-based baseload power plant development absent the implementation of new technologies in connection with other resource options. The reliance on a single fuel source will continue to put pressure on the natural gas market in the United States. SMUD has in place a natural gas procurement plan to mitigate natural gas volatility, see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply” above.

On September 16, 2022, the Governor of the State signed into law SB 1020, which creates interim climate targets under which eligible renewable energy resources and zero-carbon resources must supply 90% of all retail sales of electricity to California end-use customers by December 31, 2035, and 95% by December 31, 2040. The bill also requires each State agency to ensure that zero carbon resources and eligible renewable energy resources supply 100% of electricity procured on its behalf by December 31, 2035. SMUD provides electricity to a number of State agency buildings and will work with State agencies to comply with this requirement.

On October 7, 2023, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 1305, which requires an entity that purchases or uses voluntary carbon offsets and makes claims regarding the achievement of net zero, or other similar claims, to disclose on their website specified information. Many stakeholder groups are raising questions on if this includes RECs. Clean-up legislation could follow. It is not clear at this time whether RECs are included.

Reliability. On June 30, 2022, the Governor signed the 2022-23 budget, along with a number of trailer bills, which provide implementing details on the budget line items. Included in AB 205, the energy trailer bill, are a number of reliability programs.

1. CEC Distributed Electricity Backup Assets Program to incentivize the construction of cleaner and more efficient distributed energy assets that would serve as on-call emergency supply or load reduction for the state’s electrical grid during extreme events. The CEC adopted program guidelines in October 2023 and issued the first solicitation in December 2023.

2. CEC Demand Side Grid Support Program to pay customers to reduce demand during stressed grid events. SMUD has actively engaged the CEC on the development and subsequent revision of program guidelines. The CEC is expected to revise the guidelines again for summer 2024.

3. DWR Strategic Reliability Reserve to secure resources for summer reliability or to preserve the option to extend the life of facilities that otherwise would retire, new temporary generators of more than five MW, new energy storage systems of at least 20 MW, generation facilities that use clean, zero-emission fuel technologies, or new zero-emission technologies that can be operational by December 31, 2026.

As a follow up to this legislation, the Governor signed into law AB 1373. The bill authorizes the CEC to annually assess a capacity payment on a POU within the CAISO balancing authority area during a month in which the POU fails to meet its minimum planning reserve margin. This does not include SMUD, who is within the BANC balancing authority area. SMUD is, however, required to submit to the CEC an assessment of whether it exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin and system resource adequacy requirements. This bill also allows the DWR, for certain types of long-development projects, to act as a central procurement entity. For POUs, participation in the DWR program would be optional.

Zero-Emission Fleet Mandates. CARB has adopted the Advanced Clean Fleets (“ACF”) regulation, requiring certain medium- and heavy-duty (“MHD”) vehicle fleets to transition to zero-emission vehicles through purchase requirements or fleet composition requirements, which took effect on November

A-70
<!-- Page 230 -->
1, 2023, and applies to all publicly owned MHD fleets, larger commercially owned MHD fleets, and drayage trucks. Under the ACF Rule, public fleets like SMUD have two compliance options. The first is a zero-emission vehicle (“ZEV”) purchase requirement, under which 50% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2024, and 100% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2027. The second is an optional ZEV milestone option, under which the composition of the MHD fleet would need to meet certain ZEV percentages starting in 2025, with the entire fleet transitioned no later than 2042. The individual milestones depend on the number and category of vehicles in the fleet. Public fleets may opt into the ZEV milestone option until January 1, 2030. In 2024, SMUD plans to comply with the purchase requirement option, meaning that 50% of the MHD vehicles purchased in 2024 will be ZEVs. SMUD plans to monitor ZEV market developments and currently expects to opt into the ZEV milestone option as more ZEVs become available. The ACF Rule also accelerates a manufacturer ZEV sales requirement to 100% of all MHD truck sales by the 2036 model year.

CARB proposed the Zero-Emission Forklift regulation in November 2023. The regulation would require forklift fleets to transition spark-ignited forklifts to zero-emission technology starting in 2026. The regulation would apply to SMUD, as a forklift operator. Since SMUD has a limited number of forklifts, this regulation is not expected to have a material effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operation.

Transportation and Building Electrification. In recent years, the State has identified transportation and building electrification as key strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, and is advancing policy to support or accelerate electrification. For example, in addition to the zero-emission fleet mandates and LCFS regulation discussed herein, CARB adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks regulations to require vehicle manufacturers to increase sales of zero-emission vehicles, respectively. The CEC’s Building Energy Efficiency Standards are also encouraging the use of electric heat pumps in new homes and certain non-residential buildings across the state. The draft 2025 Energy Standards, which are expected to be proposed by April 2024 and adopted by August 2024, would establish prescriptive heat pump requirements for both space and water heating in new homes, and may require existing homes to install a heat pump when replacing an air conditioner. The 2025 Energy Standards, if approved, would take effect on January 1, 2025. In addition, the State has also provided funding for programs to encourage clean transportation and building electrification.

Increases in transportation and building electrification will result in increased customer usage of electricity.

Renewables Portfolio Standard. Senate Bill 100 was passed by the Legislature and approved by Governor Brown on September 10, 2018. Among other requirements, the bill sets a 50% RPS target for 2026 and sets compliance period targets at 44% by December 31, 2024, 52% by December 31, 2027, and 60% by December 31, 2030. The bill also creates a statewide planning goal to meet all of the state’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045.

Sacramento-San Joaquin River Bay-Delta Processes. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is an expansive inland estuary, formed at the western edge of the California Central Valley by the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers (“Delta”). There are two substantial Delta planning processes with the potential to affect (1) energy available for SMUD’s purchase from the Central Valley Project (“CVP”) and (2) flows within the Upper American River watershed. These processes are called the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan (“Bay-Delta Plan”) and the Delta Conveyance Project.

The Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan is updated periodically by the State Water Resources Control Board (“SWRCB”), the last time being in 2006. The current Bay-Delta Plan update process is being implemented in four phases. The first phase considered southern Delta water quality, with a

A-71
<!-- Page 231 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+not+available)  
significant focus on San Joaquin River tributaries. Phase 2, which is initially being addressed by a document under development by SWRCB staff, will address Sacramento River tributaries and various flow related issues, including the critically important one of those tributaries’ contribution to Delta outflow. Phase 3 will concern changes to water rights needed to implement Phase 2. A substantial change in Delta outflow requirements could have a major impact on the timing of hydroelectric energy generation by the CVP. SMUD has a long-term agreement with WAPA to purchase some of this power (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration”). On July 18, 2018, the SWRCB released an updated Framework document signaling its staff’s intent to propose Delta outflow requirements of 45-65% unimpaired flows for the Sacramento River tributaries (which includes the American River, the upper portions of which are where the AQR sits), though the report will analyze requirements of 35-75%. If these criteria were implemented, they could cut CVP generation by 50 to 63%. Governor Newsom has urged the SWRCB, other agencies and affected parties to execute voluntary agreements (aka the “Healthy Rivers Agreements”) to address species’ needs and outflow requirements. Although the negotiations have been slow, it is expected they will eventually result in a reasonable compromise. However, in September 2023 the SWRCB released a Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document in Support of Potential Updates to the Bay-Delta Plan (the “Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document”) to justify the adoption of the unimpaired flow standard as set forth in the 2018 Framework document. Numerous public entities, including SMUD, filed comments stating that, among other things, the potential updates identified in the Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document, if adopted, would violate the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act and Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution, would not protect fish and wildlife, and would not reasonably protect all beneficial uses, including water supplies for millions of Californians and hydroelectric power generation that is essential to California’s resilient energy grid. Moreover, the comments filed also stated that the Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document has not complied with CEQA because, among other things, the analysis of the proposed information and hydroelectric power generation facilities, including the generally electrical grid reliability, is not supported by substantial evidence and fails to satisfy informational requirements. In addition, the comments maintain that the Healthy Rivers Agreements are a superior approach to achieving the goal of maximizing both environmental and other beneficial uses. If the unimpaired flow standard is adopted and the Healthy Rivers Agreements do not come to fruition, SMUD plans to fully participate in all regulatory and legal proceedings to argue for consideration and minimization of impacts to hydropower generation. SMUD will assess the potential impacts of proposed modifications to the present outflow obligations on SMUD’s operations once, or if, the SWRCB makes available information with enough specificity for SMUD to conduct the relevant modeling.

In July 2022, the DWR released a Draft Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) to evaluate the potential impacts of carrying out the Delta Conveyance Project; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a separate Environmental Impact Statement to evaluate the effects of the project pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. The Delta Conveyance Project is expected to entail construction of two intakes on the Sacramento River that will carry water to a main tunnel to the California Aqueduct for delivery south of the Delta. The Delta Conveyance Project may pose the potential to exacerbate impacts to already imperiled aquatic species, and in turn could have indirectly prompted regulatory agencies to require third parties, such as SMUD, to compensate by making changes to their operations. The Bureau of Reclamation is not a party to the Delta Conveyance Project, which should eliminate the potential for CVP power to be used to supply Delta Conveyance Project pumps. SMUD will monitor the proceedings and participate as necessary to ensure any impacts to SMUD interests are minimized, including potentially filing a challenge to the water rights DWR would need to modify in order to carry out the project.

Proposition 26. Proposition 26 was approved by the electorate on November 2, 2010 and amends Article XIII A and Article XIII C of the State Constitution. Proposition 26 imposes a two-thirds voter approval requirement for the imposition of fees and charges by the State, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. It also imposes a majority voter approval requirement on local governments with  
A-72

**A-73**

**respect to fees and charges for general purposes, and a two-thirds voter approval requirement with respect to fees and charges for special purposes, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. The initiative, according to its supporters, is intended to prevent the circumvention of tax limitations imposed by the voters pursuant to Proposition 13, approved in 1978, and other measures through the use of non-tax fees and charges. Proposition 26 expressly excludes from its scope a charge imposed for a specific local government service or product provided directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable cost to the local government of providing the service or product. Proposition 26 is not retroactive as applied to local governments. Although SMUD believes that the initiative was not intended to apply to fees for utility services such as those charged by SMUD and its fees and charges meet the criteria of the exclusion described above, it is possible that Proposition 26 could be interpreted to further limit fees and charges for electric utility services and/or require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes. SMUD is unable to predict at this time how Proposition 26 will be interpreted by the courts or what its ultimate impact will be. As of the date of this Official Statement, SMUD is unaware of any fees or charges relating to SMUD’s service that would have to be reduced or eliminated because of Proposition 26. However, certain of SMUD’s adopted rate increases have been challenged. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”**

**Initiative 1935.** A voter initiative entitled “The Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act” (“Initiative 1935”) has been determined to be eligible for the State’s November 2024 statewide general election and, unless withdrawn by its proponent prior to June 27, 2024, will be certified as qualified for the ballot in such election. Were it to be approved by a majority of voters in the election, Initiative 1935 would amend Article XIII C of the State Constitution to, among other things, provide that charges (or increases in charges) imposed or extended by a local government after January 1, 2022 for services or products provided directly to the payor (including, potentially, fees and charges for electric service or product) are “taxes” subject to voter approval unless the local government can provide convincing evidence that the charge is reasonable and does not exceed the “actual cost” of providing the service or product. Initiative 1935 defines “actual cost” as “(i) the minimum amount necessary to reimburse the government for the cost of providing the service or the product to the payor and (ii) where the amount charged is not used by the government for any purpose other than reimbursing that cost.” Initiative 1935 would also require that local governments impose fees and charges by ordinance (which may be subject to referendum). If adopted, Initiative 1935 would be subject to judicial interpretation. SMUD is unable to predict whether and how Initiative 1935, if approved, would be interpreted or applied, but it is possible any such interpretation or application could further limit future fees and charges or future increases in fees and charges for electric utility services, require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes and/or otherwise adversely impact SMUD and its revenues. In response to an emergency petition filed by Governor Gavin Newsom, with support from the League of California Cities and others, the California Supreme Court has unanimously agreed to decide whether the initiative should appear on the November 2024 ballot or be disqualified. A ruling is expected before June 30, 2024, which is the deadline for placing items on the November 2024 ballot. 

**On November 2, 2023, Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 13 (“ACA 13”) was filed with the Secretary of State and will be on the ballot for the November 2024 statewide general election. If approved by voters, ACA 13 would require any initiative constitutional amendment appearing on the ballot on or after January 1, 2024, that would increase the voter approval requirement to adopt any State or local measure to be approved by the highest voter approval requirement that the initiative measure would impose. In other words, if ACA 13 is approved by voters, its express terms appear to require Initiative 1935 to pass with a 2/3 vote, since Initiative 1935 would extend a 2/3 voter requirement to additional State and local fees and charges. If adopted, ACA 13 and its effect on the adoption of Initiative 1935, if applicable, are likely to be subject to judicial interpretation. SMUD is not able to predict whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would be interpreted or applied or whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would affect the adoption, interpretation or application of Initiative 1935, if adopted.**

![Wildfire Legislation](https://example.com/image-url)

**Wildfire Legislation.** In response to catastrophic wildfires in California, legislation was adopted and signed into law requiring POUs (including SMUD), IOUs, and electrical cooperatives to construct, maintain and operate their electrical lines and equipment in a manner that will minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire posed by electrical lines and equipment. Senate Bill 247 (“SB 247”), signed by Governor Newsom on October 2, 2019, establishes notification, audit and reporting guidelines for electrical corporations relating to vegetation management requirements in the wildfire mitigation plan. SB 247 also specifies the qualifications for electrical line clearance tree trimmers performing work to comply with the vegetation management requirements in an electrical corporation’s wildfire mitigation plan and requires that qualified line clearance tree trimmers be paid no less than a specified prevailing wage rate. POUs are not required to adhere to SB 247, but the market impacts are projected to significantly increase SMUD’s annual vegetation management costs.

**Nonstock Security.** SMUD sponsored legislation in 2019, Assembly Bill 689, which was signed into law by Governor Newsom on September 5, 2019. This bill expressly allows SMUD the ability to operate a pilot project (effective January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2025), of up to three acquisitions, to hold nonstock security in a corporation or other private entity if acquired as part of a procurement of goods or services from that entity, provided that no separate funding is expended solely for the nonstock security. This will allow SMUD to realize the financial benefits of its investments, partnerships, and intellectual property.

On September 15, 2022, the Board authorized the CEO & GM to enter into a joint collaboration agreement with ESS Tech, Inc. (“ESS”). Under that agreement SMUD would procure from ESS in flow batteries for utility scale long-duration energy storage applications. The agreement contemplates a multi-year phased deployment of up to 200MW/2GWh of long duration energy storage by 2028. As part of this procurement, SMUD acquired nonstock security in ESS.

SMUD will be sponsoring legislation in 2024 to extend the authority granted by Assembly Bill 689 to future years.

**Future Regulation**

The electric industry is subject to continuing legislative and administrative reform. States and Federal entities routinely consider changes to the way in which they regulate the electric industry. Recently, both further deregulation and forms of additional regulation have been proposed for the industry, which has been highly regulated throughout its history. SMUD is unable to predict at this time the impact any such proposals will have on the operations and finances of SMUD or the electric utility industry generally.

**OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY**

**CAISO Market Initiatives**

The CAISO routinely conducts a number of initiatives and stakeholder processes that propose certain operational and market changes that impact SMUD. SMUD does and will continue to monitor the various initiatives proposed by the CAISO and participate in its stakeholder processes to ensure that its interests are protected.

SMUD participates in the CAISO market for only a small percentage of energy needs, however, it continues to benefit from its participation in the CAISO’s WEIM and is currently exploring further participation in the CAISO’s proposed Extended Day Ahead Market (“EDAM”) (both the WEIM and EDAM are described further below). Along with monitoring other key market initiatives at the CAISO which impact wholesale energy markets, SMUD will continue to actively participate in all processes related

A-74
<!-- Page 234 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

to EIM and EDAM, to ensure both participation models are beneficial to SMUD’s customers. Given its success in EIM and active engagement with the CAISO and CAISO leadership, SMUD has earned a key role in the stakeholder processes related to these important and evolving markets.

**Resource Adequacy Filing**

In September 2005, the State Legislature enacted and the Governor signed into law Assembly Bill 380 (“AB 380”), which requires the CPUC to establish resource adequacy requirements for all LSEs within the CPUC’s jurisdiction. SMUD is not an LSE subject to the CPUC’s jurisdiction. In 2005, the CPUC issued a decision requiring jurisdictional LSEs to demonstrate that they have acquired capacity sufficient to serve their forecast retail customer load plus a minimum 15% planning reserve margin. In June 2022, the CPUC issued a decision increasing the minimum planning reserve margin to 16% for 2023 and 17% for 2024. In June 2023, the CPUC kept the minimum planning reserve margin at 17% for 2024 and extended the 17% requirement for 2025.

AB 380 also required publicly owned utilities, including SMUD, to meet the most recent resource adequacy standard as adopted by the WECC. The WECC has yet to formally adopt a resource adequacy requirement. However, consistent with current WECC practices, SMUD utilizes a minimum 15% planning reserve margin when assessing the need for future resources. For summer 2023, SMUD attained a 17% planning reserve margin and will have at least a 17% planning reserve margin for summer 2024 as well.

In 2022, the State Legislature adopted Assembly Bill 209 (2022) (“AB 209”), which requires the CEC to develop recommendations about approaches to determining an appropriate planning reserve margin for local publicly owned utilities within the CAISO balancing authority area. The CEC has initiated a proceeding and plans to publish a report with a recommended methodology on summer 2024. The report will not directly impact SMUD since SMUD is not in the CAISO; nevertheless, SMUD is monitoring the proceeding. The State Legislature also passed Assembly Bill 1373 (2023) (“AB 1373”) that requires the CEC to submit a report to the Legislature that assesses whether each local publicly owned electric utility in California (both inside and outside the CAISO) exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin for 2023. The report must also assess whether local publicly owned utilities met the planning reserve margin for June through September 2023 established by the CPUC’s June 2022 decision (i.e., 16%). See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Reliability.”

While SMUD believes the CEC’s report will show SMUD met both its 15% planning reserve margin and the CPUC’s 16% planning reserve margin for 2023, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the report, or what the Legislature intends to do with the report. To the extent the CEC or Legislature imposes a higher POU planning reserve margin for future years that includes SMUD, the ultimate impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy/capacity, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers; however, such impacts could be material.

**Western Energy Imbalance Market and Extended Day Ahead Market**

Federal and state policymakers have long-promoted the development of organized markets in the west as a means (among other reasons) to better integrate intermittent renewable resources into the electric system, the first of which markets is the Western EIM, operated by the CAISO. The CAISO successfully launched the WEIM, a real time only imbalance market, on October 1, 2014, with PacifiCorp as the first participant. Since this time, the WEIM has grown significantly with the addition of 21 other Balancing

to sell to nongovernmental entities electricity from generation projects and transmission service from transmission line projects financed with tax exempt obligations; (i) effects of inflation on the operating and maintenance costs of an electric utility and its facilities; (j) changes from projected future load requirements; (k) increases in costs and uncertain availability of capital; (l) issues relating to supply chains and the uncertain availability or increased costs of necessary materials; (m) shifts in the availability and relative costs of different fuels (including the cost of natural gas); (n) sudden and dramatic increases in the price of energy purchased on the open market that may occur at times of high peak demand in an area of the country experiencing such high peak demand, such as has occurred in the State; (o) issues relating to risk management procedures and practices with respect to, among other things, the purchase and sale of natural gas, energy and transmission capacity; (p) other legislative changes, voter initiatives, referenda and statewide propositions; (q) effects of changes in the economy; (r) effects of possible manipulation of the electric markets; (s) natural disasters or other physical calamities, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, droughts, severe weather, wildfires and floods; (t) changes to the climate, including increasing volatility in rainfall in the Western United States and a reduction in the depth and duration of the Sierra snowpack; (u) issues relating to cyber-security; and (v) outbreaks of infectious diseases or the occurrence of pandemics. Any of these factors (as well as other factors) could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of any given electric utility, including SMUD’s electric utility, and likely will affect individual utilities in different ways.

SMUD is unable to predict what impact such factors will have on the business operations and financial condition of SMUD’s electric system, but the impact could be significant. SMUD has taken major steps to mitigate the impacts of many of the changes. This Official Statement includes a brief discussion of certain of these factors. This discussion does not purport to be comprehensive or definitive, and matters are subject to change subsequent to the date hereof. Extensive information on the electric utility industry is available from the legislative and regulatory sources and other sources in the public domain, and potential purchasers of any of SMUD’s Senior Bonds or Subordinated Bonds described in the forepart of this Official Statement should obtain and review such information.

## BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM

The information in this Appendix regarding DTC has been provided by DTC, and SMUD takes no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness thereof. SMUD cannot and does not give any assurances that DTC, DTC Participants or Indirect Participants will distribute the Beneficial Owners either (a) payments of interest or principal with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds or (b) certificates representing ownership interest in or other confirmation of ownership interest in the 2024 Series M Bonds, or that they will so do on a timely basis or that DTC, DTC Participants or DTC Indirect Participants will act in the manner described in this Official Statement.

The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the 2024 Series M Bonds. The 2024 Series M Bonds will be issued as fully registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully registered Bond certificate will be issued for each maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC.

DTC, the world’s largest depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 instruments from over 100 countries that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others, such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+. The DTC rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.

Purchases of the 2024 Series M Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the 2024 Series M Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each 2024 Series M Bond (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their beneficial ownership interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the 2024 Series M Bonds is discontinued.

SMUD may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, bond certificates for such 2024 Series M Bonds will be printed and delivered to DTC.

Neither SMUD or the Trustee will have any responsibility or obligation to Participants, to Indirect Participants or to any Beneficial Owner with respect to (i) the accuracy of any records maintained by DTC, any Participant, or any Indirect Participant; (ii) the payment by DTC or any Participant or Indirect Participant of any amount with respect to the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds; (iii) any notice which is permitted or required to be given to Holders under the Resolution; (iv) the selection by DTC, any Participant or any Indirect Participant of any person to receive payment in the event of a partial redemption of 2024 Series M Bonds; (v) any consent given or other action taken by DTC as Bondholder; or (vi) any other procedures or obligations of DTC, Participants or Indirect Participants under the book-entry system.

# APPENDIX D

## SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION

The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Resolution. Other provisions of the Resolution are described under the captions “THE 2024 SERIES M BONDS” and “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS.” This summary is not to be considered a full statement of the terms of the Resolution and accordingly is qualified by reference thereto and is subject to the full text thereof. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Official Statement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Resolution.

Between July 1997 and August 2003, SMUD received consents to amend the Resolution from the owners of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Bonds. Pursuant to the authority granted by such consents, SMUD amended the Resolution in October 2003 by adopting the Forty-Eighth Supplemental Resolution. The following summary of the Resolution reflects such amendments.

The purchasers of the 2024 Series M Bonds, by virtue of their purchase of the 2024 Series M Bonds, will consent to certain amendments to the Resolution (the “Proposed Amendments”). Such amendments are described in **bold italic** font in the forepart of this Official Statement under “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Rates and Charges” and “– Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues” and in this summary of the Resolution under the captions “Certain Definitions” and “Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds.” The written consents to the Proposed Amendments of the holders and registered owners of at least 60% of the Bonds outstanding have been filed with SMUD or the Trustee, as required by the Resolution. However, while certain Bonds remain outstanding SMUD must also obtain the written consents of the holders and registered owners of the Proposed Amendments to implement the Proposed Amendments when the written consents of such bond insurers are obtained if the Bonds insured by such bond insurers are no longer outstanding. The final maturity date of the insured Bonds is July 1, 2024.

### Certain Definitions

“**Assumed Interest Payments**” means for any fiscal year or period interest which would accrue during such fiscal year or period on an amount equal to the then unamortized balance of the remaining sum of Assumed Principal Payments at the Assumed Interest Rate.

“**Assumed Interest Rate**” for any Parity Bond means an interest rate equal to the “Bond Buyer Revenue Bond Index” most recently published in The Bond Buyer prior to the date of issuance of the Parity Bond to which the Assumed Interest Rate is applicable.

“**Assumed Principal Payments**” means for any fiscal year or period the sum of all amortized portions of each Excluded Principal Payment which fall within such fiscal year or period after the Excluded Principal Payments have been amortized (for purposes of this definition) equally over the years (pro rata in the case of a partial year) in the period commencing on the date of issuance of the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payment relates and ending on the date which is 30 years from such date of issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parity Bonds determined by SMUD to be an Excluded Principal Payment are refinanced with Parity Bonds determined by SMUD to be another Excluded Principal Payment, (1) Assumed Principal Payments with respect to the refinancing Parity Bonds shall not include any amount of principal which has previously been assumed amortized with respect to the refinanced Parity Bonds and (2) the period over which the refinancing Parity Bonds shall be assumed to be amortized shall be the period commencing on the date of issuance of the refinancing Parity Bonds and ending on the date which is 30 years from the date of issuance of the refinanced Parity Bonds.
<!-- Page 242 -->
**“Electric System”** means the entire electric system of SMUD, together with all additions, betterments, extensions and improvements.

**“Energy Payments”** means, when used with respect to the Electric System, all actual costs incurred, or charges made therefor, by SMUD in any particular fiscal year or period to which said term is applicable for purchased power (including power purchased from any special district included within the boundaries of SMUD), electric and thermal energy and capacity under contracts providing for payments by SMUD for electric or thermal energy or capacity whether or not such energy or capacity is delivered or capable of being delivered or otherwise made available to or received by or for the account of SMUD.

**“Excluded Principal Payments”** means each payment of principal on Parity Bonds which the Board of Directors of SMUD determines (on a date not later than the date of issuance of such Parity Bonds) that SMUD intends to refinance at or prior to the maturity date(s) of such Parity Bonds or otherwise to pay with moneys which are not Revenues. No such determination shall affect the security for such Parity Bonds or the obligation of SMUD to pay such payments from Revenues.

**“Financial Products Agreement”** means an interest rate swap, cap, collar, option, floor, forward or other hedging agreement, arrangement or security, however denominated, entered into by SMUD with a Qualified Provider not for investment purposes but with respect to specific Parity Bonds for the purpose of (1) reducing or otherwise managing SMUD’s risk of interest rate changes or (2) effectively converting SMUD’s interest rate exposure, in whole or in part, from a fixed rate exposure to a variable rate exposure, or from a variable rate exposure to a fixed rate exposure.

**“Financial Product Payments”** means amounts periodically required to be paid to a counterparty by SMUD pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement.

**“Financial Product Receipts”** means amounts periodically required to be paid to SMUD by a counterparty pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement.

**“Maintenance and Operation Costs”** means all actual maintenance and operation costs incurred by SMUD (including purchased power and fuel costs) or charges therefor made in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, exclusive in all cases of depreciation, or obsolescence charges or reserves therefor, amortization of intangibles or other entries of a similar nature, interest charges and charges for the payment of principal of SMUD debt.

**“Net Revenues”** for any fiscal period means the sum of (a) the Revenues for such fiscal period plus (b) the amounts, if any, withdrawn by SMUD from the Rate Stabilization Fund for treatment as Revenues for such fiscal period, less the sum of (c) all Maintenance and Operation Costs for such fiscal period, (d) all Energy Payments for such fiscal period not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs for such fiscal period, and (e) the amounts, if any, withdrawn by SMUD from Revenues for such fiscal period for deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund pursuant to the Resolution.

**“Parity Bonds”** includes the Bonds and all revenue bonds issued on a parity with the Bonds as provided or permitted in the Resolution. No Parity Bonds (other than the Bonds) are currently outstanding.

**“Qualified Provider”** means any financial institution or insurance company which is a party to a Financial Products Agreement if the unsecured long-term debt obligations of such financial institution or insurance company (or of the parent or a subsidiary of such financial institution or insurance company if such parent or subsidiary unconditionally guarantees the performance of such financial institution or insurance company under such Financial Products Agreement and the Trustee receives an opinion of
<!-- Page 243 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+not+displayed)

**counsel to the effect that such guarantee is a valid and binding agreement of such parent or subsidiary), or obligations secured or supported by a letter of credit, contract, guarantee, agreement, insurance policy or surety bond issued by such financial institution or insurance company (or such guarantor parent or subsidiary), are rated in one of the two highest rating categories of a national rating agency (without regard to any gradation or such rating category) at the time of the execution and delivery of the Financial Products Agreement.**

**“Rate Stabilization Fund” means the fund by that name established in the Resolution. From time to time, after provision for debt service, SMUD may deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund from remaining Revenues such amounts as SMUD shall determine, provided that deposits may be made until (but not after) the date 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. SMUD may withdraw amounts from the Rate Stabilization Fund only for inclusion in Revenues for any fiscal year, such withdrawals to be made until (but not after) 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. All interest or other earnings on deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund shall be withdrawn therefrom and accounted for as Revenues. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no deposit of Revenues to the Rate Stabilization Fund may be made to the extent such Revenues were included in an engineer’s certificate submitted in connection with the issuance of additional revenue bonds payable from Revenues and withdrawal of the Revenues to be deposited in the Rate Stabilization Fund from the Revenues employed in rendering said engineer’s certificate would have caused noncompliance with the provisions of the Resolution restricting issuance of additional obligations or securities payable from Revenues or to the extent any withdrawal of amounts from remaining Revenues for the Rate Stabilization Fund for any fiscal year would have reduced the debt service ratio referred to in this Appendix under the caption “Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds” to or below 1.40.**

**“Revenues” means all revenues derived by SMUD from the operation of the Electric System, or arising from the Electric System (consisting primarily of income derived from the sale or use of electric energy generated, transmitted or distributed by SMUD from the Electric System, but also including receipts from the sale of property pertaining to the Electric System or incidental to the operation of the Electric System or from services performed by SMUD in connection with the Electric System and revenues derived from certain wholesale, but not retail, sales of water), but exclusive in every case of any moneys derived from the levy or collection of taxes upon any taxable property in SMUD.**

**“Subsidy” means any subsidy, reimbursement or other payment from the federal government of the United States of America under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (or any similar legislation or regulation of the federal government of the United States of America or any other governmental entity or extension of any such legislation or regulation).**

**Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds**

**The Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund (the “Reserve Fund”) is created under the Resolution. The Reserve Fund secures all Bonds issued prior to January 1, 2004 that are currently outstanding (and not otherwise deemed to be paid and discharged under the Resolution) and may secure additional Bonds issued in the future. However, the Reserve Fund does not secure and will not be available to pay debt service on the 2024 Series M Bonds.**

**After the close of each fiscal year, SMUD shall determine the ratio (herein called the “debt service ratio”) of (1) the Net Revenues during such fiscal year to (2) the maximum annual debt service during the period of three fiscal years next following said fiscal year on all Bonds and Parity Bonds then outstanding. For this purpose, the term “maximum annual debt service” shall mean the sum of (i) the interest falling due on serial bonds and term bonds, (ii) the principal amount of serial bonds falling due by**
<!-- Page 244 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
their terms, and (iii) the amount of minimum sinking fund payments required, as computed for the year in which such sum shall be a maximum. Interest during construction which has been funded and provided for shall not be included in "minimum annual debt service" for the purpose of the above calculation.

So long as the debt service ratio shall exceed 1.40, the amount required to be maintained in the Reserve Fund shall be an amount such that the amount in the combined reserve funds of all Parity Bonds then outstanding will at no time be less than the current annual interest requirements on all then outstanding Parity Bonds, except only bonds (if any) for which payment has been provided in advance. If the debt service ratio in any fiscal year shall fall below 1.40, the Treasurer shall set aside in the Reserve Fund or in any other reserve fund or funds established for any one or more issues of the Parity Bonds (on or before the first day of each month of the next succeeding fiscal year) from the first available Net Revenues an amount not less than 15% of the sum of the current monthly interest requirements of all Parity Bonds then outstanding until the next year in which the debt service ratio shall exceed 1.40 or until the aggregate amount in the combined reserve funds established for all of the Parity Bonds (including the Reserve Fund) is equal to the maximum annual debt service on all of the Parity Bonds then outstanding, whichever shall first occur.

For purposes of the above calculation, the interest rates of Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period of periods of time, such interest rate or rates for such period or periods, and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period covered by such known period or periods, the interest rate shall be the greater of the numerical maximum rate that such Bonds may vary or be adjusted to and the numerical maximum rate (if any) that the interest rate for such Bonds may be fixed to, in both cases as set forth in the supplemental resolution authorizing such Bonds, or if such rate or rates have been increased in accordance with such supplemental resolution at such increased rate or rates.

Any amount in the Reserve Fund at any time in excess of the balance required to be then maintained therein shall be released to SMUD for any SMUD use.

SMUD shall not be required, notwithstanding anything herein contained, to maintain in the combined reserve funds appertaining to all Parity Bonds of SMUD, an aggregate amount in excess of the maximum annual debt service requirements in any subsequent fiscal year on all of the then outstanding Parity Bonds.

Any moneys at any time in any of said reserve funds shall be held by the Treasurer in trust for the benefit of the holder or holders from time to time of the Bonds and the coupons appertaining thereto entitled to be paid therewith, and SMUD shall not have any beneficial right or interest in any such moneys.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Supplemental Resolution adopted after the Forty-Eighth Supplemental Resolution may provide that a Series of Bonds issued pursuant to such Supplemental Resolution shall not be secured by the Reserve Fund. In such event, (i) payments of the principal of and interest on such Bonds shall be excluded from all calculations made in respect of the amount to be maintained in the Reserve Fund and (ii) amounts on deposit in the Reserve Fund shall not be applied to the payment of the principal of or interest on such Bonds, even if no other moneys are available therefor.

any expiration or termination thereof; provided, however, that no such drawing need be made if other moneys or a letter of credit are available in the Reserve Fund in the amount of the Reserve Fund Requirement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the prior two paragraphs, if at any time that there is on deposit in the Reserve Fund a combination of cash, a letter of credit and/or a surety bond as contemplated above, SMUD shall draw first on such cash to the extent required and available, then on (1) such surety bond and letter of credit on a pro rata basis (if both a surety bond and letter of credit are available) to the extent required and available, or (2) such surety bond or letter of credit (if either a surety bond or letter of credit, but not both, is available) to the extent required and available.

For purposes of calculating the “debt service ratio” and, unless otherwise specified in a Supplemental Resolution providing for the issuance of a series of Parity Bonds, the amount required to be maintained in the Reserve Fund as described above: (1) any calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy that SMUD receives or expects to receive during such period of time relating to or in connection with such Parity Bonds; and (2) to the extent the calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds is reduced by the Subsidy as provided in clause (1) of this paragraph, any calculation of Net Revenues for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy received or expected to be received by SMUD with respect to or in connection with such Parity Bonds during such period of time.

### Additional Covenants

The Resolution contains the following additional covenants, among others:

1. That the Electric System will be maintained in good repair, working order and condition at all times, and will be continuously operated in an efficient and economical manner.

2. That no electric energy shall be supplied free by SMUD, and a reasonable wholesale charge will be made for water distributed at any cost to SMUD and such charge will be deemed Revenues; but SMUD may supply without charge water furnished to it without distribution cost, and any moneys received from any retail sales of water will not be deemed Revenues.

3. That all taxes and governmental charges and other lawful claims which might become a lien on the Electric System or the Revenues or impair the security of the Bonds will be paid and discharged when due.

4. That SMUD will comply with all lawful orders of any governmental agency or authority having jurisdiction in the premises (except while the validity or application thereof is being contested in good faith) and with all necessary permits and licenses issued by the NRC.

5. That no lease or agreement will be entered into, or sale or other disposition of essential property made, that would impair the operation of the Electric System or the rights of Bondholders with respect to the Revenues; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Master Resolution, SMUD may sell or otherwise dispose of its accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD provided that SMUD delivers to the Trustee:

   (a) a Certificate of SMUD to the effect that the amount derived by SMUD from the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances is a result of the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances upon fair and reasonable terms no
<!-- Page 247 -->

less favorable to SMUD than the terms of a comparable arm’s-length transaction treated as a sale and not a loan under generally accepted accounting principles; and  
(b) a written statement or report of an independent certified public accountant to the effect that, based on the audited financial statements of SMUD for the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available and after giving effect to such transaction by reducing Revenues for such fiscal year by the difference between the face amount of such accounts receivable or loan balances and the amount derived by SMUD from the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances, the debt service ratio computed pursuant to the Master Resolution would not have been reduced to less than 1.40:1.0.

6. That proper records and accounts will be maintained of all transactions relating to the Electric System and the Revenues (open to inspection by the Trustee and the holders of not less than 10 percent in principal amount of the Bonds), to be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant within 90 days after close of the fiscal year, and copies of such financial statements supplied to Bondholders on request.

7. That insurance adequate in amounts and as to risks covered will be maintained against such risks as are usually insurable in connection with similar electric systems, and in addition public liability and property damage insurance in amounts not less than $1,000,000 per accident and adequate fidelity bonds on all officers and employees of SMUD handling or responsible for SMUD funds, subject in each case to the condition that such insurance is obtainable at reasonable rates and upon reasonable terms and conditions. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – INSURANCE” attached to this Official Statement for a description of SMUD’s insurance.

8. That the net proceeds realized by SMUD in the event all or any part of the Electric System is taken by eminent domain proceedings will be applied to the redemption or retirement of all Bonds and Parity Bonds if sufficient therefor, and, if not, then pro rata to the redemption or retirement of Bonds and Parity Bonds or to new facilities if the additional Revenues to be derived therefrom will sufficiently offset the loss of Revenues resulting from such eminent domain so that the ability of SMUD to meet its obligations will not be substantially impaired.

9. That SMUD will at all times use its best efforts to maintain the powers, functions and duties now reposed in it pursuant to law.

10. That SMUD will establish and at all times maintain and collect rates and charges for the sale or use of its electric energy sufficient to permit SMUD to purchase power or issue and sell Bonds or Parity Bonds to finance additions, betterments, extensions and improvements to the Electric System as may be reasonably necessary to satisfy its then projected electric demand upon its Electric System, and that unless the Board determines that SMUD will be able to satisfy such demand through the purchase of electric energy, SMUD will proceed with all reasonable diligence to issue and sell such Bonds or Parity Bonds.

11. That SMUD will not create, or permit the creation of, any mortgage or lien upon the Electric System or any property essential to the proper operation of the Electric System or to the maintenance of the Revenues. SMUD will not create, or permit the creation of, any pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance upon the Revenues except only as provided in the Master Resolution; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Master Resolution, SMUD may create a pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance upon its accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD (which pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance shall be prior to any pledge, lien, charge or
<!-- Page 248 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

encumbrance created or made pursuant to the Master Resolution, including without limitation the pledge of Revenues made pursuant to the Master Resolution) to secure indebtedness with a term of one year or less provided that the principal amount of such indebtedness does not exceed 50% of the aggregate face amount of the accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD as shown on SMUD’s most recent audited financial statements.

## Amendment of the Resolution

The Resolution and the rights and obligations of SMUD and of the holders of the Bonds may be modified or amended at any time pursuant to the affirmative vote at a meeting of Bondholders, or with the written consent without a meeting, of the holders of 60 percent in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding, provided that no such modification or amendment shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Bond, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the holder of each Bond so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Bonds required for consent to an amendment or modification, without the consent of the holders of all the Bonds then outstanding. Modifications or amendments may be made, without the consent of any Bondholders, to add covenants of SMUD or to surrender rights reserved by SMUD in the Resolution, to cure ambiguities or defective or inconsistent provisions or in regard to questions arising under the Resolution without adversely affecting the interests of the Bondholders, or to provide for the issuance of a series of Bonds, subject to the provisions contained in the Resolution with respect thereto.

## Events of Default and Remedies of Bondholders

The Resolution declares each of the following to be an event of default:

(a) Failure to pay the principal of and premium on any Bond when due and payable;

(b) Failure to pay any installment of interest on any Bond when due and payable, if such default continues for a period of 30 days;

(c) Default by SMUD in the observance of any of the covenants, agreements or conditions on its part in the Resolution or in the Bonds, if such default continues for a period of 60 days after written notice thereof (specifying such default and requiring the same to be remedied) has been given to SMUD by the Trustee, or to SMUD and the Trustee by the holders of not less than 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the time outstanding; and

(d) If, under the provisions of any law for the relief or aid of debtors, any court of competent jurisdiction shall assume custody or control of SMUD or of the whole or any substantial part of its property, and such custody or control shall not be terminated or stayed within 60 days;

In the event of default, the Trustee or the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Bonds may, upon written notice to SMUD, declare the principal of all outstanding Bonds, and the interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately. The Trustee is appointed as trustee to represent Bondholders and may take such action as may seem appropriate to it, and, upon the written request of the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Bonds, and upon being furnished with indemnity satisfactory to it, will take such action on behalf of Bondholders as is specified in such written request. Each Bondholder is entitled to proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in such holder by the Resolution by such appropriate judicial proceedings as such holder deems most effectual.
<!-- Page 249 -->
![Page 9](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+9)

The rights of Bondholders are limited and restricted to the use and application of Revenues as provided in the Resolution and do not extend to the levy of any attachment or execution upon or forfeiture of any of the properties of SMUD or to any moneys derived by SMUD from the levy or collection of taxes.

In addition to the limitations on remedies contained in the Resolution, the rights and remedies provided by the Bonds and the Resolution, as well as the enforcement by SMUD of contracts with customers of the Electric System, may be limited by and are subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights.

### Refunding of 2024 Series M Bonds

If Refunding Bonds are issued for the purpose of refunding 2024 Series M Bonds, then SMUD is authorized to apply proceeds of the sale of such Refunding Bonds to the payment of the purchase price of direct noncallable obligations of the United States of America (“Treasury Obligations”) to be held by the Trustee to insure the payment or retirement at or before maturity of all or a portion of the outstanding 2024 Series M Bonds. Upon deposit with the Trustee, in trust, of money or Treasury Obligations (including, but not limited to, direct obligations of the United States of America issued in book-entry form on the books of the Department of the Treasury of the United States of America), or any combination thereof, sufficient, together with the interest to accrue on any such Treasury Obligations, to pay or redeem all or a portion of 2024 Series M Bonds then outstanding at or before their maturity date, all liability of SMUD in respect of such 2024 Series M Bonds shall cease, determine and be completely discharged, and the holders thereof shall thereafter be entitled only to payment by SMUD of the money and Treasury Obligations deposited with the Trustee for their payment. If the liability of SMUD shall cease and determine with respect to all or a portion of the 2024 Series M Bonds, then said 2024 Series M Bonds shall not be considered to be outstanding Bonds for any purpose of the Resolution.

### Discharge of Resolution

The Resolution may be discharged by depositing with the Trustee in trust, moneys or Federal Securities or general obligation bonds of the State of California, in such amount as the Trustee shall determine will, together with the interest to accrue thereon, be fully sufficient to pay and discharge the indebtedness on all Bonds at or before their respective maturity dates.

### Investment of Funds

Moneys in any fund established by the Resolution may be invested in bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, bills, bankers acceptances or other securities in which funds of SMUD may be legally invested as provided by the law in effect at the time of such investment. Currently this investment authority includes, among other things, the Local Agency Investment Fund which is administered by the Treasurer of the State of California for the investment of funds belonging to local agencies in the State of California.

## PROPOSED FORM OF LEGAL OPINION FOR 2024 SERIES M BONDS

[Closing Date]

Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
Sacramento, California  

Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series M  
(Final Opinion)  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as bond counsel to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) in connection with the issuance of $ __________ aggregate principal amount of Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series M (the “2024 Series M Bonds”), issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 of the Board of Directors of SMUD, adopted January 7, 1971 (the “Master Resolution”), as supplemented and amended by later resolutions of said Board of Directors (as so supplemented and amended, the “Resolution”), including Resolution No. 24-03-[__], adopted March 21, 2024 (the “Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Resolution.

In such connection, we have reviewed the Resolution; the Tax Certificate, dated the date hereof (the “Tax Certificate”), executed by SMUD; opinions of counsel to SMUD and the Trustee; certificates of SMUD, the Trustee and others; and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after original delivery of the 2024 Series M Bonds on the date hereof. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to our attention after original delivery of the 2024 Series M Bonds on the date hereof. Accordingly, this letter speaks only as of its date and is not intended to, and may not be, relied upon or otherwise used in connection with any such actions, events or matters. Our engagement with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds has concluded with their issuance, and we disclaim any obligation to update this letter. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures provided to us and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than SMUD. We have assumed, without undertaking to verify, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents, and of the legal conclusions contained in the opinions, referred to in the second paragraph hereof. Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in the Resolution and the Tax Certificate, including (without limitation) covenants and agreements compliance with which is necessary to assure that future actions, omissions or events will not cause interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes.

or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against governmental entities such as SMUD in the State of California. We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any opinion with respect to the state or quality of title to or interest in any of the property described in or as subject to the lien of the Resolution or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description contained therein of, or the remedies available to enforce liens on, any such property. Our services did not include financial or other non-legal advice. Finally, we undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Official Statement, dated ______, 2024, or other offering material relating to the 2024 Series M Bonds and express no opinion or view with respect thereto.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the following opinions:

1. The 2024 Series M Bonds constitute the valid and binding obligations of SMUD.

2. The Resolution, including the Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution, has been duly adopted by, and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of, SMUD. The Resolution creates a valid pledge, to secure the payment of the principal of and interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds, of the Net Revenues, subject to the provisions of the Resolution permitting the application thereof for the purposes on and the terms and conditions set forth in the Resolution.

3. Interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. We observe that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series M Bonds.

Faithfully yours,

# Attachment F
to Resolution No. 24-03-07

**NEW ISSUE - FULL BOOK-ENTRY**

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to SMUD, based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and, assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series N Bonds. See “TAX MATTERS.”

amount of $[________] are expected to be outstanding under the Resolution. See "PLAN OF FINANCE."

Although the Resolution establishes an "Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund" (the "Reserve Fund"), the Reserve Fund does not secure and will not be available to pay debt service on the 2024 Series N Bonds. The Reserve Fund secures all Bonds issued prior to January 1, 2004 that are currently outstanding (and not otherwise deemed to be paid and discharged under the Resolution) and may secure additional Bonds issued in the future.

U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association serves as trustee and paying agent under the Resolution (in such capacities, the "Trustee" and the "Paying Agent" respectively).

From time to time, SMUD issues Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds (the "Subordinated Bonds") pursuant to Resolution No. 85-11-1 of SMUD, adopted on November 7, 1985, as amended and supplemented (the "Subordinate Resolution"). As of December 31, 2023, Subordinated Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $332,020,000 were outstanding. The Subordinated Bonds are payable solely from the Net Subordinated Revenues of the Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series N Bonds).

SMUD also issues commercial paper notes (the "Notes") from time to time. As of December 31, 2023, Notes in the principal amount of $150,000,000 were outstanding. Currently, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 may be outstanding at any one time, but SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be outstanding at any one time in the future. The Notes are secured by letters of credit issued by commercial banks. The Notes and SMUD's obligations to repay drawings under the letters of credit are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD's Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal, premium if any, and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series N Bonds) and the Subordinated Bonds. Drawings under the letters of credit, to the extent not repaid immediately from the proceeds of commercial paper or other available SMUD funds, are repayable with interest over a period of five years. The letters of credit currently expire in August of 2025 and March of 2027. SMUD expects to pay all $150,000,000 of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes with a portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds. See "PLAN OF FINANCE."

SMUD has also previously issued its taxable and tax-exempt revolving notes pursuant to a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank (collectively, the "Revolving Credit Facility"). As of December 31, 2023, no principal amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Currently, the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at any one time is limited to $100,000,000. However, SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the Revolving Credit Facility in the future. SMUD's payment obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD's Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series N Bonds) and the Subordinated Bonds. The current term of the Revolving Credit Facility expires in February 2026.

SMUD is responsible for the acquisition, generation, transmission and distribution of electric power to its service area, which includes most of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. For the year ended December 31, 2023, SMUD served a population of approximately 1.5 million with a total annual retail load of approximately 10,104 million kilowatt hours ("kWh"). SMUD

* Preliminary, subject to change.

owns and operates an electric system which, as of December 31, 2023, included generating facilities owned and operated by SMUD with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 775 megawatts (“MW”), local gas-fired plants owned and operated by a joint powers authority managed by SMUD with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 1,087 MW, over which SMUD has exclusive control of dispatch, and purchased power with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 1,590 MW and transmission and distribution facilities. SMUD’s power requirements exceed its generating capacity and thus SMUD has agreements with others (including the Local Gas-Fired Plants as defined in APPENDIX A) for the purchase of a portion of its power requirements. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Supply Resources.” Continuing development of SMUD’s business strategy in response to changing environmental and regulatory requirements has had, and is expected to continue to have, a major effect on SMUD’s power supply planning. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – BUSINESS STRATEGY.”

Pursuant to a Continuing Disclosure Agreement, dated the date of issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds (the “Continuing Disclosure Agreement”) between SMUD and the Trustee, SMUD will covenant for the benefit of the holders of the 2024 Series N Bonds and owners of beneficial interest in the 2024 Series N Bonds to provide certain financial information and operating data to provide certain notices. See “CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING” and APPENDIX F – “FORM OF CONTINUING DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT.”

The information presented in this Introduction is qualified in its entirety by reference to this entire Official Statement and the documents summarized or described herein. This Official Statement, including the Appendices, summarizes certain provisions of the Bonds, the Resolution and certain agreements, contracts and other arrangements, some of which currently exist and others of which may exist in the future. The summaries and references to all documents, statutes, regulations and other instruments referred to herein do not purport to be complete, comprehensive or definitive, and each such summary and reference is qualified in its entirety by reference to each such document, statute, regulation or instrument.

Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Official Statement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in APPENDIX D – “SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION – Certain Definitions” or in the Resolution.

PLAN OF FINANCE

Issuance of 2024 Series N Bonds and Refunding of Refunded Bonds

The proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds will be used to (i) refund the $200,000,000 outstanding principal amount of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Bonds, 2009 Series V (the “2009 Series V Bonds”), (ii) refund the $250,000,000 outstanding principal amount of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Bonds, 2010 Series V (the “2010 Series W Bonds” and, together with the 2009 Series V Bonds, the “Refunded Bonds”) and (iii) pay certain costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds.

The Refunded Bonds were issued as bonds designated as “Build America Bonds” under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “Recovery Act”). At the time the Refunded Bonds were issued, SMUD expected to receive cash subsidy payments from the United States Treasury equal to 35% of the interest payable on the Refunded Bonds as required by sections 54AA and 6431 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (as such sections were
<!-- Page 271 -->
![Document](https://emmas.msrb.org/FP250561-EP406639-EP803941.pdf)

The 2009 Series V Bonds are subject to extraordinary optional redemption upon the occurrence of an “Extraordinary Event.” Pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions for the 2009 Series V Bonds, an “Extraordinary Event” will have occurred if SMUD determines that a material adverse change has occurred to Section 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as such Sections were added by Section 1531 of the Recovery Act, pertaining to Build America Bonds) or there is any guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury with respect to such Sections or any other determination by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury, which determination is not the result of an act or omission by SMUD to satisfy the requirements to receive the 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury, pursuant to which SMUD’s 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury is reduced or eliminated.

The 2010 Series W Bonds are subject to extraordinary optional redemption upon the occurrence of a “Tax Law Change.” Pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions for the 2010 Bonds, “Tax Law Change” means legislation has been enacted by the Congress of the United States or passed by either House of the Congress, or a decision has been rendered by a court of the United States, or an order, ruling, regulation (final or proposed) or official statement has been made by or on behalf of the Treasury Department of the United States, the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental agency of appropriate jurisdiction, the effect of which, as reasonably determined by SMUD, would be to suspend, reduce or terminate the payment from the United States Treasury to SMUD with respect to the 2010 Series W Bonds, or to state or local governmental issuers generally with respect to obligations of the general character of the 2010 Series W Bonds, pursuant to Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code of an amount equal to 35% of the interest due thereon on each interest payment date (the “Subsidy Payments”); provided, that such suspension, reduction or termination of the Subsidy Payments is not due to a failure by the District to comply with the requirements under the Code to receive such Subsidy Payments.

The extraordinary optional redemption provisions for each series of the Refunded Bonds are described in the related Official Statement for such series of Refunded Bonds. The Official Statements for the Refunded Bonds can be found at the following links:

2009 Series V Bonds: [Link](https://emmas.msrb.org/FP250561-EP406639-EP803941.pdf)  
2010 Series W Bonds: [Link](https://emmas.msrb.org/EA393164-EA308929-EA704612.pdf)  

The foregoing links are provided for reference and convenience only. The Official Statements for the Refunded Bonds are not incorporated herein by reference and do not constitute part of this Official Statement.

For various reasons, including but not limited to, the enactment of the Budget Control Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act and the resulting reduction of the cash subsidy payments required to be paid by the United States Treasury to SMUD with respect to the Refunded Bonds pursuant to section 6431 of the Code, SMUD has determined that an “Extraordinary Event” has occurred with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and that a “Tax Law Change” has occurred with respect to the 2010 Series W Bonds. Therefore,

[A portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds, [together with other available funds], will be deposited in one or more escrow funds (the “Escrow Funds”) established under one or more escrow agreements between SMUD and the Trustee. The moneys so deposited will be invested in direct obligations of the United States of America (the “Federal Securities”), the interest on and principal of which, together with other moneys held in the Escrow Funds, are expected to be in an amount sufficient to pay the interest on the Refunded Bonds due on [____] (the “Redemption Date”) and to redeem the Refunded Bonds on the Redemption Date at their respective redemption prices. [Upon deposit, all liability of SMUD with respect to the Refunded Bonds (except for the obligation of SMUD to pay the interest on and redemption price of the Refunded Bonds from moneys on deposit in the Escrow Fund) will cease. The holders of the Refunded Bonds will be entitled to payment from SMUD solely from moneys or Federal Securities on deposit in the Escrow Fund, and the Refunded Bonds will no longer be outstanding under the Resolution.] [Notwithstanding the deposit to the Escrow Funds, the Refunded Bonds will remain outstanding, and SMUD will remain liable for the payment of the principal and redemption price of and interest on the Refunded Bonds, until the Refunded Bonds are actually redeemed in full on the Redemption Date.] The Federal Securities and moneys in the Escrow Funds will not secure the 2024 Series N Bonds and will not be available to pay the principal of or interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds.]

[A portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds, [together with other available funds], will be used to pay the interest on the Refunded Bonds due on [____] (the “Redemption Date”) and to redeem the Refunded Bonds on the Redemption Date at their respective redemption prices.]

The issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds and the refunding of the Refunded Bonds are components of the Plan of Finance, as further described below. The issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds is not contingent upon the implementation of the other components of the Plan of Finance, and SMUD is not obligated to implement any of the components of the Plan of Finance.

**Issuance of 2024 Series M Bonds**

Concurrently with the issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds, SMUD expects to issue approximately $[____]1 aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Series M Bonds. The proceeds of the 2024 Series M Bonds are expected to be used to finance and refinance certain improvements and additions to SMUD’s Electric System, including by paying the outstanding principal amount of SMUD’s commercial paper notes at maturity, [and pay certain costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds].

**THE 2024 SERIES N BONDS**

The 2024 Series N Bonds will mature in the years and amounts and bear interest at the rates set forth on the inside cover page hereof. Interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds will accrue from the date of delivery of the 2024 Series N Bonds, and will be payable on [November 15, 2024], and semiannually thereafter on each [May 15 and November 15] (each, an “Interest Payment Date”) to the owners thereof as of the first day of the month (whether or not such day is a Business Day) in which an Interest Payment Date occurs (each, a “Record Date”).

The 2024 Series N Bonds will be issued in fully registered form and, when issued, will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). DTC will act as securities depository (the “Securities Depository”) for the 2024 Series N Bonds. Individual purchases of interests in the 2024 Series N Bonds will be made in book-entry form only, in the principal amount of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. Purchasers of such interests will not receive certificates representing their interests in the 2024 Series N Bonds. Principal and interest are payable directly to the Securities Depository by the Trustee. Upon receipt of payments of principal and interest, the Securities Depository will in turn remit such principal and interest to the Securities Depository’s Direct Participants (as such term is hereinafter defined) for subsequent disbursement to the purchasers of interests in the 2024 Series N Bonds. See APPENDIX C – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.”

**Notice of Redemption.** Notice of redemption for the 2024 Series N Bonds will be given by publication at least once in financial newspapers or journals, selected by the Trustee, of general circulation in San Francisco, California, Chicago, Illinois, and New York, New York, each such publication to be not less than 20 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption, if at any time the 2024 Series N Bonds are not in book entry form. Notice will also be mailed to the registered owners of any 2024 Series N Bonds designated for redemption, but failure to mail such notice or any defect therein with respect to any particular 2024 Series N Bond will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other 2024 Series N Bonds. For so long as the book-entry system is in effect with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds, the Trustee will mail notice of redemption solely to DTC or its nominee or its successor. Any failure of DTC or its successor, or of a direct or indirect DTC participant, to notify a beneficial owner of a 2024 Series N Bond of any redemption will not affect the sufficiency or validity of the redemption of any 2024 Series N Bond. See APPENDIX C – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.” SMUD may instruct the Trustee to give conditional notice of optional redemption, which may be conditioned upon the receipt of moneys or any other event.

# SECURITY FOR THE BONDS

## General

The principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds, together with other Parity Bonds, are payable exclusively from, and are secured by a pledge (effected in the manner and to the extent provided in the Resolution) of, the Net Revenues of the Electric System of SMUD.

Neither the credit nor the taxing power of SMUD is pledged to the payment of the Bonds and the general fund of SMUD is not liable for the payment thereof. The owners of the Bonds cannot compel the exercise of any taxing power of SMUD or the forfeiture of any of its property. The Bonds are not a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien or encumbrance upon any of SMUD’s property (including the Electric System) or upon any of its income, receipts or revenues except the Net Revenues of the Electric System to the extent of the pledge thereof contained in the Resolution.

## Consent to Amendments to the Resolution

The purchasers of the 2024 Series N Bonds, by virtue of their purchase of the 2024 Series N Bonds, will consent to certain amendments to the Resolution (the “Proposed Amendments”). Such amendments are described in **bold italic font** herein under “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Rates and Charges” and “– Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues” and in APPENDIX D – “SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION – Certain Definitions” and “– Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds.” The written consents to the Proposed Amendments of the holders and registered owners of at least 60% of the Bonds outstanding have been filed with SMUD or the Trustee, as required by the Resolution. However, while certain Bonds remain outstanding, SMUD must also obtain the written consents of certain bond insurers to implement the Proposed Amendments. SMUD expects to implement the Proposed Amendments when the written consents of such bond insurers are obtained or
<!-- Page 276 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

when the Bonds insured by such bond insurers are no longer outstanding. The final maturity date of the insured Bonds is July 1, 2024.

**Allocation of Revenues**

After making an allocation of Revenues to Maintenance and Operation Costs and to Energy Payments not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs, the Treasurer of SMUD is required (subject to the last paragraph of this section) to set aside, on an equal priority with sums set aside for all other Parity Bonds, Net Revenues as follows:

**First:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Interest Fund, in approximately equal monthly installments on or before the first day of each month, an amount equal to at least one-fifth (1/5) of the aggregate amount of interest becoming due on the Bonds on the next succeeding semiannual interest payment date, until an amount sufficient to meet said interest payment is accumulated.

**Second:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Redemption Fund, to be set aside in the Principal Account and Sinking Fund, respectively, in approximately equal monthly installments on or before the first day of each month, an amount equal to at least one-tenth (1/10) of the aggregate amount of principal becoming due on serial Bonds and the aggregate minimum sinking fund payments required to be made with respect to term Bonds during the next ensuing 12 months, until an amount sufficient to meet the principal and sinking fund requirements on all Bonds outstanding is accumulated in said accounts, respectively.

**Third:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund, such amounts as any supplemental resolution authorizing the issuance of a series of Bonds may require to build up and maintain said fund.

If interest on Bonds of a series or maturity is payable more frequently than semiannually, the Treasurer of SMUD shall set aside out of Net Revenues in the Interest Fund such amounts as may be required to pay interest on the Bonds of such series or maturity on each interest payment date at least one month prior to such interest payment date. Allocation to the Electric Revenue Bond Redemption Fund and Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund shall be made as set forth above.

All remaining Revenues, after making the foregoing allocations, will be available to SMUD for all lawful SMUD purposes.

From time to time, SMUD may deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund from such remaining Revenues such amounts as SMUD shall determine, provided that deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund from remaining Revenues in any fiscal year may be made until (but not after) the date 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. SMUD may withdraw amounts from the Rate Stabilization Fund only for inclusion in Revenues for any fiscal year, such withdrawals to be made until (but not after) 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. All interest or other earnings upon deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund shall be withdrawn therefrom and accounted for as Revenues. No deposit of Revenues to the Rate Stabilization Fund may be made to the extent such Revenues were included in any certificate submitted in connection with the issuance of additional bonds and withdrawal of the Revenues from the Revenues employed in rendering said certificate would have caused noncompliance with the additional bond provisions or to the extent withdrawals of the Revenues for any fiscal year would have reduced the debt provisions.
<!-- Page 277 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

service ratio for such fiscal year to or below 1.40:1.00. See APPENDIX A – “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges” for a description of the balance in the Rate Stabilization Fund.

With respect to Bonds of a series issued on or after October 1, 2003 (including the 2024 Series N Bonds), notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Bonds of such series or maturity are outstanding, the supplemental resolution authorizing the issuance of such series shall require the Treasurer, out of Net Revenues received by SMUD, to set aside in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account, respectively, such amounts as may be required so that an amount equal to the amount of principal and/or interest becoming due and payable on the Bonds of such series or maturity on each interest payment date and principal payment date is on deposit in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account, respectively, at such time on or prior to such interest payment date or principal payment date as shall be specified in the supplemental resolution authorizing such Bonds.

### Rates and Charges

SMUD has covenanted in the Resolution to establish and at all times maintain and collect rates and charges for the sale or use of electric energy generated, transmitted, distributed or furnished by SMUD which, together with certain items of other income permitted under the Resolution, will yield Revenues at least sufficient, with respect to the ensuing 12 months, to pay and provide for all sums required for Maintenance and Operation Costs and Energy Payments not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs and, in addition, to provide an aggregate sum equal to at least 1.20 times the total amount required for the payment of principal and interest, together with any sinking fund or reserve fund payments, on the Bonds and all Parity Bonds, in each case during such 12 months.

For purposes of the calculations of payments to be made pursuant to the Resolution, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal and interest on Parity Bonds, if a Financial Products Agreement has been entered into by SMUD with respect to any Parity Bonds, interest on such Parity Bonds shall be included in the calculation of such principal and interest by including for each fiscal year or period an amount equal to the amount of interest payable on such Parity Bonds in such fiscal year or period at the rate or rates stated in such Parity Bonds plus any Financial Product Payments payable in such fiscal year or period minus any Financial Product Receipts receivable in such fiscal year or period; provided that in no event shall any calculation made pursuant to this clause result in a number less than zero being included in the calculation of such principal and interest.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal and interest on Parity Bonds, Excluded Principal Payments shall be disregarded (but interest on the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payments relate shall be included until but not after the stated due date when principal payments on such Parity Bonds are scheduled by their terms to commence) and Assumed Principal Payments and Assumed Interest Payments shall be included; and for purposes of the above calculations of interest on Parity Bonds, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

10
<!-- Page 278 -->
![SMUD Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Document)

SMUD has full power to establish rates and charges for all SMUD services, and the levels of such rates are not subject to review or regulation by any other governmental agency, either federal or state.

For purposes of the calculations specified in this section: (1) any calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy that SMUD receives or expects to receive during such period of time relating to or in connection with such Parity Bonds; and (2) to the extent the calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds is reduced by the Subsidy as provided in clause (1) of this paragraph, any calculation of Revenues for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy received or expected to be received by SMUD with respect to or in connection with such Parity Bonds during such period of time.

See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments” for a description of the current Subsidy that SMUD receives with respect to the Refunded Bonds.

**Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues**

The Resolution provides that SMUD will not, so long as any Bonds are outstanding, issue any obligations payable in whole or in part from Revenues except the following:

1. Refunding bonds issued solely to refund all or part of the Bonds or Parity Bonds;

2. General obligation bonds or other securities secured by the full faith and credit of SMUD;

3. Additional revenue bonds (including additional Bonds under the Resolution and additional Parity Bonds), payable on a parity with the Bonds, with an equal lien and charge upon the Revenues, but only subject to the following conditions:

   (a) Such additional revenue bonds shall have been authorized for and the proceeds therefrom required to be applied to additions, betterments, extensions or improvements to the Electric System (and necessary costs of issuance, interest during construction and reserve funds);

   (b) The proceedings for the issuance of such additional revenue bonds shall require SMUD to fix and collect rates and charges in an amount not less, with respect to such bonds, than the amounts required with respect to Bonds issued under the Resolution;

   (c) SMUD shall not then be in default under the Resolution or other resolutions authorizing the issuance of Parity Bonds; and

   (d) The Trustee shall receive a certificate of SMUD to the effect (i) that Net Revenues, after completion of the improvements proposed to be financed by such additional revenue bonds, will be sufficient to pay the principal of and interest (and bond reserve fund requirements) on all Bonds and Parity Bonds then outstanding and on such additional revenue bonds; and (ii) that for a period of 12 consecutive months during the 24 months immediately preceding the issuance of the additional revenue bonds the Net Revenues have been at least equal to 1.25 times maximum annual debt service on all Bonds and Parity Bonds then outstanding and on such additional revenue bonds (after adjusting Net Revenues to include 75 percent of the estimated additional Net Revenues to be derived from an increase in rates and charges or from the acquisition of an existing revenue producing electric system); and

11
<!-- Page 279 -->
4. Revenue bonds junior and subordinate to the Bonds and Parity Bonds.

For purposes of the above calculations, Excluded Principal Payments shall be disregarded (but interest on the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payments relate shall be included until but not after the stated due date when principal payments on such Parity Bonds are scheduled by their terms to commence) and Assumed Principal Payments and Assumed Interest Payments shall be included; and for purposes of the above calculations of interest on Parity Bonds, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal and interest on Parity Bonds, if a Financial Products Agreement has been entered into by SMUD with respect to any Parity Bonds, interest on such Parity Bonds shall be included in the calculation of such principal and interest by including for each fiscal year or period an amount equal to the amount of interest payable on such Parity Bonds in such fiscal year or period at the rate or rates stated in such Parity Bonds plus any Financial Product Payments payable in such fiscal year or period minus any Financial Product Receipts receivable in such fiscal year or period; provided that in no event shall any calculation made pursuant to this clause result in a number less than zero being included in the calculation of such principal and interest.

For purposes of the calculations specified in this section: (1) any calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy that SMUD receives or expects to receive during such period of time relating to or in connection with such Parity Bonds; and (2) to the extent the calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds is reduced by the Subsidy as provided in clause (1) of this paragraph, any calculation of Net Revenues for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy received or expected to be received by SMUD with respect to or in connection with such Parity Bonds during such period of time.

See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Estimated Capital Requirements” for a description of SMUD’s projected capital requirements.

SMUD’s audited, consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are included in APPENDIX B attached to this Official Statement. These financial statements have been audited by Baker Tilly US, LLP, Madison, Wisconsin (the “Auditor”), for the periods indicated and to the extent set forth in their report thereon and should be read in their entirety. SMUD has not requested nor did it obtain permission from the Auditor to include the audited, consolidated financial statements as an appendix to this Official Statement. Accordingly, the Auditor has not performed any procedures to review the financial condition or operations of SMUD subsequent to the date of its report included therein, nor has it reviewed any information contained in this Official Statement.

**TAX MATTERS**

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to SMUD (“Bond Counsel”), based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series N Bonds. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in APPENDIX E hereto.

To the extent the issue price of any maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds is less than the amount to be paid at maturity of such 2024 Series N Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least annually over the term of such 2024 Series N Bonds), the difference constitutes “original issue discount,” the accrual of which, to the extent properly allocable to each Beneficial Owner thereof, is treated as interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and exempt from State of California personal income taxes. For this purpose, the issue price of a particular maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds is the first price at which a substantial amount of such maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds is sold to the public (excluding bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). The original issue discount with respect to any maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds accrues daily over the term to maturity of such 2024 Series N Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded semiannually (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). The accruing original issue discount is added to the adjusted basis of such 2024 Series N Bonds to determine taxable gain or loss upon trade or business disposition (including sale, redemption, or payment at maturity) of such 2024 Series N Bonds. Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series N Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of 2024 Series N Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of Beneficial Owners who do not purchase such 2024 Series N Bonds in the original offering to the public at the first price at which a substantial amount of such 2024 Series N Bonds is sold to the public.

2024 Series N Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount higher than their principal amount payable at maturity (or, in some cases, at their earlier call date) (“Premium Bonds”) will be treated as having amortizable bond premium. No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the case of bonds, like the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is

The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the 2024 Series N Bonds. SMUD has made certain representations and covenanted to comply with certain restrictions, conditions and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds will not be included in federal gross income. Inaccuracy of these representations or failure to comply with these covenants may result in interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants. Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken), or events occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond Counsel’s attention after the date of issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the 2024 Series N Bonds. Accordingly, the opinion of Bond Counsel is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon in connection with any such actions, events or matters.

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of amounts treated as interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds may otherwise affect a Beneficial Owner’s federal, state or local tax liability. The nature of the interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds depends upon the status of the Beneficial Owner or the Beneficial Owner’s other items of income or deduction. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences.

Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Code or court decisions may cause interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to federal income taxation or to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent Beneficial Owners from realizing the full current benefit of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals or clarification of the Code or court decisions may also affect, perhaps significantly, the market price for, or marketability of, the 2024 Series N Bonds. Prospective purchasers of the 2024 Series N Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential impact of any pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment of the 2024 Series N Bonds for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of SMUD, or about the effect of future changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the IRS. SMUD has covenanted, however, to comply with the requirements of the Code.

Bond Counsel’s engagement with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds ends with the issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds, and, unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to defend SMUD or the Beneficial Owners regarding the tax-exempt status of the 2024 Series N Bonds in the event of an audit examination by the IRS. Under current procedures, Beneficial Owners would have little, if any, right to participate in the audit examination process. Moreover, because achieving judicial review in

Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”) and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) have assigned ratings of “[AA (stable outlook)]” and “[Aa2 (stable outlook)],” respectively, to the 2024 Series N Bonds.

Any such downward revision, suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price or marketability of the 2024 Series N Bonds.

# INTRODUCTION

## General

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) owns and operates an electric system that has provided retail electric service since 1946. SMUD’s current service area is approximately 900 square miles, and includes the principal parts of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. See “THE SERVICE AREA AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM – The Service Area.”

## Independent Governance

SMUD is an independently run community-owned organization. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government.

SMUD is governed by a Board of Directors (the “Board”), which consists of seven directors elected by ward for staggered four-year terms. The Board determines policy and appoints the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, who is responsible for SMUD’s overall management and day-to-day operations. The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager is responsible for the hiring and removal of all employees, other than the Chief Legal and Government Affairs Officer and General Counsel, the Internal Auditor and the Special Assistant to the Board, who are hired and may be removed only by the Board. The employment status of nearly all SMUD employees is governed by a civil service system administered by the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager.

The Board elects its President and Vice President annually to take office in January. The current members of the Board are as follows:

| Name                     | Occupation                                               | Ward  | Term Expires     |

**The Service Area**

SMUD is the primary distributor of electric power within an area of approximately 900 square miles in central California. The service area includes the State Capital, Sacramento, the populous areas principally to the northeast and south of the City of Sacramento (the “City” or “Sacramento”) and the agricultural areas to the north and south. The City is located 85 miles northeast of San Francisco.

SMUD’s electric system supplies power to a population of approximately 1.5 million with a total annual retail load of approximately 10,104 million kilowatt-hours (“kWh”) for the year ended December 31, 2023. As the capital of the nation’s most populous state, Sacramento benefits from the historically stabilizing influence of a large government sector. Sacramento is home to the State government headquarters, the Sacramento County seat, the City government and various special districts that combine to make government the largest single employment sector in the Sacramento area. Information technology, transportation, education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and construction round out the other major sectors of employment and industry in the area.

SMUD’s annual peak load has averaged 3,045 Megawatts (“MW”) over the last three years, with SMUD’s record peak load of 3,299 MW occurring on July 24, 2006. In 2022, SMUD recorded its second highest peak load of 3,263 MW. SMUD reviews its load forecast, at a minimum, on an annual basis.

**The Electric System**

SMUD owns and operates an integrated electric system that includes generation, transmission and distribution facilities.

SMUD supplies power to its bulk power substations through a 230 kilovolt (“kV”) and 115 kV transmission system. This system transmits power from SMUD’s generation plants and interconnects with Pacific Gas & Electric (“PG&E”) and the Western Area Power Administration (“WAPA”). Power is distributed throughout Sacramento County via a 69 kV sub-transmission system with the exception of the City’s downtown area, which is served from the 115 kV transmission system. The downtown area is served from 115/12 kV and 115/21 kV substations. The distribution system serving the remainder of SMUD’s service territory is comprised of 69/12 kV substations with overhead and underground 12 kV distribution circuits.

**BUSINESS STRATEGY**

**General**

SMUD’s Board of Directors has established the following purpose and vision statements: “SMUD’s purpose is to enhance the quality of life for our customers and community by providing reliable and affordable electricity, and leading the transition to a clean energy future. SMUD’s vision is to be a trusted and powerful partner in achieving an inclusive, zero carbon economy. SMUD will leverage its relationships to accelerate innovation, ensure energy affordability and reliability, protect the environment, eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, catalyze economic and workforce development, promote environmental justice, and enhance community vitality for all.” The Board has adopted a set of Strategic Directions with related metrics, which it considers essential for the success of SMUD and for serving SMUD’s customers. These include competitive rates, access to credit markets, reliability, customer relations, environmental leadership, resource planning, enterprise risk management and safety. Some of the general elements in SMUD’s business strategy are:

- developing and maintaining a sustainable and reliable power supply to meet demand growth consistent with State mandates and the Board’s directions for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions to zero by 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan”;
- working closely with customers to provide the information, tools and incentives to assist them to more efficiently manage energy use, which will contribute to meeting greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission targets and managing needle peak demand requirements (those 40 or so hours of the year with extreme temperatures when customer demand surges by up to 400 additional MW);
- managing price, volumetric and credit risks associated with energy and natural gas procurement;
- attracting, developing and retaining a diverse, skilled and engaged workforce that reflects SMUD’s values and is committed to achieving SMUD’s mission;
- retaining local decision making authority and operational independence; and
- collaborating regionally to attract new businesses and grow existing business to diversify and strengthen the Sacramento economy.

SMUD’s long-range business strategy focuses in part on ensuring financial stability by establishing rates that provide an acceptable fixed charge coverage ratio on a consolidated basis, taking into consideration the impact of capital expenditures and other factors on cash flow.

with current energy market prices. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges.”

**Renewable Options.** SMUD’s customers have been increasingly interested in distributed energy resources, mainly through the installation of solar systems. As of December 2023, approximately 51,374 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, approximately 8% of retail customers, had installed solar systems, representing approximately 360 MW of solar installations.

As the cost of energy storage continues to decline, SMUD anticipates an increase in behind-the-meter energy storage, mainly through the installation of battery storage systems. As of December 2023, approximately 1,532 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, had installed storage systems, representing approximately 10 MW of storage.

As another option for solar, SMUD’s SolarShares® pilot program (the “SolarShares Pilot”) was established as a cost-effective and convenient way for commercial customers to meet their energy needs from solar power. The SolarShares Pilot offered SMUD commercial customers the opportunity to receive solar power without upfront costs or equipment installation through 5-, 10- or 20-year purchase contracts. Customers that entered into purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot receive up to half of their power from a utility-scale solar system. SMUD supplies solar power for the SolarShares Pilot either by building and maintaining utility-scale solar systems or by procuring solar power from third parties through power purchase agreements. The SolarShares Pilot generation was approximately 3.2% of retail sales in 2023. As of April 30, 2021, SMUD had completed the SolarShares Pilot and is not entering into new purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot.

Since January 2020, the California Building Code has required all new constructed residential buildings under three stories to be powered by photovoltaic solar systems. A new home satisfies this requirement if it installs on-site solar or participates in an approved community solar or energy storage program. In February 2020, SMUD obtained approval from the California Energy Commission (“CEC”) to administer its own community solar program, called Neighborhood SolarShares® (“Neighborhood SolarShares”). SMUD’s Neighborhood SolarShares program can be used by developers of new low-rise residential buildings to satisfy the mandatory solar requirement. See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Rooftop Solar Mandate.” Starting in 2023, the California Building Code’s mandatory solar requirement extends beyond low-rise residential properties, and other changes to the California Building Code’s community solar regulations took effect. SMUD revised its program to align with the new regulations and, in May 2023, obtained approval from the CEC to continue offering its Neighborhood SolarShares compliance option to newly constructed low rise residential homes in its service territory.

In addition to the SolarShares Pilot and Neighborhood SolarShares, SMUD maintains a voluntary green energy pricing program called Greenergy® (“Greenery”). The Greenery program allows customers the opportunity to pay an additional amount per month to ensure that either all or part of their electricity comes from green or carbon free energy sources. In 2023, the program allocated Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”) equivalent to approximately 4.2% of retail sales to its participating customers.

**Energy Efficiency.** To further assist customers in managing energy use and reducing regional carbon emissions and air pollution, SMUD offers an extensive array of energy efficiency and building electrification programs and services including financial incentives, loans, energy audits and education. In addition, SMUD has partnered with local developers to incorporate energy efficiency and all-electric construction measures into new residential and commercial construction, which helps developers plan and design efficient, cost-effective and low or zero-emission buildings. As part of SMUD’s 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”), SMUD set a goal for regional carbon emissions through transport and building

# Electrification and Sustainable Power Supply

**Electrification Goals**  
SMUD’s electrification aims to reduce carbon emissions in buildings and transport by 64% over the next 20 years. SMUD’s focus on electrification is continued in the Zero Carbon Plan (defined and discussed below). SMUD was the first electric utility in the country to set its efficiency goals based on carbon reductions, allowing building electrification and energy efficiency to both count toward meeting SMUD’s efficiency goals. This is a significant opportunity, as converting a typical home today to all-electric saves more than three times the carbon emissions compared to doing a major energy efficiency upgrade alone to the same building. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources.”

## Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission

Maintaining a sustainable power supply entails focusing efforts on researching, promoting and implementing new renewable energy technologies and sources to meet SMUD’s long-term commitment to reducing carbon emissions and providing a reliable energy supply. SMUD defines a sustainable power supply as one that reduces SMUD’s GHG emissions to serve retail customer load to zero by 2030. See “– 2030 Zero Carbon Plan”. Below, SMUD is planning to achieve zero GHG emissions to serve retail customer load through investments in energy efficiency, clean distributed energy resources, renewables portfolio standard (“RPS”) eligible renewables, energy storage, large hydroelectric generation, clean and emissions free fuels, carbon capture and sequestration, and new technologies and business models. Additionally, SMUD plans to continue pursuing GHG emissions reductions through vehicle, building and equipment electrification. At the same time, SMUD’s plans for maintaining a sustainable power supply include assuring the reliability of SMUD’s electric system, minimizing environmental impacts on land, habitat, water and air quality, and maintaining competitive rates relative to other electric providers in the State.

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills regulate GHG emissions and promote the development of sustainable generation alternatives, principally through more stringent RPS. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings” herein.

### 2030 Zero Carbon Plan

In July 2020, the Board declared a climate emergency and adopted a resolution calling for SMUD to take significant and consequential actions to reduce its carbon footprint by 2030. On April 28, 2021, the Board approved SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan (the “Zero Carbon Plan”). The Zero Carbon Plan is intended to be a flexible roadmap for SMUD to eliminate carbon emissions from its electricity production by 2030 while maintaining reliable and affordable service. To achieve these goals the Zero Carbon Plan is focused on four main areas: natural gas generation repurposing, proven technologies, new technologies and business models and financial impacts and options. SMUD plans to revisit the Zero Carbon Plan annually.

The natural gas generation repurposing focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for exploring the replacement of two of SMUD’s five Local Gas-Fired Plants (as defined herein) and the retooling of the other three Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” Based on SMUD’s studies to date, SMUD estimates that McClellan (as defined herein) and the Campbell Soup Project (as defined herein) can be replaced in the next several years depending on SMUD’s success with replacement resources. Final decisions about the replacement of these two Local Gas-Fired Plants will be based on additional reliability studies and engagement with the community. As part of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is also exploring converting the Carson Project (as defined herein) and the Procter & Gamble Project (as defined herein) to reliability use operations only and investigating the use of alternative fuels like Renewable Natural Gas-biomethane (RNG-biomanthene), hydrogen and other biofuels for the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, and the Consumers Power Plant (as defined herein). In addition, SMUD is investigating new technologies such as long duration energy storage, carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen and other clean fuel alternatives to help support.

A-8

the reduction of GHG emissions in SMUD’s energy supply. All final generator configurations are subject to reliability assessments.

The proven clean technologies focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for SMUD to procure approximately 1,100 to 1,500 MW of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (“PV”) generating capacity, 700 to 1,100 MW of local utility-scale battery storage, 300 to 500 MW of wind generating capacity, and 100 to 220 MW of geothermal generating capacity. The Zero Carbon Plan also estimates that customer installation of approximately 500 to 750 MW of behind-the-meter solar PV generating capacity and approximately 50 to 250 MW of behind-the-meter battery storage will assist SMUD with achieving the Zero Carbon Plan goals.

With respect to new technologies and business models, the Zero Carbon Plan focuses on evaluating, prioritizing and scaling the emerging technologies that SMUD expects will have the largest impact on reducing carbon in SMUD’s 2030 resource mix. SMUD is currently focused on various areas of technology and customer-focused programs, including electrification, demand flexibility, virtual power plants, vehicle-to-grid technology, and new grid-scale technologies. The Zero Carbon Plan forecasts that customer-owned devices and SMUD customer-focused programs will contribute between 360 and 1,300 MW of capacity to SMUD’s grid by 2030.

The financial impacts and options focus of the Zero Carbon Plan aims to keep SMUD rate increases at or below the rate of inflation while achieving SMUD’s goal of eliminating carbon emissions from its power supply by 2030. To pay for the expected costs of the Zero Carbon Plan and keep rate increases at or below the rate of inflation, the Zero Carbon Plan estimates the need for SMUD to realize between $50 million and $150 million of sustained annual savings. SMUD currently plans to achieve these sustained annual savings by exploring the implementation of operational savings and pursuing partnership and grant opportunities.

While the ultimate impacts of the Zero Carbon Plan on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy from clean technologies, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers, such impacts could be material.

Renewable Energy and Climate Change. The California Renewable Energy Resources Act, established by Senate Bill X1-2 (“SBX1-2”) and the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015, enacted by Senate Bill 350 (“SB 350”) require that SMUD meets 33% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2020 and 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2030. Senate Bill 100 (“SB 100”), passed by the legislature and approved by then-Governor Brown on September 10, 2018, accelerates the RPS targets and establishes a new 60% target by 2030. The bill also created a planning goal to meet all of the State’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Renewables Portfolio Standards” for a discussion of the State RPS requirements.

SMUD’s compliance with State RPS requirements is evaluated over 3- or 4-year compliance periods. SMUD met the State RPS requirements for the first compliance period (2011-2013) and second compliance period (2014-2016). The third compliance period (2017-2020) required SMUD to source one-third of its energy from renewable resources, and SMUD had sufficient RECs to meet the third compliance period requirements. SMUD filed its 2020 and third compliance period RPS compliance report with the CEC in the second quarter of 2021 and the CEC adopted SMUD’s third compliance period verification report in December 2023. SMUD expects the confirmation letter from the CEC indicating that SMUD was

In addition to procuring new sources, meeting the RPS requirements will require replacement of certain existing renewable contracts which expire in future years. While SMUD anticipates it will meet much of its renewable resource requirements through purchased contracts with third parties, it continues to explore additional options, including wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal developments, partnering with other utilities on future projects, and local development options. SMUD’s resource forecast (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources”) accounts for future renewable resources as a component of “Uncommitted Purchases.” To meet SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan goals, SMUD anticipates meeting loads in 2030 with approximately 70-80% renewable resources, in addition to hydro and other new zero carbon technologies. See “← 2030 Zero Carbon Plan” above.

Given the intermittent nature of power from renewable resources such as wind and solar, SMUD is exploring and investing in options that provide the flexibility to manage the intermittency of such renewable resources. Potential options include energy storage resources, which SMUD has committed to as part of the Zero Carbon Plan, and expanding load management resources. Additionally, on April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its membership in BANC, a joint exercise of powers agency formed in 2009, and currently comprised of SMUD, the Modesto Irrigation District (“MID”), the City of Roseville (“Roseville”), the City of Redding (“Redding”), the City of Shasta Lake and the Trinity Public Utilities District, commenced participation in the California Independent System Operator Corporation (“CAISO”) western energy imbalance market (“WEIM”). Participation in the WEIM benefits SMUD by providing it with broader access to balancing resources within the region to help manage its expanding renewable portfolio. In addition, other entities within the BANC Balancing Authority Area began participation in the WEIM on March 25, 2021. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Operational Independence and Local Control” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

In 2022, SMUD’s Board formally adopted the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan as SMUD’s updated IRP. SMUD filed the approved IRP update with the CEC on September 14, 2022, pursuant to the CEC’s guidelines, which called for updating SMUD’s IRP filing within five years of SMUD’s previous filing of April 29, 2019. SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan built upon the April 2019 IRP and set a goal for zero carbon emissions by 2030. SMUD’s next formal IRP process is expected to be completed and filed with the CEC in 2027. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

The State’s carbon cap-and-trade market established pursuant to Assembly Bill 32 (“AB 32”) began in 2013. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Greenhouse Gas Emissions” for a discussion of AB 32 and the State’s cap-and-trade program. SMUD anticipates that allowances allocated to SMUD will nearly equal SMUD’s compliance obligations under normal water year conditions. Under low water year conditions, SMUD may need to purchase additional allowances to cover its compliance obligations, including carbon obligations related to wholesale energy sales from SMUD’s natural gas power plants. As SMUD implements its clean power goals, SMUD expects its need for these allowances to decline.

There is scientific consensus that increasing concentrations of GHG have caused and will continue to cause a rise in temperatures in the State and around the world. The change in the earth’s average atmospheric temperature, generally referred to as “climate change,” is, among other things, expected to result in a wide range of changes in climate patterns, including increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including droughts and heat waves, more frequent incidences of wildfires, changes in wind patterns, sea level rise and flooding, any of which alone or in combination could materially adversely affect SMUD’s financial results or operations. See also “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION” and “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY – Other Factors.” As described above, SMUD is actively working to meet its sustainable power supply goals.

reduce its own GHG emissions, and assist the local governments in the territory it serves with their desired GHG reductions. In 2016, SMUD introduced the Pilot Natural Refrigerant Incentive Program, its first customer program providing incentives for GHG reduction in addition to kWh savings. SMUD is a founding member and active participant in the Capital Region Climate Readiness Collaborative, a public-private partnership formed to better understand and plan for climate impacts expected in the region. SMUD is also an active member of the United States Department of Energy (the “DOE”) Partnership for Energy Sector Climate Resilience. SMUD regularly reviews scientific findings related to climate change and in 2016 published its Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan. In 2024, SMUD is planning to update the Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan along with other climate resiliency actions.

Energy Storage Systems. Assembly Bill 2514 (“AB 2514”) requires the Board to re-evaluate energy storage goals every three years. In compliance with AB 2514, the Board established a target of 9 MW of energy storage procurement by December 31, 2020, which SMUD has procured. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Energy Storage Systems” for further discussion of AB 2514. In September 2020, the Board directed that energy storage forecasts be implemented through SMUD’s IRP process going forward. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” above for a discussion of SMUD’s IRP. SMUD is also evaluating how to couple utility-scale solar with utility-scale storage to support future system reliability needs and enable energy goals.

Meeting Peak Load. A significant consideration for SMUD will be how it addresses its system peak load. SMUD has implemented programs and tools, such as advanced metering, energy efficiency options, and TOD rates for residential customers, to help customers manage their costs while helping SMUD reduce its peak load. Analysis of 2022 data showed a reduction of approximately 108 MW, weather continue to monitor the progress and results of the implementation of TOD rates and will use this information to inform future rate actions and load forecasts. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Time-of-Day Rates.”

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved an optional residential Critical Peak Pricing rate (the “Peak Pricing Rate”), which went into effect June 1, 2022. The Peak Pricing Rate is designed to reduce load by increasing the price of energy when the grid is most impacted, up to 50 hours per summer. In exchange, customers on the rate will receive a per kWh discount on summer Off-Peak and Mid-Peak rates. SMUD is also exploring the use of more distributed energy resources and demand response programs that could further reduce SMUD’s system peak.

Operational Independence and Local Control. A key component of SMUD’s business strategy is focused on maintaining its independence in operating and maintaining its resources. As such, SMUD has taken a number of actions to mitigate the potential impacts of various federal and state regulatory actions. For example, in 2002 SMUD established itself as an independent control area (now termed “Balancing Authority”) within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (“WECC”) region. By removing itself from CAISO’s Balancing Authority area, SMUD became responsible for balancing electric supply and demand within its own service territory. This move substantially reduced fees paid to CAISO, preserved operational flexibility and helped to insulate SMUD from the uncertain regulatory environment and tariff structure of CAISO. In addition to decreased financial risks, this independence also reduced SMUD’s exposure to the impacts of capacity and energy shortages in the CAISO Balancing Authority area. Further, as an independent Balancing Authority, SMUD continued to support the statewide electric grid in events of electrical emergencies requiring rotating outages, such as loss of major transmission lines or equipment, as provided in the statewide emergency plan. By 2006, the SMUD Balancing Authority footprint expanded north to the California-Oregon border and south to Modesto, to include the service areas of the WAPA, MID, Redding and Roseville, and TANC-owned 340-mile 500-kV California-Oregon Transmission Project.

(“COTP”). In October 2009, SMUD, with the coordination and cooperation of WAPA, joined the Western Power Pool Reserve Sharing Group, which supports reliability and reduces operating costs. In May 2011, BANC assumed the role of the Balancing Authority, though SMUD continues to oversee operation of the grid on behalf of BANC. BANC members share cost responsibility for balancing authority-related compliance obligations, liabilities, and operations. BANC also serves as an important venue for SMUD and other BANC members to collaborate with respect to operational and market improvements inside the BANC footprint and to preserve their operational independence. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.” On April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its participation in BANC, began operating in the CAISO WEIM, which helps SMUD better manage the integration of renewable energy resources. The CAISO WEIM is a voluntary market, which allows SMUD to maintain its operational independence from the CAISO, while providing SMUD greater access to balancing resources throughout the western region. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

Electricity, Natural Gas, and Related Hedging

SMUD continues to utilize a comprehensive and integrated power and fuel supply strategy to acquire a reliable and diversified portfolio of resources to meet existing and future needs. This strategy includes a combination of both physical supply and financial hedging transactions to reduce price risk exposure over a five-year horizon. SMUD’s physical supply arrangements include ownership of power generating resources, as well as a diversified portfolio of power and fuel supply purchase contracts that range in duration, with a mixture of fixed and variable pricing terms.

With regard to the power purchase contracts, SMUD has entered into a series of contracts for the purchase of electricity to meet its resource needs. SMUD also actively manages its exposure on variable rate electricity purchases, and at times may enter into financial contracts to fix prices by using options to reduce price risk, in each case when warranted by economic conditions. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements.”

With regard to fuel supply contracts, SMUD utilizes a similar strategy of employing financial contracts of various durations to hedge its variable rate fuel supply contracts. As of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply – Supply.”

As provided in SMUD’s natural gas contracts, SMUD may be required to post collateral to various counterparties. As of February 29, 2024, SMUD did not have any collateral posting obligations. A decrease in natural gas prices could result in a collateral posting by SMUD. While the posting of collateral is not an expense for SMUD, it does temporarily encumber unrestricted cash balances.

To hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a pass-through rate component called the Hydro Generation Adjustment (the “IGA”), and established a Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund (the “HRSF”). Similarly, to hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a HGA and established a WAPA Rate Stabilization Fund (“WRSF”). These rate stabilization funds and rate pass through mechanisms help to offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs in years where precipitation levels at SMUD-owned and non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities are low. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

![Managing Risks](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Managing+Risks)

**Managing Risks**  
SMUD maintains an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program, a strategic approach to managing enterprise-wide risks as a portfolio, to help reduce the chance of loss, create greater financial stability and protect SMUD resources. It is designed to maintain an early warning system to monitor changes in, and the emergence of, risks that affect the organization’s business objectives. Under the purview of the Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee, composed of executive members and chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, ERM conducts ongoing risk identification, assessments, monitoring, mitigation, risk-based budgeting and reporting. To ensure accountability and oversight, each identified risk is assigned to an executive-level risk owner. Risk status and mitigation efforts are reported monthly to the Board.

**Competitive Challenges**  
In the coming decade, utilities like SMUD may face competition from companies in other industries looking to diversify into the energy sector. Examples of developing competitive areas include retail sale of electricity, distributed electric storage resources, renewable distributed generation (mostly solar in Sacramento), customer installation of fuel cells, third-party electric vehicle charging, home or business automation that enables greater customer participation in energy markets, and third-party provision of energy management software and solutions.

SMUD has a wide range of initiatives to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions and new industry participants. Key areas of focus include:

- **Enhancing customer experience.** Recognizing the importance of meeting customer expectations, SMUD introduced the Customer Experience Strategy in 2016 to provide customers “value for what they pay” and further strengthen customer loyalty. The initiative is focused on ensuring SMUD has the people, systems, technology, programs and services to consistently meet or exceed customers’ changing expectations. The customer experience is measured via surveys with the goal of achieving 80% of customers agreeing that SMUD provides them with value for what they pay by 2030.

- **Restructuring electric rates.** In 2017, the Board approved TOD rates as the standard rate for residential customers. The residential rate transition began in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the full transition was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. All of SMUD’s business customers are also on time-based rates. In 2019, the Board approved a restructuring of commercial rates to collect a greater portion of fixed costs through fixed charges and to better align time periods and prices with energy markets. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges” and “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

- **Ongoing integrated resource planning.** SMUD monitors and updates its integrated resource planning to ensure future sources of energy balance cost, reliability and environmental requirements with the flexibility to meet challenges of changing market and regulatory conditions, customer energy resources, and emerging technologies.

**Leveraging Core Competencies**  
In addition to these initiatives, SMUD is leveraging core competencies to improve industry safety and help communities serve their customers’ energy needs.

![Sacramento Power Academy](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**Sacramento Power Academy.** The Sacramento Power Academy is SMUD’s operational training center providing training support for all of SMUD’s skilled trades professionals. Operating on a 10-acre training facility the academy oversees SMUD’s 14 skilled trades apprenticeships. The academy’s experienced training professionals serve as liaisons and mentors to apprentices progressing through on-the-job training, program testing, night schooling, and extensive training components. The academy also ensures SMUD’s skilled trades professionals are safe and compliant by coordinating and delivering annual regulatory and safety training. The academy is also a workforce development hub utilized by SMUD to increase awareness of and interest in skilled trades careers at SMUD, in SMUD’s community, and in the utility industry.

**Community Energy Services.** In 2002, Assembly Bill 117 was passed to establish Community Choice Aggregation in the State by authorizing Community Choice Aggregators (“CCAs”) to aggregate customer electric load and purchase electricity for customers. SMUD’s Community Energy Services department was established in 2017 to support organizations with values closely aligned with SMUD’s values, while also generating additional revenue for SMUD. CCA programs are proliferating in the State thanks to support for expanding renewable energy use and desire for local control particularly for electricity procurement. There are numerous CCAs operating in the State, and more are anticipated to launch in the future. CCAs are responsible for procuring wholesale power, setting the generation rate, and staffing a call center to handle opt-outs and questions about the power portfolio. The local investor-owned utility (“IOU”) continues to deliver electricity from the electric grid, maintain its electric infrastructure, bill customers and collect payments.

In October 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Valley Clean Energy (“VCE”) to provide technical, energy and support services, including data management and call center services, wholesale energy services, and business operations support, to VCE for a term set to end in 2023. SMUD and VCE recently executed a new contract for data management, contact center, consulting and debt collection services that expires on December 31, 2028. VCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the City of Woodland, the City of Davis and Yolo County to implement a local CCA program. The service territory expanded to include the City of Winters in 2021. The mission of VCE is to deliver cost-competitive clean electricity, product choice, price stability, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions reductions to its customers in Yolo County. VCE began electric services to its customers in the summer of 2018, giving Yolo County residents a choice between two electricity providers, VCE and PG&E.

In November 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of East Bay Community Energy (“EBCE”) to provide call center and data management services for a three-year term beginning in January 2018. SMUD signed a new contract with EBCE in January 2022 for call center and data management services for an additional three-year term. EBCE recently changed its name to Ava Community Energy (“Ava”). Ava is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Oakland, Piedmont, San Leandro and Union City in Alameda County to implement a local CCA program. Ava expanded its territory to the cities of Pleasanton, Newark, and Tracy in April 2021.

In June 2019, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Silicon Valley Clean Energy (“SVCE”) to provide program services to help local SVCE communities reduce carbon pollution while delivering engaging customer experiences. SVCE programs are focused on grid integration, as well as electrifying transportation, buildings and homes. This contract was extended through September of 2024. In June 2023, SMUD was selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s concierge service vendor for three years. In December 2023, SMUD was again selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s programs administrator for five years. SVCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Campbell, Cupertino, Gilroy, Lost Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos, Milpitas, Monte Sereno, Morgan Hill,

Mountain View, Saratoga, Sunnyvale and Unincorporated Santa Clara County to implement a local CCA program.

In July 2022, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Marin Clean Energy (“MCE”) to provide data management, billing, data analytic and system assessment services to MCE. MCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2010 and represents 37 member communities across four Bay Area counties: Contra Costa, Marin, Napa and Solano.

In September 2022, SMUD was selected through a competitive process by the governing board of Sonoma Clean Power (“SCP”) to provide market research services to SCP. In January of 2023, SMUD was selected to provide strategic consulting services, providing recommendations related to programs and marketing. SCP is a joint powers agency that serves Sonoma and Mendocino counties.

While CCAs have had success in the State, they are susceptible to business, regulatory and other risks that could lead to a financial loss and/or result in a cessation of operations for the CCA. These risks could extend to a CCA’s counterparties, including SMUD. SMUD has made an effort to identify and mitigate potential counterparty risks to the extent possible in service agreements with the CCAs described above. SMUD may pursue opportunities to provide similar services to additional CCAs in the future. SMUD management does not expect its current arrangements to have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

## FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION

### Precipitation Variability

SMUD uses a precipitation measuring station located at Fresh Pond, California to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s Upper American River Project (the “UARP”) hydropower reservoir. As of January 31, 2024, precipitation at Fresh Pond, California totaled 21 inches for the October-September hydropower water supply period. This is 75% of the 50-year rolling median of 28 inches. Total reservoir storage in the UARP hydropower reservoirs was 238 thousand acre-feet as of January 31, 2024, which was about 63% of capacity and approximately 6% above the historical average. SMUD manages its reservoirs to maximize water storage going into the summer season, which preserves generating capacity during SMUD’s high load months and ensures that SMUD meets its UARP FERC license requirements, including requirements for recreational and environmental flows.

There can be wide swings in precipitation from year to year. In years with below average rainfall, SMUD may have to generate or purchase replacement energy at additional cost. To hedge against variations in the volume of energy received from SMUD-owned UARP hydroelectric resources, SMUD uses the HRSF to help offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

SMUD is also exposed to precipitation variability through its contract with the WAPA. In an average water year this contract provides roughly 661 gigawatt hours (“GWh”) of power. WAPA’s actual deliveries are based on hydroelectric generation (minus energy used for pumping) at Central Valley Project reservoirs in Northern California, which varies based on annual precipitation patterns, water deliveries for agriculture, and flow requirements in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Unlike the UARP, SMUD does not monitor precipitation stations to approximate power deliveries under the WAPA contract, and instead relies on a forecast of power deliveries from WAPA. As of January 31, 2024, WAPA has forecasted power deliveries of 703 GWh for 2024, approximately 6% more than an average water year. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration.”

# Wildfires

## General
Wildfires in the State have become increasingly common and destructive. Frequent drought conditions and unseasonably warm temperatures have increased, and could further increase, the possibility of wildfires occurring in areas where SMUD maintains generation, transmission and distribution facilities. The number of diseased and dead trees has increased, and could further increase this possibility. As a result, SMUD faces an increased risk that it may be required to pay for wildfire related property damage or
<!-- Page 308 -->
![Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory)](https://example.com/image.png)

**Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory).** In 2018, the CPUC approved a new statewide fire map that identifies areas of elevated and extreme wildfire risk from utility-associated assets located throughout the State. SMUD directly participated in the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map. In connection with the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map, a peer review and a team of independent nationwide experts led by Cal Fire affirmed that SMUD’s electric service area is properly located outside of these elevated (“Tier 2”) and extreme (“Tier 3”) high fire threat areas; however, SMUD’s UARP facilities are located within both Tier 2 and Tier 3 areas. According to the CPUC, Tier 2 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an elevated wildfire risk from utility assets and Tier 3 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an extreme risk from utility assets. As of June 8, 2021, approximately 37 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 19 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. SMUD is also a member of TANC. As of July 2022, approximately 116.3 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 4.5 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. In accordance with its FERC license, SMUD adheres to a FERC-approved Fire Prevention and Response Plan for its UARP facilities. On May 17, 2018, in accordance with State law, SMUD’s Board of Directors determined that the UARP area may have a “significant risk of catastrophic wildfire” resulting from overhead electric facilities and that SMUD’s FERC-approved UARP Fire Prevention and Response Plan meets requirements for presenting wildfire mitigation measures to the Board for its approval.

**Wildfire Mitigation.** In response to potential wildfire risk, SMUD has implemented and is continuing to implement a series of measures intended to prevent wildfires from occurring, minimize the spread of any fire that does occur and improve the resiliency of its system. These measures include an increase in the number of inspections for fuel reduction inside and adjacent to rights-of-ways, utilization of Cal Fire-approved vegetation management to reduce the risk of spark generation; enhanced inspection and maintenance programs; increased use of ignition reduction techniques, including undergrounding of conductors; increased monitoring of identified responses to fire conditions, including operational procedures for the de-energization of lines during high fire conditions; and elimination of automatic reclosing on SMUD’s transmission lines and on SMUD’s distribution lines in certain areas during fire season.

SMUD’s proactive approach to vegetation management has been expanded to include the use of advanced technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (“LiDAR”), ortho and oblique imagery that is used to pinpoint tree health and/or condition that may not yet be visible to the naked eye. In addition, SMUD has installed additional weather stations in transmission corridors and substations for increased situational awareness and has continued coordination and collaboration with local agencies and first responders as well as vulnerable populations.

State legislation enacted in 2018 and 2019 (SB 901 and AB 1054, respectively) requires publicly owned utilities (“POUs”) to prepare and present Wildfire Mitigation Plans to their governing boards by January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter. SB 901 requires POUs, including SMUD, before January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter, to prepare a wildfire mitigation plan and present it in a public meeting to their governing board. SB 901 requires POU’s to accept comments on the wildfire mitigation plan from the public, other local and State agencies, and interested parties, and to verify that the plan complies with all applicable rules, regulations, and standards, as appropriate. The bill requires a qualified independent evaluator to review and assess the comprehensiveness of its wildfire mitigation plan and present its report to the board in a public meeting. AB 1054 created a new Wildfire Safety Division within the CPUC to prioritize wildfire safety throughout the State, and established an appointed Wildfire Safety Advisory Board (“WSAB”) to advise and make recommendations relating to wildfire safety to this new Division. For POUs, the bill requires submittal of annual wildfire mitigation plans to the WSAB for review and advisory opinions relating to the content and sufficiency of the plans.

A-18
<!-- Page 309 -->
SMUD assembled an enterprise-wide team of subject-matter experts to prepare its plan in compliance with this legislation. SMUD’s initial Wildfire Mitigation Plan (“WMP”) was adopted by the Board in the fourth quarter of 2019, after circulation for public comment and review of the comprehensiveness of the plan by a qualified independent evaluator. The WMP and evaluator’s report were submitted to the WSAB in 2020.

SMUD reviews its WMP each year, presenting the updated plan to the Board for adoption at duly noticed public meetings. The updated plans and evaluator reports are submitted to the WSAB for advisory opinion and recommendations. SMUD responds to the WSAB’s comments regarding SMUD’s WMP as part of its WMP process. SMUD will continue to annually review and update its WMP, conducting a comprehensive review at least every third year.

SMUD recently completed a comprehensive review and update of its WMP after soliciting public input and independent evaluation. The 2023-2025 WMP was adopted by the Board on June 15, 2023, and duly submitted to the WSAB.

**Wildfire Insurance.** Wildfires both in California and nationally have not only increased potential liability for utilities, but have also adversely impacted the insurance markets, leading to higher costs for coverage; coverages becoming prohibitively expensive; limited or restricted coverage to certain types of risks; or coverage at insufficient levels. SMUD most recently renewed its general and wildfire liability insurance coverage on June 15, 2023, increasing the coverage limit by $25 million to $275 million. SMUD increased the commercially insured portion of its wildfire coverage program from $176 million to $212.5 million and maintained the self-insured layers and quota share portions of the coverage at $6.5 million.

In addition, it is expected that SMUD will have a portion of the $500 million aggregate limit amount of its commercial paper and line of credit program to provide operational flexibility in the event of the occurrence of a wildfire or other operational event. However, SMUD has not covenanted to maintain the availability of the commercial paper program and line of credit program for these purposes and no assurances can be given that the commercial paper and line of credit program will be available at the time of, or during, such an event.

**August 2020 Heat Wave**

The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from August 14, 2020 through August 18, 2020. The CAISO was forced to institute rotating electricity outages in the State during this extreme heat wave. SMUD, as a member of BANC, and being outside of the CAISO did not have to implement any planned power disruptions. Additionally, SMUD was able to support the CAISO during some hours of the heat wave with both requested emergency assistance and wholesale market sales. SMUD’s peak demand between August 14, 2020 and August 18, 2020, varied between 2,874 MW and 3,057 MW, well below SMUD’s record peak of 3,299 MW.

**September 2022 Heat Wave**

The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from September 5, 2022 through September 8, 2022. On September 6, 2022, SMUD experienced its second highest peak demand of 3,263 MW. SMUD did not have to implement any planned power disruptions.

**Storm Damage**

In January 2023, SMUD experienced a series of winter storms that brought heavy rains and high winds causing damage to SMUD’s grid and widespread outages for SMUD’s customers. By the time the  
A-19

**storm response was complete, SMUD had experienced the largest mobilization of personnel and restoration crews in its history. SMUD incurred costs related to removing downed trees, restoring power from downed poles and broken lines, replenishing inventory, communicating with and providing assistance to customers, maintaining IT systems, and coordinating with local emergency agencies. SMUD is pursuing claims with Federal and State agencies to attempt to recover certain of SMUD’s costs related to the storms. The material financial impacts have been reflected in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, [which are included in APPENDIX B].**

**Cosumnes Power Plant Outage**

On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant (as defined herein) was shut down due to a ground fault in the Steam Turbine Generator (“STG”) stator. The ground fault was caused by delamination of the insulation on one of the through bolts. Damage from the ground fault resulted in a full rewind and restack of the stator core, replacement of all stator through bolts, and a full rewind of turbine rotor. The Cosumnes Power Plant repairs were completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. During the extended outage, SMUD shifted generation to the other local gas-fired plants and the Sutter Energy Center and procured additional energy and resource adequacy capacity. SMUD also requested and received approval from the California Air Quality Board and California Energy Commission to operate one or both of the gas turbines without the STG. During the September 2022 heatwave, both of the gas turbines at the Cosumnes Power Plant were operated without the STG, providing 270 MW at peak.

To mitigate the financial impact of unplanned outages from its thermal assets, SMUD carries commercial property insurance with a business interruption endorsement. At the time of the loss, the coverage provided up to $30.8 million of business interruption recovery per month at the Cosumnes Power Plant, with a sub-limit of $310 million over any 18-month period. During the period of loss, the claims were subject to a $5 million equipment damage deductible and a 60-day business interruption claims waiting period.

SMUD has settled the equipment damage portion of the loss for $18.6 million, resulting in a $13.6 million recovery. The business interruption portion of the claim remains in process, with SMUD receiving a $50 million advance in December of 2022. As of January 2024, the carriers have confirmed an additional $51 million in undisputed recovery, which is anticipated to be received in the first quarter of 2024. Thus far, SMUD has recovered $114.6 million of the loss and will continue to work toward full settlement of the disputed portion of the claim, which is approximately $68 million.

**Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic**

While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD has lessened since the height of the pandemic in 2020, SMUD is still experiencing impacts from the pandemic. However, compared to weather adjusted load levels, SMUD’s overall load is near or above pre-pandemic levels.

Part of the governmental response to the economic consequences of the pandemic required utility providers (including SMUD) to provide additional grace periods and flexible payment plans for the payment of utility bills or to refrain from pursuing collection remedies for unpaid bills for a period of time. SMUD also implemented a no-shutoff policy through January 2022 under which SMUD did not disconnect power to a customer for non-payment of their electric bill. Beginning in February 2022, SMUD resumed its normal payment, late fee, and disconnection process and began disconnections of unpaid accounts in late April 2022. As a result, SMUD has experienced an increase in delinquencies for customer electric accounts versus pre-pandemic levels. In December 2021, SMUD received $41 million from the California Arrearage Payment Program (“CAPP”) initial funding, and an additional $9.9 million in 2022. All funds were applied to delinquent balances. As of December 31, 2023, the total delinquencies for customer electric

**A-20**
<!-- Page 311 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

accounts were $38.2 million, after the CAPP credit, which is an increase from the February 2020 balance of total delinquencies for customer electric accounts of $16.9 million. The financial impacts stemming from delinquent accounts have been accounted for in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the preceding years. Any successful recovery of delinquent accounts will contribute to an increase in net income.

SMUD also paused the recertification process for existing customers in SMUD’s low-income discount program during the pandemic. The number of customers participating in the low-income assistance program increased by 16,407, or approximately 22% from February 2020 to December 2023. SMUD has resumed the recertification process for existing customers in the low-income discount program in 2023.

While the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD have lessened, if the pandemic and its consequences again become more severe or another similar event occurs, the impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations could be material.

## RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE

### Rates and Charges

SMUD’s Board of Directors has autonomous authority to establish the rates charged for all SMUD services. Unlike IOUs and some other municipal utility systems, retail rate and revenue levels are not subject to review or regulation by any other federal, State or local governmental agencies. Changes to SMUD rates only require formal action by the Board of Directors after two public workshops and a public hearing. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government. SMUD typically reviews and sets rates on a two-year cycle.

### 2019 Rate Action.

On June 24, 2019, the Board approved a 3.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2020, a 3.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2020, a 2.50% rate increase effective January 1, 2021, and a 2.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2021, for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved a restructuring of the commercial rates, including new time periods and an overall increase in the fixed bill components, such as the System Infrastructure Fixed Charge and demand charges, and a corresponding decrease in energy charges, making the restructuring revenue neutral by rate category. To minimize bill impacts, rate categories will be restructured over an eight-year period.

### 2021 Rate Action.

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved a 1.5% rate increase effective March 1, 2022 and a 2.0% rate increase effective January 1, 2023 for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved the Solar and Storage Rate, the optional residential Peak Pricing Rate, and updates to certain schedules of SMUD’s Open Access Transmission Tariff (“OATT”). The Board also approved a new timeline for the commercial rate restructure transition, and all impacted commercial customers were transitioned to the new rates by the end of the first quarter of 2022.

SMUD also implemented a solar interconnection fee based on the size of solar interconnection and supporting programs such as battery incentives, incentives to enroll in SMUD’s Peak Pricing Rate, battery incentives for Virtual Power Plants, and a program to bring the benefits of solar to under-resourced multi-family communities. These programs and fees are not subject to Board approval.
<!-- Page 312 -->
![2023 Rate Action](https://example.com/image.png)

**2023 Rate Action**

On September 21, 2023, the Board approved a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2025, and a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2025 for all customer classes. The Board also approved establishing the Energy Assistance Program Rate (“EAPR”) Rate Stabilization Fund, which will provide an additional discount to those low-income customers with the greatest need. The discount will be funded with discretionary, non-retail rate revenue, as to not have an impact on any future required rate changes. There is currently pending litigation concerning the adoption of the 2023 rates. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”

**Rate Stabilization Funds**

The Rate Stabilization Fund (“RSF”) is maintained by SMUD to reduce the need for future rate increases when costs exceed existing rates. At the direction of the Board, amounts may be either transferred into the RSF (which reduces revenues) or transferred out of the RSF (which increases revenues). The Board authorizes RSF transfers on an event driven basis. The RSF includes funds to hedge variations in the volume of energy received from WAPA hydroelectric generation, variation in AB 32 revenue and variations in Low Carbon Fuel Credit (“LCFS”) revenue. As of December 31, 2023, the balance in the RSF was $115.8 million, which is approximately 7.2% of annual retail revenue.

Effective July 2008, SMUD implemented the HGA, which is a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from the UARP (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric”). The HGA is designed to increase the deposits to the HRSF in wet years when SMUD has more hydroelectric generation than expected. Each year SMUD determines the impact of precipitation variances on projected hydroelectric generation from the UARP. When the precipitation variance results in a deficiency of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, transfers from the HRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is zero. When the precipitation variance results in a projected surplus of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, deposits will be made into the HRSF in an amount approximating the positive impact to SMUD from the surplus hydroelectric generation (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is not sufficient to cover transfers that would otherwise be made in the event of a projected deficiency in UARP hydroelectric generation, a 12-month HGA surcharge will automatically be included on customers’ electric bills at a level that generates up to 4% of retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue on any precipitation variance calculation date and the precipitation variance results in a projected UARP hydroelectric generation surplus, the positive impact of the surplus may be used for other purposes at staff’s recommendation, with the approval of the Board, including returned to customers through an electric bill discount up to 4% of retail revenue. SMUD calculates HRSF transfers based on an April-March (water year) precipitation period at Fresh Pond, California. This precipitation station is used to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s UARP hydropower reservoirs. As of January 31, 2024, and based on the current HRSF water year precipitation forecast, SMUD anticipates transferring $20.8 million out of the HRSF in April 2024.

In September 2023, SMUD added a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from WAPA. Each year SMUD determines the WAPA Energy Delivery Variance (“EDV”) based on forecasted energy delivery minus the actual energy delivery. When the EDV variance is positive, transfers from the WRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 2% of cash).

**Low Income Discount**

As of December 2023, approximately 91,407 customers received the low-income discount offered by SMUD, which represents approximately 16% of all residential customers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, SMUD suspended recertification during the pandemic. In 2023, the total discount was approximately $32.7 million. As a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn, SMUD experienced an increase in low-income discount applicants. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

While the low-income discount has provided substantial benefits to low-income customer bills for years, multiple economic variables, such as inflation and rate increases, have had disproportionately negative impacts on low-income customers, particularly those in the 0-50% Federal Poverty Level (“FPL”). In 2023, SMUD established an EAPR Rate Stabilization Fund (“ERSF”) to provide an additional discount to the electricity usage charge up to an established maximum discount (“ERSF Additional Discount”) for customers in the 0-50% FPL. The ERSF is funded by discretionary non-retail rate revenue, reviewed on an annual basis, and the specific monthly ERSF Additional Discount is set before the year the value is in effect. SMUD expanded its programs and services starting in 2016 to help customers with energy assistance, home improvement packages, and education. SMUD is creating tailored solutions to best meet the needs of low-income customers. These solutions include free solar panels and inspecting homes to identify energy saving and fuel switching opportunities. As of December 2023, SMUD has performed 30,000 energy retrofits and, in partnership with Grid Alternatives (a non-profit organization that focuses on implementing solar power and energy efficiency for low-income families), 230 customers have benefited from free solar installations. Forty-eight additional homes received solar and energy efficiency through a partnership with Habitat for Humanity of Greater Sacramento. As part of SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan and the focus on building electrification, SMUD has also been ramping up electrification investments for low-income customers. Additionally, since 2019, SMUD has assisted more than 2,600 households with electrification upgrades. Additionally, SMUD has installed nearly 450 electric vehicle chargers and more than 400 electric vehicle circuits in low-income households or areas that serve low-income customers.

# Customer Base; Largest Customers

A stabilizing influence on SMUD’s revenues is that a substantial proportion is derived from residential customers (49.2% in 2023). Historically, revenue from commercial and industrial consumption has been more sensitive to economic fluctuation. Furthermore, SMUD has no dominant customers that account for a significant percentage of annual revenues. In 2023, no single customer contributed more than 3% of revenues. The top ten customers generated approximately 9% of revenues and the top 30 generated approximately 15% of revenues. The following table presents information on SMUD’s top ten customers as of December 31, 2023.

# Power Generation Facilities

## Hydroelectric
The UARP consists of three relatively large storage reservoirs (Union Valley, Loon Lake and Ice House) with an aggregate water storage capacity of approximately 400,000 acre-feet and eight small reservoirs. Project facilities also include eight tunnels with a combined length of over 26 miles and eight powerhouses containing 11 turbines. In addition to providing clean hydroelectric power and operating flexibility for SMUD, the UARP area provides habitat for fish and wildlife and a variety of recreational opportunities, including camping, fishing, boating, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking and cross-country skiing.

The combined capacity of the UARP is approximately 685 MW at SMUD’s load center in Sacramento. Under current licensing and mean water conditions, these facilities are expected to generate approximately 1,600 GWh of electric energy annually, which represents approximately 15% of SMUD’s current average annual retail energy requirements. In 1957, the Federal Power Commission (predecessor agency to FERC) issued a license to SMUD for the UARP. This 50-year license was subsequently amended to add and upgrade facilities and now includes all segments of SMUD’s hydroelectric facilities located on the South Fork of the American River and its tributaries upstream from the Chili Bar Project (described below). On July 23, 2014, FERC issued to SMUD a new 50-year license for the UARP.

On November 9, 2016 FERC issued an Order authorizing SMUD to construct the South Fork Powerhouse downstream of the UARP’s Slab Creek Dam. Construction was substantially completed in the fall of 2020, and the new powerhouse was placed into operation on October 25, 2022, adding 1.8 MW of generation to the UARP’s overall capacity.

On June 16, 2021, pursuant to Board authorization, SMUD approved the Chili Bar Hydroelectric Project which consists of a 7 MW powerhouse, reservoir, dam and spillway, north of Placerville on the South Fork of the American River for approximately $10.4 million (the “Chili Bar Project”). The Chili Bar Project is immediately downstream from the UARP and operates as the regulating reservoir for the UARP’s largest powerhouse. Owning the UARP and the Chili Bar Project enables SMUD to operate the two projects with a holistic approach to license compliance and generation efficiency.

## Solano 2 Wind Project
SMUD owns and operates an 87 MW wind project, located in Solano County, known as Solano 2. Solano 2 consists of 29 wind turbine generators (“WTGs”) rated at 3.0 MW. Energy from the project is collected at 21 kV and transmitted over a dedicated 3-mile overhead system to the SMUD-owned Russell substation. At the Russell facility, the energy is transformed to 230 kV and interconnected to PG&E’s Birds Landing Switching Station. Energy deliveries are scheduled through the CAISO.

## Solano 3 Project
In 2011 and 2012, SMUD constructed a 128 MW wind project adjacent to Solano Phase 2, known as Solano 3. The Solano 3 project consists of 31 WTGs rated at 1.8 MW and 24 WTGs rated at 3.0 MW. The project interconnects through a 34.5 kV underground collection system to the Russell substation. Like the Solano Phase 2 project, this energy is transformed to 230 kV and delivered through the CAISO.

## Solano 4 Project
SMUD has developed the Solano 4 Wind Project on land with a wind easement owned by SMUD near the Solano 3 project, known as the Collinsville and Roberts properties, to install 10 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW, and to remove the Solano 1 turbines and replace them with 9 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW. SMUD has met all of the CAISO requirements and has executed a Large Generator Interconnection Agreement (“GLIA”) as of June 2021 that will allow for 90.8 MW of capacity at the point of interconnection. In April 2021, SMUD submitted an application for advisory review by the Solano County Airport Land Use Commission (the “Solano ALUC”) of the Solano 4 Wind Project’s consistency.

with the 2015 Travis Air Force Base Land Use Compatibility Plan (the “Travis Plan”). In May 2021, the Solano ALUC purported to resolve that the Solano 4 Wind Project was inconsistent with the Travis Plan. In August 2021, the Board approved the Project Environmental Impact Report, made findings overriding the Solano ALUC’s finding of inconsistency, made findings there was no alternative to the project, and approved the Solano 4 Wind Project. In September 2021, Solano County filed a writ petition challenging SMUD’s approval of the Solano 4 Wind Project based on procedural, environmental, zoning and land use grounds. The parties entered into a settlement agreement on December 14, 2022, and the suit was dismissed on January 10, 2023. The settlement agreement allows for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project as planned.

In addition, SMUD applied for and obtained extensions of the Federal Aviation Administration Determinations of No Hazard allowing for construction of the turbines. A contract for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project was awarded to Vestas Corporation and the Solano 4 Wind Project is currently under construction. The expected operation date for the Solano 4 Wind Project is May 2024. PG&E identified upgrades needed to interconnect the Solano 4 Wind Project that will not be complete before the expected Solano 4 commercial operation date. PG&E has an approved project and expects to complete the needed upgrades by May of 2025. Realization of the full capacity of the Solano 4 Wind Project may be delayed into the second quarter of 2025 due to the timeframe established for the PG&E required transmission upgrades. SMUD has developed a mitigation plan for the limited interconnection capacity for the first year of operation, in coordination with CAISO and PG&E, of using all of the existing SMUD Solano Russell substation interconnection capacity combined for the dispatch of all the Solano Wind Project. SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process, which combines all phases of the Solano 4 Wind Project so it may operate as one project. This was fully executed by SMUD, CAISO, and PG&E on February 27, 2023.

As of the end of 2023, all of the turbine site delivery roads and foundations for the Solano 4 Project have been completed, all of the turbine components have been delivered to the Solano 4 Project site and 10 of the Solano 4 Project turbines have been fully erected.

At the completion of the Solano 4 project, SMUD will have an installed wind capacity of 303 MW in connection with the overall Solano Wind Project, leaving 18 MW at the point of interconnection for future development.

**Distributed Solar Photovoltaic.** SMUD owns and operates approximately 2 MW of solar photovoltaic generating facilities. These facilities include installations at the Hedge Substation property, SMUD Headquarters, the East Campus Operations Center, and other smaller photovoltaic systems throughout the service area on parking lots.

**Hedge Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 4 MW, 8 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached commercial operation in January 2023.

**ESS Flow Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 0.45 MW, 3 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached test operation in September 2023, and commercial operation is planned for March 2024.

**Local Gas-Fired Plants.** SMUD constructed five local natural gas-fired plants in its service area: the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, the Campbell Soup Project, McClellan and the Cosumnes Power Plant (each defined below). These five plants are referred to collectively as the “Local Gas-Fired Plants.” These plants are a strategic component of SMUD’s resource mix. In addition to providing SMUD a total capacity of approximately 1,139 MW, the Local Gas-Fired Plants provide SMUD with needed

**Local Gas-Fired Plants Overview**

SMUD has entered into long-term agreements with SFA providing for the purchase by SMUD of all of the power from each of the Local Gas-Fired Plants on a take-or-pay basis. This consolidation created operational and administrative efficiencies without changing any of the functionality of the power plants. Although the Local Gas-Fired Plants are owned by SFA, SMUD has exclusive control of their dispatch and manages their operations as part of its overall power supply strategy.

Payments under the power purchase agreements are payable from the revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of the principal of or interest on SMUD’s Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the caption “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below), as are other maintenance and operation costs and energy payments. For further discussion of SMUD’s obligations to make these payments to SFA, see “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Joint Powers Authorities.”

**Description of the Five Local Gas-Fired Plants:**

1. **The Cosumnes Power Plant (the “Cosumnes Power Plant”)**  
   The Cosumnes Power Plant is a 612 MW natural gas-fired, combined cycle plant located in the southern portion of Sacramento County adjacent to SMUD’s decommissioned Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant. Commercial operation of the Cosumnes Power Plant commenced on February 24, 2006. SFA increased the net generating capacity of the facility by 81 MWs via an Advanced Gas Path (“AGP”) upgrade. The additional AGP generation was realized after hardware and software upgrades were completed. The Cosumnes Power Plant is owned by SFA, a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and MID. The existing take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA expires no earlier than when the related bonds have been paid in full (the outstanding related bonds are scheduled to mature on July 1, 2030). On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant was shut down due to a ground fault in the STG stator. The repair was completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Cosumnes Power Plant Outage”.

2. **The Carson Cogeneration Project (the “Carson Project”)**  
   The Carson Project, a 103 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project consisting of separate cycle and peaking plants, provides steam to the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) wastewater treatment plant adjacent to the site. The Carson Project was originally owned by the Central Valley Financing Authority (“CVFA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and the SRCSD. Construction of the Carson Project was completed and the plant began commercial operation on October 11, 1995. The CVFA bonds issued to finance the Carson Project were defeased in September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Carson Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

3. **The Procter & Gamble Cogeneration Project (the “Procter & Gamble Project”)**  
   The Procter & Gamble Project, a 182 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, is located in an established industrial area of Sacramento. The initial combined cycle portion of the plant began commercial operation on March 1, 1997. Construction of the peaking plant portion of the Procter & Gamble Project commenced during 2000 and the unit achieved commercial status on April 24, 2001. The Procter & Gamble Project produces steam for use in Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Company’s oleochemical manufacturing processes and electricity for sale to SMUD. The Procter & Gamble Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Cogeneration Authority (“SCA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA, a separate joint powers authority. The SCA bonds issued to finance the Procter & Gamble Project were defeased in
<!-- Page 322 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Procter & Gamble Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Procter & Gamble Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

**The Campbell Soup Cogeneration Project (the “Campbell Soup Project”).** The Campbell Soup Project, a 170 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project, was completed and began commercial operations on December 4, 1997. Upgrades were implemented during 2000, which increased the plant’s peaking capacity to 180 MW, well above its net demonstrated capacity of 159.8 MW. The plant is located in south Sacramento adjacent to the Capital Commerce Center (formerly the Campbell Soup Company food processing facility). The Campbell Soup Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Power Authority (“SPA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA. The SPA bonds issued to finance the Campbell Soup Project were redeemed in July 2015. In late 2021, ownership of the Campbell Soup Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Campbell Soup Project (the “Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA”) covers both the Campbell Soup Project and McClellan and will be in effect until terminated by SMUD. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing the Campbell Soup Project in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

**The McClellan Gas Turbine (“McClellan”).** McClellan is a 72 MW natural gas-fired simple cycle combustion turbine generating plant at McClellan Business Park in Sacramento. This turbine is connected to SMUD’s electric system and is operated to meet SMUD’s peak-load requirements. McClellan is aligned for remote starting and operation with black start and fast start capabilities. SMUD constructed the McClellan unit in 1986 as a 50 MW emergency power source for the McClellan Air Force Base. In 2001, following the closure of the Air Force base, McClellan was repurposed for SMUD’s use. In May 2007, SMUD transferred ownership of McClellan to SPA for more efficient operation. SPA did not issue debt related to McClellan. In late 2021, ownership of McClellan was transferred to SFA. SFA pays all costs of operations and maintenance through to SMUD in accordance with the terms of the Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA. In exchange for paying all costs related to McClellan, SMUD receives all of the power generated thereby on a take-or-pay basis. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing McClellan in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

**Fuel Supply**

**General.** SMUD is obligated to arrange for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Management of the natural gas procurement and delivery process is a key focus of SMUD’s reliability and risk policies. Although the natural gas consumption of the power plants for SMUD’s load can vary significantly depending on the season, precipitation, and the market price of power and natural gas, the plants are forecasted to need, on average in 2024, a total of approximately 91,000 Decatherms per day (“Dth/day”) with a daily peak slightly more than 171,000 Dth/day of natural gas. SMUD has implemented a comprehensive strategy to secure a reliable and diversified fuel supply through a variety of agreements for the supply, transportation, and storage of natural gas.

**Supply.** SMUD hedges a significant portion of its expected gas needs to meet customer power requirements. This includes gas for the Local Gas-Fired Plants and for the Sutter Energy Center. See “Power Purchase Agreements – Sutter Energy Center”. This is accomplished through a combination of long-term supply arrangements and an exposure reduction program. The program consists of a primarily rolling three-year exposure reduction component, a fuel hedging component on a rolling three-year basis, as well as supplemental fixed calendar year components reaching out up to five calendar years. Long-term

A-32
<!-- Page 323 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

arrangements may consist of a combination of physical commodity supply contracts, financial hedges, or options. Natural gas is purchased from a wide variety of producers and marketers at the northern and southern California borders, and from the San Juan and the Rocky Mountain supply basins. SMUD has a number of both fixed-price supply agreements and financial hedging contracts to fix gas costs ranging from one month to several years in duration. Including fixed price biogas contracts as of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted.

SMUD has contracted with NCGA to purchase an approximate average of 8,700 Dth/day over the remaining life of a contract expiring May 31, 2027 (the “NCGA Contract”). Under the NCGA contract, SMUD pays a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. Until November 1, 2023 the delivery point for the NCGA Contract was the AECO hub in Alberta. Starting November 1, 2023, to increase delivery efficiencies, SMUD has exchanged the gas delivered at the AECO hub under the NCGA Contract with gas delivered at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border. From there SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants.

SMUD has also contracted with NCEA to purchase an approximately 22,000 Dth/day on average, or to be converted to the appropriate cash flow value in Megawatt-hours (“MWh”) of electricity over the remaining life of a contract expiring on May 31, 2049. The gas will be delivered to the SMUD system via the Malin receipt point on the PG&E backbone system. SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants. SMUD will pay a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. In connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement), SMUD expects to amend and restate the contract with NCEA in connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement.) [adjust for 2024 Senior Bonds offering documents]

**Renewable Natural Gas Supply.** As a component of meeting SMUD’s RPS goals, SMUD procures renewable natural gas and digesters gas as fuels to generate renewable electricity from the Cosumnes Power Plant. Descriptions of the renewable natural gas supply agreements are provided below.

In March 2009, SMUD entered into a 15-year contract (that qualifies as renewable energy) with Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. (“Shell Energy”) to purchase up to 6,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from a landfill project in Texas. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in April 2009. In March 2012, SMUD amended the contract with Shell Energy to increase the maximum volumes to 7,300 Dth/day and extended the term by 10 years to March 31, 2034. Currently, the delivery point is PG&E Topock and SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In 2016, SMUD entered into a 3-year contract with Shell Energy to sell back the entire volume of renewable natural gas purchased, less 500 Dth/day, to be sold into the vehicle transportation markets. Upon expiration of the initial 3-year contract for the sale of biogas to Shell Energy, SMUD extended the sell back of the entire volume of biogas twice for an additional three years with Element Markets (now RNG, LLC), starting in 2020 and 2023. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

SMUD contracted with Heartland Renewable Energy, LLC (“HRE”) in December 2009 for a 20-year supply of up to 7,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas from a digester facility in Colorado. Deliveries began in March of 2014. Currently, the delivery point is Opal, Wyoming and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. HRE has not delivered volumes from the project to SMUD since December 2016 due to litigation with Weld County, Colorado regarding odor and

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

permit issues. EDF Renewables, the majority owner of HRE, notified SMUD in August of 2017 that it is in discussions with a short list of bidders to sell its interests in the facility. In June of 2020, the project was purchased and SMUD’s contract was assigned to the new owner, Platte River Biogas, LLC (“PRB”). SMUD and PRB reached a settlement in the third quarter of 2021 that could lead to terminating the contract.

In September 2011, SMUD and CVFA entered into a “Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement” through which the Carson Project cleans nearly all of the digester gas received from Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) and sells it to SMUD for delivery to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In return, SMUD pays all of the Carson Project’s costs in acquiring, cleaning and making the gas available to SMUD. The Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement expires in September 2025. In late 2021, the Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement, along with the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The Carson Project is currently receiving, processing and selling up to 1,500 Dth/day with provisions for volume increases over time to 2,500 Dth/day. Digester gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations.

In December 2011, SMUD entered into a 20-year agreement with EIF KC Landfill Gas LLC (“EIF”) to purchase up to 7,050 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from multiple landfill projects. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in January 2014. Currently the delivery point is Kern River – Opal and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. Renewable natural gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations. In April 2022, SMUD entered into a transaction to sell the renewable natural gas purchased into the renewable transportation markets. The transaction expires in March 2025. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

AB 2196 is a law that defines the criteria by which existing and future renewable natural gas contracts will qualify for the State RPS program. The CEC adopted a RPS Eligibility Guidebook on April 30, 2013, which includes detailed rules for implementation of AB 2196. SMUD received an updated certificate of eligibility from the CEC in July 2014 for the Cosumnes Power Plant that included the quantities of renewable natural gas from all contracts. The CEC adopted a revised RPS Eligibility Guidebook (Ninth Edition) on April 27, 2017. This latest guidebook did not change the RPS eligibility of any of the above SMUD renewable natural gas and digester gas contracts, but did simplify reporting requirements for these contracts.

Gas Transmission

SMUD has satisfied its obligation to deliver natural gas to its power plants by constructing a natural gas pipeline, purchasing an equity interest in two PG&E backbone gas transmission lines, and contracting for capacity on a number of existing interstate natural gas transmission lines.

The Local Pipeline. SMUD constructed and owns a 20-inch, 50-mile natural gas pipeline in the greater Sacramento area (the “Local Pipeline”) that transports gas to all of the Local Gas-Fired Plants except McClellan. The Local Pipeline is interconnected with PG&E’s major State gas transmission lines 300 and 401. Additionally, it may be interconnected with one or more private gas gathering pipelines located in the area, a gas storage project and/or other FERC approved pipelines that may be built in the local area. In conjunction with the construction of the Cosumnes Power Plant, SMUD extended the Local Pipeline to the plant site. The 26-mile extension was completed in 2004. The extension is 24 inches in diameter and was designed to serve both the Cosumnes Power Plant and an additional second phase, if constructed.

![PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401](https://example.com/image.png)

**PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401.** In 1996, SMUD purchased an equity interest in PG&E’s backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 (referred to as the PG&E backbone). The total capacity acquired at that time was approximately 85,000 Dth/day and consisted of approximately 43,600 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, Oregon and 44,700 Dth/day from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California. SMUD was also entitled to a share of non-firm capacity, which was approximately 4,360 Dth/day; making the total capacity potentially available to SMUD almost 90,000 Dth/day. This purchase made SMUD a co-owner of the PG&E backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 and obligated SMUD to pay PG&E to operate the pipelines on its behalf subject to the terms of the purchase agreement and operating protocols. PG&E reduced operating pressures on Line 300 after PG&E suffered a natural gas explosion in San Bruno, CA in September of 2010. Operating pressures and capacity may also fluctuate due to regulatory and other changes. As of December 1, 2021, SMUD holds a total capacity of approximately 87,000 Dth/day, consisting of approximately 47,572 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, and 39,193 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California.

**Kern River Gas Transmission Company Long Term Agreement.** SMUD has an agreement with Kern River Gas Transmission Company for 200,000 Dth/day of firm capacity through April 30, 2028. This capacity gives SMUD access to the Rocky Mountain supply basin at Opal, Wyoming, and connects to PG&E Line 300 (owned in part by SMUD) at Daggett, California.

SMUD’s diversified portfolio of gas transmission arrangements allows for the purchase of gas from a variety of suppliers and locations, and the opportunity to capitalize on regional price differentials where possible. In addition, it ensures diversity in the SMUD/PG&E backbone and South Pipeline enhances the reliability of SMUD’s gas supply.

**Gas Storage**

SMUD also employs gas storage as part of its overall fuel supply strategy. Gas storage is useful in helping to balance gas supply, mitigate market price volatility, and provide a reliable supply to meet peak day delivery requirements.

SMUD has a contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2023 and expires in March 2026, for capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity.

SMUD also has a second contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2022 and expires in March 2024, for additional capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity. SMUD does not plan to renew this contract upon expiration.

SMUD has a contract with Wild Goose Storage LLC, that will begin in April 2024 (but which allows for early injection (December 2023 – March 2024)) for capacity in the Wild Goose Storage project located near Gridley in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 0.2 million Dth of storage inventory, ratcheted (12,500-14,000 Dth/day) volumes of injection rights and ratcheted (10,000 – 24,000 Dth/day) volumes of withdrawal capacity.

# Power Purchase Agreements

SMUD has a number of power purchase agreements to help meet its power requirements. Some of these agreements are described below.

## Western Area Power Administration
Effective January 1, 2005, SMUD entered into a 20-year contract with WAPA. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement extending the term by 30 years for the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2054. Power sold under this contract is generated by the Central Valley Project (“CVP”), a series of federal hydroelectric facilities in northern California operated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. The contract provides WAPA’s CVP Base Resource customers (including SMUD) delivery of a percentage share of project generation in return for reimbursement of an equivalent share of project costs. SMUD’s CVP Base Resource share is roughly 25% of project generation and costs. This is expected to be approximately 318 MW of capacity and 661 GWh of energy in an average water year but will vary depending on precipitation. Energy available under the contract is determined by water releases required for water supply and flood control and is then shaped into higher value periods within other CVP operating constraints. More capacity and energy are typically available in spring and summer months and less in fall and winter.

SMUD also has a contract with WAPA expiring December 31, 2024, by which WAPA delivers an additional 200-300 MW per hour from projects located in the Pacific Northwest based on certain contractual parameters. In 2022, SMUD received 1,913 GWh of energy under this contract. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement for the period January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2030.

## Avangrid (formerly Iberdrola Renewables (“Iberdrola”))
SMUD has a contract with Iberdrola for 126 GWh of wind power generated in Solano County, California. The SMUD Board approved an extension of the wind contract through June 30, 2025.

## Patua Project LLC
In April 2010, SMUD entered into a power purchase agreement with Patua Project LLC (“Patua”), a subsidiary of Gradient Resources, for the delivery of up to 132 MW (expected to be 120 MW nominal power output) of renewable energy from geothermal generation being developed in north central Nevada, from a Gradient Resources project known as the Patua Project. The Patua Project was to have been developed in three phases. Since 2010, the agreed upon capacity has been reduced several times. In December 2013, Phase 1 of the project, which had been reduced to 30 MW, finally achieved commercial operation. In 2014, the parties concluded negotiations on the fourth amendment to the power purchase agreement with Patua, which reduced the total capacity down to 40 MW, extended the commercial operation date of Phase 2 to January 1, 2016, and allowed Patua to add up to 13 MW of solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production. In addition, this amendment shifted responsibility to Patua for a portion of the long-term transmission service agreements that have been underutilized due to the project not meeting its targets. In November 2015, the Patua Project was acquired by TL Power, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cyrq Energy, Inc. (“Cyrq”). In December 2015, Cyrq terminated Phase 2. Upon termination of Phase 2, the contractual right for Cyrq to add solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production was reduced to 10 MW. As a result of poor performance during the first year of operation, SMUD reduced its obligation to take power from 30 MW to 25 MW. Performance continued to lag in 2015 and 2016 and SMUD further reduced its obligation to take power from 25 MW to 19 MW.

## Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff
In September 2009, SMUD’s Board authorized a feed-in tariff program for the purchase of renewable energy from local renewable energy projects connected to SMUD’s distribution system. SMUD’s Board authorized connection of up to 100 MW under the feed-in tariff which included standard payment rates and standard purchase terms for power. The feed-in tariff program became effective on January 1, 2010. Under the feed-in tariff, SMUD has executed 20-year term power purchase

A-36

agreements for solar projects totaling 98.5 MW. Construction and start-up were completed on all projects between 2010 and 2012.

**CalEnergy LLC.** In August 2014, SMUD entered into a 22-year power purchase agreement with CalEnergy LLC for the purchase of 30 MW per year of renewable energy from its Salton Sea geothermal facilities. As of July 1, 2017, SMUD began receiving up to 10 MW from the CalEnergy portfolio, which escalated to the full 30 MWs on May 1, 2020.

**Rancho Seco Solar.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Rancho Seco Solar LLC for the purchase of energy from a 10.88 MW solar PV project sited on SMUD’s property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station. Commercial operation was achieved in August of 2016. Rancho Seco Solar LLC leased the property from SMUD under a land lease agreement. The output of this project directly serves two large commercial customers that executed agreements with SMUD for retail supply of solar power.

In May 2019, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement for an additional 160 MW solar PV project with Rancho Seco Solar II, LLC. The project is located on SMUD-owned property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station, adjacent to the existing 10.88 MW solar PV project. Construction began in 2019, and the project became commercially operable in February 2021.

**Grady Wind Energy.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Grady Wind Energy LLC (“Grady”) for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW wind project located in New Mexico (the “Grady Project”). The Grady Project began commercial operations on August 5, 2019. Energy from the Grady Project is delivered to CAISO. SMUD purchases 100% of the Grady Project output, which includes energy, renewable energy credits, and capacity attributes.

**Great Valley Solar 2, LLC.** In January 2017, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Great Valley Solar 2, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 60 MW solar PV project located in Fresno County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was December 28, 2017.

**ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC.** On September 14, 2016, Senate Bill 859 (“SB 859”) was signed into law. Under SB 859, a POUs must procure its proportionate share of 125 MW of renewable energy from biomass plants burning high hazard forest fuels, subject to terms of at least five years. Seven POUs (SMUD, MID, Turlock Irrigation District (“TID”), Anaheim Public Utilities, Imperial Irrigation District, and Angeles Department of Water & Power and Riverside Public Utilities, collectively described herein as the “ARP-Loyalton POUs”) jointly solicited proposals for up to 29 MW of contract capacity for renewable energy to meet the requirements of SB 859. In January 2018, SMUD entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC to fulfill 18 MW of the required 29 MW with SMUD’s share being just over 23 percent (the “ARP-Loyalton PPA”). See “—Roseburg Forest Products Co.” below for a discussion of the remaining SB 859 capacity. The contract became effective on April 1, 2018. On February 18, 2020, ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and stopped producing and selling energy from the biomass plant. On May 7, 2022, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the Loyalton facility to Sierra Valley Enterprises, LLC (“SVE”). SVE initially expressed interest in bringing the facility back into service; however, the bankruptcy trustee requested requested extension of the deadline for SVE to accept or reject the ARP-Loyalton PPA. The latest deadline was April 19, 2023, the date of expiration of the ARP-Loyalton PPA terms. SVE did not resume operations before the end of the ARP-Loyalton PPA term, the ARP-Loyalton POUs have negotiated a settlement agreement with the bankruptcy trustee (the “ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement”). The ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement, which SMUD executed and is filed with the court, defines funds from the performance security that the ARP-Loyalton POUs will keep to cover legal and administrative fees, along with a contingency amount to cover potential risk of future damages.

procure compliant biomass and provided SVE the opportunity to accept the ARP-Loyalton PPA and restart operations, the ARP-Loyalton POUs consider their statutory obligations to have been fulfilled.

**Roseburg Forest Products Co.** For the remaining SB 859 biomass obligation of 11 MW, SMUD and the other ARP-Loyalton POUs have entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with Roseburg Forest Products Co. SMUD’s share of the contract capacity is 2.5795 MW, and the plant began operating under the contract on February 26, 2021.

**Sutter Energy Center.** SMUD entered into an initial two-year contract (with a third-year exercisable option) with Calpine Energy Services, L.P. (“Calpine”) for the ability to schedule up to 258 MW of energy from Sutter Energy Center. The Sutter Energy Center is a natural gas-fired, combined-cycle facility located in Yuba City, California. The initial contract became effective on April 1, 2018. SMUD exercised its option to extend the contract, which expired November 1, 2020. SMUD entered into a new contract with Calpine for the same 258 MW of energy that became effective January 1, 2021, and had an original expiration date of January 1, 2024. In December 2021, SMUD extended this contract through December 31, 2026.

**Drew Solar, LLC.** In June 2018, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Drew Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 100 MW solar PV project located in Imperial County, California. The project’s scheduled commercial operation date was set to be December 31, 2021. The commercial operation date was delayed due to Force Majeure claims surrounding the COVID pandemic and supply chain constraints caused by changes in Federal regulatory requirements. The project began commercially operating on November 3, 2022.

**Wildflower Solar I, LLC.** In October 2018, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Wildflower Solar I, LLC, for the purchase of energy, capacity, and RECs from a 13 MW solar PV project located in Rio Linda, California. The project began commercially operating on December 18, 2020.

**Coyote Creek (Formerly Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC.)** In August 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW solar PV and 100 MW four-hour Battery Energy Storage System (“BESS”) capacity project located in Sacramento County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was originally expected to be December 31, 2023, but has been delayed to 2026 due to ongoing development and permitting delays.

**SloughHouse Solar, LLC.** In September 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with SloughHouse Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 50 MW solar PV project located in Sacramento County, California.

# Transmission Service Agreements

## TANC California-Oregon Transmission Project
The 340-mile COTP is one part of a three 500-kV line coordinated system known as the California-Oregon Intertie (“COI”). The COTP is allocated one-third of the 4,800 MW capability of the COI system (see related agreements below). TANC is entitled to 1,390 MW and is obligated to pay approximately 80% of the operating costs of the COTP. SMUD is a member of TANC and a party to Project Agreement No. 3 (“PA3”), under which it is entitled to 378 MW and obligated to pay on an unconditional take-or-pay basis about 27.5% of TANC’s COTP debt service and operations costs, subject to a “step-up” obligation of up to 25% of its entitlement share upon the unremedied default of another TANC member-participant. In 2009, SMUD entered into a long-term layoff agreement with certain members that increased SMUD’s entitlement by 35 MW. In 2014, SMUD entered into another long-term layoff agreement with certain other members that increased SMUD’s COTP entitlements by 128 MW and amended the 2009 layoff agreement that returned 13 MW to a member. In January 2024, SMUD entered into an agreement to extend the 2009 long-term layoff agreement with certain members to January 31, 2034. As of January 31, 2024, SMUD was entitled to approximately 528 MW of TANC’s transfer capability for imports and 405 MW for exports, and is obligated to pay approximately 38.6% of COTP debt service and operations costs. SMUD’s payments under this contract, like SMUD’s payments under its other power purchase and transmission service agreements, are treated as “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the resolution securing the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the section “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below). SMUD relies on its COTP rights to purchase power, access contingency reserves through the Western Power Pool, and obtain renewable resources to supplement its own resources to serve its load. TANC maintains insurance coverage for its own property/casualty insurance program. TANC’s budget for COTP costs, support services and advocacy expenses is about $45.4 million for 2023. SMUD’s obligation on the TANC budget is about $11.5 million for 2023.

## TANC Tesla-Midway Transmission Service
TANC has a long-term contract with PG&E to provide TANC with 300 MW of transmission service between PG&E’s Midway Substation and the electric systems of the TANC Members (the “Tesla-Midway Service”). SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service had been 46 MW. As part of the 2009 long-term layoff agreement, SMUD acquired an additional 2 MW of South-of-Tesla Principles (“SOTP”) transmission rights for 15 years starting February, 2009 from another TANC member, bringing SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service to 48 MW.

## Bonneville Power Administration
In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with the Bonneville Power Administration (“BPA”) for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service from BPA’s Hilltop substation in northeastern California to the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua geothermal project over BPA’s 230kV transmission lines. In early 2013, in accordance with BPA’s transmission tariff, the transmission service was split into two 30 MW services and deferred as appropriate to better fit the timing of expected commercial operation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Patua Project LLC.” SMUD submitted another request for the 30 MW of transmission procured for Phase 2 of the Patua Project to split the service into a 10 MW and a 20 MW service, with the 10 MW service deferred and timed with the originally expected commercial operation date of Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 1 of the Patua Project and SMUD’s reduced obligation due to the poor performance of Phase 1 of the Patua Project, much of the transmission reserved for it will no longer be needed. BPA does not have a provision in its transmission tariff for early termination of transmission service. However, the power purchase agreement with Patua requires Patua to cover unused transmission that SMUD has procured for the Patua purchases. On January 1, 2020, SMUD’s transmission rights with BPA were reduced to 19 MW. This now aligns with SMUD’s PacifiCorp transmission rights of 19 MW described in the immediately following paragraph.

**PacifiCorp.** In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with PacifiCorp for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service across PacifiCorp’s high voltage step-up transformer at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In early 2013, in accordance with PacifiCorp’s transmission tariff, the commencement of the 60 MW of transmission service was deferred to fit the timing of first deliveries expected from the 30 MW of Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In 2013, SMUD terminated the 60 MW of transmission service and requested two new transmission services of 30 MW each, with service start dates timed to better fit with the expected start dates of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the reduction in expected output of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the second 30 MW transmission agreement, and replaced it with a 10 MW transmission service agreement for Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 2 of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the 10 MW PacifiCorp transmission service agreement and as a result of the reduced obligation to take power from the Patua Project, SMUD has reduced its remaining PacifiCorp transmission service from 30 MW to 19 MW.

**Western Area Power Administration.** SMUD does not have a direct interconnection of its power system to the COTP. To receive power deliveries that use its COTP rights, SMUD has a long-term transmission service agreement with WAPA for transmission of 342 MW of power from the COTP line (received at WAPA’s Tracy or Olinda substations) to SMUD’s system. In May of 2011, WAPA completed the Sacramento Voltage Support Transmission Project. Completion of this project has given SMUD an additional 165 MW of transmission service rights on WAPA’s system from the COTP at the Olinda Substation to SMUD’s system at the Elverta Substation.

**Projected Resources**

The following tables titled “Projected Requirements and Resources to Meet Load Requirements Energy Requirements and Resources” (the “Energy Table”) and “Capacity Requirements and Resources Net Capacity – Megawatts” (the “Capacity Table”) describe SMUD’s contracted commitments and owned resources available to meet its forecasted load requirements through the year 2033. Resources are shown on an annualized basis with market purchases netted against surpluses to arrive at a single net position for each year. Because SMUD’s available resources do not exactly match its actual load requirements on an hourly basis, there are times during a year when resources available will either exceed or be insufficient to meet SMUD’s needs. Expected actual capacity values are included in the tables. These values may differ from measured net demonstrated capacity values of the Local Area Gas-Fired Plants. The table below also includes the impact energy efficiency has on resources requirements as discussed below under “Demand Side Management Programs.” See “BUSINESS STRATEGY” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.”

Resources listed in both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table are listed as either renewable or non-renewable. Generally, SMUD follows the CEC guidelines for eligibility requirements. Some of SMUD’s renewable resources listed include solar, wind, geothermal, small hydroelectric facilities with a capacity of 30 MW or less, and biomass (representing generation from a fuel comprised of agricultural wastes and residues, landscape and tree trimmings, wood and wood waste).

As in any forecast, assumptions are made. In both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table the WAPA and UARP forecasts assume average water conditions throughout the period. On the capacity table, WAPA and Cosumnes Power Plant renewable capacity is estimated based on the ratio of renewable energy to total WAPA or Cosumnes Power Plant energy. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric.”

A-40
<!-- Page 331 -->
The Uncommitted Purchases (Sales) on the tables represent either anticipated future needs or surpluses. Future needs are met well in advance of delivery. They also include both renewable and non-renewable resources.

The Transmission Losses represent reductions in the amount of energy or capacity from the location it was purchased to the point of entering SMUD’s electrical system. This amount reduces the Total Resources available to meet the Total Projected Energy Requirements of the electrical system.

## Demand Side Management Programs

SMUD’s demand-side management initiatives represent an integral element of its total resource portfolio, and are organized into two major components: energy efficiency and load management programs. Energy efficiency offerings include a wide variety of programs and services to customers to retrofit or upgrade existing equipment and fixtures and to install new energy efficiency measures in existing and new construction facilities. Load management allows SMUD to reduce the load on the electric system by cycling residential air conditioning, and calling upon commercial/industrial customers to curtail energy usage when energy is constrained during the summer or system emergencies. Load management programs are projected to allow SMUD to shed approximately 60 MW of peak load in an emergency on a hot day, representing about 2% of SMUD’s maximum system peak demand.

The customer “smart meter” system with 2-way communication capability provides information regarding customer usage patterns, which is expected to help SMUD tailor rate designs that provide customers with both the information and ability to manage their energy usage around high energy cost periods.

# Balancing Authority Area Agreements

## Background
SMUD began operating as an independent control area, later termed a Balancing Authority, on June 18, 2002 within the WECC reliability organization’s region. This reduced SMUD’s exposure to the costs and reliability risks of the CAISO’s markets. SMUD expanded its operational footprint beyond SMUD’s service territory to include WAPA’s electric system, including the MID, Roseville, and Redding service areas (on January 1, 2005) and the COTP (on December 1, 2005). As described further below, SMUD ceased to be the Balancing Authority on April 30, 2011, as BANC took SMUD’s place as the Balancing Authority. SMUD remains the operator of the Balancing Authority through a contract with BANC. SMUD administers the contracts with WAPA and TANC to provide specified Balancing Authority-related and other services, and is compensated by WAPA and TANC. TANC recovers such Balancing Authority services costs as a part of its annual operating budget from the COTP Participants and WAPA recovers its Balancing Authority services costs through its rates for power and transmission service. The agreement with WAPA, among other terms, establishes operating procedures and reserve obligations between the parties and terminates on December 31, 2024. BANC, SMUD and WAPA will develop successor agreements in 2024 to take effect upon expiration of the existing contract. WAPA in turn has agreements with electric systems connected to it to assure that such systems also operate reliably (i.e., MID, Roseville and Redding). As a result of the transition to BANC as the Balancing Authority, SMUD assigned or terminated its interconnection and operations agreements with other connecting Balancing Authority areas (i.e., CAISO, BPA and TID). BANC is now the party to these agreements as they primarily address only Balancing Authority matters required for compliance with the reliability standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”), such as emergency assistance arrangements. See also “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY” – Western Energy Imbalance Market.”

## Reliability Standards
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave FERC authority to enforce reliability standards for the bulk electric system. In June 2007, these standards became mandatory for SMUD and BANC.

In 2022, SMUD and BANC underwent a combined NERC/WECC audit to evaluate compliance with applicable reliability standards. These audits occur every three years. At the conclusion of the audit, regulators determined that neither entity had any compliance violations related to the Operations and Planning or Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards. SMUD and BANC will undergo another NERC/WECC audit sometime in 2025.

## Balancing Authority of Northern California
SMUD, MID, Redding and Roseville executed a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement (the “BANC JPA Agreement”) creating BANC on May 8, 2009. BANC became operational on May 1, 2011 as a Balancing Authority and replaced SMUD as the entity responsible for Balancing Authority-related reliability standards. Since that time, the Trinity Public Utilities District and the City of Shasta Lake have also become members of BANC. As provided in the BANC member agreement, liability for penalties associated with such Balancing Authority-related reliability standards are shared on a pro rata basis among the members of BANC. SMUD is the Balancing Authority operator under contract and performs Balancing Authority operational functions on behalf of BANC, much as it did when it was the Balancing Authority. The BANC JPA Agreement assigns cost responsibility based on member load within the BANC Balancing Authority, with SMUD representing approximately 70% of the total load.

## Power Pool and Other Agreements

### Western Power Pool Agreement
The Western Power Pool (“WPP”) is an agreement among over 30 utilities and public agencies in the western United States to coordinate contingency reserve sharing.
<!-- Page 335 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Displayed)

referred to as the WPP Reserve Sharing Program (“RSP”). The RSP permits participants to rely on one another in the event that any participant experiences a generating resource outage. While SMUD became an RSP participant in 2009, participation is limited to Balancing Authorities, which SMUD relinquished to BANC in 2011. Under the RSP, BANC and TID (also a WPP member) share their reserve amounts and when necessary and when sufficient unused COTP rights and capacity are available, may call upon WPP reserves from the RSP member systems in the Pacific Northwest. The WPP RSP permits members to operate more efficiently by reducing the contingency reserves that they would otherwise need to have available if they could not rely on each other.

**TANC-SMUD OASIS Administration Agreement.** SMUD entered into an agreement with TANC to provide OASIS services (transmission sales and scheduling related services in the BANC BA of TANC members’ COTP rights) on September 29, 2005. SMUD is compensated for performing these services. TANC and SMUD entered into a letter agreement dated October 25, 2010 to clarify each party’s role for regulatory reliability standards compliance responsibilities and take into account SMUD’s increased efforts related to supporting TANC’s compliance requirements. SMUD and TANC entered into an agreement to transition this service to the Western Area Power Administration, effective on May 1, 2023. Going forward SMUD will only have a minor role in receiving payments and distributing revenues to the TANC members.

**Other Interconnection Agreements**

**Background.** SMUD’s electric system was originally purchased from PG&E in 1947. SMUD’s service area is mostly surrounded by PG&E’s and WAPA’s service areas. The SMUD and PG&E electric systems are interconnected at SMUD’s Rancho Seco and Lake 230-kV substations. SMUD and WAPA are interconnected at SMUD’s Hurley, Elverta, Natomas and Folsom 230-kV substations.

**PG&E Interconnection Agreement.** PG&E and SMUD executed a Replacement Interconnection Agreement (“RIA”) which became effective on January 1, 2010. The RIA provides that SMUD and PG&E operate their interconnections reliably, plan their electric systems to meet their load requirements, and avoid or mitigate impacts the cause by certain electric system modifications. The agreement has a termination date of December 31, 2024, subject to FERC approval. SMUD and other Northern California utilities have similar interconnection agreements with PG&E, albeit with different expiration dates. PG&E filed a successor interconnection agreement with one of these utilities, TID, on November 1, 2023, to become effective on January 1, 2024. Many interconnection customers, including SMUD, intervened and submitted comments or protests in the FERC docket. FERC accepted the filing and TID and PG&E are now in a settlement process, pending litigation of the parties action and resolve the disputed items. SMUD anticipates that PG&E will seek to negotiate a successor interconnection agreement with SMUD which will be informed by the TID settlement or litigation process. While some functional mechanisms in the interconnection agreement may change, SMUD expects that its successor interconnection agreement will substantially preserve the balance of burdens and benefits consistent with FERC’s standard of requiring rates and terms of service that are just and reasonable. SMUD expects this process to be completed by the current expiration date of the RIA.

**PG&E Generator Interconnection Agreements.** SMUD signed a LGIA with CAISO and PG&E for the Solano 3 Wind Project, effective December 16, 2008, with a 50-year term. The Solano 2 Wind Project has interconnection rights granted through a LGIA, also with the CAISO and PG&E. The agreement became effective in January 2010 and has a term of 20 years. On June 3, 2021, SMUD entered into a LGIA with the CAISO and PG&E, for the planned 90.8 MW Solano 4 Wind project with a 10-year term and automatic renewal for successive one-year terms thereafter. On February 27, 2023, SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process which combines the Solano 2, 3 & 4 projects into one Solano Wind Project. The original agreement conditions for the individual projects are carried forward with

A-45
<!-- Page 336 -->
a new combined project maximum production limit of 320.8 MW at the point of interconnection at the Russell Substation.

Other PG&E generator interconnection agreements include a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for Slab Creek with a 22-year term which became effective on January 14, 2010, and a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for the Chili Bar Project with a 10-year term which became effective on June 2, 2021.

WAPA Interconnection Agreement and other WAPA Agreements. SMUD and WAPA executed an interconnection agreement on May 8, 2008 for a term of 40 years which establishes the terms and conditions under which the SMUD and WAPA transmission systems are interconnected and memorializes related understandings. SMUD is working with WAPA on a reconfiguration at the shared Elverta interconnection to increase reliability and accommodate new generation interconnection in the area. SMUD has other agreements with WAPA including for operation of the Sutter Energy Center generating facility, communication systems terms and fiber optic access, training and for use of WAPA labor and heavy equipment to assist SMUD’s maintenance activities on an as-available basis.

# Management’s Discussion of SMUD’s Operating Results

## Year Ended December 31, 2023
For the year ended December 31, 2023, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $218.1 million as compared to an increase of $70.7 million for 2022.

Operating revenues were $228.5 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower sales of surplus gas ($118.3 million), transfers to the RSF ($67.2 million), sales to customers ($28.3 million), transfers from the RSF ($21.9 million), and LCFS revenue ($3.9 million), partially offset by higher sales of surplus power ($136.6 million), AB 32 revenue ($3.7 million), customer fees ($1.1 million), and lower transmission revenue ($2.3 million).

Operating expenses were $292.8 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower purchased power expenses ($175.5 million), production operating expenses ($146.4 million), depreciation expenses ($22.7 million), production maintenance expenses ($12.3 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($7.2 million), partially offset by higher administrative and general expenses ($33.4 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($15.8 million), public good expenses ($8.8 million), and customer service and information expenses ($6.6 million).

Non-Operating income increased by $55.2 million primarily due to fair market value assessment and gain on sale of land ($33.3 million), higher interest income ($21.7 million), higher unrealized holding gains ($11.4 million), higher CCA revenue ($5.7 million), partially offset by lower investment income ($39.1 million).

Interest expense decreased $27.9 million from 2022.

## Year Ended December 31, 2022
For the year ended December 31, 2022, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $70.7 million as compared to an increase of $347.3 million for 2021.

Operating revenues were $363.0 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher sales to customers ($130.7 million), sales of surplus gas ($96.0 million), sales of surplus power ($62.2 million), transfers to the RSF ($28.9 million), transfers from the RSF ($24.3 million), customer fees ($9.5 million), AB 32 revenue ($4.9 million) and LCFS revenue ($2.2 million), partially offset by lower gain on sale of carbon allowance futures ($3.7 million).

Operating expenses were $601.2 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher purchased power expenses ($263.6 million), amortization of pension and OPEB ($126.9 million), production operating expenses ($125.1 million), depreciation expenses ($49.5 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($22.1 million), production maintenance expenses ($18.4 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($8.1 million), public good expenses ($7.4 million), and customer service and information expenses ($4.5 million), partially offset by lower administrative and general expenses ($27.4 million).

Non-Operating income decreased by $19.0 million primarily due to lower grant revenue ($39.6 million), unrealized holding losses ($3.7 million), partially offset by higher investment income ($19.7 million), closeout of escrow account ($2.8 million), and loss on asset retirements ($1.9 million).

Interest expense increased $19.5 million from 2021.

## Regulatory Assets
In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” SMUD defers, as regulatory assets, certain types of expenditures. These assets are amortized and collected through future rates.

As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had a total of $916.1 million recorded for regulatory assets. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 68 which requires SMUD to record a net pension liability was $323.5 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 68 was $174.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 75 which requires SMUD to record a net Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) liability was $268.2 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 75 was $39.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with Rancho Seco decommissioning costs totaled $108.0 million at December 31, 2023. Nuclear fuel storage costs and non-radiological decommissioning costs have been collected in rates since 2009. For a complete description of these regulatory assets, see Note 8 (Regulatory Deferrals) to SMUD’s financial statements.

The Board has authorized the deferral of any charges or credits that result from the change in valuation of ineffective hedges that should be reported as Investment Revenue/Expense on the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and changes in net position. The Board’s resolution establishes that such charges or credits are not included in rates based on market value changes but are included in rates when the underlying transactions occur. Therefore, under GASB No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” any such changes are included in the Statement of Net Position as regulatory assets or liabilities. For a complete description of these derivative financial instruments, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s financial statements.

RANCHO SECO DECOMMISSIONING

Overview. The 913 MW Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant (“Rancho Seco”) began regulatory operations with the NRC (“NRC”) licensed operator. In June 1989, the plant was shut down. In 1991, SMUD submitted a report (the “Financial Assurance Plan”) providing financial assurance to the NRC that SMUD will have sufficient funds available to pay for the cost of decommissioning. On March 17, 1992, the NRC granted SMUD a change from operating to a possession-only license for Rancho Seco that relieved SMUD from compliance with a number of NRC regulations applicable to operating nuclear power plants. SMUD also filed a proposed decommissioning plan with the NRC (the “Decommissioning Plan”), which was approved in March 1995.

After the decommissioning efforts began, no suitable disposal option was available to SMUD for the Class B and Class C low level radioactive waste generated during the plant decommissioning. With the used nuclear fuel stored onsite requiring oversight staff, SMUD opted to store the Class B and Class C radioactive waste in an existing interim onsite storage building until a suitable disposal option was available. In November 2007, the possession-only license for Rancho Seco was amended to update the Decommissioning Plan to terminate the possession-only license for the Class B and Class C waste in two phases. Phase I of the decommissioning was completed at the end of 2008. Following verification of the site conditions, SMUD submitted a request to the NRC to reduce the licensed facility from 2,480 acres to the interim onsite storage building and about one acre surrounding it. The request was approved by the NRC in September 2009. Phase II of decommissioning included the approximately two-acre interim storage building containing the Class B and Class C radioactive waste and surrounding area. In September 2013, SMUD entered into a contract with the operator of the low-level radioactive waste disposal facility located in Andrews, Texas. Shipment of the Class B and Class C radioactive waste for disposal was completed in November 2014. SMUD conducted additional clean-up activities and radiological surveys, which were followed by NRC confirmatory surveys. The results of these surveys demonstrated unit dose criteria well below NRC release criteria, and the NRC approved the Phase II area for unrestricted use. On September 21, 2017, SMUD formally requested the termination of the possession-only license. On August A-51

31, 2018, the NRC officially terminated SMUD’s possession-only license for the remaining Class B and Class C waste at Rancho Seco.

As part of the Decommissioning Plan, the nuclear fuel and Greater Than Class C (“GTCC”) radioactive waste is being stored in a dry storage facility (the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation or “ISFSI”) constructed by SMUD, adjacent to the former reactor facility. The NRC has separately licensed this facility. The DOE, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, is responsible for permanent disposal of used nuclear fuel and GTCC radioactive waste. SMUD has a contract with the DOE for the removal and disposal of this waste. The DOE was to have a waste repository operating by 1998, but has experienced significant and ongoing delays. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act designates Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the final and exclusive repository for the nation’s used nuclear fuel. The DOE discontinued the Yucca Mountain license review activities in 2010, but after a court ordered the NRC to resume its review in 2013, the NRC published its final safety evaluation report in 2015. The final safety report, and the final environmental impact statement, concluded that the proposed repository would be safe and environmentally sound for one million years.

Nevertheless, seeking alternatives to Yucca Mountain, the Blue-Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future delivered its final report in January 2012 with several recommendations. The DOE responded to the recommendations by issuing a report in January 2013 (Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste). Key to both documents is a focus on used fuel from decommissioned sites including Rancho Seco. The DOE report accepts most of the Blue-Ribbon Commission recommendations, and contains timelines for fuel management options which proposed removing the fuel from Rancho Seco as early as 2021. However, any progress on the strategies proposed by the DOE is dependent on legislative action by Congress. With no legislative action taken to date, the 2021 projected date for removal slips year-for-year. Therefore, SMUD continues to incur costs at this time when the DOE will fulfill its contractual obligations to remove the nuclear fuel and GTCC waste from the Rancho Seco facility. In the meantime, SMUD continues to incur costs of approximately $5 to $7 million per year for storage of used nuclear fuel at the ISFSI. SMUD has filed a series of successful lawsuits against the federal government for recovery of past spent fuel costs. SMUD has recovered over $14 million in 2023. SMUD plans to continue pursuing cost recovery claims to ensure it is reimbursed for all such costs in the future. The ISFSI will be decommissioned, and its license terminated after the fuel and GTCC is removed.

Financial Assurance Plan. In accordance with the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD established and funded an external decommissioning trust fund currently held by Computershare Corporate Trust (the “Decommissioning Trust Fund”). Pursuant to the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD made the final deposit into the Decommissioning Trust Fund in 2008. Additional deposits are not expected but will be made if increased cost estimates or reduced fund interest earnings require it. In 2011, the NRC began requiring that SMUD demonstrate financial assurance for decommissioning the ISFSI as well as the former power facility, increasing the overall cost for decommissioning Rancho Seco. The estimated total cost for decommissioning the ISFSI was approximately $7.1 million on December 31, 2023. The decommissioning cost estimate is required to be updated every three years. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of the Decommissioning Trust Fund was $9.4 million, excluding unrealized gains and losses. Based on the current decommissioning cost estimate and the value of the fund, SMUD’s existing Decommissioning Trust Fund provides sufficient funds to complete decommissioning and terminate the ISFSI license.

In addition to these costs, SMUD also estimates that it would cost approximately $13.1 million to restore the site to make it available for other SMUD uses with some major structures remaining intact. Site restoration is not a legal requirement. No site restoration is currently underway.

# EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

SMUD has approximately 2,334 employees, most of whom are covered by a civil service system. SMUD is a contracting member of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“PERS”). Approximately 50% of SMUD’s work-force is represented as to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment, by one of three recognized employee organizations, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”) Local 1245, the Organization of SMUD Employees (“OSE”), and the SMUD Public Safety Officers’ Association (“PSOA”). The remaining 50% of SMUD’s workforce, which includes managers, professional, administrative, supervisory, confidential and security staff, is unrepresented.

SMUD negotiated a four-year Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with IBEW and the OSE, effective January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2025. Both contracts contain a no-strike/no-lockout clause effective during the life of the agreements. SMUD has an MOU with PSOA effective through December 31, 2026. SMUD has experienced only one labor interruption, which occurred in January 1980 that lasted four days.

# RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POST-EMPLOYMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

## Pension Plans

SMUD participates in PERS, an agent multiple-employer public employee defined benefit pension plan. PERS provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. PERS acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating public entities within the State. Benefit provisions are established by State statute and SMUD policies. The pension plan provides retirement benefits, survivor benefits, and death and disability benefits based upon employees’ years of credited service, age, and final compensation.

As of June 30, 2022, the last actuarial valuation date for SMUD’s plan within PERS, the market value of the SMUD plan assets was $2.32 billion. The plan is 87.8% funded on a market value of assets basis, a decrease of 12.3% compared to the June 30, 2021 funded status based on the market value of assets.

As an employer, SMUD is required to contribute a percentage of payroll each year to PERS to fund SMUD’s plan based on actuarial valuations performed by PERS. PERS collects the normal cost based on a percentage of payroll and the unfunded liability portion is based on a dollar amount. SMUD also makes partial contributions required of SMUD employees on their behalf and for their account. At the PERS fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, SMUD’s required employer contribution rate for normal cost was 9.8% of payroll and the unfunded liability contribution was $22.4 million. During 2023, SMUD contributed $37.4 million to PERS (including SMUD’s contributions to cover required employee contributions), and SMUD employees paid $18.3 million for their share of the PERS contribution.

For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2025, SMUD is required to contribute 9.6% and 9.5% of payroll for normal costs and $10.7 million for fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 for the unfunded liability contribution. There is no estimated employer contribution to the unfunded liability for fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Assuming no amendments to the plan and no liability gains or losses (which can have a significant impact), PERS has projected that SMUD will be required to contribute 9.4% of payroll to the plan for normal costs and $15.7 million for the unfunded liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026, not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions. The amount SMUD is required to contribute to PERS is expected to increase in the future. The actual amount of such increases

SMUD has the option to prepay an annual lump sum payment to PERS for the unfunded accrued liability portion only (not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions). SMUD made an annual lump sum prepayment of $19.5 million, and also voluntarily made an additional payment of $47.3 million, for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. SMUD was not required to make an annual lump sum prepayment and, to date, has not voluntarily made additional payments for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.

While SMUD has some ability to adjust the retirement benefits provided to its employees, PERS determines the actuarial methods and assumptions used with respect to assets administered by PERS (including the SMUD plan assets) and makes the investment decisions with respect to such assets. For a description of such actuarial methods and assumptions (including the smoothing conventions used by PERS when setting employer contribution rates) and investments, see the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS (SMUD’s plan is part of the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund of PERS) available on its website at www.calpers.ca.gov. SMUD cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information and neither the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS nor any other information contained on the PERS website is incorporated by reference in or part of this Official Statement. Actuarial assessments are “forward-looking” information that reflect the judgment of the fiduciaries of the pension plans, and are based upon a variety of assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be inaccurate or be changed in the future. Actuarial assessments will change with the future experience of the pension plans.

GASB issued Statement No. 68 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – An Amendment of GASB Statement No. 27” (“GASB No. 68”). The primary objective of GASB No. 68 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for pensions. Under GASB No. 68, SMUD is required to report the net pension asset or net pension liability (i.e., the difference between the total pension liability and the pension plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of investment gains and losses. GASB No. 68 separates financial reporting from funding requirements for pension plans. The pension liability as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is $259.0 million and $235.5 million, respectively.

SMUD provides its employees with two cash deferred compensation plans: one pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 401(k) (the “401(k) Plan”) and one pursuant to IRC Section 457 (the “457 Plan” and collectively, the “Plans”). The Plans are contributory plans in which SMUD’s employees contribute the funds. Each of SMUD’s eligible full-time or permanent part-time employees may participate in either or both Plans, and amounts contributed by employees are vested immediately. Such funds are held by a trustee in trust for the employees upon retirement from SMUD service and, accordingly, are not subject to the general claims of SMUD’s creditors. SMUD makes annual contributions to the 401(k) Plan on behalf of certain employees pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with both of its collective bargaining units. SMUD matches the non-represented employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to a set amount. SMUD also makes limited discretionary contributions to non-represented employees hired after January 1, 2013, which contributions fully vest after five years. Prior to 2022, SMUD did not match employee contributions, nor make contributions on behalf of its employees to the 457 Plan. Beginning in 2022, SMUD makes annual contributions to the 457 Plan on behalf of certain employees and matches employee contributions up to a set amount pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with one of its collective bargaining units. SMUD made contributions to both Plans of $6.9 million in 2023 and to the 401(k) Plan of $7.0 million in 2022. Participating employees made contributions into both Plans totaling $34.3 million in 2023 and $32.4 million in 2022.

# Other Post-Employment Benefits

SMUD provides post-employment healthcare benefits, in accordance with SMUD policy and negotiated agreements with employee representation groups in a single employer defined benefit plan, to all employees who retire from SMUD, and their dependents. SMUD also provides post-employment healthcare benefits to covered employees who are eligible for disability retirement. SMUD contributes the full cost of coverage for retirees hired before January 1, 1991, and a portion of the cost based on credited years of service for retirees hired after January 1, 1991. SMUD also contributes a portion of the costs of coverage for these retirees’ dependents. Retirees are required to contribute the portion that is not paid by SMUD. The benefits, benefit levels, retiree contributions and employer contributions are governed by SMUD and can be amended by SMUD through its personnel manual and union contracts.

SMUD’s post-employment health care benefits are funded through the PERS California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust (“CERBT”), an agent multiple-employer plan. The funding of a plan occurs when the following events take place: the employer makes payments of benefits directly to or on behalf of a retiree or beneficiary; the employer makes premium payments to an insurer; or the employer irrevocably transfers assets to a trust or other third party acting in the role of trustee, where the plan assets are dedicated to the sole purpose of the payments of the plan benefits, and creditors of the government do not have access to those assets.

SMUD has elected to contribute the normal costs to the CERBT but annually receive reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT. In 2024, SMUD’s contribution for the normal costs to CERBT is $10.6 million. In 2023, SMUD made a contribution to the CERBT for normal costs in the amount of $8.6 million. In 2022, SMUD decided to forgo making a contribution for the normal costs to the CERBT because there was a net OPEB asset as of December 31, 2021. SMUD made additional contributions to the trust. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD made healthcare benefit contributions by paying actual medical costs of $24.7 million and $24.5 million, respectively. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD received $24.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively, reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT.

At June 30, 2023 and 2022, SMUD estimated that the actuarially determined accumulated post-employment benefit obligation was approximately $403.6 and $381.7 million, respectively. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the plan was 92.3% and 97.9% funded, respectively.

SMUD’s actuary uses PERS economic and other assumptions as the basis for the calculation of the post-employment benefit obligation. The actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will vary substantially if such PERS assumptions, such as interest rate and life expectancy, among others, prove to be inaccurate or different than SMUD’s actual experience. Although SMUD believes that such assumptions and estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that any such assumptions will prove to be accurate, or that SMUD’s actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will not materially exceed its estimates. Additional information is available in Note 15 (Other Postemployment Benefits) and “Required Supplementary Information” to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

GASB previously issued SGAS No. 75 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions”. The primary objective of GASB No. 75 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for post-employment benefits other than pensions (“OPEB”). Under GASB No. 75, SMUD is required to report the net OPEB asset or net OPEB liability (i.e., the difference between the total OPEB liability and the OPEB plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes.

**CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS**

**Estimated Capital Requirements**

SMUD has a projected capital requirement of approximately $2.8 billion for the period 2024 through 2028 as shown in the table below. Approximately 60% of this requirement is anticipated to be funded with internally generated funds and cash on hand.

Special projects include costs relating to construction of large substations and the construction of Solano Phase 4. The Estimated Capital Requirements table below includes $51 million for Solano Phase 4. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Solano 4 Project.”

**Outstanding Indebtedness**

**General.** SMUD typically finances its capital requirements through the sale of revenue bonds, the sale of commercial paper, from draws on its Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and from internally generated funds. With the enactment of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and the 2024 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, SMUD is monitoring and exploring new methods of financing, including those afforded under these two federal laws, that provide not-for-profit public power utilities with direct federal incentive payments.

SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Senior Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 (the “Senior Resolution”) adopted in 1971, as amended and supplemented (the “Senior Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Senior Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $1,783,965,000 outstanding. The Senior Bonds are payable solely from the Net Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Senior Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of “Maintenance and Operation Costs” and “Energy Payments” as defined in the Senior Resolution, including payments by SMUD to TANC under PA3, payments by SMUD under power purchase agreements related to the Authorities and payments by SMUD to NCGA and NCEA under their respective gas supply contracts. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD’s Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Subordinated Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 85-11-1 of SMUD, adopted on November 7, 1985, as amended and supplemented (the “Subordinated Resolution”).
<!-- Page 347 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**“Subordinate Resolution”**. As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Subordinated Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $332,020,000 outstanding. The Subordinated Bonds are payable solely from the Net Subordinated Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Subordinated Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds.

SMUD issues commercial paper notes (the “Notes”) from time to time. As of March 21, 2024, SMUD’s Notes were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000. Currently, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 may be outstanding at any one time, but SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be outstanding at any one time in the future. The Notes are secured by letters of credit issued by commercial banks. The Notes (and SMUD’s obligations to repay drawings under the letters of credit) are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. Drawings under the letters of credit, to the extent not repaid immediately from the proceeds of commercial paper or other available SMUD funds, are repayable with interest over a period of five years. The letters of credit currently expire in August of 2025 and March of 2027. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD also entered into a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank and issued its taxable and tax-exempt revolving notes thereunder (collectively, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in February 2022. As of December 31, 2023, no principal amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Currently, the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at any one time is limited to $100,000,000. However, SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the Revolving Credit Facility from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. The current term of the Revolving Credit Facility expires in February 2026.

**Joint Powers Authorities.** SMUD has entered into long-term take-or-pay purchase agreements with SFA relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Under such agreements, SMUD has exclusive control of the dispatch of all five of the Local Gas-Fired Plants and takes all of the power produced by the Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” The Authorities are each treated as component units of SMUD for accounting purposes. Only SFA has outstanding debt, which relates solely to the Cosumnes Power Plant and is payable solely from capacity payments made by SMUD under the related power purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2023, bonds issued by SFA to finance the Cosumnes Power Plant were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $87,890,000. SMUD’s payments under the power purchase agreements relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal of and interest on the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and Subordinate Resolution.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCGA as a joint powers authority. NCGA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCGA issued $757,055,000 in bonds in May 2007 for the purpose of paying Morgan Stanley Capital Group in advance for natural gas to be delivered to NCGA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas supplies delivered by NCGA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the
<!-- Page 348 -->
![NCGA bonds](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=NCGA+bonds)

NCGA bonds. As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $120,070,000 remain outstanding.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCEA as a joint powers authority. NCEA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCEA issued $539,615,000 in bonds in December 2018 for the purpose of paying J. Aron & Company LLC in advance for natural gas or electricity to be delivered to NCEA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas or electricity supplies delivered by NCEA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the NCEA bonds. [As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $537,295,000 remain outstanding. As described in the forepart of this Official Statement, the bonds issued by NCEA in 2018 are expected to be refunded with proceeds of the Bonds (as defined in the forepart of this Official Statement.)] [to be revised for 2024 Senior Bond offering documents]

**Interest Rate Swap Agreements.** SMUD has two interest rate swap agreements relating to previously or currently outstanding Subordinated Bonds, as shown in the following table. For more information, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

| Effective Date | Termination Date | SMUD Pays | SMUD Receives | Notional Amount (000's) | Counterparty |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 7/2/1997       | 7/1/2024         | Floating  | SIFMA          | 5.154%                  | $19,570      | J Aron & Company LLC |
| 07/12/2023     | 08/15/2041       | Fixed     | 0.718%         | [70% of 1M SOFR]       | 132,020      | Barclays Bank |

The obligations of SMUD under the swap agreements are not secured by a pledge of revenues of SMUD’s electric system or any other property of SMUD. SMUD does not currently have any collateral posting requirements with respect to the interest rate swap agreements, but SMUD may be required to post collateral under certain circumstances.

**Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments.** SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds, 2009 Series V (the “2009 Series V Bonds”) and Electric Revenue Bonds, 2010 Series W (the “2010 Series W Bonds”) were issued as “Build America Bonds” under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. At the time the 2009 Series V Bonds and 2010 Series W Bonds were issued, SMUD expected to receive an annual cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury equal to 35% of the interest payable on the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. However, as a result of the federal budget process, many payments from the federal government, including Build America Bonds subsidy payments, have been reduced. Absent the federal budget reductions, the aggregate annual cash subsidy payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds would be approximately $9.8 million. With the current federal budget reductions, SMUD has typically been receiving aggregate annual cash subsidy payments with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds of approximately $9.2 million. It is possible that future federal budget actions could further reduce, or eliminate entirely, the annual cash subsidy payments with respect to Build America Bonds, including the annual cash subsidy payments payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. SMUD cannot predict the likelihood of the further reduction or elimination of the Build America Bonds subsidy payments. A significant reduction or elimination of the cash subsidy.

# INSURANCE

SMUD maintains a comprehensive property/casualty insurance program designed to protect against catastrophic losses that would have an adverse effect on its financial position or operational capabilities. Insurance programs are continuously reviewed and modified when construction, operational exposures, or developments in the insurance industry so warrant. Long-term relationships with a variety of insurers minimize SMUD’s susceptibility to the effects of market cycles. SMUD budgets reserves to meet potential insurance deductibles and self-insured liability claims.

SMUD safeguards assets with all-risk property and boiler/machinery insurance with limits of $800 million per occurrence for physical damage and business interruption combined. Various coverage sublimits and deductibles apply to losses arising from certain perils, such as business interruption, earthquake, or flood, respectively. Liability insurance is in effect to defend and indemnify SMUD against third party claims, including general, automobile and sudden and accidental pollution claims with policy limits of $140 million, and wildfire coverage with policy limits of $275 million, all of which include a variety of self-insured retentions.

Nuclear property and liability insurance policies are maintained in accordance with the NRC’s requirements for decommissioned nuclear plants that maintain dry storage of spent fuel on-site. This includes $100 million in first party property damage and decontamination, $100 million for nuclear liability arising from accidents on-site, $200 million for supplier’s and transporter’s nuclear liability, and $300 million for nuclear worker liability. SMUD is exposed to possible retrospective assessments for nuclear property events occurring at other nuclear facilities in the United States capped at ten times SMUD’s annual nuclear property premium (currently the maximum retrospective assessment is approximately $1,000,000).

Other types of insurance include non-owned aircraft liability, workers’ compensation, crime, cyber security, fidelity, fiduciary liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, professional errors and omissions, transportation, and builder’s risk for major facilities under construction.

# LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

SMUD is a party to numerous actions arising out of the conduct of its business and affairs, some of which are discussed below. SMUD believes that any losses or adverse financial results it may suffer in these current actions, to the extent not covered by insurance, would not, in the aggregate, have an adverse material impact on SMUD, its business and affairs, or results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

## Environmental Litigation

SMUD was one of many potentially responsible parties that had been named in a number of actions relating to environmental claims and/or complaints. SMUD has resolved these environmental claims and/or complaints and entered into settlement agreements and/or consent orders. These settlement agreements and consent orders have statutory reopener provisions which allow regulatory agencies to seek additional funds for environmental remediation under certain limited circumstances. While SMUD believes it is unlikely that any of the prior settlements or consent orders will be reopened, the possibility exists. If any of the settlements or consent orders were to be reopened, SMUD believes that the outcome will not have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

## Proposition 26 Lawsuit

In October 2019, two SMUD customers jointly filed a complaint against SMUD (subsequently one of the customers removed themselves from the complaint), which stated that SMUD’s Board violated

A-60
<!-- Page 351 -->
![Proposition 26](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Proposition+26)

**Proposition 26** (see “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Proposition 26” for a description of Proposition 26) when on June 24, 2019, it adopted rate increases for 2020 and 2021. The plaintiff contended the rates did not reflect SMUD’s reasonable cost of service because they included a 9.2% scalar that SMUD applies to its TOD residential rate restructure adopted by SMUD’s Board in the 2017 rate process. SMUD viewed the lawsuit as having little merit and while SMUD anticipated the court would rule in SMUD’s favor on substantive grounds, the plaintiff in early 2024 agreed to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice due to their failure to diligently prosecute the case. On January 16, 2024, the court approved the dismissal.

On January 19, 2024, the same plaintiff, along with a second SMUD residential customer, jointly filed a new complaint challenging the September 21, 2023, SMUD Board adoption of 2024 and 2025 rate increases. The plaintiffs make a similar claim regarding the TOD scalar as the prior lawsuit. Given the little merit behind the lawsuit, SMUD believes the court will rule in its favor. However, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the case or, if to the extent SMUD ultimately is not successful in the litigation, what remedies against SMUD may be available. SMUD believes that if it is not successful in the litigation, and to the extent the outcome would have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, the Board would make appropriate rate modifications based on an evidentiary record consistent with guidance from a judicial decision in the case.

**Other Litigation Matters**

Currently, SMUD is party to various claims, legal actions and complaints relating to its operations, including, but not limited to, property damage, personal injury, contract disputes, and employment matters. SMUD believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

**FERC Administrative Proceedings**

SMUD is involved in a number of FERC administrative proceedings related to the operation of wholesale energy markets, regional transmission planning, gas transportation and NERC reliability standards. These proceedings generally fall into the following categories: (i) filings initiated by the CAISO (or other market participants) to adopt/modify the CAISO Tariff and/or establish market design and behavior rules; (ii) filings initiated by existing transmission owners (i.e., PG&E and the other IOUs) to pass-through costs to their existing wholesale transmission customers; (iii) filings initiated by FERC to market participants to establish market design and behavior rules or investigate market behavior by certain market participants; (iv) filings initiated by transmission owners under their transmission owner tariffs to establish a regional transmission planning process; (v) filings initiated by providers of firm gas transportation services under the Natural Gas Act; and (vi) filings initiated by NERC to develop reliability standards applicable to owners, users, and operators of the bulk electric system. In addition, SMUD is an active participant in other FERC administrative proceedings, including those related to reliability, variable resource integration and the changing resource mix, and transmission planning and cost allocation. SMUD believes that determinations of these FERC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

**CPUC Administrative Proceedings**

Periodically, PG&E seeks to update its gas transmission and storage (“GT&S”) revenue requirements and rate designs. These applications are litigated at the CPUC and affect SMUD through several tariff rates SMUD pays to move natural gas along PG&E’s backbone transmission lines. In the 2019 GT&S rate case (the “2019 GT&S Case”), the CPUC affirmed the application in GT&S rates of cost causation principles to prevent excessive and unreasonable costs being shifted to electric generator. 

A-61

backbone customers like SMUD, either through proposed changes in PG&E’s natural gas storage strategy or through cost shifts within the electric generator customer class.

PG&E filed its 2023 General Rate Case (the “GRC”) in June 2021 which includes its gas transmission and storage revenue requirements. In September 2021, PG&E filed an application for approval of its Gas Cost Allocation and Rate Design Proposals (“CARD”). The CPUC issued a decision in the GRC in November 2023 authorizing PG&E’s revenue requirements for the four-year rate period of 2023-2026. SMUD is a party to the comprehensive all-party settlement agreement submitted to the CPUC for approval in June 2023 which, if approved, would resolve all open issues in the CARD proceeding. SMUD does not believe that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. SMUD will continue to actively participate in PG&E’s GRC and CARD proceedings to ensure that costs are fairly allocated to non-core customers, including electric generator backbone customers.

In the GRC, the CPUC directed PG&E to submit an application to revise its natural gas curtailment procedures “similar to the curtailment procedures of other large energy utilities”. SMUD will actively participate in this future proceeding.

Separately, SMUD continues to participate and monitor a proceeding at the CPUC concerning long-term gas system planning. At this point in these proceedings, SMUD does not anticipate that the resolution of such cases will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

SMUD monitors a number of other CPUC proceedings. These proceedings generally fall into three categories: (i) filings initiated by PG&E to adopt/modify its tariffs and/or rules; (ii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish market design and behavior rules or program rules affecting SMUD customers; and (iii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish electric and/or gas system safety design and maintenance rules. SMUD believes that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR

California Electric Market

In 1996, the State partially deregulated its electric energy market and the CAISO was established in 1998. Since the CAISO’s formation, the State has experienced episodes of higher and more volatile prices for natural gas and wholesale electricity. In reaction to such conditions, SMUD made significant changes to its business strategy to mitigate the impacts of the more volatile and unpredictable energy markets. Volatility in energy prices in the State are always a potential risk due to a variety of factors which affect both the supply and demand for electricity in the western United States. These factors include, but are not limited to, the implementation of the CAISO market design changes, insufficient generation resources, the increase in intermittent renewable energy resources, natural gas price volatility, fuel costs and availability, weather and natural disasters, transmission constraints and levels of hydroelectric generation within the region. While SMUD has taken a number of steps to mitigate its exposure to price volatility associated with these factors, this price volatility under extreme conditions may contribute to greater volatility in SMUD’s net revenues from the purchase and sale of electric energy and, therefore, could materially adversely affect the financial condition and liquidity of SMUD. For a discussion of SMUD’s current resource planning activities and risk management strategies, see “BUSINESS STRATEGY” above.

# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity continues to be a top priority for SMUD. Attacks or threats directed at critical electric or energy sector operations could damage or cause the shut-down of generation, transmission or distribution assets that are essential to SMUD’s ability to serve its customers, cause operational malfunctions and outages affecting SMUD’s electric system, and result in costly recovery and remediation efforts. The costs of security measures or of remedying breaches could be material.

SMUD participates in sharing and receiving information about cyber security threats in real-time through the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (“E-ISAC”), the central hub for such data to actively manage risk related to potential cyber intrusion. SMUD also participates in NERC’s development of mandatory, enforceable cyber security standards to address vulnerabilities in electric utility systems. SMUD also adopts voluntary measures suggested as best practices by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) in its national framework.

SMUD’s prudent response to this ever-changing threat requires constant monitoring and frequent updates to implement new regulatory requirements as they are developed. SMUD manages risk related to frequently changing regulatory requirements by participating in the development of standards at NERC and NIST and through active engagement in the cyber security policy dialogue in Congress.

# Physical Security

Physical security is a critical concern for electric utilities as they seek to protect their infrastructure from a range of threats. The electric utility infrastructure is complex and consists of multiple components, such as power plants, substations, transmission and distribution lines, and other facilities. SMUD employs a dedicated physical security team that is deployed 24/7 and allows SMUD to respond to emergent events in a safe, coordinated, efficient, and cohesive manner, protecting the lives of its employees, customers, community, properties and assets. SMUD has policies, processes and procedures in place that outline the access controls and restrictions for its properties. SMUD restricts access based on need as it determines, while adhering to applicable laws, regulations and standards such as NERC Reliability Standards and NRC regulations. SMUD also maintains a Utility Security Plan adopted by the Board representing SMUD’s compliance with the CPUC’s Safety and Enforcement Division six-step security plan process described in CPUC Decision 19-01-018.

During times of elevated, imminent threats, safety and/or security concerns, SMUD’s Security Operations team, under the direction of the Chief Financial Officer or delegate, reserves the right to deploy additional security measures, controls, and further restrict or limit access to its properties to increase its security posture.

SMUD operates a 24/7 security operations center which monitors and coordinates responses to situations reported by internal and external stakeholders, or which are detected by SMUD’s security technology. The technology includes access control, video surveillance, and various types of intrusion detection solutions. The security operations center is a central hub for initial contact for physical security calls from employees of suspicious events and initiates incident responses as needed.

# Federal Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings

## Energy Policy Act of 2005

On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct of 2005”) was signed into law. The law includes a number of energy-related provisions, including among other things limited FERC jurisdiction over interstate transmission assets of municipal utilities, cooperatives and federal utilities to order these entities to provide transmission services on rates and terms. 

A-63
<!-- Page 354 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**Federal Regulation of Transmission Access.** The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the “Energy Policy Act”) made fundamental changes in the federal regulation of the electric utility industry, particularly in the area of transmission access. The Energy Policy Act provided FERC with the authority to require a transmitting utility to provide transmission services at rates, charges, terms and conditions set by FERC. The purpose of these changes, in part, was to bring about increased competition in the electric utility industry. Under the Energy Policy Act, electric utilities owned by municipalities and other public agencies which own or operate electric power transmission facilities which are used for the sale of electric energy at wholesale are “transmitting utilities” subject to the requirements of the Energy Policy Act.

Since the Energy Policy Act, FERC has adopted a series of rules to implement competitive open access to transmission facilities and regional transmission planning. Order No. 888, issued in 1996, requires the provision of open access transmission services on a nondiscriminatory basis by all “jurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does not include municipal entities like SMUD) by requiring all such utilities to file OATTs. Order No. 888 also requires “nonjurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does include SMUD) that purchase transmission services from a jurisdictional utility under an open access tariff and that owns or controls transmission facilities to provide open access service to the jurisdictional utility under terms that are comparable to the service that the nonjurisdictional utility provides itself. Section 211A of the EPAct of 2005 authorizes, but does not require, FERC to order nonjurisdictional utilities to provide transmission services, including rates and terms and conditions, that are comparable to those under which the unregulated transmitting utility provides transmission services to itself that are not unduly discriminatory or preferential – often referred to as the reciprocity rule.

In Order 890, issued in 2007, FERC stated that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis and retain the current reciprocity provisions.

In 2011, FERC issued Order 1000, which among other things requires public utility (jurisdictional) transmission providers to participate in a regional transmission planning process that produces a regional transmission plan and that incorporates a regional and inter-regional cost allocation methodology. Similar to Order 890, FERC states that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis. However, in Order 1000, FERC appears to expand upon the current reciprocity provisions and states that it has the authority to allocate costs to beneficiaries of services provided by specific transmission facilities even in the absence of a contractual relationship between the owner of the transmission facilities and the identified beneficiary.

SMUD, individually, and through the Large Public Power Council (“LPPC”), appealed Order 1000, but in 2014 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected all of the arguments raised on appeal, upholding the entirety of Order 1000.

The jurisdictional members of WestConnect filed their proposed regional planning process and cost allocation methodology through a series of compliance filings at FERC. FERC accepted binding cost allocation for jurisdictional transmission providers of WestConnect and mandated that non-jurisdictional transmission providers (such as SMUD) identified as beneficiaries of a project have the ability to not accept the cost allocation. WestConnect’s Order 1000 planning process began with the 2016-2017 planning cycle. 

A-64
<!-- Page 355 -->
However, in response to FERC’s WestConnect orders on compliance, El Paso Electric Company (“El Paso”), a jurisdictional transmission provider, petitioned to the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. El Paso contends that FERC’s WestConnect orders violate Order 1000’s cost causation principle because WestConnect’s binding cost allocation applies only to the jurisdictional transmission providers and thus forces jurisdictional transmission providers to subsidize projects benefiting non-jurisdictional transmission providers that opt-out of projects. The non-jurisdictional transmission providers agreed on a settlement with the jurisdictional transmission providers to resolve the matters on appeal in the 5th Circuit, but FERC ultimately did not accept the settlement. On August 2, 2023, the court reversed FERC’s orders implementing Order No. 1000 for WestConnect concerning cost allocation of regional transmission projects to non-jurisdictional transmission providers. The court found that the WestConnect orders are incompatible with Order No. 1000’s application of the cost causation principle to address free ridership. There is uncertainty at this time on the future of WestConnect’s regional planning process. FERC has not yet acted on its own in light of the Fifth Circuit’s decision, and it is uncertain whether it will act while it is working on an updated transmission planning and cost allocation proposal that could change the Order 1000 process (as further discussed below regarding the April 21, 2022 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking). It is also uncertain if and/or the extent to which the jurisdictional transmission providers in WestConnect will file revisions to the regional transmission planning provisions in their OATTs. In the meantime, the WestConnect planning has continued under the existing framework and SMUD, along with the other non-jurisdictional transmission providers, continue to participate in the WestConnect process. SMUD’s longstanding objective is to comply with open access requirements necessary to achieve reciprocity, including through participation in a regional planning process while binding itself to mandatory cost allocation. Thus, SMUD has an interest in continuing to explore options for participation in a regional transmission planning process if the WestConnect rules are modified to permit SMUD to reasonably participate consistent with its business and jurisdictional interests.

SMUD is unable to predict at this time the full impact that Order 1000, or the 5th Circuit’s August decision, will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the WestConnect process generally. However, WestConnect has conducted multiple planning cycles under its Order 1000 planning process and has not identified any project eligible for cost allocation. SMUD will continue to take any action necessary, including withdrawing from a cost allocation determination or planning region, and engaging in FERC proceedings, to ensure that it is not required to pay for transmission costs in the absence of an agreement or service relationship.

On April 21, 2022, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Building for the Future Through Electric Regional Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation and Generator Interconnection (the “NOPR”). The NOPR seeks input on proposals that would impact the Order 1000 planning and cost allocation process. SMUD has been engaged in the proceeding, providing input and helping draft comments with trade organizations, including LPPC. FERC has not issued any subsequent order. SMUD will continue to monitor and be engaged in any developments at FERC that impact the Order 1000 process and its regional transmission planning participation.

NERC Reliability Standards. The EPAct of 2005 required FERC to certify an electric reliability organization (“ERO”) to develop mandatory and enforceable reliability standards, subject to FERC review and approval. On February 3, 2006, FERC issued Order 672, which certified NERC as the ERO. Many reliability standards have since been approved by FERC, including those aimed at protecting the bulk electric system from physical and cyber threats.

The ERO or the regional entities, such as WECC, may enforce the reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight or FERC may independently enforce reliability standards. Potential monetary sanctions include fines of up to $1,544,521 per violation per day. Order 693 provides ERO and regional entities with 

A-65
<!-- Page 356 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

the discretion necessary to assess penalties for such violations, while also having discretion to calculate a penalty without collecting the penalty if circumstances warrant.

**Anti-Market Manipulation Rules.** EPAct of 2005 gave FERC the authority to issue rules to prevent market manipulation in jurisdictional wholesale power and gas markets, and in jurisdictional transmission and transportation services. These anti-market manipulation rules apply to non-jurisdictional entities such as SMUD. Further, EPAct of 2005 provided FERC civil penalty authority, which the Commission has stated that it will exercise carefully by assuring that its market manipulation rules are clear.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions.** Since 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions from different sources, including from the electric sector.

In 2014, EPA issued a proposed rule under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) called the Clean Power Plan (the “CPP”) that projected power sector emissions reductions of 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The proposed CPP would have established a rate-based emissions goal for each state, providing states the responsibility to develop a State Implementation Plan (“SIP”) describing how each will meet the goal assigned by EPA using the “Best System of Emissions Reduction” (“BSER”) established by EPA. The rule was finalized in October 2015.

In November 2015, 27 states and numerous corporations challenged the CPP in court, alleging that EPA had exceeded its authority under the CAA; however, before the issue could be decided by the court, the 2016 presidential election resulted in a change of administration. The new administration quickly moved for an abeyance (or stay) of the case for as long as the agency needed to review and withdraw the CPP. The U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP pending disposition in the D.C. Circuit and any subsequent review by the Supreme Court. In August 2018, EPA proceeded to withdraw the CPP and the D.C. Circuit ultimately dismissed the case on September 17, 2019. EPA proposed a different rule under the same provision of the CAA, known as the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, which would have established a BSER that only includes measures that can be undertaken at an individual power plant, rather than the broader suite of measures envisioned under the CPP. The ACE rule was challenged in court by environmental groups and states alleging that the revised rule inadequately responds to EPA’s responsibility to protect public health and welfare. SMUD joined in this litigation along with other challengers. The D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule on January 19, 2021, and remanded it to the EPA for review and revision, just days before a new presidential administration took office. Several states led by West Virginia and coal industry members appealed the decision.

In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in West Virginia v. EPA, striking down the CPP and foreclosing any future regulations of “significant political and economic significance” if Congress has not expressly authorized them. While the decision does not restrict EPA to only requiring measures “inside the fence line” at an individual power plant to control GHGs, it appears unlikely that the EPA will be able to require material reductions in GHGs to mitigate climate change through section 111(d) of the CAA.

Under the new presidential administration, in May 2023, the EPA issued a proposed rule under Section 111(d) of the CAA to reduce GHG emissions from existing and new power plants. The four-part proposed rule, **New Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Existing Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; and Repeal of the Affordable Clean Energy Rule**, would set both GHG emission standards for certain subcategories of new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants operating greater than 50% of the time and generating more than 300 MW per turbine. In the proposed rule, EPA determined the BSER is either deploying carbon capture and storage

technology to capture 90% of emissions or co-firing 96% hydrogen produced through a low-emission process (“low-GHG hydrogen”). If finalized, compliance is required by 2032. SMUD has filed comments as part of several trade groups and coalitions in response to the proposed rule. SMUD’s internal analysis shows the rule as proposed would not require changes at any of its currently-operating fossil-fueled power plants and therefore will not have a material impact on SMUD’s financial position, operations, or liquidity.

**Federal Communications Commission**

The 1978 Pole Attachment Act added section 224 to the Communications Act of 1934, authorizing the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) to regulate attachments by cable television systems or providers of telecommunications service to utility poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way. Under Section 224(a)(1), public power entities are exempt from FCC pole attachment regulations, as municipally-owned poles are already subject to local decision-making processes and governance. The municipal exemption from FCC pole attachment regulations was further codified through the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. However, over the past decade, this exemption has been continuously eroded.

Various actions by the FCC have limited the exemption in support of a “uniform policy for broadband access to privately-owned physical infrastructure.” Through four orders issued between 2017 and 2018, the FCC set strict time limits for the review of pole attachment applications and preempted state and local agreements on pole attachments. In 2020, in *City of Portland v. United States*, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the FCC’s Small Cell Order, which adopted new time limits for municipal utilities’ review of wireless infrastructure siting applications and preempted access for small cell installations. In November 2023, the FCC adopted its Fourth Report and Order, Declaratory Ruling, and Third Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which established new rules and timelines for the approval process for pole attachment applications, among other things. SMUD will monitor this proceeding for any potential impact to SMUD.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new FCC rulemakings will impact the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system.

**Federal Clean Energy Legislation.** SMUD actively participates in discussion at the federal level regarding legislation that would meaningfully impact SMUD’s existing GHG reduction strategies or impose new requirements for electric generators, including a proposed federal clean energy standard. In the 117th Congress, a clean electricity performance program was considered but ultimately lacked support to pass. Instead, Congress extended and expanded clean energy tax credits and created new grant and rebate programs to incentivize clean energy investments in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While it is possible that a future Congress may revisit the concept of a clean energy standard or other GHG reduction regime, it is possible that the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will diminish the likelihood of a new regulatory framework being enacted in the near future.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new EPA rulemakings will be undertaken, and what the full impact of the reduction of fossil-based generation over time will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the electric utility industry generally.

**State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings**

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills provide for reduced GHG emission standards and greater investment in energy efficient and environmentally friendly generation alternatives through more stringent RPS. Additionally, ongoing regulatory proceedings address the implementation of these bills as well as water flow and quality.

![Greenhouse Gas Emissions Summary](https://example.com/image.png)

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**  
On September 27, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (“AB 32”). AB 32 requires the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) to adopt enforceable GHG emission limits and emission reduction measures in order to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In addition, AB 32 establishes a mandatory reporting program for all IOUs, local, publicly-owned electric utilities and other load-serving entities (electric utilities providing energy to end-use customers) (“LSEs”). The AB 32 reporting program allows CARB to adopt regulations using market-based compliance mechanisms such as a “cap-and-trade” system.

On December 16, 2010, CARB approved a resolution adopting cap-and-trade regulations for the State. The regulations became effective on January 1, 2012. As adopted, the cap-and-trade program covers sources accounting for 85% of the State’s GHG emissions, the largest program of its type in the United States. In November of 2012, CARB conducted its first allowance auction and auctions now occur on a quarterly schedule.

The cap-and-trade program introduced a hard emissions cap that declines over time on the combined electric utility and large industrial sectors, covering all sources emitting more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases (“CO2e”) per year, and was subsequently expanded to cover distributors of transportation, natural gas, and other fossil fuels. The cap-and-trade program requires covered entities to retire compliance instruments (allowances and carbon offsets) for each metric ton of CO2e they emit. CARB has allocated allowances to LSEs to mitigate the compliance cost burden on ratepayers. The value of allowances must be used to benefit ratepayers and achieve GHG emission purposes (not exceeding 8% of a regulated entity’s compliance obligation through 2020, 4% from 2021 through 2025, and 6% from 2026 through 2030). Offsets must be obtained from certified projects in sectors that are not regulated under the cap-and-trade program and are subject to other restrictions.

The State's cap-and-trade program was briefly linked to companion program in the Canadian province of Ontario during 2018 but was de-linked following a political change. In 2021, the Washington state legislature passed a cap-and-trade bill, which is expected to interact with the State’s markets. Future potential near-term links to the CARB cap-and-trade program also include the states of Oregon, which has adopted a cap-and-trade program, and New Mexico, which is considering the adoption of a cap-and-trade program.

On October 7, 2015, SB 350 was enacted, containing aggressive goals for reducing carbon emissions by 2030, including raising the proportion of renewable energy to 50%, reducing the use of petroleum fuel in cars and trucks by up to 50%, and doubling the energy efficiency of existing buildings. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” for additional information. In addition, SB 350 established requirements for larger POUs to adopt and file with the CEC Integrated Resource Plans (“IRPs”) by April 2019 that should planned procurement to achieve the 50% RPS and State GHG goals established by CARB. The CEC developed “guidelines” for these IRPs for POUs in 2017, updated them in 2018, and proposed additional updates in 2022. CARB established specific GHG target ranges for these IRPs in summer 2018, which were revised in 2023 following the adoption of CARB’s 2022 Scoping Plan. SMUD developed and adopted an IRP in 2018 through a comprehensive public process and filed the adopted IRP with the CEC in April 2019. SMUD adopted an updated IRP in June 2022 and filed the updated IRP with the CEC in September 2022, but the CEC has not yet completed its review of SMUD’s 2022 IRP. SMUD’s updated IRP plans for a greater than 92% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 relative to 1990 levels, which equals approximately A-68.

250,000 metric tons of GHG emissions in 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change.”

On April 29, 2015, the Governor of the State signed Executive Order B-30-15, establishing a goal for the State to reduce GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2016, the State Legislature passed Senate Bill 32 (“SB 32”), which codified then-Governor Brown’s goal of reducing the State’s GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2017, the State Legislature passed Assembly Bill 398 (“AB 398”), explicitly authorizing the continuation of the cap-and-trade program, with designated changes, through 2030. Subsequently, CARB adopted an initial set of regulatory changes extending the cap-and-trade program, including establishing utility sector allowance allocations through 2030. In 2018, CARB completed a rulemaking to implement the cap-and-trade program changes designated by AB 398. These changes include development of a hard price ceiling for the cap-and-trade program and two price-containment points below that ceiling, in an attempt to ensure stable prices in the program. CARB adopted final regulations on December 13, 2018.

In addition, any new projects constructed in the State, including power plants, that may cause a significant adverse impact on the environment must be analyzed under CEQA. Some State agencies have begun using CEQA in novel ways to require mitigation of “significant” GHG emissions caused, either directly or indirectly, by a project. Pursuant to Senate Bill 97 passed in 2007, CARB will assist the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research in setting thresholds of significance under CEQA of GHG impacts from new projects. This is an area of State law that is evolving and unsettled in the courts. However, there is a risk that any project proponent of an electric system infrastructure project might have to mitigate such potential impacts to a level of less than significant.

On December 3, 2012, the Superior Court issued a ruling in California Redwood Forest Foundation v. San Diego Association of Governments (“SANDAG”), Case No. 2100-00101593, that sided with the State Attorney General and the other petitioners stating that SANDAG did not follow CEQA when it adopted a $257 billion regional transportation plan in 2011. The ruling expressly invalidated the certification of the Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) on the grounds that the EIR should have analyzed the plan’s consistency with the governor’s policy goal to reduce GHG emissions by 80% by 2050 as articulated in the 2005 Executive Order S-03-05. On November 24, 2014, the Fourth Appellate District upheld the trial court in a published decision, and SANDAG appealed to the State Supreme Court. On July 13, 2017, the Supreme Court reversed and held that SANDAG’s decision to not adopt the 2050 goal was not an abuse of discretion. Nevertheless, the Court articulated three clear principles for agencies to follow in their CEQA review of planning documents: 1) agencies must take seriously the significance of even small increases in GHG emissions; 2) they must consider science-based State policy guidance in their decision-making; and 3) they are required to use the best scientific information available to determine whether their planning decisions are consistent with the State’s goals. These principles will apply to SMUD in CEQA reviews of future projects.

On September 29, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law Senate Bill 1368 (“SB 1368”), the GHG Emissions Performance Standard (“EPS”). SB 1368 limits long-term investments in baseload generation by the State’s utilities to power plants that meet an EPS jointly established by the CEC and the CPUC. The agencies have set the EPS at 1,100 pounds CO2 per MWh, which is roughly half of the CO2 emissions rate of a conventional coal-fired power plant. CEC regulations to implement the law for POUs were approved by the Office of Administrative Law on October 16, 2007.

SMUD’s primary supply and demand-side resources need to meet customers’ electric usage patterns over the next 10 years. Currently there is a ban in the State that prohibits the development of nuclear power plants until there is a permanent storage solution for spent fuel rods. With the effective ban on new coal power imports under SB 1368, natural gas-fired, combined cycle power plants would appear

A-69
<!-- Page 360 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

to be the primary viable option for fossil fuel-based baseload power plant development absent the implementation of new technologies in connection with other resource options. The reliance on a single fuel source will continue to put pressure on the natural gas market in the United States. SMUD has in place a natural gas procurement plan to mitigate natural gas volatility, see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply” above.

On September 16, 2022, the Governor of the State signed into law SB 1020, which creates interim climate targets under which eligible renewable energy resources and zero-carbon resources must supply 90% of all retail sales of electricity to California end-use customers by December 31, 2035, and 95% by December 31, 2040. The bill also requires each State agency to ensure that zero carbon resources and eligible renewable energy resources supply 100% of electricity procured on its behalf by December 31, 2035. SMUD provides electricity to a number of State agency buildings and will work with State agencies to comply with this requirement.

On October 7, 2023, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 1305, which requires an entity that purchases or uses voluntary carbon offsets and makes claims regarding the achievement of net zero, or other similar claims, to disclose on their website specified information. Many stakeholder groups are raising questions on if this includes RECs. Clean-up legislation could follow. It is not clear at this time whether RECs are included.

Reliability. On June 30, 2022, the Governor signed the 2022-23 budget, along with a number of trailer bills, which provide implementing details on the budget line items. Included in AB 205, the energy trailer bill, are a number of reliability programs.

1. CEC Distributed Electricity Backup Assets Program to incentivize the construction of cleaner and more efficient distributed energy assets that would serve as on-call emergency supply or load reduction for the state’s electrical grid during extreme events. The CEC adopted program guidelines in October 2023 and issued the first solicitation in December 2023.

2. CEC Demand Side Grid Support Program to pay customers to reduce demand during stressed grid events. SMUD has actively engaged the CEC on the development and subsequent revision of program guidelines. The CEC is expected to revise the guidelines again for summer 2024.

3. DWR Strategic Reliability Reserve to secure resources for summer reliability or to preserve the option to extend the life of facilities that otherwise would retire, new temporary generators of more than five MW, new energy storage systems of at least 20 MW, generation facilities that use clean, zero-emission fuel technologies, or new zero-emission technologies that can be operational by December 31, 2026.

As a follow up to this legislation, the Governor signed into law AB 1373. The bill authorizes the CEC to annually assess a capacity payment on a POU within the CAISO balancing authority area during a month in which the POU fails to meet its minimum planning reserve margin. This does not include SMUD, who is within the BANC balancing authority area. SMUD is, however, required to submit to the CEC an assessment of whether it exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin and system resource adequacy requirements. This bill also allows the DWR, for certain types of long-development projects, to act as a central procurement entity. For POUs, participation in the DWR program would be optional.

Zero-Emission Fleet Mandates. CARB has adopted the Advanced Clean Fleets (“ACF”) regulation, requiring certain medium- and heavy-duty (“MHD”) vehicle fleets to transition to zero-emission vehicles through purchase requirements or fleet composition requirements, which took effect on November

A-70
<!-- Page 361 -->
1, 2023, and applies to all publicly owned MHD fleets, larger commercially owned MHD fleets, and drayage trucks. Under the ACF Rule, public fleets like SMUD have two compliance options. The first is a zero-emission vehicle (“ZEV”) purchase requirement, under which 50% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2024, and 100% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2027. The second is an optional ZEV milestone option, under which the composition of the MHD fleet would need to meet certain ZEV percentages starting in 2025, with the entire fleet transitioned no later than 2042. The individual milestones depend on the number and category of vehicles in the fleet. Public fleets may opt into the ZEV milestone option until January 1, 2030. In 2024, SMUD plans to comply with the purchase requirement option, meaning that 50% of the MHD vehicles expects to opt into the ZEV milestone option as more ZEVs become available. The ACF Rule also accelerates a manufacturer ZEV sales requirement to 100% of all MHD truck sales by the 2036 model year.

CARB proposed the Zero-Emission Forklift regulation in November 2023. The regulation would require forklift fleets to transition spark-ignited forklifts to zero-emission technology starting in 2026. The regulation would apply to SMUD, as a forklift operator. Since SMUD has a limited number of forklifts, this regulation is not expected to have a material effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operation.

Transportation and Building Electrification. In recent years, the State has identified transportation and building electrification as key strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, and is advancing policy to support or accelerate electrification. For example, in addition to the zero-emission fleet mandates and LCFS regulation discussed herein, CARB adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks regulations to require vehicle manufacturers to increase sales of zero-emission vehicles, respectively. The CEC’s Building Energy Efficiency Standards are also encouraging the use of electric heat pumps in new homes and certain non-residential buildings across the state. The draft 2025 Energy Standards, which are expected to be proposed by April 2024 and adopted by August 2024, would establish prescriptive heat pump requirements for both space and water heating in new homes, and may require existing homes to install a heat pump when replacing an air conditioner. The 2025 Energy Standards, if approved, would take effect on January 1, 2025. In addition, the State has also provided funding for programs to encourage clean transportation and building electrification.

Increases in transportation and building electrification will result in increased customer usage of electricity.

Renewables Portfolio Standard. Senate Bill 100 was passed by the Legislature and approved by Governor Brown on September 10, 2018. Among other requirements, the bill sets a 50% RPS target for 2026 and sets compliance period targets at 44% by December 31, 2024, 52% by December 31, 2027, and 60% by December 31, 2030. The bill also creates a statewide planning goal to meet all of the state’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045.

Sacramento-San Joaquin River Bay-Delta Processes. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is an expansive inland estuary, formed at the western edge of the California Central Valley by the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers (“Delta”). There are two substantial Delta planning processes with the potential to affect (1) energy available for SMUD’s purchase from the Central Valley Project (“CVP”) and (2) flows within the Upper American River watershed. These processes are called the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan (“Bay-Delta Plan”) and the Delta Conveyance Project.

The Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan is updated periodically by the State Water Resources Control Board (“SWRCB”), the last time being in 2006. The current Bay-Delta Plan update process is being implemented in four phases. The first phase considered southern Delta water quality, with a

A-71
<!-- Page 362 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+not+displayed)  
significant focus on San Joaquin River tributaries. Phase 2, which is initially being addressed by a document under development by SWRCB staff, will address Sacramento River tributaries and various flow related issues, including the critically important one of those tributaries’ contribution to Delta outflow. Phase 3 will concern changes to water rights needed to implement Phase 2. A substantial change in Delta outflow requirements could have a major impact on the timing of hydroelectric energy generation by the CVP. SMUD has a long-term agreement with WAPA to purchase some of this power (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration”). On July 18, 2018, the SWRCB released an updated Framework document signaling its staff’s intent to propose Delta outflow requirements of 45-65% unimpaired flows for the Sacramento River tributaries (which includes the American River, the upper portions of which are where the AQR sits), though the report will analyze requirements of 35-75%. If these criteria were implemented, they could cut CVP generation by 50 to 63%. Governor Newsom has urged the SWRCB, other agencies and affected parties to execute voluntary agreements (aka the “Healthy Rivers Agreements”) to address species’ needs and outflow requirements. Although the negotiations have been slow, it is expected they will eventually result in a reasonable compromise. However, in September 2023 the SWRCB released a Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document in Support of Potential Updates to the Bay-Delta Plan (the “Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document”) to justify the adoption of the unimpaired flow standard as set forth in the 2018 Framework document. Numerous public entities, including SMUD, filed comments stating that, among other things, the potential updates identified in the Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document, if adopted, would violate the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act and Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution, would not protect fish and wildlife, and would not reasonably protect all beneficial uses, including water supplies for millions of Californians and hydroelectric power generation that is essential to California’s resilient energy grid. Moreover, the comments filed also stated that the Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document has not been developed consistent with CEQA because, among other things, the analysis of the proposed information and the impacts of proposed changes to beneficial uses, including generally electrical grid reliability, is not supported by substantial evidence and fails to satisfy informational requirements. In addition, the comments maintain that the Healthy Rivers Agreements are a superior approach to achieving the goal of maximizing both environmental and other beneficial uses. If the unimpaired flow standard is adopted and the Healthy Rivers Agreements do not come to fruition, SMUD plans to fully participate in all regulatory and legal proceedings to argue for consideration and minimization of impacts to hydropower generation. SMUD will assess the potential impacts of proposed modifications to the present outflow objectives on SMUD’s operations once, or if, the SWRCB makes available information with enough specificity for SMUD to conduct the relevant modeling.

In July 2022, the DWR released a Draft Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) to evaluate the potential impacts of carrying out the Delta Conveyance Project; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a separate Environmental Impact Statement to evaluate the effects of the project pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. The Delta Conveyance Project is expected to entail construction of two intakes on the Sacramento River that will carry water to a main tunnel to the California Aqueduct for delivery south of the Delta. The Delta Conveyance Project may pose the potential to exacerbate impacts to already imperiled aquatic species, and in turn could have indirectly prompted regulatory agencies to require third parties, such as SMUD, to compensate by making changes to their operations. The Bureau of Reclamation is not a party to the Delta Conveyance Project, which should eliminate the potential for CVP power to be used to supply Delta Conveyance Project pumps. SMUD will monitor the proceedings and participate as necessary to ensure any impacts to SMUD interests are minimized, including potentially filing a challenge to the water rights DWR would need to modify in order to carry out the project.

Proposition 26. Proposition 26 was approved by the electorate on November 2, 2010 and amends Article XIII A and Article XIII C of the State Constitution. Proposition 26 imposes a two-thirds voter approval requirement for the imposition of fees and charges by the State, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. It also imposes a majority voter approval requirement on local governments with  
A-72
<!-- Page 363 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+not+displayed)

**A-73**

**respect to fees and charges for general purposes, and a two-thirds voter approval requirement with respect to fees and charges for special purposes, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. The initiative, according to its supporters, is intended to prevent the circumvention of tax limitations imposed by the voters pursuant to Proposition 13, approved in 1978, and other measures through the use of non-tax fees and charges. Proposition 26 expressly excludes from its scope a charge imposed for a specific local government service or product provided directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable cost to the local government of providing the service or product. Proposition 26 is not retroactive as applied to local governments. Although SMUD believes that the initiative was not intended to apply to fees for utility services such as those charged by SMUD and its fees and charges meet the criteria of the exclusion described above, it is possible that Proposition 26 could be interpreted to further limit fees and charges for electric utility services and/or require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes. SMUD is unable to predict at this time how Proposition 26 will be interpreted by the courts or what its ultimate impact will be. As of the date of this Official Statement, SMUD is unaware of any fees or charges relating to SMUD’s service that would have to be reduced or eliminated because of Proposition 26. However, certain of SMUD’s adopted rate increases have been challenged. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”**

**Initiative 1935.** A voter initiative entitled “The Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act” (“Initiative 1935”) has been determined to be eligible for the State’s November 2024 statewide general election and, unless withdrawn by its proponent prior to June 27, 2024, will be certified as qualified for the ballot in such election. Were it to be approved by a majority of voters in the election, Initiative 1935 would amend Article XIII C of the State Constitution to, among other things, provide that charges (or increases in charges) imposed or extended by a local government after January 1, 2022 for services or products provided directly to the payor (including, potentially, fees and charges for electric service or product) are “taxes” subject to voter approval unless the local government can provide convincing evidence that the charge is reasonable and does not exceed the “actual cost” of providing the service or product. Initiative 1935 defines “actual cost” as “(i) the minimum amount necessary to reimburse the government for the cost of providing the service or the product to the payor and (ii) where the amount charged is not used by the government for any purpose other than reimbursing that cost.” Initiative 1935 would also require that local governments impose fees and charges by ordinance (which may be subject to referendum). If adopted, Initiative 1935 would be subject to judicial interpretation. SMUD is unable to predict whether and how Initiative 1935, if approved, would be interpreted or applied, but it is possible any such interpretation or application could further limit future fees and charges or future increases in fees and charges for electric utility services, require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes and/or otherwise adversely impact SMUD and its revenues. In response to an emergency petition filed by Governor Gavin Newsom, with support from the League of California Cities and others, the California Supreme Court has unanimously agreed to decide whether the initiative should appear on the November 2024 ballot or be disqualified. A ruling is expected before June 30, 2024, which is the deadline for placing items on the November 2024 ballot. 

**On November 2, 2023, Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 13 (“ACA 13”) was filed with the Secretary of State and will be on the ballot for the November 2024 statewide general election. If approved by voters, ACA 13 would require any initiative constitutional amendment appearing on the ballot on or after January 1, 2024, that would increase the voter approval requirement to adopt any State or local measure to be approved by the highest voter approval requirement that the initiative measure would impose. In other words, if ACA 13 is approved by voters, its express terms appear to require Initiative 1935 to pass with a 2/3 vote, since Initiative 1935 would extend a 2/3 voter requirement to additional State and local fees and charges. If adopted, ACA 13 and its effect on the adoption of Initiative 1935, if applicable, are likely to be subject to judicial interpretation. SMUD is not able to predict whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would be interpreted or applied or whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would affect the adoption, interpretation or application of Initiative 1935, if adopted.**

![Wildfire Legislation](https://example.com/image-url)

**Wildfire Legislation.** In response to catastrophic wildfires in California, legislation was adopted and signed into law requiring POUs (including SMUD), IOUs, and electrical cooperatives to construct, maintain and operate their electrical lines and equipment in a manner that will minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire posed by electrical lines and equipment. Senate Bill 247 (“SB 247”), signed by Governor Newsom on October 2, 2019, establishes notification, audit and reporting guidelines for electrical corporations relating to vegetation management requirements in the wildfire mitigation plan. SB 247 also specifies the qualifications for electrical line clearance tree trimmers performing work to comply with the vegetation management requirements in an electrical corporation’s wildfire mitigation plan and requires that qualified line clearance tree trimmers be paid no less than a specified prevailing wage rate. POUs are not required to adhere to SB 247, but the market impacts are projected to significantly increase SMUD’s annual vegetation management costs.

**Nonstock Security.** SMUD sponsored legislation in 2019, Assembly Bill 689, which was signed into law by Governor Newsom on September 5, 2019. This bill expressly allows SMUD the ability to operate a pilot project (effective January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2025), of up to three acquisitions, to hold nonstock security in a corporation or other private entity if acquired as part of a procurement of goods or services from that entity, provided that no separate funding is expended solely for the nonstock security. This will allow SMUD to realize the financial benefits of its investments, partnerships, and intellectual property.

On September 15, 2022, the Board authorized the CEO & GM to enter into a joint collaboration agreement with ESS Tech, Inc. (“ESS”). Under that agreement SMUD would procure from ESS in flow batteries for utility scale long-duration energy storage applications. The agreement contemplates a multi-year phased deployment of up to 200MW/2GWh of long duration energy storage by 2028. As part of this procurement, SMUD acquired nonstock security in ESS.

SMUD will be sponsoring legislation in 2024 to extend the authority granted by Assembly Bill 689 to future years.

**Future Regulation**

The electric industry is subject to continuing legislative and administrative reform. States and Federal entities routinely consider changes to the way in which they regulate the electric industry. Recently, both further deregulation and forms of additional regulation have been proposed for the industry, which has been highly regulated throughout its history. SMUD is unable to predict at this time the impact any such proposals will have on the operations and finances of SMUD or the electric utility industry generally.

**OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY**

**CAISO Market Initiatives**

The CAISO routinely conducts a number of initiatives and stakeholder processes that propose certain operational and market changes that impact SMUD. SMUD does and will continue to monitor the various initiatives proposed by the CAISO and participate in its stakeholder processes to ensure that its interests are protected.

SMUD participates in the CAISO market for only a small percentage of energy needs, however, it continues to benefit from its participation in the CAISO’s WEIM and is currently exploring further participation in the CAISO’s proposed Extended Day Ahead Market (“EDAM”) (both the WEIM and EDAM are described further below). Along with monitoring other key market initiatives at the CAISO which impact wholesale energy markets, SMUD will continue to actively participate in all processes related

A-74
<!-- Page 365 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

to EIM and EDAM, to ensure both participation models are beneficial to SMUD’s customers. Given its success in EIM and active engagement with the CAISO and CAISO leadership, SMUD has earned a key role in the stakeholder processes related to these important and evolving markets.

**Resource Adequacy Filing**

In September 2005, the State Legislature enacted and the Governor signed into law Assembly Bill 380 (“AB 380”), which requires the CPUC to establish resource adequacy requirements for all LSEs within the CPUC’s jurisdiction. SMUD is not an LSE subject to the CPUC’s jurisdiction. In 2005, the CPUC issued a decision requiring jurisdictional LSEs to demonstrate that they have acquired capacity sufficient to serve their forecast retail customer load plus a minimum 15% planning reserve margin. In June 2022, the CPUC issued a decision increasing the minimum planning reserve margin to 16% for 2023 and 17% for 2024. In June 2023, the CPUC kept the minimum planning reserve margin at 17% for 2024 and extended the 17% requirement for 2025.

AB 380 also required publicly owned utilities, including SMUD, to meet the most recent resource adequacy standard as adopted by the WECC. The WECC has yet to formally adopt a resource adequacy requirement. However, consistent with current WECC practices, SMUD utilizes a minimum 15% planning reserve margin when assessing the need for future resources. For summer 2023, SMUD attained a 17% planning reserve margin and will have at least a 17% planning reserve margin for summer 2024 as well.

In 2022, the State Legislature adopted Assembly Bill 209 (2022) (“AB 209”), which requires the CEC to develop recommendations about approaches to determining an appropriate planning reserve margin for local publicly owned utilities within the CAISO balancing authority area. The CEC has initiated a proceeding and plans to publish a report with a recommended methodology on summer 2024. The report will not directly impact SMUD since SMUD is not in the CAISO; nevertheless, SMUD is monitoring the proceeding. The State Legislature also passed Assembly Bill 1373 (2023) (“AB 1373”) that requires the CEC to submit a report to the Legislature that assesses whether each local publicly owned electric utility in California (both inside and outside the CAISO) exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin for 2023. The report must also assess whether local publicly owned utilities met the planning reserve margin for June through September 2023 established by the CPUC’s June 2022 decision (i.e., 16%). See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Reliability.”

While SMUD believes the CEC’s report will show SMUD met both its 15% planning reserve margin and the CPUC’s 16% planning reserve margin for 2023, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the report, or what the Legislature intends to do with the report. To the extent the CEC or Legislature imposes a higher POU planning reserve margin for future years that includes SMUD, the ultimate impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy/capacity, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers; however, such impacts could be material.

**Western Energy Imbalance Market and Extended Day Ahead Market**

Federal and state policymakers have long-promoted the development of organized markets in the west as a means (among other reasons) to better integrate intermittent renewable resources into the electric system, the first of which markets is the Western EIM, operated by the CAISO. The CAISO successfully launched the WEIM, a real time only imbalance market, on October 1, 2014, with PacifiCorp as the first participant. Since this time, the WEIM has grown significantly with the addition of 21 other Balancing

to sell to nongovernmental entities electricity from generation projects and transmission service from transmission line projects financed with tax exempt obligations; (i) effects of inflation on the operating and maintenance costs of an electric utility and its facilities; (j) changes from projected future load requirements; (k) increases in costs and uncertain availability of capital; (l) issues relating to supply chains and the uncertain availability or increased costs of necessary materials; (m) shifts in the availability and relative costs of different fuels (including the cost of natural gas); (n) sudden and dramatic increases in the price of energy purchased on the open market that may occur at times of high peak demand in an area of the country experiencing such high peak demand, such as has occurred in the State; (o) issues relating to risk management procedures and practices with respect to, among other things, the purchase and sale of natural gas, energy and transmission capacity; (p) other legislative changes, voter initiatives, referenda and statewide propositions; (q) effects of changes in the economy; (r) effects of possible manipulation of the electric markets; (s) natural disasters or other physical calamities, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, droughts, severe weather, wildfires and floods; (t) changes to the climate, including increasing volatility in rainfall in the Western United States and a reduction in the depth and duration of the Sierra snowpack; (u) issues relating to cyber-security; and (v) outbreaks of infectious diseases or the occurrence of pandemics. Any of these factors (as well as other factors) could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of any given electric utility, including SMUD’s electric utility, and likely will affect individual utilities in different ways.

SMUD is unable to predict what impact such factors will have on the business operations and financial condition of SMUD’s electric system, but the impact could be significant. SMUD has taken major steps to mitigate the impacts of many of the changes. This Official Statement includes a brief discussion of certain of these factors. This discussion does not purport to be comprehensive or definitive, and matters are subject to change subsequent to the date hereof. Extensive information on the electric utility industry is available from the legislative and regulatory sources and other sources in the public domain, and potential purchasers of any of SMUD’s Senior Bonds or Subordinated Bonds described in the forepart of this Official Statement should obtain and review such information.

# APPENDIX C
## BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM

The information in this Appendix regarding DTC has been provided by DTC, and SMUD takes no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness thereof. SMUD cannot and does not give any assurances that DTC, DTC Participants or Indirect Participants will distribute the Beneficial Owners either (a) payments of interest or principal with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds or (b) certificates representing ownership interest in or other confirmation of ownership interest in the 2024 Series N Bonds, or that they will so do on a timely basis or that DTC, DTC Participants or DTC Indirect Participants will act in the manner described in this Official Statement.

The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the 2024 Series N Bonds. The 2024 Series N Bonds will be issued as fully registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully registered Bond certificate will be issued for each maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC.

DTC, the world’s largest depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. DTC holds and operates servicing for over 3.5 instruments from over 100 countries that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others, such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+. The DTC rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.

Purchases of the 2024 Series N Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the 2024 Series N Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each 2024 Series N Bond (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the 2024 Series N Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their beneficial ownership interests in the 2024 Series N Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the 2024 Series N Bonds is discontinued.

1
<!-- Page 370 -->
To facilitate subsequent transfers, all 2024 Series N Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of the 2024 Series N Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series N Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such 2024 Series N Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series N Bonds may wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the bond documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series N Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the 2024 Series N Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners.

Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of a maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds is being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in the 2024 Series N Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed.

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant and in accordance with DTC’s Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to SMUD as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the 2024 Series N Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).

Principal, premium, redemption proceeds and interest payments on the 2024 Series N Bonds will be made to Cede & Co. or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts, upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from SMUD or the Trustee, on a

# APPENDIX D

## SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION

The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Resolution. Other provisions of the Resolution are described under the captions “THE 2024 SERIES N BONDS” and “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS.” This summary is not to be considered a full statement of the terms of the Resolution and accordingly is qualified by reference thereto and is subject to the full text thereof. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Official Statement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Resolution.

Between July 1997 and August 2003, SMUD received consents to amend the Resolution from the owners of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Bonds. Pursuant to the authority granted by such consents, SMUD amended the Resolution in October 2003 by adopting the Forty-Eighth Supplemental Resolution. The following summary of the Resolution reflects such amendments.

The purchasers of the 2024 Series N Bonds, by virtue of their purchase of the 2024 Series N Bonds, will consent to certain amendments to the Resolution (the “Proposed Amendments”). Such amendments are described in **bold italic font** in the forepart of this Official Statement under “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Rates and Charges” and “– Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues” and in this summary of the Resolution under the captions “Certain Definitions” and “Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds.” The written consents to the Proposed Amendments of the holders and registered owners of at least 60% of the Bonds outstanding have been filed with SMUD or the Trustee, as required by the Resolution. However, while certain Bonds remain outstanding SMUD must also obtain the written consents of the holders and registered owners of the Proposed Amendments. SMUD expects to implement the Proposed Amendments when the written consents of such bond insurers are obtained or when the Bonds insured by such bond insurers are no longer outstanding. The final maturity date of the insured Bonds is July 1, 2024.

### Certain Definitions

“Assumed Interest Payments” means for any fiscal year or period interest which would accrue during such fiscal year or period on an amount equal to the then unamortized balance of the remaining sum of Assumed Principal Payments at the Assumed Interest Rate.

“Assumed Interest Rate” for any Parity Bond means an interest rate equal to the “Bond Buyer Revenue Bond Index” most recently published in The Bond Buyer prior to the date of issuance of the Parity Bond to which the Assumed Interest Rate is applicable.

“Assumed Principal Payments” means for any fiscal year or period the sum of all amortized portions of each Excluded Principal Payment which fall within such fiscal year or period after the Excluded Principal Payments have been amortized (for purposes of this definition) equally over the years (pro rata in the case of a partial year) in the period commencing on the date of issuance of the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payment relates and ending on the date which is 30 years from such date of issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parity Bonds determined by SMUD to be an Excluded Principal Payment are refinanced with Parity Bonds determined by SMUD to be another Excluded Principal Payment, (1) Assumed Principal Payments with respect to the refinancing Parity Bonds shall not include any amount of principal which has previously been assumed amortized with respect to the refinanced Parity Bonds and (2) the period over which the refinancing Parity Bonds shall be assumed to be amortized shall be the period commencing on the date of issuance of the refinancing Parity Bonds and ending on the date which is 30 years from the date of issuance of the refinanced Parity Bonds.
<!-- Page 373 -->
**“Electric System”** means the entire electric system of SMUD, together with all additions, betterments, extensions and improvements.

**“Energy Payments”** means, when used with respect to the Electric System, all actual costs incurred, or charges made therefor, by SMUD in any particular fiscal year or period to which said term is applicable for purchased power (including power purchased from any special district included within the boundaries of SMUD), electric and thermal energy and capacity under contracts providing for payments by SMUD for electric or thermal energy or capacity whether or not such energy or capacity is delivered or capable of being delivered or otherwise made available to or received by or for the account of SMUD.

**“Excluded Principal Payments”** means each payment of principal on Parity Bonds which the Board of Directors of SMUD determines (on a date not later than the date of issuance of such Parity Bonds) that SMUD intends to refinance at or prior to the maturity date(s) of such Parity Bonds or otherwise to pay with moneys which are not Revenues. No such determination shall affect the security for such Parity Bonds or the obligation of SMUD to pay such payments from Revenues.

**“Financial Products Agreement”** means an interest rate swap, cap, collar, option, floor, forward or other hedging agreement, arrangement or security, however denominated, entered into by SMUD with a Qualified Provider not for investment purposes but with respect to specific Parity Bonds for the purpose of (1) reducing or otherwise managing SMUD’s risk of interest rate changes or (2) effectively converting SMUD’s interest rate exposure, in whole or in part, from a fixed rate exposure to a variable rate exposure, or from a variable rate exposure to a fixed rate exposure.

**“Financial Product Payments”** means amounts periodically required to be paid to a counterparty by SMUD pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement.

**“Financial Product Receipts”** means amounts periodically required to be paid to SMUD by a counterparty pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement.

**“Maintenance and Operation Costs”** means all actual maintenance and operation costs incurred by SMUD (including purchased power and fuel costs) or charges therefor made in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, exclusive in all cases of depreciation, or obsolescence charges or reserves therefor, amortization of intangibles or other entries of a similar nature, interest charges and charges for the payment of principal of SMUD debt.

**“Net Revenues”** for any fiscal period means the sum of (a) the Revenues for such fiscal period plus (b) the amounts, if any, withdrawn by SMUD from the Rate Stabilization Fund for treatment as Revenues for such fiscal period, less the sum of (c) all Maintenance and Operation Costs for such fiscal period, (d) all Energy Payments for such fiscal period not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs for such fiscal period, and (e) the amounts, if any, withdrawn by SMUD from Revenues for such fiscal period for deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund pursuant to the Resolution.

**“Parity Bonds”** includes the Bonds and all revenue bonds issued on a parity with the Bonds as provided or permitted in the Resolution. No Parity Bonds (other than the Bonds) are currently outstanding.

**“Qualified Provider”** means any financial institution or insurance company which is a party to a Financial Products Agreement if the unsecured long-term debt obligations of such financial institution or insurance company (or of the parent or a subsidiary of such financial institution or insurance company if such parent or subsidiary unconditionally guarantees the performance of such financial institution or insurance company under such Financial Products Agreement and the Trustee receives an opinion of

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**counsel to the effect that such guarantee is a valid and binding agreement of such parent or subsidiary), or obligations secured or supported by a letter of credit, contract, guarantee, agreement, insurance policy or surety bond issued by such financial institution or insurance company (or such guarantor parent or subsidiary), are rated in one of the two highest rating categories of a national rating agency (without regard to any gradation or such rating category) at the time of the execution and delivery of the Financial Products Agreement.**

**“Rate Stabilization Fund” means the fund by that name established in the Resolution. From time to time, after provision for debt service, SMUD may deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund from remaining Revenues such amounts as SMUD shall determine, provided that deposits may be made until (but not after) the date 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. SMUD may withdraw amounts from the Rate Stabilization Fund only for inclusion in Revenues for any fiscal year, such withdrawals to be made until (but not after) 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. All interest or other earnings on deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund shall be withdrawn therefrom and accounted for as Revenues. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no deposit of Revenues to the Rate Stabilization Fund may be made to the extent such Revenues were included in an engineer’s certificate submitted in connection with the issuance of additional revenue bonds payable from Revenues and withdrawal of the Revenues to be deposited in the Rate Stabilization Fund from the Revenues employed in rendering said engineer’s certificate would have caused noncompliance with the provisions of the Resolution restricting issuance of additional obligations or securities payable from Revenues or to the extent any withdrawal of amounts from remaining Revenues for the Rate Stabilization Fund for any fiscal year would have reduced the debt service ratio referred to in this Appendix under the caption “Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds” to or below 1.40.**

**“Revenues” means all revenues and income derived by SMUD from the operation of the Electric System, or arising from the Electric System (consisting primarily of income derived from the sale or use of electric energy generated, transmitted or distributed by the Electric System, but also including receipts from the sale of property pertaining to the Electric System or incidental to the operation of the Electric System or from services performed by SMUD in connection with the Electric System and revenues derived from certain wholesale, but not retail, sales of water), but exclusive in every case of any moneys derived from the levy or collection of taxes upon any taxable property in SMUD.**

**“Subsidy” means any subsidy, reimbursement or other payment from the federal government of the United States of America under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (or any similar legislation or regulation of the federal government of the United States of America or any other governmental entity or extension of any such legislation or regulation).**

**Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds**

**The Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund (the “Reserve Fund”) is created under the Resolution. The Reserve Fund secures all Bonds issued prior to January 1, 2004 that are currently outstanding (and not otherwise deemed to be paid and discharged under the Resolution) and may secure additional Bonds issued in the future. However, the Reserve Fund does not secure and will not be available to pay debt service on the 2024 Series N Bonds.**

**After the close of each fiscal year, SMUD shall determine the ratio (herein called the “debt service ratio”) of (1) the Net Revenues during such fiscal year to (2) the maximum annual debt service during the period of three fiscal years next following said fiscal year on all Bonds and Parity Bonds then outstanding. For this purpose, the term “maximum annual debt service” shall mean the sum of (i) the interest falling due on serial bonds and term bonds, (ii) the principal amount of serial bonds falling due by**
<!-- Page 375 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
their terms, and (iii) the amount of minimum sinking fund payments required, as computed for the year in which such sum shall be a maximum. Interest during construction which has been funded and provided for shall not be included in "minimum annual debt service" for the purpose of the above calculation.

So long as the debt service ratio shall exceed 1.40, the amount required to be maintained in the Reserve Fund shall be an amount such that the amount in the combined reserve funds of all Parity Bonds then outstanding will at no time be less than the current annual interest requirements on all then outstanding Parity Bonds, except only bonds (if any) for which payment has been provided in advance. If the debt service ratio in any fiscal year shall fall below 1.40, the Treasurer shall set aside in the Reserve Fund or in any other reserve fund or funds established for any one or more issues of the Parity Bonds (on or before the first day of each month of the next succeeding fiscal year) from the first available Net Revenues an amount not less than 15% of the sum of the current monthly interest requirements of all Parity Bonds then outstanding until the next year in which the debt service ratio shall exceed 1.40 or until the aggregate amount in the combined reserve funds established for all of the Parity Bonds (including the Reserve Fund) is equal to the maximum annual debt service on all of the Parity Bonds then outstanding, whichever shall first occur.

For purposes of the above calculation, the interest rates of Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period of periods of time, such interest rate or rates for such period or periods, and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period covered by such known period or periods, the interest rate shall be the greater of the numerical maximum rate that such Bonds may vary or be adjusted to and the numerical maximum rate (if any) that the interest rate for such Bonds may be fixed to, in both cases as set forth in the supplemental resolution authorizing such Bonds, or if such rate or rates have been increased in accordance with such supplemental resolution at such increased rate or rates.

Any amount in the Reserve Fund at any time in excess of the balance required to be then maintained therein shall be released to SMUD for any SMUD use.

SMUD shall not be required, notwithstanding anything herein contained, to maintain in the combined reserve funds appertaining to all Parity Bonds of SMUD, an aggregate amount in excess of the maximum annual debt service requirements in any subsequent fiscal year on all of the then outstanding Parity Bonds.

Any moneys at any time in any of said reserve funds shall be held by the Treasurer in trust for the benefit of the holder or holders from time to time of the Bonds and the coupons appertaining thereto entitled to be paid therewith, and SMUD shall not have any beneficial right or interest in any such moneys.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Supplemental Resolution adopted after the Forty-Eighth Supplemental Resolution may provide that a Series of Bonds issued pursuant to such Supplemental Resolution shall not be secured by the Reserve Fund. In such event, (i) payments of the principal of and interest on such Bonds shall be excluded from all calculations made in respect of the amount to be maintained in the Reserve Fund and (ii) amounts on deposit in the Reserve Fund shall not be applied to the payment of the principal of or interest on such Bonds, even if no other moneys are available therefor.

any expiration or termination thereof; provided, however, that no such drawing need be made if other moneys or a letter of credit are available in the Reserve Fund in the amount of the Reserve Fund Requirement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the prior two paragraphs, if at any time that there is on deposit in the Reserve Fund a combination of cash, a letter of credit and/or a surety bond as contemplated above, SMUD shall draw first on such cash to the extent required and available, then on (1) such surety bond and letter of credit on a pro rata basis (if both a surety bond and letter of credit are available) to the extent required and available, or (2) such surety bond or letter of credit (if either a surety bond or letter of credit, but not both, is available) to the extent required and available.

For purposes of calculating the “debt service ratio” and, unless otherwise specified in a Supplemental Resolution providing for the issuance of a series of Parity Bonds, the amount required to be maintained in the Reserve Fund as described above: (1) any calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy that SMUD receives or expects to receive during such period of time relating to or in connection with such Parity Bonds; and (2) to the extent the calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds is reduced by the Subsidy as provided in clause (1) of this paragraph, any calculation of Net Revenues for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy received or expected to be received by SMUD with respect to or in connection with such Parity Bonds during such period of time.

### Additional Covenants

The Resolution contains the following additional covenants, among others:

1. That the Electric System will be maintained in good repair, working order and condition at all times, and will be continuously operated in an efficient and economical manner.

2. That no electric energy shall be supplied free by SMUD, and a reasonable wholesale charge will be made for water distributed at any cost to SMUD and such charge will be deemed Revenues; but SMUD may supply without charge water furnished to it without distribution cost, and any moneys received from any retail sales of water will not be deemed Revenues.

3. That all taxes and governmental charges and other lawful claims which might become a lien on the Electric System or the Revenues or impair the security of the Bonds will be paid and discharged when due.

4. That SMUD will comply with all lawful orders of any governmental agency or authority having jurisdiction in the premises (except while the validity or application thereof is being contested in good faith) and with all necessary permits and licenses issued by the NRC.

5. That no lease or agreement will be entered into, or sale or other disposition of essential property made, that would impair the operation of the Electric System or the rights of Bondholders with respect to the Revenues; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Master Resolution, SMUD may sell or otherwise dispose of its accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD provided that SMUD delivers to the Trustee:

   (a) a Certificate of SMUD to the effect that the amount derived by SMUD from the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances is a result of the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances upon fair and reasonable terms no
<!-- Page 378 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

less favorable to SMUD than the terms of a comparable arm’s-length transaction treated as a sale and not a loan under generally accepted accounting principles; and  
(b) a written statement or report of an independent certified public accountant to the effect that, based on the audited financial statements of SMUD for the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available and after giving effect to such transaction by reducing Revenues for such fiscal year by the difference between the face amount of such accounts receivable or loan balances and the amount derived by SMUD from the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances, the debt service ratio computed pursuant to the Master Resolution would not have been reduced to less than 1.40:1.0.

6. That proper records and accounts will be maintained of all transactions relating to the Electric System and the Revenues (open to inspection by the Trustee and the holders of not less than 10 percent in principal amount of the Bonds), to be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant within 90 days after close of the fiscal year, and copies of such financial statements supplied to Bondholders on request.

7. That insurance adequate in amounts and as to risks covered will be maintained against such risks as are usually insurable in connection with similar electric systems, and in addition public liability and property damage insurance in amounts not less than $1,000,000 per accident and adequate fidelity bonds on all officers and employees of SMUD handling or responsible for SMUD funds, subject in each case to the condition that such insurance is obtainable at reasonable rates and upon reasonable terms and conditions. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – INSURANCE” attached to this Official Statement for a description of SMUD’s insurance.

8. That the net proceeds realized by SMUD in the event all or any part of the Electric System is taken by eminent domain proceedings will be applied to the redemption or retirement of all Bonds and Parity Bonds if sufficient therefor, and, if not, then pro rata to the redemption or retirement of Bonds and Parity Bonds or to new facilities if the additional Revenues to be derived therefrom will sufficiently offset the loss of Revenues resulting from such eminent domain so that the ability of SMUD to meet its obligations will not be substantially impaired.

9. That SMUD will at all times use its best efforts to maintain the powers, functions and duties now reposed in it pursuant to law.

10. That SMUD will establish and at all times maintain and collect rates and charges for the sale or use of its electric energy sufficient to permit SMUD to purchase power or issue and sell Bonds or Parity Bonds to finance additions, betterments, extensions and improvements to the Electric System as may be reasonably necessary to satisfy its then projected electric demand upon its Electric System, and that unless the Board determines that SMUD will be able to satisfy such demand through the purchase of electric energy, SMUD will proceed with all reasonable diligence to issue and sell such Bonds or Parity Bonds.

11. That SMUD will not create, or permit the creation of, any mortgage or lien upon the Electric System or any property essential to the proper operation of the Electric System or to the maintenance of the Revenues. SMUD will not create, or permit the creation of, any pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance upon the Revenues except only as provided in the Master Resolution; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Master Resolution, SMUD may create a pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance upon its accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD (which pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance shall be prior to any pledge, lien, charge or
<!-- Page 379 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

encumbrance created or made pursuant to the Master Resolution, including without limitation the pledge of Revenues made pursuant to the Master Resolution) to secure indebtedness with a term of one year or less provided that the principal amount of such indebtedness does not exceed 50% of the aggregate face amount of the accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD as shown on SMUD’s most recent audited financial statements.

## Amendment of the Resolution

The Resolution and the rights and obligations of SMUD and of the holders of the Bonds may be modified or amended at any time pursuant to the affirmative vote at a meeting of Bondholders, or with the written consent without a meeting, of the holders of 60 percent in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding, provided that no such modification or amendment shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Bond, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the holder of each Bond so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Bonds required for consent to an amendment or modification, without the consent of the holders of all the Bonds then outstanding. Modifications or amendments may be made, without the consent of any Bondholders, to add covenants of SMUD or to surrender rights reserved by SMUD in the Resolution, to cure ambiguities or defective or inconsistent provisions or in regard to questions arising under the Resolution without adversely affecting the interests of the Bondholders, or to provide for the issuance of a series of Bonds, subject to the provisions contained in the Resolution with respect thereto.

## Events of Default and Remedies of Bondholders

The Resolution declares each of the following to be an event of default:

(a) Failure to pay the principal of and premium on any Bond when due and payable;

(b) Failure to pay any installment of interest on any Bond when due and payable, if such default continues for a period of 30 days;

(c) Default by SMUD in the observance of any of the covenants, agreements or conditions on its part in the Resolution or in the Bonds, if such default continues for a period of 60 days after written notice thereof (specifying such default and requiring the same to be remedied) has been given to SMUD by the Trustee, or to SMUD and the Trustee by the holders of not less than 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the time outstanding; and

(d) If, under the provisions of any law for the relief or aid of debtors, any court of competent jurisdiction shall assume custody or control of SMUD or of the whole or any substantial part of its property, and such custody or control shall not be terminated or stayed within 60 days;

In the event of default, the Trustee or the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Bonds may, upon written notice to SMUD, declare the principal of all outstanding Bonds, and the interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately. The Trustee is appointed as trustee to represent Bondholders and may take such action as may seem appropriate to it, and, upon the written request of the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Bonds, and upon being furnished with indemnity satisfactory to it, will take such action on behalf of Bondholders as is specified in such written request. Each Bondholder is entitled to proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in such holder by the Resolution by such appropriate judicial proceedings as such holder deems most effectual.
<!-- Page 380 -->
![Page 9](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+9)

The rights of Bondholders are limited and restricted to the use and application of Revenues as provided in the Resolution and do not extend to the levy of any attachment or execution upon or forfeiture of any of the properties of SMUD or to any moneys derived by SMUD from the levy or collection of taxes.

In addition to the limitations on remedies contained in the Resolution, the rights and remedies provided by the Bonds and the Resolution, as well as the enforcement by SMUD of contracts with customers of the Electric System, may be limited by and are subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights.

### Refunding of 2024 Series N Bonds
If Refunding Bonds are issued for the purpose of refunding 2024 Series N Bonds, then SMUD is authorized to apply proceeds of the sale of such Refunding Bonds to the payment of the purchase price of direct noncallable obligations of the United States of America (“Treasury Obligations”) to be held by the Trustee to insure the payment or retirement at or before maturity of all or a portion of the outstanding 2024 Series N Bonds. Upon deposit with the Trustee, in trust, of money or Treasury Obligations (including, but not limited to, direct obligations of the United States of America issued in book-entry form on the books of the Department of the Treasury of the United States of America), or any combination thereof, sufficient, together with the interest to accrue on any such Treasury Obligations, to pay or redeem all or a portion of 2024 Series N Bonds then outstanding at or before their maturity date, all liability of SMUD in respect of such 2024 Series N Bonds shall cease, determine and be completely discharged, and the holders thereof shall thereafter be entitled only to payment by SMUD of the money and Treasury Obligations deposited with the Trustee for their payment. If the liability of SMUD shall cease and determine with respect to all or a portion of the 2024 Series N Bonds, then said 2024 Series N Bonds shall not be considered to be outstanding Bonds for any purpose of the Resolution.

### Discharge of Resolution
The Resolution may be discharged by depositing with the Trustee in trust, moneys or Federal Securities or general obligation bonds of the State of California, in such amount as the Trustee shall determine will, together with the interest to accrue thereon, be fully sufficient to pay and discharge the indebtedness on all Bonds at or before their respective maturity dates.

### Investment of Funds
Moneys in any fund established by the Resolution may be invested in bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, bills, bankers acceptances or other securities in which funds of SMUD may be legally invested as provided by the law in effect at the time of such investment. Currently this investment authority includes, among other things, the Local Agency Investment Fund which is administered by the Treasurer of the State of California for the investment of funds belonging to local agencies in the State of California.

## PROPOSED FORM OF LEGAL OPINION FOR 2024 SERIES N BONDS

[Closing Date]  
Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
Sacramento, California  

Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
Electric Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2024 Series N  
(Final Opinion)  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as bond counsel to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) in connection with the issuance of $ __________ aggregate principal amount of Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2024 Series N (the “2024 Series N Bonds”), issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 of the Board of Directors of SMUD, adopted January 7, 1971 (the “Master Resolution”), as supplemented and amended by later resolutions of said Board of Directors (as so supplemented and amended, the “Resolution”), including Resolution No. 24-03-[__], adopted March 21, 2024 (the “Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Resolution.

In such connection, we have reviewed the Resolution; the Tax Certificate, dated the date hereof (the “Tax Certificate”), executed by SMUD; opinions of counsel to SMUD and the Trustee; certificates of SMUD, the Trustee and others; and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after original delivery of the 2024 Series N Bonds on the date hereof. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to our attention after original delivery of the 2024 Series N Bonds on the date hereof. Accordingly, this letter speaks only as of its date and is not intended to, and may not be, relied upon or otherwise used in connection with any such actions, events or matters. Our engagement with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds has concluded with their issuance, and we disclaim any obligation to update this letter. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures provided to us and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than SMUD. We have assumed, without undertaking to verify, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents, and of the legal conclusions contained in the opinions, referred to in the second paragraph hereof. Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in the Resolution and the Tax Certificate, including (without limitation) covenants and agreements compliance which is necessary to assure that future actions, omissions or events will not cause interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes.

or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against governmental entities such as SMUD in the State of California. We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any opinion with respect to the state or quality of title to or interest in any of the property described in or as subject to the lien of the Resolution or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description contained therein, or the remedies available to enforce liens on any such property. Our services did not include financial or other non-legal advice. Finally, we undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Official Statement, dated ______, 2024, or other offering material relating to the 2024 Series N Bonds and express no opinion or view with respect thereto.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the following opinions:

1. The 2024 Series N Bonds constitute the valid and binding obligations of SMUD.

2. The Resolution, including the Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution, has been duly adopted by, and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of, SMUD. The Resolution creates a valid pledge, to secure the payment of the principal of and interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds, of the Net Revenues, subject to the provisions of the Resolution permitting the application thereof for the purposes and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Resolution.

3. Interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. We observe that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series N Bonds.

Faithfully yours,

(c) The amendment or waiver either (1) is approved by the Holders of 60% of the 2024 Series N Bonds, or (2) does not, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel, materially impair the interests of the Holders or Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series N Bonds.

In addition, if the amendment relates to the accounting principles to be followed in preparing financial statements, (1) notice of such change shall be given in the same manner as for a Listed Event under Section 5, and (2) the Annual Report for the year in which the change is made should present a comparison (in narrative form and also, if feasible, in quantitative form) between the financial statements as prepared on the basis of the new accounting principles and those prepared on the basis of the former accounting principles.

In the event that two or more Interest Rate Periods are so established, the Series 2024 Bonds shall, by Supplemental Indenture, be divided into separate Series or sub-Series corresponding to such Interest Rate Periods.

(b) In the manner hereinafter provided, the term of each Series of Bonds will be divided into consecutive Interest Rate Periods during each of which such Bonds shall bear interest at the Daily Interest Rate, the Weekly Interest Rate, CP Interest Term Rates, a Fixed Rate or an Index Rate; provided, however, that the Interest Rate Period shall be the same for all Bonds of a Series, and no Bond shall bear interest in excess of the Maximum Rate. The Interest Rate Period for any Series of Bonds (other than the Initial Interest Rate Period for the Series 2024 Bonds) shall be established pursuant to the related Supplemental Indenture.

**Section 2.5 Daily Interest Rate Period.** (a) Determination of Daily Interest Rates. During each Daily Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds, the Bonds of such Series shall bear interest at the Daily Interest Rate, which shall be determined by the Remarketing Agent on or before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on each Business Day for such Business Day. The Minimum Daily Interest Rate will be determined by the Remarketing Agent by 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on each Business Day for such Business Day; the Remarketing Agent will then modify the interest rate as necessary and determine the final Daily Interest Rate not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date; the Remarketing Agent will advise the Trustee by Electronic Means of any change in the final Daily Interest Rate by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the day such rate is determined. The Daily Interest Rate shall be the rate of interest per

**Interest Rate Determination**  
Interest at the Weekly Interest Rate, which shall be determined by the Remarketing Agent by no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Wednesday of each week during such Weekly Interest Rate Period, or if such day shall not be a Business Day, then on the next succeeding Business Day. The Weekly Interest Rate for each Weekly Interest Rate Period shall be determined on or prior to the first day of such Weekly Interest Rate Period and shall apply to the period commencing on the first day of such Weekly Interest Rate Period and ending on the next succeeding Wednesday (whether or not a Business Day). Thereafter, each Weekly Interest Rate shall apply to the period commencing on Thursday (whether or not a Business Day) and ending on the next succeeding Wednesday (whether or not a Business Day), unless such Weekly Interest Rate Period shall end on a day other than Wednesday, in which event the last Weekly Interest Rate for such Weekly Interest Rate Period shall apply to the period commencing on Thursday (whether or not a Business Day) preceding the last day of such Weekly Interest Rate Period and ending on the last day of such Weekly Interest Rate Period. The Weekly Interest Rate shall be the rate of interest per annum determined by the Remarketing Agent to be the minimum interest rate which, if borne by the Bonds of the applicable Series, would enable the Remarketing Agent to sell the Bonds of such Series on the effective date of such rate at a price (without regarding accrued interest) equal to not less than 100% of the principal amount thereof. In the event that the Remarketing Agent fails to establish a Weekly Interest Rate for any week, then the Weekly Interest Rate for such week shall be the same as the Weekly Interest Rate for the immediately preceding week if the Weekly Interest Rate for such preceding week was determined by the Remarketing Agent. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.10(d), in the event that the Weekly Interest Rate for the immediately preceding week was not determined by the Remarketing Agent, or in the event that the Weekly Interest Rate determined by the Remarketing Agent shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of law, then the interest rate for such week shall be equal to the SIFMA Index on the day such Weekly Interest Rate would otherwise be determined as provided herein for such Weekly Interest Rate Period.

**Conversion to Weekly Interest Rate Period**  
(b) Conversion to Weekly Interest Rate Period. Subject to Section 2.10, at any time, the Issuer, in a Written Direction of the Issuer delivered to the Trustee and the Remarketing Agent (if any), may elect that a Series of Bonds shall bear interest at a Weekly Interest Rate. Such direction of the Issuer shall specify (i) the proposed effective date of such Conversion to a Weekly Interest Rate Period, which shall be (A) a Business Day not earlier than the 30th day following the second Business Day after receipt by the Trustee of such Written Direction of the Issuer, (B) in the case of a Conversion from a Daily Interest Rate Period, a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period, an Index Rate Period or a Fixed Rate Period, the day immediately following the last day of such Interest Rate Period, or (C) in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds, a day on which such Bonds are subject to optional redemption pursuant to Section 4.3(b) or an applicable Supplemental Indenture; and (ii) the date of delivery for such Bonds to be purchased on the effective date of such Conversion to a Weekly Interest Rate Period. In addition, such direction shall be accompanied by a form of notice required by Section 2.6(c) and a letter of Bond Counsel that it expects to be able to give a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel on the effective date of the Conversion to the Weekly Interest Rate Period. During each Weekly Interest Rate Period commencing on a date so specified and ending on the day immediately preceding the effective date of the next succeeding Interest Rate Period, the interest rate borne by the applicable Series of Bonds shall be a Weekly Interest Rate.

4011B-2  
<!-- Page 438 -->
(c) Notice of Conversion to Weekly Interest Rate. The Trustee shall give notice by first-class mail of a Conversion to a Weekly Interest Rate Period to the Owners of the Bonds of the applicable Series not less than 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of such Weekly Interest Rate Period. Such notice shall state: (i) that the Interest Rate Period on such Bonds will be converted to a Weekly Interest Rate unless Bond Counsel fails to deliver a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel as to such Conversion on the applicable Conversion Date; (ii) the proposed Conversion Date to the Weekly Interest Rate Period; and (iii) that the Bonds of the applicable Series are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the proposed Conversion Date and setting forth the applicable Purchase Price and the place of delivery for purchase of such Bonds.

Section 2.7 Fixed Rate Period. (a) Determination of Fixed Rate. During and in connection with a Fixed Rate Period for a Series of Bonds, (i) the Issuer may by Written Notice to the Trustee establish one or more Maturity Dates for the Bonds of such Series, and (ii) each maturity of such Bonds shall bear interest at a Fixed Rate. The Fixed Rate shall be determined by the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as the case may be, on a Business Day no later than the Issue Date or the Fixed Rate Conversion Date for such Series of Bonds, as applicable. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.7(d), each Fixed Rate shall be the rate of interest per annum determined by the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as the case may be, to be the minimum interest rate which, if borne by the Bonds of the applicable Series and maturity, would enable the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as the case may be, to sell the Bonds of such Series and a maturity on such date at a price (without regard to accrued interest) equal to the principal amount thereof. If, for any reason, with respect to any Series of Bonds being converted to a Fixed Rate Period, the Fixed Rate for such Fixed Rate Period is not determined by the Remarketing Agent on or prior to the first day of such Fixed Rate Period, then the Interest Rate Period for the Bonds of the applicable Series shall be a Weekly Interest Rate Period and such Weekly Interest Rate Period shall continue until such time as the Interest Rate Period for such Series of Bonds shall have been converted to a Daily Interest Rate Period, a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period, a Fixed Rate Period or an Index Rate Period as provided herein.

(b) Conversion to or Continuation of Fixed Rate Period.

(i) Subject to Section 2.10, at any time, the Issuer, in a Written Direction of the Issuer delivered to the Trustee and the Remarketing Agent (if any), may elect that the Bonds of a Series shall bear interest at a Fixed Rate. Such direction of the Issuer (A) shall specify the proposed effective date of the Fixed Rate Period, which date shall be (1) a Business Day not earlier than the 30th following receipt by the Trustee of such Written Direction of the Issuer, (2) the day immediately following the last day of the Interest Rate Period then in effect, or (3) in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds, a day on which such Bonds are subject to optional redemption pursuant to Section 4.3(b) or an applicable Supplemental Indenture; (B) shall specify the last day of such Fixed Rate Period, which day shall be either the day immediately prior to the Final Maturity Date for the applicable Series of Bonds, or a day which both immediately precedes a Business Day and is at least 181 days after the effective date of Fixed Rate Period; and (C) with respect to any such Fixed Rate Period, may specify redemption prices and periods different than those set forth in this Indenture or the applicable Supplemental Indenture providing for the issuance of

such Series of Bonds, subject to the Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel as provided in Section 2.7(b)(iii).

(ii) The day following the last day of any Fixed Rate Period for a Series of Bonds shall be a Fixed Rate Tender Date for such Bonds.

(iii) The election of the Issuer described in Section 2.7(b)(i) shall be accompanied by a letter or letters of Bond Counsel and/or Special Tax Counsel that it expects to be able to give a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel on the Fixed Rate Conversion Date and by a form of the notice to be mailed by the Trustee to the Owners of the Bonds of the applicable Series as provided in Section 2.7(c).

(iv) If, by the 29th day prior to the last day of any Fixed Rate Period that ends on a day other than the day immediately preceding the Final Maturity Date for the applicable Series of Bonds, the Trustee shall not have received Written Notice of the Issuer’s election that, during the next succeeding Interest Rate Period, the Bonds of such Series shall bear interest at a Daily Interest Rate, a Weekly Interest Rate, a Fixed Rate, an Index Rate or CP Interest Term Rates, then the Bonds of the applicable Series shall be purchased on the applicable Mandatory Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.13 and the Bonds shall not be remarketed.

(v) After the Final Fixed Rate Conversion Date for a Series of Bonds, the Bonds of the applicable Series shall no longer be subject to or have the benefit of the provisions of Section 4.11 through Section 4.22.

(c) Notice of Conversion to or Continuation of Fixed Rate. The Trustee shall give notice of a Conversion to a (or the establishment of another) Fixed Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to the Owners of the Bonds of such Series not less than 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of such Fixed Rate Period. Such notice shall state: (i) that the Interest Rate Period for such Bonds shall be converted to, or continue to be, a Fixed Rate Period unless Bond Counsel fails to deliver a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel as to such Conversion on the Fixed Rate Conversion Date; (ii) the proposed Fixed Rate Conversion Date; and (iii) that such Bonds are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the Fixed Rate Conversion Date and setting forth the applicable Purchase Price and the place of delivery for purchase of such Bonds.

(d) Sale at Premium or Discount. As set forth in Section 2.4(a), the Series 2024 Bonds of each maturity have been sold with an initial issue premium. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.7(a), the Fixed Rate for each maturity of any other Series of Bonds as initially issued, or Fixed Rate for each maturity of any other Series of Bonds upon Conversion to a Fixed Rate Period, shall be the rate of interest per annum determined by the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, to be the interest rate which, if borne by the Bonds of the applicable Series, would enable the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, to sell such Bonds at a price (without regard to accrued interest) which will result in the lowest net interest cost for such Bonds, after taking into account any premium or discount at which such Bonds are sold by the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, provided that:

- 37 -
4147-6340-3086.5

<!-- Page 440 -->
(i) The Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, certifies in writing to the Trustee and the Issuer that the sale of such Bonds at the interest rate and premium or discount specified by the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, is expected to result in the lowest net interest cost for such Bonds;

(ii) The Issuer consents in writing to the sale of such Bonds at such premium or discount;

(iii) In the case of a Conversion of the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to a Fixed Rate Period, or establishment of another Fixed Rate Period for such Bonds, and the sale of such Bonds at a premium, the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, shall transfer the amount of such premium to the Trustee for deposit into such Funds and Accounts as shall be specified in a Written Direction of the Issuer;

(iv) In the case of a Conversion of the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to a Fixed Rate Period, or establishment of another Fixed Rate Period for such Bonds, on or before the date of determination of the Fixed Rate, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Remarketing Agent a letter or letters of Bond Counsel and/or Special Tax Counsel to the effect that it expects to be able to give a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel on the Fixed Rate Conversion Date; and

(v) In the case of a Conversion of the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to a Fixed Rate Period, or establishment of another Fixed Rate Period for such Bonds, on or before the Conversion Date, a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel shall have been received by the Trustee and confirmed to the Issuer and the Remarketing Agent.

**Section 2.8 Commercial Paper Interest Rate Periods. (a) Determination of CP Interest Terms and CP Interest Rates.** During each Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds, each Bond of such Series shall bear interest during each CP Interest Term for such Bond and the CP Interest Term Rate for such Bond. The CP Interest Term and the CP Interest Term Rate for each Bond need not be the same for any two Bonds of such Series, even if determined on the same date. Each of such CP Interest Terms and CP Interest Term Rates for each Bond shall be determined by the Remarketing Agent no later than the first day of each CP Interest Term. Each CP Interest Term shall be for a period of days within the range or ranges announced as possible CP Interest Terms no later than 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the first day of each CP Interest Term by the Remarketing Agent. Each CP Interest Term for each Bond of the applicable Series shall be a period of not more than 180 days, determined by the Remarketing Agent to be the period which, together with all other CP Interest Terms for all Bonds of the applicable Series then Outstanding, will result in the lowest overall interest expense on such Bonds over the next succeeding one hundred eighty (180) days. Each CP Interest Term shall end on either a day which immediately precedes a Business Day or on the day immediately preceding the Final Maturity Date for the applicable Series of Bonds. If, for any reason, a CP Interest Term for any Bond cannot be so determined by the Remarketing Agent, or if the determination of such CP Interest Term is held by a court of law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such CP Interest Term shall be thirty (30) days, but if the last day so determined shall not be a day immediately preceding a Business Day, such CP Interest Term shall end on the first day immediately preceding the
<!-- Page 441 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Page)

Business Day next succeeding such last day, or if such last day would be after the day immediately preceding the Final Maturity Date for the applicable Series of Bonds, shall end on the day immediately preceding such Final Maturity Date. In determining the number of days in each CP Interest Term, the Remarketing Agent shall take into account the following factors: (i) existing short-term, tax-exempt market rates and indices of such short-term rates; (ii) the existing market supply and demand for short-term tax-exempt securities; (iii) existing yield curves for short-term and long-term tax-exempt securities for obligations of credit quality comparable to the Bonds of the applicable Series; (iv) general economic conditions; (v) industry economic and financial conditions that may affect or be relevant to the Bonds of the applicable Series; (vi) the CP Interest Terms of other Bonds of the applicable Series; and (vii) such other facts, circumstances and conditions pertaining to financial markets as the Remarketing Agent, in its sole discretion, shall determine to be relevant.

The CP Interest Term Rate for each CP Interest Term for each Bond in a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period shall be the rate of interest per annum determined by the Remarketing Agent to be the minimum interest rate which, if borne by such Bond, would enable the Remarketing Agent to sell such Bond on the effective date of such rate at a price equal to the principal amount thereof. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.10(d), if, for any reason, a CP Interest Term Rate for any Bond in a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period is not so established by the Remarketing Agent for any CP Interest Term, or if such CP Interest Term Rate is determined by a court of law to be invalid or unenforceable, then the CP Interest Term Rate for such CP Interest Term shall be a rate per annum equal to the SIFMA Index on the first day of such CP Interest Term.

(b) Conversion to Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period. Subject to Section 2.10, at any time, the Issuer, in a Written Direction of the Issuer to the Trustee and the Remarketing Agent (if any), may elect that a Series of Bonds shall bear interest at CP Interest Term Rates. Such Written Direction of the Issuer shall specify (i) the proposed effective date of the Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period, which shall be (A) a Business Day not earlier than the thirtieth (30th) day following the second Business Day after receipt by the Trustee of such direction, (B) the day immediately following the last day of the Interest Rate Period then in effect, or (C) in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds, a day on which such Bonds are subject to optional redemption pursuant to Section 4.3(b) or an applicable Supplemental Indenture; and (ii) the date of delivery of such Bonds to be purchased. In addition, the Written Direction of the Issuer shall be accompanied by (i) a letter of Bond Counsel that it expects to be able to give a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel on the Conversion Date, and (ii) a form of the notice to be mailed by the Trustee to the Owners of the Bonds of the applicable Series as provided in Section 2.8(c). During each Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period commencing on the date so specified and ending on the day immediately preceding the effective date of the next succeeding Interest Rate Period, each Bond of such Series shall bear interest at a CP Interest Term Rate applicable to the CP Interest Term then in effect for such Bond.

(c) Notice of Conversion to CP Interest Term Rates. The Trustee shall give notice by first-class mail of a Conversion to a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period to the Owners of the Bonds of the applicable Series not less than 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of such Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period. Such notice shall state: (i) that such Bonds shall bear interest at CP Interest Term Rates unless Bond Counsel fails to deliver a Favorable Opinion of

Bond Counsel as to such Conversion on the Conversion Date or other conditions precedent to such adjustment are not met; (ii) the proposed Conversion Date; and (iii) that such Bonds are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on such proposed Conversion Date, regardless of whether any or all conditions precedent to such Conversion are met, and setting forth the applicable Purchase Price and the place of delivery for purchase of such Bonds.

(d) **Conversion from Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period.** Subject to Section 2.10(b), at any time during a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds, the Issuer may elect, pursuant to Section 2.5(b), Section 2.6(b), Section 2.7(b) or Section 2.9(c), that such Bonds no longer shall bear interest at CP Interest Term Rates and shall instead bear interest at a Daily Interest Rate, a Weekly Interest Rate, a Fixed Rate or an Index Rate, as specified in such election. In connection with any such election, and notwithstanding any provision contained in this Section 2.8 to the contrary, each CP Interest Term established by the Remarketing Agent for the Bonds shall end on the same date in order to facilitate the Conversion of such Bonds. The date on which all CP Interest Terms determined for the Bonds end shall be the last day of the then-current Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period and the day next succeeding such date shall be the effective date of the Daily Interest Rate Period, Weekly Interest Rate Period, Fixed Rate Period or Index Rate Period elected by the Issuer for such Bonds.

**Section 2.9 Index Rate Periods.** (a) **Determination of Applicable Spread.** In connection with the issuance of a Series of Bonds bearing interest at an Index Rate, or the Conversion of the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to an Index Rate Period, the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, shall determine the Applicable Spread and, if applicable, the Applicable Factor, and shall specify the same in the Index Rate Determination Certificate for the applicable Index Rate Period. The Applicable Spread and any Applicable Factor for an Index Rate Period shall be such amount or percentage as shall result in the minimum interest rate which, if borne by the Bonds of the applicable Series as of the first day of the applicable Index Rate Period, under Prevailing Market Conditions, would enable the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, to sell the Bonds at a price equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate principal amount of such Bonds on the first day of the applicable Index Rate Period.

(b) **Determination of Index Rate.**

(i) During any Index Rate Period for a Series of Bonds, such Bonds shall bear interest at an Index Rate, as specified in the applicable Index Rate Determination Certificate delivered to the Trustee on or before the first day of such Interest Rate Period.

(ii) With respect to each SIFMA Index Rate Period, the Calculation Agent shall (A) determine the SIFMA Index by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on each Wednesday or, if such Wednesday is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately succeeding such Wednesday, and (B) determine the SIFMA Index Rate at or before 12:00 noon, New York City time, on each Index Rate Reset Date. The Calculation Agent shall furnish each SIFMA Index Rate so determined to the Issuer and the Trustee by Electronic Means not later than each Index Rate Reset Date.

(iii) With respect to each SOFR Index Rate Period, the Calculation Agent shall (A) determine and provide to the Trustee by Electronic Means the SOFR Index by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on each SOFR Publish Date, and (B) determine and provide to the Trustee by Electronic Means the SOFR Index Rate at or before 12:00 noon, New York City time, on each SOFR Effective Date.

(iv) During any Index Rate Period, interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year and actual days elapsed. The Calculation Agent shall calculate and provide by Electronic Means to the Issuer and the Trustee the amount of interest due and payable on each Series of Bonds bearing interest at an Index Rate (A) with respect to a Series of Bonds bearing interest at the SIFMA Index Rate, on or prior to each Interest Payment Date, and (B) with respect to a Series of Bonds bearing interest at the SOFR Index Rate, on each Interest Payment Date, which in the case of a Series of Bonds bearing interest at the SOFR Index Rate shall be the SOFR Interest Calculation Date. The amount of interest due on a Series of Bonds bearing interest at the SIFMA Index Rate on any Interest Payment Date shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the calendar month immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. The amount of interest due on a Series of Bonds bearing interest at the SOFR Index Rate on any Interest Payment Date shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the SOFR Accrual Period immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. All percentages resulting from any step in the calculation of interest on a Series of Bonds while in an Index Rate Period will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest ten thousandth of a percentage point (i.e., to five decimal places) with five hundred thousandths of a percentage point rounded upward, and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation of interest on such Bonds while in an Index Rate Period will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).

(v) Upon the written request of any Bondholder, the Trustee shall (A) confirm the applicable Index Rate then in effect, and (B) provide the calculation of, and supporting data for, the amount of interest due on a Series of Bonds bearing interest at an Index Rate on each Interest Payment Date.

(vi) In determining the Index Rate that any Bond shall bear as provided in this Section 2.9, neither the Underwriter nor the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, the Calculation Agent, nor the Trustee shall have any liability to the Issuer or the Holder of such Bond, except for its negligence or willful misconduct.

(vii) If, during any Index Rate Period, the Index or rate used to determine an Index Rate is not reported by the relevant source at the time necessary for determination of such Index Rate or otherwise ceases to be available, the Issuer or its independent financial advisor shall determine a substitute or replacement Index Rate (as applicable), including any Alternative Rate and any Adjustments, and promptly provide the same via Electronic Means to the Trustee and the Calculation Agent, together with the effective date of the substitute or replacement Index Rate.

which substitute or replacement must be consistent with any corresponding substitute or replacement index designated pursuant to the relevant Interest Rate Swap.

(c) Index Rate Continuation.

(i) On any Mandatory Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.13 or in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds, a day on which such Bonds are subject to optional redemption pursuant to Section 4.3(b) or an applicable Supplemental Indenture, and unless the Issuer has given written notice with respect to the Conversion of the Bonds to an Interest Rate Period other than the Index Rate Period, the Issuer may establish a new Index Rate Period and a new Index Rate for the Bonds with such right to be exercised by delivery of an Index Rate Continuation Notice to the Trustee no less than 30 days prior to the effective date of the new Index Rate Period. The Index Rate Continuation Notice shall be accompanied by a letter or letters of Bond Counsel and/or Special Tax Counsel to the effect that it expects to be able to deliver a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel on the effective date of the new Index Rate Period.

(ii) Any establishment of a new Index Rate and Index Rate Period for a Series of Bonds pursuant to paragraph (i) above must comply with the following conditions:

(A) the first day of such new Index Rate Period must be a Mandatory Purchase Date for such Bonds pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.13, and such Bonds shall be required to be tendered for purchase on such date;

(B) the first day of such new Index Rate Period must be a Business Day; and

(C) no new Index Rate shall become effective unless (x) the Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel referred to in paragraph (i) above is delivered on the first day of the new Index Rate Period and (y) no Failed Remarketing has occurred.

(iii) Upon receipt by the Trustee of an Index Rate Continuation Notice from an Authorized Officer of the Issuer, as soon as practicable, but in any event not less than 10 Business Days prior to the first day of the proposed Index Rate Period, the Issuer (or any Dissemination Agent appointed by the Issuer) shall give notice by first-class mail or by Electronic Means via EMMA to the Holders of the Bonds of the applicable Series, which notice shall state in substance:

(A) that a new Index Rate Period and Index Rate is to be established for such Bonds and the proposed effective date of such new Index Rate Period (which date shall be the Mandatory Purchase Date for such Bonds pursuant to Section 4.13), and that such new Index Rate Period and Index Rate will become effective on such date if the conditions specified in this Section 2.9 are satisfied on or before such date;

40118-2  
<!-- Page 445 -->
(B) that all Bonds of the applicable Series are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the applicable Mandatory Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.13 (whether or not the proposed new Index Rate Period becomes effective on such date) at the Purchase Price, which shall be specified therein;

(C) the first day of the new Index Rate Period;

(D) that the new Index Rate Period and Index Rate for the Bonds shall not be established unless a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel is delivered to the Trustee on the first day of the new Index Rate Period and no Failed Remarketing has occurred;

(E) the CUSIP numbers or other identification information of the applicable Series; and

(F) that, to the extent that there shall be on deposit with the Trustee on the first day of the new Index Rate Period an amount of money sufficient to pay the Purchase Price thereof, all the Bonds not delivered to the Trustee on or prior to such date shall be deemed to have been properly tendered for purchase and shall cease to constitute or represent a right on behalf of the Holder thereof to payment of principal thereof or interest thereon and shall represent and constitute only the right to payment of the Purchase Price on deposit with the Trustee, without interest accruing thereon after such date.

(d) End of Index Rate Period. In the event the Issuer has not given an Index Rate Continuation Notice or other Written Notice reasonably acceptable to the Trustee with respect to the Conversion of Bonds to an Interest Rate Period other than an Index Rate Period, in either case at the time required by this Indenture, or if the conditions to the effectiveness of a new Index Rate Period and new Index Rate set forth in Section 2.9(c)(ii) are not satisfied, including as a result of the Remarketing Agent’s failure to establish an Index Rate as herein provided, then the Bonds of the applicable Series shall be purchased on the applicable Mandatory Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.13 and the Bonds shall not be remarketed.

Section 2.10 Notice of Conversion. (a) In the event that the Issuer shall elect to convert the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to a Daily Interest Rate Period, a Weekly Interest Rate Period, a Fixed Rate Period, an Index Rate Period or a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period as provided in this Article II, then the Written Direction of the Issuer required to be delivered to the Trustee by the applicable provision of this Article II shall be given by registered or certified mail, or by Electronic Means.

and the Bonds of the applicable Series shall continue to bear interest in the Daily Interest Rate Period, Weekly Interest Rate Period, Fixed Rate Period, Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period or Index Rate Period, as the case may be, as in effect immediately prior to such proposed Conversion (provided, that the period of any such continuing Fixed Rate Period shall be one year).

(iv) If an Issuer Commodity Swap is not otherwise replaced but the Commodity Supplier is obligated under Section 3(d) of a Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement to continue paying Commodity Swap Receipts in the same amount that would have applied under such Issuer Commodity Swap, then such Issuer Commodity Swap will be deemed to be replaced by such obligation under such Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement and such obligation under the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement will be treated as the Issuer Commodity Swap thereafter until such terminated Issuer Commodity Swap is otherwise replaced by another Issuer Commodity Swap.

(c) The following shall apply with respect to the termination of the Issuer Commodity Swap:

(c) Unless the Issuer shall otherwise direct, the Bonds shall be numbered from one upward.

### Section 3.2 Legends.
The Bonds may contain or have endorsed thereon such provisions, specifications and descriptive words not inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture as may be necessary or desirable to comply with custom, the rules of any securities exchange or commission or brokerage board, or otherwise, as may be determined by the Issuer prior to the authentication and delivery thereof.

### Section 3.3 Execution and Authentication.
(a) The Issuer and the Trustee agree that the Electronic Signature of a party to this Indenture, including all acknowledgments, authorizations, directions, waivers and consents thereto (or any amendment or supplement thereto) shall be as valid as an original signature of such party and shall be effective to bind such party to this Indenture. The Issuer and the Trustee agree that any Electronically Signed Document (including this Indenture) shall be deemed (i) to be “written” or “be in writing,” (ii) to have been signed, and (iii) to constitute a record established and maintained in the ordinary course of business and an original written record when printed from electronic files.

(b) The Bonds shall be executed in the name of the Issuer by the manual or facsimile signature of its Chair, Vice Chair or other Authorized Officer, and its seal (or a facsimile thereof), if any, shall be impressed, imprinted, engraved or otherwise reproduced thereon and attested by the manual or facsimile signature of its Secretary, an Assistant Secretary or other Authorized Officer, or in such other manner as may be required or permitted by law. In case any one or more of the officers who have signed or sealed any of the Bonds shall cease to be such officer before the Bonds so signed and sealed shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, such Bonds may, nevertheless, be authenticated and delivered as herein provided, and may be issued as if the Persons who signed or sealed such Bonds had not ceased to hold such offices.

(c) The Bonds shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication, in the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto, executed manually by the Trustee. Only such Bonds as shall bear thereon such certificate of authentication shall be entitled to any right or benefit under this Indenture, and no Bond shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose until such certificate of authentication shall have been duly executed by the Trustee. Such certificate of the Trustee upon any Bond executed on behalf of the Issuer shall be conclusive evidence that the Bond so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered under this Indenture and that the Holder thereof is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.

Section 3.4 Exchange, Transfer and Registry. (a) The Bonds shall be registered as transferred only upon the books of the Issuer, which shall be held and controlled by the Bond Registrar and kept for such purposes at the designated corporate trust office of the Bond Registrar, by the registered owner thereof in person or by its attorney duly authorized in writing, upon surrender thereof together with a written instrument of transfer, in form and with guaranty of signature satisfactory to the Bond Registrar duly executed by the registered owner or its duly authorized attorney. The transferor shall also provide, or cause to be provided, to the Trustee all information reasonably required by the Trustee to allow it to comply with any applicable federal, state or local tax reporting obligations, including, without limitation, any cost-basis reporting obligations under Section 6045 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Trustee may rely upon such information provided to it and shall have no responsibility to verify or ensure the accuracy of such information.

(b) The registered owner of any Bond or Bonds of one or more denominations shall have the right to exchange such Bond or Bonds for a new Bond or Bonds of any denomination then authorized for such Bond or Bonds of the same Series, aggregate principal amount and maturity of the surrendered Bond or Bonds. Such Bond or Bonds shall be exchanged by the Issuer for a new Bond or Bonds upon the request of the registered owner thereof in person or by its attorney duly authorized in writing, upon surrender of such Bond or Bonds together with a written instrument requesting such exchange, in form and with guaranty of signature satisfactory to the Bond Registrar duly executed by the registered owner or its duly authorized attorney.

(c) The Issuer and each Fiduciary may deem and treat the Person in whose name any Bond shall be registered upon the books of the Issuer maintained by the Bond Registrar as the absolute owner of such Bond, whether such Bond shall be overdue or not, for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal and Redemption Price, if any, of and interest on such Bond and for all other purposes, and all such payments so made to any such registered owner or upon its order shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability upon such Bond to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, and neither the Issuer nor any Fiduciary shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

Section 3.5 Regulations with Respect to Exchanges and Registration of Transfers. In all cases in which the privilege of exchanging or registering the transfer of Bonds is exercised, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Bonds in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

transfer shall forthwith be delivered to the Trustee and cancelled or retained by the Trustee. Prior to every such exchange or registration of transfer of Bonds, whether temporary or definitive, the Issuer or the Bond Registrar may require the Holder to pay an amount sufficient to reimburse it for any tax, fee or other governmental charge required to be paid with respect to such exchange or transfer. Unless otherwise provided in a Supplemental Indenture, neither the Issuer nor the Bond Registrar shall be required (a) to register the transfer or exchange of Bonds for the period next preceding any Interest Payment Date for the Bonds, beginning with the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date and ending on such Interest Payment Date, or for the period next preceding any date for the proposed payment of Defaulted Interest with respect to such Bonds beginning with the Special Record Date for the date of such proposed payment and ending on the date of such proposed payment, (b) to register the transfer or exchange of Bonds for a period beginning 15 days before the mailing of any notice of redemption of such Bonds and ending on the day of such mailing, or (c) to register the transfer or exchange of any Bonds called for redemption. Every Person that transfers Bonds shall timely provide or cause to be timely provided to the Trustee all information necessary to allow the Trustee to comply with any applicable tax reporting obligations, including without limitation any cost-basis reporting obligations under Section 6045 of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Trustee may rely on the information provided to it and shall have no responsibility to verify or ensure the accuracy of such information.

If any Bond becomes mutilated or is lost, stolen or destroyed, the Issuer may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver a new Bond of like Series, date of issue, maturity date, principal amount and interest rate per annum as the Bond so mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, provided that (a) in the case of such mutilated Bond, such Bond is first surrendered to the Trustee, (b) in the case of any such lost, stolen or destroyed Bond, there is first furnished evidence of such loss, theft or destruction, in form satisfactory to the Trustee together with indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee while the Bonds are held in a Book-Entry System and to the Trustee and the Issuer at all other times, (c) all other reasonable requirements of the Issuer, set forth in a Written Instrument of the Issuer delivered to the Trustee are complied with, and (d) expenses in connection with such transaction are paid by the Holder. Any Bond surrendered for registration of transfer shall be cancelled. Any such new Bonds issued pursuant to this Section 3.6 in substitution for Bonds alleged to be destroyed, stolen or lost shall constitute original additional contractual obligations on the part of the Issuer, whether or not the Bonds so alleged to be destroyed, stolen or lost be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be equally secured by and entitled to equal and proportionate benefits with all other Bonds issued under this Indenture, in any moneys or securities held by the Issuer or any Fiduciary for the benefit of the Bondholders.

Section 3.7 Temporary Bonds. (a) Until the definitive Bonds are prepared, the Issuer may execute, in the same manner as is provided in Section 3.3, and upon the request of the Issuer, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of definitive Bonds, but subject to the same provisions, limitations and conditions as the definitive Bonds, one or more temporary Bonds substantially of the tenor of the definitive Bonds in lieu of which such temporary Bond or Bonds are issued, and with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate to temporary Bonds. The Issuer at its own expense shall prepare and execute and, upon the surrender of such temporary Bonds for exchange and the cancellation of such surrendered temporary Bonds, the

Trustee shall authenticate and, without service charge to the Owner thereof (except a sum sufficient to cover any tax, fee or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto), deliver in exchange therefor, definitive Bonds of the same aggregate principal amount and maturity as the temporary Bonds surrendered. Until so exchanged, the temporary Bonds shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits and security as definitive Bonds authenticated and issued pursuant to this Indenture.

(b) All temporary Bonds surrendered in exchange either for another temporary Bond or Bonds or for a definitive Bond or Bonds shall be forthwith cancelled by the Trustee.

**Section 3.8 Payment of Interest on Bonds; Interest Rights Preserved.** Interest on any Bond which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Bond is registered at the close of business on the date (hereinafter, the “Regular Record Date”) which is the 15th day of the calendar month next preceding such Interest Payment Date.

Any interest on any Bond which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (hereinafter, “Defaulted Interest”) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Person who was the registered owner on the relevant Regular Record Date; and such Defaulted Interest shall be paid by the Issuer to the Persons in whose names the Bonds are registered at the close of business on a date (hereinafter, the “Special Record Date”) for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner: the Issuer shall notify the Bond Registrar in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Bond and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Issuer shall deposit with the Paying Agent an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to and approved in writing by the Paying Agent for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Section 3.8 provided. Thereupon the Bond Registrar shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days or less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Bond Registrar of written notice of the proposed payment. The Bond Registrar shall promptly notify the Issuer of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Issuer, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Bondholder at his address as it appears upon the registry books, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.8, each Bond delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Bond shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Bond.

**Section 3.9 Book Entry System; Appointment of Securities Depository.** All Bonds shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, as Securities Depository, and held in the custody or for the account of the Securities Depository. A single certificate will be issued and delivered to the Securities Depository for each maturity of Bonds, and the Beneficial Owners will not receive physical delivery of Bond certificates except as provided in this Indenture.

<!-- Page 454 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

long as the Securities Depository shall continue to serve as securities depository for the Bonds as provided herein, all transfers of Beneficial Ownership interests will be made by book-entry only, and no investor or other party purchasing, selling or otherwise transferring Beneficial Ownership of Bonds is to receive, hold or deliver any Bond certificate.

The Issuer may, with written notice to the Trustee but without the consent of any Bondholders, appoint a successor Securities Depository and enter into an agreement with the successor Securities Depository, to establish procedures with respect to a Book-Entry System for the Bonds not inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture. Any successor Securities Depository shall be a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The Issuer and the Trustee may rely conclusively upon (i) a certificate of the Securities Depository as to the identity of the Participants in the Book-Entry System with respect to the Bonds, and (ii) a certificate of any such Participant as to the identity of, and the respective principal amount of the Bonds beneficially owned by the Beneficial Owners.

Whenever, during the term of the Bonds, the Beneficial Ownership of any Series thereof is determined by a book-entry at the Securities Depository, the requirements in this Indenture of holding, delivering or transferring such Bonds shall be deemed modified to require the appropriate Person to meet the requirements of the Securities Depository as to registering or transferring the book-entry to produce the same effect. Any provision hereof permitting or requiring delivery of the Bonds shall, while such Bonds are in such Book-Entry System, be satisfied by the notation on the books of the Securities Depository in accordance with applicable state law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any security (including any transfers between or among Securities Depository Participants or Beneficial Owners) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.

Except as otherwise specifically provided herein with respect to the rights of Participants and Beneficial Owners, when a Book-Entry System is in effect, the Issuer and the Trustee may treat the Securities Depository (or its nominee) as the sole and exclusive owner of the Bonds registered in its name for the purposes of payment of the principal or purchase price of and interest on such Bonds or portion thereof to be redeemed or purchased, of giving any notice permitted or required to be given to the Bondholders under this Indenture and of voting, and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or obligations to the Securities Depository, any Participant, any Beneficial Owner or any other Person which is not shown on the bond register, with respect to (a) the accuracy of any records maintained by the Securities Depository or any Participant; (b) the payment by the Securities Depository or by any Participant of any amount due to any Beneficial Owner in respect of the principal amount or redemption or purchase price of, or interest on, any Bonds; (c) the delivery of any notice by the Securities Depository or any Participant; (d) the selection of the Beneficial Owners to receive payment in the event of any partial redemption of Bonds;

- any of the Bonds; or (e) any other action taken by the Securities Depository or any Participant. The Trustee shall pay all principal or Redemption Price of and interest on the Bonds registered in the name of Cede only to or “upon the order of” the Securities Depository (as that term is used in the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the State and New York), and all such payments shall be valid and effective to fully satisfy and discharge the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the principal, Redemption Price or purchase price of and interest on such Bonds to the extent of the sum or sums so paid.

The Book-Entry System may be discontinued by the Trustee and the Issuer, at the Written Direction and expense of the Issuer, and the Issuer and the Trustee will cause the delivery of Bond certificates to such Beneficial Owners of the Bonds and registered in the names of such Beneficial Owners as shall be specified to the Trustee by the Securities Depository in writing, under the following circumstances:

(a) The Securities Depository determines to discontinue providing its service with respect to any Bonds and no successor Securities Depository is appointed as described above. Such a determination may be made at any time by giving 30 days’ written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law; or

(b) the Issuer determines, with written notice to the Trustee, not to continue the Book-Entry System with a Securities Depository for the Bonds.

In connection with any proposed transfer outside the Book-Entry System of the Securities Depository, the Securities Depository or the Issuer shall provide or cause to be provided to the Trustee all information necessary to allow the Trustee to comply with any applicable tax reporting obligations, including without limitation any cost-basis reporting obligations under Section 6045 of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder. The Trustee may rely on the information provided to it and shall have no responsibility to verify or ensure the accuracy of such information.

When the Book-Entry System is not in effect, all references herein to the Securities Depository shall be of no further force or effect.

The Trustee agrees to hold all Bonds delivered to it pursuant to Section 4.11, Section 4.12, Section 4.13, or Section 4.14 in trust for the benefit of the respective Owners which shall have delivered such Bonds until moneys representing the Purchase Price of such Bonds have been delivered to such Owner in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture and until such Bonds shall have been delivered by the Trustee in accordance with Section 4.15(f).

(iii) Any Purchased Bonds which are subject to mandatory tender for purchase in accordance with Section 4.12, Section 4.13 or Section 4.14 which are not presented to the Trustee on the Purchase Date and any Purchased Bonds which are the subject of a notice pursuant to Section 4.16 which are not presented to the Trustee on the Purchase Date shall, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.16, be deemed to have been purchased upon the deposit of moneys equal to the Purchase Price thereof into any or all of the accounts of the Bond Purchase Fund.

Any moneys held by the Trustee in the Issuer Purchase Account remaining unclaimed by the Owners of the Purchased Bonds which were to have been purchased for two years after the respective Purchase Date for such Bonds shall be paid to the Issuer, upon a request in a Written Direction of the Issuer against written receipt therefor. The Owners of Purchased Bonds who have not yet claimed money in respect of such Bonds shall thereafter be entitled to look only to the Trustee, to the extent it shall hold moneys on deposit in the Bond Purchase Fund, or the Issuer to the extent moneys have been transferred in accordance with this Section 4.15(e).

mandatory tender for purchase shall be purchased on the Mandatory Purchase Date unless (i) a Failed Remarketing shall have occurred prior to a Mandatory Purchase Date occurring at the end of any Interest Rate Period, in which case such Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant to Section 4.1 rather than purchased on such Mandatory Purchase Date, or (ii) such Bonds shall have otherwise been redeemed on or prior to, or are not Outstanding as of, such Mandatory Purchase Date; and (c) that in the event that any Owner of a Bond so subject to mandatory tender for purchase shall not surrender such Bond to the Trustee for purchase on such Mandatory Purchase Date, then such Bond shall be deemed to be an Undelivered Bond, and that no interest shall accrue thereon on and after such Mandatory Purchase Date and that the Owner thereof shall have no rights under this Indenture other than to receive payment of the Purchase Price thereof. Any such notice of a mandatory tender of Bonds pursuant to Section 4.12, Section 4.13 or Section 4.14 shall be given no less than 30 days prior to the applicable Mandatory Purchase Date, and in addition, the Trustee shall give a conditional notice of extraordinary redemption pursuant to Section 4.4 no later than the applicable deadlines set forth in that Section to provide for the extraordinary redemption of the Bonds in the event that a Failed Remarketing occurs prior to the Mandatory Purchase Date. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which such conditional notice of extraordinary redemption is required to be given by the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.4, the Issuer shall direct the Trustee to send such conditional redemption notice pursuant to a Written Direction in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E, which Written Direction shall include the applicable Redemption Date and method(s) for calculating the Redemption Price, to be followed by notice of the Redemption Price, as provided in Exhibit E.

Section 4.17 Irrevocable Notice Deemed to Be Tender of Bond; Undelivered Bonds. (a) The giving of notice by an Owner of a Bond bearing interest at a Daily Interest Rate or a Fixed Interest Rate pursuant to Section 4.11 shall constitute the irrevocable tender for purchase of each such Bond with respect to which such notice shall have been given, regardless of whether such Bond is delivered to the Trustee for purchase on the relevant Purchase Date as provided in this Article IV.

(b) The Trustee may refuse to accept delivery of any Purchased Bonds for which a proper instrument of transfer, with a satisfactory guaranty of signature, has not been provided; such refusal, however, shall not affect the validity of the purchase of such Bond as herein described. For purposes of this Article IV, the Trustee for the Bonds shall determine timely and proper delivery of Purchased Bonds and the proper endorsement of such Bonds. Such determination shall be binding on the Owners of such Bonds, the Issuer and the Remarketing Agent, absent manifest error. If any Owner of a Bond who shall have given notice of tender of purchase pursuant to Section 4.11 or any Owner of a Bond subject to mandatory tender for purchase pursuant to Section 4.12, Section 4.13 or Section 4.14 shall fail to deliver such Bond to the Trustee at the place and on the applicable date and at the time specified, or shall fail to deliver such Bond properly endorsed, such Bond shall constitute an Undelivered Bond. If funds in the amount of the Purchase Price of the Undelivered Bond are available for payment to the Owner thereof on the date and at the time specified, from and after the date and time of that required delivery, (i) the Undelivered Bond shall be deemed to be purchased and shall no longer be deemed to be Outstanding under this Indenture; (ii) interest shall no longer accrue thereon; and (iii) funds in the amount of the Purchase Price of the Undelivered Bond shall be held by the Trustee for such Bond for the benefit of the Owner thereof, to be paid on delivery (and proper endorsement) of the Undelivered Bond to the

Trustee at its designated corporate trust office. Any funds held by the Trustee as described in clause (iii) of the preceding sentence shall be held uninvested.

**Section 4.18 Remarketing of Bonds; Notice of Interest Rates.** (a) Upon a mandatory tender or notice of the tender for purchase of Bonds, the Remarketing Agent shall offer for sale and use its best efforts to sell such Bonds subject to conditions in the Remarketing Agreement, any such sale to be made on the Purchase Date in accordance with this Article IV at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any, thereon to the Purchase Date.

5.11(b) at the Written Request of the Issuer. The Issuer may deposit funds that are not part of the Trust Estate into the Working Capital Account of the General Fund from time to time.

(c) If at any time Bonds of any maturity for which Sinking Fund Installments shall have been established here (i) purchased or redeemed other than pursuant to Section 5.7(d) or (ii) deemed to have been paid pursuant to Section 12.1(b) and, with respect to such Bonds which have been deemed paid, irrevocable written instructions have been given to the Trustee to redeem or purchase the same on or prior to the due date of the Sinking Fund Installment to be credited under this subsection (c), the Issuer may from time to time and at any time by Written Direction to the Trustee specify the portion, if any, of such Bonds so purchased, redeemed or deemed to have been paid and not previously applied as a credit against any Sinking Fund Installment which are to be credited against future Sinking Fund Installments. Such direction shall specify the amounts of such Bonds to be applied as a credit against each Sinking Fund Installment or Installments and the particular Sinking Fund Installment or Installments against which such Bonds are to be applied as a credit; provided, however, that none of such Bonds may be applied as a credit against a Sinking Fund Installment to become due less than 45 days after such notice is delivered to the Trustee. All such Bonds to be applied as a credit shall be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation on or prior to the due date of the Sinking Fund Installment against which they are being applied as a credit.

For purposes of this Section 5.12, the portion of the Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund allocable to a remarketing shall consist of the product of (i) a fraction, the numerator of which is the purchase price of the gas electricity to be remarketed, and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount previously received by the Issuer from any sale of such gas or electricity in a Non-Private Business Sale (as defined in the Commodity Remarketing Exhibit to the Commodity Purchase Agreement) or Private Business Sale (as defined in the Commodity Remarketing Exhibit to the Commodity Purchase Agreement)

## PARTICULAR COVENANTS OF the ISSUER

The Issuer covenants and agrees with the Trustee and the Bondholders as follows:

### Section 7.1 Payment of Bonds.
The Issuer shall duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid, but solely from the Trust Estate, the principal or Redemption Price, if any, of every Bond and the interest thereon, at the dates and places and in the manner provided in the Bonds, according to the true intent and meaning thereof.

### Section 7.2 Extension of Payment of Bonds.
The Issuer shall not directly or indirectly extend or assent to the extension of the maturity of any of the Bonds or the time of payment of any claims for interest by the purchase or funding of such Bonds or claims for interest or by any other arrangement, and in case the maturity of any of the Bonds or the time for payment of any such claims for interest shall be extended, such Bonds or claims for interest shall not be entitled, in case of any default under this Indenture, to the benefit of this Indenture or to any payment out of Revenues or Funds established by this Indenture, including the investment income, if any, thereof, pledged under this Indenture or the moneys (except moneys held in trust for the payment of particular Bonds or claims for interest pursuant to this Indenture) held by the Fiduciaries, except subject to the prior payment of the principal of all Bonds Outstanding the maturity of which has not been extended and such portion of the accrued interest on the Bonds as shall not be represented by such extended claims for interest.

### Section 7.3 Offices for Servicing Bonds.
The Issuer shall at all times maintain one or more agencies where Bonds may be presented for payment. Pursuant to Section 2.2, the Issuer has appointed the Trustee as Bond Registrar and Paying Agent for the Bonds and the Trustee hereby accepts such appointments. The Trustee shall at all times maintain one or more agencies or offices where Bonds may be presented for registration, exchange or transfer, where principal and Redemption Price of and interest on the Bonds may be paid, where reports, statements and other documents furnished to the Trustee hereunder may be inspected and where notices, demands and other documents may be served upon the Issuer in respect of the Bonds or of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall continuously maintain or make arrangements to provide such services.

### Section 7.4 Further Assurance.
At any and all times the Issuer shall, as far as it may be authorized by law, comply with any reasonable request of the Trustee to pass, make, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all and every such further resolutions, acts, deeds, conveyances, assignments, transfers and assurances as may be necessary or desirable for the better assuring, conveying, granting, assigning and confirming all and singular the rights, Revenues and other moneys, securities and funds hereby pledged, or intended so to be, or which the Issuer may become bound to pledge.

### Section 7.5 Power to Issue Bonds and Pledge the Trust Estate.
The Issuer is duly authorized under all applicable laws to create and issue the Bonds and to execute and deliver this Indenture and to pledge the Trust Estate, in the manner and to the extent provided in this Indenture. Except to the extent otherwise provided in this Indenture, the Trust Estate will be free and clear of

any pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance thereon or with respect thereto prior to, or of equal rank with, the security interest, the pledge and assignment created by this Indenture, and all action on the part of the Issuer to that end has been and will be duly and validly taken. The Bonds and the provisions of this Indenture are and will be the valid and legally enforceable special obligations of the Issuer in accordance with their terms and the terms of this Indenture. The Issuer shall at all times, to the extent permitted by law, defend, preserve and protect the pledge of the Revenues and other moneys, securities and funds pledged under this Indenture and all the rights of the Bondholders under this Indenture against all claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever.

**Section 7.6 Power To Enter Into and Perform the Commodity Supply Contract.** The Issuer has and will have as long as any Bonds are Outstanding, good right and lawful power to (a) enter into the Commodity Supply Contract, (b) observe and perform its obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract, and (c) charge and collect the amounts payable by the Project Participant in respect of the gas supply or electricity supply and other services provided by the Issuer thereunder.

Nothing in this Indenture limits the Issuer’s right to issue any bonds, notes, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness of similar nature payable out of or secured by a security interest in or pledge or assignment of a trust estate separate from the Trust Estate.

(c) The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Bonds at the time Outstanding may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, provided that the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee shall be advised by counsel that the action or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken, or if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that the action or proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability or be unjustly prejudicial to the Bondholders not parties to such direction.

(d) Upon commencing a suit in equity or upon other commencement of judicial proceedings by the Trustee to enforce any right under this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled - 95 -

(e) Regardless of the happening of an Event of Default, the Trustee shall have power to, but unless requested in writing by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding and furnished with reasonable security and indemnity, shall be under no obligation to, institute and maintain such suits and proceedings as it may be advised shall be necessary or expedient to prevent any impairment of the security under this Indenture by any acts which may be unlawful or in violation of this Indenture, and such suits and proceedings as the Trustee may be advised shall be necessary or expedient to preserve or protect its interests and the interests of the Bondholders.

Section 8.6 Restriction on Bondholder’s Action. (a) No Holder of any Bond shall have any right to institute any suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity for the enforcement of any provision of this Indenture or the execution of any trust under this Indenture or for any remedy under this Indenture, unless such Holder (i) shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of the happening of an Event of Default, as provided in this Article VIII, and the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding shall have filed a written request with the Trustee, (ii) shall have offered it reasonable opportunity, either to exercise the powers granted in this Indenture or by the Act or by the laws of the State or to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name, and (iii) shall have offered to the Trustee adequate security and indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee shall have refused to comply with such request for a period of 60 days after receipt by it of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders of Bonds shall have any right in any manner whatever by its or their action to affect, disturb or prejudice the pledge created by this Indenture, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner therein provided; and that all proceedings at law or in equity to enforce any provision of this Indenture shall be instituted, had and maintained in the manner provided in this Indenture and for the equal benefit of all Holders of the Outstanding Bonds, subject only to the provisions of Section 7.2.

Section 8.7 Remedies Not Exclusive. No remedy by the terms of this Indenture conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or the Bondholders is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, but each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given under this Indenture or existing at law or in equity or by statute on or after the date of execution and delivery of this Indenture.

Section 8.8 Effect of Waiver and Other Circumstances. (a) No delay or omission of the Trustee or any Bondholder to exercise any right or power arising upon the happening of an Event

of Default shall impair any right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or be an acquiescence therein; and every power and remedy given by this Article VIII to the Trustee or to the Bondholders may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Trustee or by the Bondholders.

Subject to the provisions of subsection (b), no Fiduciary shall be liable in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder except for its own negligence or willful misconduct. To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer shall indemnify the Fiduciaries for, and hold the Fiduciaries harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred by it, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this Indenture or the trusts hereunder or the performance of its duties hereunder, except to the extent determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been primarily caused by its own negligence or willful misconduct. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the permissive rights of any Fiduciary to do things enumerated under this Indenture shall not be construed as duties.

The Trustee shall not be responsible for insuring any property conveyed or collecting any insurance monies, or for the validity of the execution by the Issuer of this Indenture or of any supplements hereto, or instruments of further assurance, or for the sufficiency of the security for the Bonds, or for the investment of monies as herein permitted (except that no investment shall be made except in compliance with Section 6.2 and Section 6.3 hereof), or for the recording or re-recording, filing or re-filing of this Indenture, or any supplement or amendment thereto, or of any security for the Bonds issued hereunder intended to be secured hereby, or for the value or title of the property herein conveyed or otherwise as to the maintenance of the security hereof.

(b) The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing of all Events of Default which may have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture.

**Section 9.4 Evidence on Which Fiduciaries May Act.**  
(a) Each Fiduciary, upon receipt of any notice, direction, resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, bond or other paper or document furnished to it pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, shall examine such instrument to determine whether it conforms to the requirements of this Indenture and shall be protected in acting upon any such instrument believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. Each Fiduciary may consult with any consultant, accountant, or counsel, who may or may not be counsel to the Issuer, and the opinion of such consultant, accountant, or counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered by it under this Indenture in good faith and in accordance therewith and the Trustee shall be under no duty to make any investigation or inquiry into any statements contained or matters referred to in any such instrument.

(b) Whenever any Fiduciary shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering any action under this Indenture, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be therein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a Written Certificate of the Issuer, and such certificate shall be full warrant for any action taken or suffered in good faith under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof; but in its discretion the Fiduciary may in lieu thereof accept other evidence of such fact or matter or may require such further or additional evidence as it may deem reasonable. Neither the Trustee, the Bond Registrar nor the Paying Agent shall be bound to recognize any Person as a Bondholder or to take any action at its request unless its Bond shall be deposited with such entity or satisfactory evidence of the ownership of such Bond shall be furnished to such entity.

(c) The Trustee shall have the right to accept and act upon directions given pursuant to this Indenture, or any other document reasonably relating to the Bonds and delivered using Electronic Means; provided, however, that the Issuer shall provide to the Trustee a Written Certificate of the Issuer listing Authorized Officers with the authority to provide such directions and containing specimen signatures of such Authorized Officers, which Written Certificate of the Issuer shall be amended whenever a person is to be added or deleted from the listing. If the Issuer elects to give the Trustee directions using Electronic Means and the Trustee in its discretion elects to act upon such directions, the Trustee’s understanding of such directions shall be deemed controlling. The Issuer understands and agrees that the Trustee cannot determine the identity of the actual sender of such directions and that the Trustee shall conclusively presume that directions that purport to have been sent by an Authorized Officer listed on the Written Certificate of the Issuer provided to the Trustee have been sent by such Authorized Officer. The Issuer shall be responsible for ensuring that only Authorized Officers transmit such directions to the Trustee and that all Authorized Officers treat applicable user and authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys as confidential and with extreme care. The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from the Trustee’s reliance upon and compliance with such directions notwithstanding such directions conflict or are inconsistent with a subsequent written direction. The Issuer agrees: (i) to assume all risks arising out of the use of Electronic Means to submit directions to the Trustee, including without limitation the risk of the

40118-2  
<!-- Page 502 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
Trustee acting on unauthorized directions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties; (ii) that it is fully informed of the protections and risks associated with the various methods of transmitting directions to the Trustee and that there may be more secure methods of transmitting directions, (iii) that the security procedures (if any) to be followed in connection with its transmission of directions provide to it a commercially reasonable degree of protection in light of its particular needs and circumstances and (iv) to notify the Trustee immediately upon learning of any compromise or unauthorized use of the security procedures.

(d) Paper copies or “printouts” of any document, if introduced as evidence in any judicial, arbitral, mediation or other administrative proceeding, will be admissible as between the Issuer and the Trustee to the same extent and under the same conditions as other original business records created and maintained in documentary form. Neither party shall contest the admissibility of true and accurate copies of Electronically Signed Documents on the basis of the best evidence rule or as not satisfying the business records exception to the hearsay rule.

Section 9.5 Compensation. The Issuer shall pay or cause to be paid to each Fiduciary from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered under this Indenture, and also all reasonable expenses, charges, legal fees and other disbursements, including those of its attorneys, agents and employees, incurred in and about the performance of their powers and duties under this Indenture, in accordance with the agreements made from time to time between the Issuer and the Fiduciary. Subject to the provisions of Section 9.3, the Issuer further agrees to indemnify and save each Fiduciary harmless against, and agrees to pay or reimburse, the expenses, charges, legal fees and disbursements described in the preceding sentence. The Trustee shall be entitled to reimbursement of all expenses and liabilities incurred and all advances made by the Trustee, except for expenses and liabilities incurred or advances made by the Trustee as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Section 9.6 Certain Permitted Acts. Any Fiduciary, individually or otherwise, may become the owner of any Bonds, with the same rights it would have if it were not a Fiduciary. To the extent permitted by law, any Fiduciary may act as depository for, and permit any of its officers or directors to act as a member of, or in any other capacity with respect to, any committee formed to protect the rights of Bondholders or to effect or aid in any reorganization growing out of the enforcement of the Bonds or this Indenture, whether or not any such committee shall represent the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding. Nothing herein shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Bondholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, or composition affecting the Bonds or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Bondholder in any such proceeding without the approval of the Bondholders so affected.

Section 9.7 Resignation of Trustee. The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged of the duties created by this Indenture by giving not less than forty-five (45) days’ written notice to the Issuer and mailing notice thereof to the Holders of Bonds then Outstanding, specifying the date when such resignation shall take effect, and such resignation shall take effect upon the day specified in such notice unless (a) previously a successor shall have been appointed by the Issuer or the Bondholders as provided in Section 9.9, in which event such resignation shall take effect immediately on the appointment of such successor, or (b) a successor shall not have

Said court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as such court may deem proper, appoint a successor Trustee.

(c) Any Trustee appointed under the provisions of this Section 9.9 in succession to the Trustee shall be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of any state or a national banking association and shall have capital stock, surplus and undivided earnings aggregating at least $500,000,000 if there be such a bank with trust powers or trust company or national banking association willing and able to accept the office on reasonable and customary terms and authorized by law to perform all the duties imposed upon it by this Indenture.

**Section 9.10 Transfer of Rights and Property to Successor Trustee.** Any successor trustee appointed under this Indenture shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to its predecessor Trustee, and also to the Issuer, an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with all moneys, estates, properties, rights, powers, duties and obligations of such predecessor Trustee, with like effect as if originally named as Trustee; but the Trustee ceasing to act shall nevertheless, on the Written Request of the Issuer or of the successor Trustee, execute, acknowledge and deliver such instrument of conveyance and further assurance and do such other things as may reasonably be

Should any deed, conveyance or instrument in writing from the Issuer be required by such successor Trustee for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee any estates, rights, powers and duties, any and all such deeds, conveyances and instruments in writing shall, on request, and so far as may be authorized by law, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Issuer. Any such successor Trustee shall promptly notify the Paying Agents of its appointment as Trustee.

Section 9.11 Merger or Consolidation. Any company into which any Fiduciary may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated or any company resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which it shall be a party or any company to which any Fiduciary may sell or transfer all or substantially all of its corporate trust business, provided such company shall be a bank with trust powers or trust company organized under the laws of any state of the United States or a national banking association and shall be authorized by law to perform all the duties imposed upon it by this Indenture and shall meet the qualifications set forth in Section 9.9(c), shall be the successor to such Fiduciary without the execution or filing of any paper or the performance of any further act.

Section 9.12 Adoption of Authentication. In case any of the Bonds contemplated to be issued under this Indenture shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any successor Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee so authenticating such Bonds and deliver such Bonds so authenticated; and in case any of the said Bonds shall not have been authenticated, any successor Trustee may authenticate such Bonds in the name of the predecessor Trustee, or in the name of the successor Trustee, and in all such cases such certificate shall have the full force which it is provided, anywhere in said Bonds or in this Indenture, that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.

Section 9.13 Resignation or Removal of Paying Agent and Appointment of Successor. (a) Any Paying Agent may at any time resign and be discharged of the duties and obligations created by this Indenture by giving at least 45 days’ written notice to the Issuer, the Trustee and the other Paying Agents. Any Paying Agent may be removed with 30 days’ prior notice by an instrument filed with such Paying Agent and the Trustee and signed by an Authorized Officer.

(b) In the event of the resignation or removal of any Paying Agent, such Paying Agent shall pay over, assign and deliver any moneys held by it as Paying Agent to its successor, or if there be no successor, to the Trustee. In the event that for any reason there shall be a vacancy in the office of any Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such Paying Agent.

The Trustee may conclusively rely, and shall be protected in acting upon any notice, direction, ordinance, resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, bond, statement, facsimile transmission, electronic mail or other paper or document furnished to the Trustee pursuant to any provision of this Indenture and that is believed by the Trustee to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties and in conformity with the formal requirements of this Indenture. The Trustee may consult with any consultant, account, or counsel, who may or may not be counsel to the Issuer, and the opinion of such consultant, accountant, or counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered by Trustee under this Indenture in good faith and in accordance therewith. The Trustee shall be under no duty to make any investigation or inquiry into any statements contained or matters referred to in any such instrument.

# ARTICLE XI

## AMENDMENTS

### Section 11.1 Mailing.
Any provision in this Article XI for the mailing of a notice or other paper to Bondholders shall be fully complied with if it is mailed postage prepaid only (a) to each registered owner of Bonds then Outstanding at its address, if any, appearing upon the registry books of the Issuer, and (b) to the Trustee.

### Section 11.2 Powers of Amendment.
Any modification or amendment of this Indenture and of the rights and obligations of the Issuer and of the Holders of the Bonds thereunder may be made by a Supplemental Indenture, subject to Section 10.3(e), with the written consent given as provided in Section 11.3 (a) of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of Outstanding Bonds, and (b) in case the modification or amendment changes the terms of any Sinking Fund Installment, of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of Outstanding Bonds of the particular maturity entitled to such Sinking Fund Installment; provided, however, that if such modification or amendment will, by its terms, not take effect so long as any Bonds of any specified like maturity remain Outstanding (or are subject to mandatory purchase) the consent of the Holders of such Bonds shall not be required and such Bonds shall not be deemed to be Outstanding for the purpose of any calculation of Outstanding Bonds under this Section 11.2; and provided further, however, that if such modification or amendment would adversely affect any Interest Rate Swap Counterparty, such modification or amendment shall be subject to the prior written consent of the Interest Rate Swap Counterparty. No such modification or amendment shall permit a change in the terms of redemption or maturity of the principal of any Outstanding Bond or of any installment of interest thereon or a reduction in the principal amount or the Redemption Price thereof or in the rate of interest thereon without the consent of the Holder of such Bond, or shall reduce the percentages or otherwise affect the classes of Bonds the consent of the Holders of which is required to effect any such modification or amendment, or shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of any Fiduciary without its written assent thereto. For the purposes of this Section 11.2, the Bonds shall be deemed to be affected by a modification or amendment of this Indenture if the same adversely affects or diminishes the rights of the Holders of Bonds in any material respect. The Trustee may in its discretion determine whether or not in accordance with the foregoing powers of amendment Bonds would be materially affected by any modification or amendment of this Indenture and any such determination shall be binding and conclusive on the Issuer and all Holders of Bonds. For purposes of this Section 11.2, the Holders of any Bonds may include the initial Holders thereof, regardless of whether such Bonds are being held for resale.

### Section 11.3 Consent of Bondholders.
The Issuer and the Trustee may at any time enter into a Supplemental Indenture making a modification or amendment permitted by the provisions of Section 11.2 to take effect when and as provided in this Section 11.3. A copy of such Supplemental Indenture (or brief summary thereof or reference thereto in form approved by the Trustee), together with a request to Bondholders for their consent thereto in form satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be mailed by the Issuer to Bondholders (but failure to mail such copy and request shall not affect the validity of the Supplemental Indenture when consented to as in this Section 11.3 provided). Such Supplemental Indenture shall not be effective unless and until there shall have been filed with the Trustee (a) the written consents of Holders of the percentages of Outstanding

- 108 -

<!-- Page 511 -->
![Bonds specified in Section 11.2, subject to Section 11.5(b), (b) the written consent of any Interest Rate Swap Counterparty if required by Section 11.2, and (c) an Opinion of Counsel stating that such Supplemental Indenture has been duly and lawfully executed by the Issuer in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, is authorized or permitted by this Indenture, and is valid and binding upon the Issuer and enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and may state that no opinion is being rendered as to the availability of any particular remedy. For purposes of clause (a) of the preceding sentence, the written consent of the Bondholder shall be deemed to have been received if the amendment is expressly referred to in the Supplemental Indenture authorizing such Bonds and in the text of such Bonds and such Bonds recite that such Bondholder shall be deemed to have consented to such amendments by accepting such Bonds. Otherwise, each such consent shall be effective only if accompanied by proof of the holding, at the date of such consent, of the Bonds with respect to which such consent is given, which proof shall be as permitted by Section 12.2. A certificate or certificates executed by the Trustee and filed with the Trustee and the Issuer stating that it has examined such proof and that such proof is sufficient in accordance with Section 12.2 shall be conclusive that the consents have been given by the Holders of the Bonds described in such certificate or certificates of the Trustee. Any such consent shall be irrevocable and shall be binding upon the Holder of the Bonds giving such consent and, anything in Section 12.2 to the contrary notwithstanding, upon any subsequent Holder of such Bonds and of any Bonds issued in exchange therefor (whether or not such subsequent Holder thereof has notice of such consent). At any time after the Holders of the required percentages of Bonds shall have filed their consents to the Supplemental Indenture (or have deemed to have consented to such Supplemental Indenture), the Trustee shall make and file with the Trustee and the Issuer a written statement that the Holders of such required percentages of Bonds have consented to, such Supplemental Indenture. Such written statements shall be conclusive that such consents have been received. At any time thereafter, notice stating in substance that the Supplemental Indenture (which may be referred to as a Supplemental Indenture entered into by the Issuer and the Trustee on a stated date, a copy of which is on file with the Trustee) has been consented to by the Holders of the required percentages of Bonds and will be effective as provided in this Section 11.3, may be given to Bondholders by the Trustee by mailing such notice to Bondholders (but failure to mail such notice shall not prevent such Supplemental Indenture from becoming effective and binding as in this Section 11.3 provided). A record, consisting of the certificates or statements required or permitted by this Section 11.3 to be made by the Trustee, shall be proof of the matters therein stated.

Section 11.4 Notifications by Unanimous Consent. The terms and provisions of this Indenture and the rights and obligations of the Issuer and of the Holders of the Bonds thereunder may be modified or amended in any respect upon the execution of a Supplemental Indenture by the Trustee and the Issuer, the consent of the Holders of all of the Bonds then Outstanding (such consent to be given as provided in Section 11.3), and the consent of any Interest Rate Swap Counterparty if required by Section 11.2; provided, however, that no such modification or amendment shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of any Fiduciary or any of the provisions referenced in Section 10.3(e) without the filing with the Trustee of the written assent thereto of such Fiduciary or the Commodity Swap Counterparty, respectively, in addition to the consent of the Bondholders.

If the Issuer shall pay or cause to be paid, or there shall otherwise be paid, to the Holders of any Outstanding Bonds the principal or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest due or to become due thereon, at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and in this Indenture, such Bonds shall cease to be entitled to any lien, benefit or security under this Indenture, and all covenants, agreements and obligations of the Issuer to the Holders of such Bonds shall thereupon cease, terminate and be discharged and satisfied except for remaining rights of registration of transfer and exchange of Bonds.

(b) Bonds or interest installments for the payment or redemption of which moneys shall have been set aside and shall be held in trust by the Paying Agents (through deposit by the Issuer of funds for such payment or redemption or otherwise) at the maturity or redemption date thereof shall be deemed to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed in subsection (a). In addition, any Outstanding Bonds shall prior to the maturity or redemption date thereof be deemed to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed in subsection (a) upon compliance with the provisions of subsection (c).

(c) Subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section 12.1, any Outstanding Bonds shall prior to the maturity or redemption date thereof be deemed to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed in subsection (a) of this Section 12.1 if (i) in case any of said Bonds are to be redeemed on any date prior to maturity, the Issuer shall have given the Trustee irrevocable written instructions accepted in writing by the Trustee to mail as provided in Article IV notice of redemption of such Bonds (other than Bonds which have been purchased by the Trustee at the direction of the Issuer or purchased or otherwise acquired by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee as hereinafter provided prior to the mailing of such notice of redemption) on said date, (ii) there shall have been deposited with the Trustee either moneys (including moneys withdrawn and deposited pursuant to Section 5.7(g)) in an amount which shall be sufficient, or Defeasance Securities (including any Defeasance Securities issued or held in book-entry form on the books of the Department of the Treasury of the United States) the principal of and the interest on which when due will provide moneys which, together with the moneys, if any, deposited with the Trustee at the same time, shall be sufficient, to pay when due the principal or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest due and to become due on said Bonds (with such interest being calculated at the Maximum Rate with respect to any Bonds with interest rates that are not fixed to their redemption or maturity date, as applicable) on or prior to the redemption date or maturity date thereof, as the case may be, and (iii) in the event said Bonds are not by their terms subject to redemption within the next succeeding 60 days, the Issuer shall have given the Trustee in form satisfactory to it irrevocable written instructions to mail, as soon as practicable, a notice to the Holders of such Bonds at their last addresses appearing upon the registry books at the close of business on the last Business Day of the month preceding the month for which notice is mailed that the deposit required by (ii) above has been made with the Trustee and that said Bonds are deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 and stating such maturity or redemption date upon which moneys are expected, subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section 12.1, to be available for the payment of the principal or Redemption Price, if

applicable, on said Bonds (other than Bonds which have been purchased by the Trustee at the direction of the Issuer or purchased or otherwise acquired by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee as hereinafter provided prior to the mailing of the notice of redemption referred to in clause (i)). Any notice of redemption mailed pursuant to the preceding sentence with respect to Bonds which constitute less than all of the Outstanding Bonds of any maturity shall specify the letter and number or other distinguishing mark of each such Bond. The Trustee shall, as and to the extent necessary, apply moneys held by it pursuant to this Section 12.1 to the retirement of said Bonds in amounts equal to the unsatisfied balances (determined as provided in Section 12.1) of any Sinking Fund Installments with respect to such Bonds, all in the manner provided in this Indenture. The Trustee shall, if so directed by the Issuer (A) prior to the maturity date of Bonds deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 which are not to be redeemed prior to their maturity date or (B) prior to the mailing of the notice of redemption referred to in clause (i) above with respect to any Bonds deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 which are to be redeemed on any date prior to their maturity, apply moneys deposited with the Trustee in respect of such Bonds and redeem or sell Defeasance Securities so deposited with the Trustee and apply the proceeds thereof to the purchase of such Bonds and, the Trustee shall immediately thereafter cancel all such Bonds so purchased; provided, however, that the moneys and Defeasance Securities remaining on deposit with the Trustee after the purchase and cancellation of such Bonds (or the deemed cancellation thereof) shall be sufficient to pay when due the Principal Installment or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest due or to become due on all Bonds (calculated as described above), in respect of which such moneys and Defeasance Securities are being held by the Trustee on or prior to the redemption date or maturity date thereof, as the case may be. If, at any time (1) prior to the maturity date of Bonds deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 which are not to be redeemed prior to their maturity date or (2) prior to the mailing of the notice of redemption referred to in clause (i) with respect to any Bonds deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 which are to be redeemed on any date prior to their maturity, the Trustee shall purchase or otherwise acquire any such Bonds and deliver such Bonds to the Trustee prior to their maturity date or redemption date, as the case may be, the Trustee shall immediately cancel all such Bonds so delivered; such delivery of Bonds to the Trustee shall be accompanied by directions from the Issuer to the Trustee as to the manner in which such Bonds are to be applied against the obligation of the Trustee to pay or redeem Bonds deemed paid in accordance with this Section 12.1. The directions given by the Issuer to the Trustee referred to in the preceding sentences shall also specify the portion, if any, of such Bonds so purchased or delivered and cancelled or deemed cancelled to be applied against the obligation of the Trustee to pay Bonds deemed paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 upon their maturity date or dates and the portion, if any, of such Bonds so purchased or delivered and cancelled or deemed cancelled to be applied against the obligation of the Trustee to redeem Bonds deemed paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 on any date or dates prior to their maturity. In the event that on any date as a result of any purchases, acquisitions and cancellations or deemed cancellations of Bonds as provided in this Section 12.1 the total amount of moneys and Defeasance Securities remaining on deposit with the Trustee under this Section 12.1 is in excess of the total amount which would have been required to be deposited with the Trustee on such date in respect of the remaining Bonds in order to satisfy clause (ii) of this subsection (c) of Section 12.1, the Trustee shall, if requested by the Issuer, pay the amount of such excess to the Issuer free and clear of any trust, lien, security interest, pledge or assignment securing said Bonds or otherwise existing under this Indenture. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this Section 12.1, neither Defeasance - 112 - 4147-6340-3086.5 40118-2

In connection with any such deposit of Defeasance Securities, or any determination of the sufficiency or remaining sufficiency thereof, for any of the purposes described in this Section 12.1, there shall be delivered to the Trustee, on which it shall be entitled to rely, a verification report of an independent certified public accountant, verification agent or similar expert to the effect that such Defeasance Securities, together with investment earnings thereon (and other available cash deposited with the Trustee at the same time for the applicable purpose), will be sufficient to pay when and as due and payable the principal (or Redemption Price, if applicable), interest, and premium, if applicable, on the applicable Bonds to redemption or maturity, as applicable. (d) Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, any moneys held by a Fiduciary in trust for the payment and discharge of any of the Bonds which remain unclaimed for two years after the date when such Bonds have become due and payable, either at their stated maturity dates or by call for earlier redemption, if such moneys were held by the Fiduciary at such date, or for two years after the date of deposit of such moneys if deposited with the Fiduciary after the said date when such Bonds became due and payable, shall, at the Written Request of the Issuer, be repaid by the Fiduciary to the Issuer, as its absolute property and free from trust, and the Fiduciary shall thereupon be released and discharged with respect thereto and the Bondholders shall look only to the Issuer for the payment of such Bonds; provided, however, that before being required to make any such payment to the Issuer the Fiduciary shall, at the expense of the Issuer, cause to be published at least twice, at an interval of not less than seven days between publications, in the Authorized Newspaper, a notice that said moneys remain unclaimed and that, after a date named in said notice, which date shall be not less than 30 days after the date of the first publication of such notice, the balance of such moneys then unclaimed will be returned to the Issuer.

(a) Any request, consent, revocation of consent or other instrument which this Indenture may require or permit to be signed and executed by the Bondholders may be in one or more instruments of similar tenor, and, except as otherwise provided in Section 11.3, shall be signed or executed by such Bondholders in person or by their attorneys appointed in writing. Proof of (1) the execution of any such instrument, or of an instrument appointing any such attorney, or (2) the holding by any Person of the Bonds shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture (except as otherwise therein expressly provided) if made in the following manner, or in any other manner satisfactory - 113 - 4147-6340-3086.5 4011B-2.

(i) The fact and date of the execution by any Bondholder or its attorney of such instruments may be proved by a guarantee of the signature thereof by a bank or trust company or by the certificate of any notary public or other officer authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds, that the Person signing such request or other instrument acknowledged to him the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness of such execution, duly sworn to before such notary public or other officer.

**EXHIBIT D**

**DIRECTION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY TO OPTIONALLY REDEEM COMMODITY SUPPLY REVENUE REFUNDING BONDS, SERIES 2024**

To: Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the “Trustee”)

DIRECTION IS HEREBY GIVEN BY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY (the “Issuer”) to the Trustee for the Issuer’s Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024 (the “Bonds”) issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated Trust Indenture, dated as of __1__, 2024 between the Issuer and the Trustee (the “Indenture”), to call the Bonds for redemption on ____, (the “Redemption Date”) at a redemption price (the “Redemption Price”), calculated by a quotation agent selected by the Issuer, equal to [FOR REDEMPTIONS UNDER SECTION 4.3(a): the greater of (a) the Amortized Value of the Series 2024 Bonds as of the Redemption Date, plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date, or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining unpaid payments of principal and interest to be paid on the Series 2024 Bonds to be redeemed from and including the Redemption Date (not including any portion of the interest accrued and unpaid as of the redemption date) to the earlier of the stated maturity date of such Series 2024 Bonds or the Series 2024 Mandatory Purchase Date, discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis at a discount rate equal to the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate for such Bonds minus 0.25% per annum, plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date]; or [FOR REDEMPTIONS UNDER SECTION 4.3(b) the Amortized Value of the Series 2024 Bonds as of the Redemption Date, plus $0.__ per $1,000 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date, provided that, if the optional redemption date is the Mandatory Purchase Date, the Redemption Price shall be the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption].

“Amortized Value” means, with respect to any Series 2024 Bond to be redeemed when a Fixed Rate Period is in effect with respect to such Bond, the principal amount of such Bond multiplied by the price of such Bond expressed as a percentage, calculated by a major market maker in municipal securities, as the quotation agent, selected by the Issuer, based on the industry standard method of calculating bond prices (as such industry standard prevails on the date of delivery of the Bonds), with a delivery date equal to the date of redemption, a maturity date equal to the earlier of (a) the stated maturity date of such Bond or (b) the Fixed Rate Tender Date of such Bond and a yield equal to such Bond’s original reoffering yield, which, in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds and certain dates, produces the amounts for all of the Series 2024 Bonds set forth in Schedule IV attached to the Indenture.

“Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate” means, for the Series 2024 Bonds of any maturity, the “Comparable AAA General Obligations” yield curve rate for the year of such maturity or Mandatory Purchase Date, as applicable, as published by Refinitiv Global Markets, Inc. one Business Day prior to the date of this Notice of Conditional Optional Redemption. If no such yield curve rate is established for the applicable year, the “Comparable AAA General Obligations” yield curve rate for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the applicable year shall be determined, and the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate will be

interpolated or extrapolated from those yield curve rates on a straight-line basis. This rate is made available daily by Refinitiv Global Markets, Inc. and is available to its subscribers through the internet address: www.tm3.com. In calculating the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate, should Refinitiv Global Markets, Inc. no longer publish the “Comparable AAA General Obligations” yield curve rate, then the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate shall equal the Consensus Scale yield curve rate for the applicable year. The Consensus Scale yield curve rate is made available daily by Municipal Market Analytics and is available to its subscribers through its internet address: www.mma-research.com. In the further event Municipal Market Analytics no longer publishes the Consensus Scale, the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate shall be determined by a major market maker in municipal securities, as the quotation agent, based upon the rate per annum equal to the annual yield to maturity, calculated using semi-annual compounding, of those tax-exempt general obligation bonds rated in the highest Rating Category by Moody’s and S&P with a maturity date equal to the stated maturity date or Mandatory Purchase Date, as applicable, of such Bonds having characteristics (other than the ratings) most comparable to those of such Bonds in the judgment of the quotation agent. The quotation agent’s determination of the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate shall be final and binding in the absence of manifest error on all parties and may be conclusively relied upon in good faith by the Trustee.

The quotation agent selected by the Issuer is _____________________________. The Issuer shall calculate the Redemption Price and deliver it to you [one] Business Day prior to the date that notice of redemption is required to be given pursuant to Section 4.4 of the Indenture.

The Issuer hereby directs you to cause notice of such optional redemption to be given pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 4.4 of the Indenture to the registered owner of each Bond being redeemed, at its address as it appears on the bond registration books of the Trustee or at such address as such owner may have filed with the Trustee for that purpose, as of the Regular Record Date (as defined in the Indenture), such notice to be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least _____ (__) days prior to the Redemption Date, and such notice to be in substantially the form attached as Exhibit A hereto.

All payments from the Issuer or the Commodity Swap Counterparty will be due on each “Payment Date” under the Issuer Commodity Swap (which shall be the 25th day of the Month following the Month of natural gas and electricity deliveries or, if such day is not a Business Day under the Issuer Commodity Swap, then the next following Business Day).

HP = The higher of (i) the Replacement Gas Price or Replacement Electricity Price, as applicable or (ii) during the Gas Delivery Period, the Monthly Index Price applicable to the Gas Day and the Delivery Point for which the Shortfall Quantity arose, or (B) during the Electricity Delivery Period, the Day-Ahead Market Price applicable to the Delivery Hour and the Delivery Point for which the Shortfall Quantity arose; provided that in the case of a Shortfall Quantity arising at a Secondary Electricity Delivery Point, “HP” shall be deemed to equal the Day-Ahead Market Price; and

AF = The Administrative Fee.

(c) If, with respect to any Shortfall Quantity, Replacement Gas or Replacement Electricity (as applicable) is not purchased, then Seller shall pay to Buyer the result determined by the following formula:

P = Q x IP

Where:

P = The amount payable by Seller under this Section 4.1(c);

Q = The portion of the Shortfall Quantity described in the lead-in to this Section 4.1(c); and

IP = Either (i) during the Gas Delivery Period, the Monthly Index Price applicable to the Gas Day and the Delivery Point for which the Shortfall Quantity arose, or (ii) during the Electricity Delivery Period, the Day-Ahead Market Price applicable to the Delivery Hour and the Delivery Point for which the Shortfall Quantity arose.

(d) If, with respect to any Shortfall Quantity for Gas that arises on a Gas Day that commences on any of the last seven Business Days of a Month, Buyer or the Project Participant purchases Replacement Gas for delivery in the Month following the Month in which such Shortfall Quantity arose, then Seller shall pay to Buyer, in addition to those amounts already paid under Section 4.1(c), the positive result, if any, determined by the following formula:

18

(e) Buyer shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to monitor or cause Project Participant to monitor nominations and deliveries of Gas to be delivered directly from Seller to Buyer at each Delivery Point for each Gas Day and promptly notify Seller upon becoming aware that such nominations or deliveries might result in a Shortfall Quantity with respect to such Delivery Point. Buyer shall also exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to monitor or cause Project Participant to monitor any nominations and deliveries of Gas to be delivered directly from Seller to Project Participant at each Delivery Point for each Gas Day and promptly notify or cause Project Participant to promptly notify Seller if Buyer or Project Participant becomes aware that such nomination or deliveries would reasonably be expected to result in a Shortfall Quantity with respect to such Delivery Point.  

(f) Buyer shall cause Project Participant to comply with its obligations under Section 4.1(d) of the Commodity Supply Contract to mitigate damages.  

(g) Imbalance Charges shall not be recovered under this Section 4.1, but rather in accordance with Section 5.5.  

Section 4.2 Buyer’s Failure to Take the Contract Quantity (Not Due to Force Majeure). Except to the extent Buyer is excused under Section 4.3, if, on any Gas Day during the Gas Delivery Period or for any Delivery Hour during the Electricity Delivery Period, Buyer breaches its obligation to take all or any portion of the Contract Quantity at any Delivery Point pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then Buyer shall be deemed to have issued a Deemed Remarketing Notice with respect to the portion not taken. Imbalance Charges shall not be recovered under this Section 4.2, but rather in accordance with Section 5.5. For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to Gas required to be delivered on any Gas Day, Buyer may be deemed to have issued a Deemed Remarketing Notice with respect to the entire Contract Quantity unless Seller receives actual written notice from Buyer to the contrary prior to the end of the following Month or thirty (30) calendar days after Buyer first receives notice of a deficiency from the applicable Transporter, whichever is later.

**ARTICLE VII. COMMODITY REMARKETING**

**Section 7.1 Commodity Remarketing. If the Project Participant is in default under its Commodity Supply Contract or does not require or is unable to receive all or any portion of the Commodities purchased by Buyer under the Agreement as a result of (a) Project Participant’s decreased Gas requirements due to reduced generation requirements during the Gas Delivery Period, (b) decreased demand by Project Participant’s retail customers or (c) a change in Law and requests that such Commodity be remarketed, then Buyer shall request (and pursuant to Section 4.2 may be deemed to request) remarketing services from Seller pursuant to the provisions of Exhibit C; provided that any remarketing request delivered under clause (c) above shall constitute a “Structural Remarketing Notice” and shall be subject to the following requirements:**

5 OHS NTD: Will this be defined (consistent with the Commodity Supply Agreement) in the Gas Communications Protocol? If not, add definition in Article 1. SM NTD: Thank you for clarifying.

ASSIGNMENT**

(a) pursuant to the Bond Indenture, Buyer may, without the consent of Seller, transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign this Agreement to the Trustee in connection with any financing or other financial arrangements; provided that Buyer shall not assign this Agreement unless, contemporaneously with the effectiveness of such assignment, Buyer also assigns the Buyer Swap (and the Buyer Swap Custodial Agreement) to the same assignee;

29
<!-- Page 585 -->
(b) upon written notice to Buyer, Seller may, without Buyer’s consent, assign this Agreement to an Affiliate of Seller, which assignment shall constitute a novation; provided that the assignee shall agree in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and Seller shall not assign this Agreement unless (i) Seller delivers a Rating Confirmation to Buyer with respect to such assignment, (ii) contemporaneously with the effectiveness of such assignment, Seller also assigns the Seller Swaps, the Seller Swap Custodial Agreements and the SPE Master Custodial Agreement to the same assignee and either (A) Seller assigns the Funding Agreement and Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to the same assignee or (B) the assignee provides to Buyer a guarantee of its obligations by GSG (as defined in the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement) and GSG continues to guarantee the obligations of J. Aron (or any successor to or assignee of J. Aron) under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, and (iii) the assignee is a special purpose entity approved by Buyer or its obligations under this Agreement are guaranteed by a Funding Recipient to the satisfaction of Buyer; and

(c) if (i) Seller notifies Buyer that the Funding Agreement will not be replaced, refinanced, or re-priced as of the end of any Interest Rate Period, (ii) Seller is unable to provide, under the Re-Pricing Agreement, an estimated Available Discount Percentage (as defined in the Re-Pricing Agreement) that is equal to or greater than the highest Minimum Discount Percentage under the Commodity Supply Contract, or (iii) if Buyer can provide reasonable evidence that the Seller’s estimated Reset Period Implied Rate (as defined in the Re-Pricing Agreement) is materially less than the Seller would offer to a substantially similar counterparty in an arm’s length transaction on the same date, then, at the request of Seller, Buyer will reasonably cooperate with Buyer to ensure Seller’s or Seller’s Affiliate’s, if applicable, interest in its agreements, the Re-Pricing Agreement, the Seller Swap and any Specified Investment Agreement with a term that extends past the then-current Interest Rate Period to which Seller or any Affiliate is a party and all agreements related to any of the foregoing “Transaction Documents”) to be novated to a replacement seller; provided that (w) a Rating Confirmation (as defined in the Bond Indenture) is obtained for any Bonds required to be tendered for purchase on the first Mandatory Purchase Date following the effective date of such novation, (x) the Swap Counterparty shall have provided its prior written consent to such assignment in accordance with the terms of the Seller Swap, (y) after giving effect to such novation, Seller will have no obligations (contingent or otherwise, including any obligation to make or repeat any representations or warranties other than basic representations on authority and the right to transfer its interests under this Agreement without encumbrances) or be required to make any payment under any Transaction Document or otherwise in connection with or following such novation other than any obligations that would have existed or payments that would have been required had this Agreement terminated as of the end of the last Reset Period that commenced prior to such novation, and (z) as it relates to clause (iii) above, Seller shall have a right to match the Reset Period Implied Rate provided by the potential novated counterparty.

ARTICLE XIV.  
PAYMENTS

Section 14.1 Monthly Statements.

(a) No later than the [7th] day of each Month during the Delivery Period (excluding the first Month of the Delivery Period) and the first Month following the end of the Delivery Period, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement (a “Buyer’s Statement”) listing (i) for  
30
<!-- Page 586 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

each purchase of Replacement Gas or Replacement Electricity, the quantity and replacement price applicable to such purchase, and (ii) any other amounts due to Buyer in connection with this Agreement with respect to the prior Month(s).

(b) No later than the [12th] day of each Month during the Delivery Period (excluding the first Month of the Delivery Period) and the first Month following the end of the Delivery Period (the “Billing Date”), Seller shall deliver a statement (a “Billing Statement”) to Buyer indicating (i) the total amount due to Buyer, if any, under Article IV, Article V and Article VII and Exhibit C with respect to the prior Month(s), (ii) any amounts due to Seller in connection with this Agreement with respect to the prior Month(s), and (iii) the net amount due to Buyer or Seller. If the actual quantity delivered is not known by the Billing Date, Seller may provisionally prepare a Billing Statement based on Seller’s best available knowledge of the quantity of Commodities delivered, which shall not exceed the sum of the Contract Quantity of all the Gas Days or Hours (as applicable) in such Month plus any make-up quantities delivered during such Month. The invoiced quantity and amounts paid thereon (with interest calculated on the amount overpaid or underpaid by Buyer at the Default Rate) will then be adjusted on the following Month’s Billing Statement, as actual delivery information becomes available based on the actual quantity delivered. The Parties acknowledge and agree that all amounts owed to and from Seller in connection with the Commodity Project shall be paid pursuant to the SPE Master Custodial Agreement, and the Billing Statement may be provided by J. Aron, as Seller’s agent, in the form of a consolidated statement regarding all amounts owed to and from Seller in connection with the Commodity Project for each Month, including payments to be made under the Service Agreement and the Bond Swap.

(c) Upon request by either Party, the other Party shall deliver such supporting documentation of the foregoing as such requesting Party may reasonably request.

Section 14.2 Payment.

(a) If the Billing Statement indicates an amount due from Buyer, then Buyer shall remit such amount to Seller by wire transfer (pursuant to the instructions set forth in the SPE Master Custodial Agreement), in immediately available funds, on or before the later of (i) the 25th day of the Month following the most recent Month to which such Billing Statement relates, or (ii) the 10th day following Buyer’s receipt of Seller’s Billing Statement, or if either such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day. If the Billing Statement indicates an amount due from Seller, then Seller shall remit such amount to Buyer by wire transfer (pursuant to Buyer’s instructions), in immediately available funds, on or before the later of (i) the 22nd day of the Month following the most recent Month to which such Billing Statement relates, or (ii) the 10th day following Seller’s receipt of Buyer’s Statement, or if either such day is not a Business Day, the preceding Business Day.

(b) If Buyer fails to issue a Buyer’s Statement with respect to any Month, Seller shall not be required to estimate any amounts due to Buyer for such Month, provided that Buyer may include any such amount on subsequent Buyer’s Statements issued within the next sixty (60) days. The sixty (60)-day deadline in this subsection (b) replaces the two (2)-year deadline in Section 14.5 with respect to any claim by any non-delivering Party of inaccuracy in any estimated invoice issued or payment made pursuant to this subsection (b).

31
<!-- Page 587 -->
Section 14.3  Payment of Disputed Amounts. If Seller disputes any amounts included in the Buyer’s Statement, Seller shall (a) (except in the case of manifest error) nonetheless calculate the Billing Statement based on the amounts included in Buyer’s Statement and (b) pay any amount required by the Billing Statement in accordance with Section 14.2 without regard to any right of set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or other defenses to payment that Seller may have; provided, however, that Seller shall have the right, after payment, to dispute any amounts included in a Buyer’s Statement or otherwise used to calculate payments due under this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.5(b). If Buyer disputes any amounts included in the Billing Statement, Buyer may withhold payment to the extent of the disputed amount; provided, however, that interest shall be due at the Default Rate for any withheld amount later found to have been properly due.

Section 14.4  Late Payment. If a Party owing a net payment under Section 14.2 fails to remit the full amount payable within one Business Day of when due, interest on the unpaid portion shall accrue from the date due until the date of payment at the Default Rate.

Section 14.5  Audit; Adjustments.

(a) A Party shall have the right, at its own expense, upon reasonable notice to the other Party and at reasonable times, to examine and audit and to obtain copies of the relevant portion of the books, records, and telephone recordings of the other Party to the extent reasonably necessary, but only to such extent, to verify the accuracy of any statement, charge, payment, or computation made under this Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any such examination and audit reveals any material discrepancy in the other Party’s books and records, the examining Party shall have a right to be reimbursed by the other Party for costs reasonably incurred in connection with such examination and audit. This right to examine, audit, and obtain copies shall not be available with respect to proprietary information not directly relevant to transactions under this Agreement.

(b) Each Buyer’s Statement and each Billing Statement shall be conclusively presumed final and accurate and all associated claims for under- or overpayments shall be deemed waived unless such Buyer’s Statement or Billing Statement is objected to in writing, with adequate explanation and/or documentation, within two (2) years after the applicable Month of Commodity delivery.

(c) All retroactive adjustments shall be paid in full by the Party owing payment within 30 days of notice and substantiation of such inaccuracy. If the Parties are unable to agree upon any retroactive adjustments requested by either Party within the time period specified in Section 14.5(b), then either Party may pursue any remedies available with respect to such adjustments at law or in equity. Retroactive adjustments for payments made based on incorrect Buyer’s Statements or Billing Statements shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date such payment was made. Buyer shall cause Project Participant to comply with the provisions of Section 14.5(a) to the extent necessary to allow Seller to verify any amounts due under this Agreement.

Section 14.6  Netting. The Parties shall net all amounts due and owing, including any past due amounts (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include any accrued interest), arising under this Agreement such that the Party owing the greater amount shall make a single payment of the net amount to the other Party in accordance with this Article XIV. Notwithstanding

32
<!-- Page 588 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

the foregoing, Seller shall not be entitled to net (i) any amounts that are in dispute or (ii) any payments due to Seller against (A) the Termination Payment if it becomes due, or (B) any payments due from Seller pursuant to Article IV, Article V or Exhibit C.

ARTICLE XV.  
PPA ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENTS

Section 15.1 Assignment by Project Participant. The Project Participant and the Buyer have agreed pursuant to Article XV of the Commodity Supply Contract that the Project Participant has the right to propose to assign certain Assigned Rights and Obligations under one or more power purchase agreements to J. Aron. If the Project Participant does so, and to the extent such assignment is accepted by J. Aron, Buyer, J. Aron, and the Project Participants have agreed to comply with Article XV of the Commodity Supply Contract. Following the effectiveness of any PPA Assignment Agreement and Assignment Schedule executed pursuant thereto, the Hourly Quantities of Electricity shall be reduced as contemplated by Article XV and Exhibit H of the Commodity Supply Contract to reflect the Commodities acquired by Seller pursuant to such assignment. References to Article XV and Exhibit H of the Commodity Supply Contract mean that Commodity Supply Contract as it originally exists, without regard to any modification, amendments, supplements or waivers thereto (including any embedded definitions or cross-referenced provisions) that have not been consented to by J. Aron in its sole discretion.

Section 15.2 Adjustments to Swaps. The Parties agree to issue appropriate notices to cause the Buyer and the Seller Swap to be revised for each Assignment Period such that the notional quantity under such swaps will be reduced to reflect the Reduced Hourly Quantity determined pursuant to Article XV of the Commodity Supply Contract; provided that such revisions will revert back effective as of the end of the Assignment Period pursuant to the terms of the Assignment Schedule and the applicable PPA Assignment Agreement.

Section 15.3 Early Termination of Assignment Period. Except for any Assignment Period that terminates contemporaneously with this Agreement, upon termination for any reason of the Assignment Period for any PPA Assignment Agreement, the Hourly Quantity shall be increased for all future periods to reverse any reductions to the Hourly Quantity made in connection with such PPA Assignment Agreement.

ARTICLE XVI.  
NOTICES

Any notice, demand, statement or request required or authorized by this Agreement to be given by one Party to the other Party (or to a third party) shall be in writing and shall either be sent by email transmission, courier, or personal delivery (including overnight delivery service) to each of the notice recipients and addresses specified in Exhibit B for the receiving Party. Any such notice, demand, statement or request shall be deemed to be given (i) when delivered by email transmission, or (ii) when actually received if delivered by courier or personal delivery (including overnight delivery service). Each Party shall have the right, upon 10 days’ prior written notice to the other Party, to change its list of notice recipients and addresses in Exhibit B. The Parties may mutually agree in writing at any time to deliver notices, demands or requests through alternate or additional methods. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may at any time notify the other

33

(a) Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event. Upon the occurrence of any Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event, a Commodity Delivery Termination Date shall be deemed to be designated as the end of the Month in which the Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event occurs.

(b) Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event. If at any time an Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, then the Terminating Party, by notice to the other Party specifying the relevant Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event, may designate a day not earlier than the last day of the Month in which such notice is deemed given under Article XVI as the Commodity Delivery Termination Date; provided, however, that with respect to an Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event related to a Buyer Swap or Seller Swap, the Terminating Party may, at any time after the commencement of the Swap Replacement Period, conditionally designate a Commodity Delivery Termination Date, with such designation being conditioned upon (i) the termination and failure to replace either the corresponding Seller Swap or such Buyer Swap and (ii) the Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurring no earlier than the last day of the Month in which the Swap Replacement Period ends.

(c) Effect of Commodity Delivery Termination Date. As of the Commodity Delivery Termination Date, (i) the Delivery Period shall end, (ii) the obligation of Buyer to receive delivery of Commodities from Seller under this Agreement shall terminate, and (iii) the obligation of Seller to Schedule or make any further deliveries of Commodities to Buyer under this Agreement shall terminate and, unless such Commodity Delivery Termination Date resulted from a Termination Payment Event, such obligation to deliver Commodities shall be replaced with a continuing obligation to make payment of the amounts set forth in Exhibit D-3 to Buyer until the earlier of (A) the Month in which a Termination Payment Event occurs and (B) the last due date for such payments under Exhibit D-3. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) except as set forth in this Section 17.4(c) and in Section 17.4(d), this Agreement will continue past a Commodity Delivery Termination Date, and (ii) a Termination Payment Event may arise contemporaneously with a Commodity Delivery Termination Date or at any time thereafter and the occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date shall not prevent the occurrence of a Termination Payment Event.

(d) Termination Payment Event; Early Termination Payment Date. A Termination Payment Event shall occur upon (i) a Commodity Delivery Termination Event that is
<!-- Page 594 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

specified as a Termination Payment Event in Section 17.1 or (ii) a J. Aron Acceleration Option. Following a Termination Payment Event, Seller on the Early Termination Payment Date shall (A) pay the Termination Payment and (B) if applicable, pay the Additional Termination Payment, in each case, to the Trustee pursuant to payment instructions issued by Buyer or, in the absence of such instructions, by wire transfer. Such amounts shall be paid together with interest thereon (before as well as after judgment) from (and including) the Early Termination Payment Date to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the Default Rate. The obligation of Seller to pay the Termination Payment on the Early Termination Payment Date is unconditional, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby, any waiver or consent by Buyer, or any other circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of Seller or a defense of Seller to pay the Termination Payment. Seller waives all rights to set-off, counterclaim, recoupment and any other defenses that might otherwise be available to Seller with regard to Seller’s obligation to pay the Termination Payment on the Early Termination Payment Date.

(e) Acknowledgement of Parties. The Parties acknowledge that it is impractical and difficult to assess actual damages as a result of a termination of the Delivery Period under this Agreement, and the Parties therefore agree that the payment of the Termination Payment and any applicable Additional Termination Payment or the continued payment of amounts specified in Exhibit D-3, as applicable, is a fair and reasonable pre-estimate of the actual damages that would be incurred by Buyer as a result of termination of the Delivery Period under this Agreement for any reason and is not a penalty.

(f) Exclusive Termination Rights. Neither this Agreement nor the Delivery Period may be terminated for any reason except as specified in this Article XVII and in Section 2.2. Except with respect to amounts due for periods prior to the Commodity Delivery Termination Date, the continued payment of amounts required to be made under Section 17.4(c), and, as applicable, the payment of the Termination Payment and any Additional Termination Payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for each Party upon the termination of the Delivery Period and this Agreement for any reason, including as a result of rejection of this Agreement by either Party in any bankruptcy proceedings.

(g) Payment of Investment Agreement Breakage Costs. In the event that a payment in respect of breakage costs becomes due from Buyer under a Specified Investment Agreement due to the occurrence of an Early Termination Payment Date, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the amount of such payment no later than the later of (A) one Business Day prior to the date such payment is required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to such Specified Investment Agreement and (B) one Business Day following receipt by Seller of a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of such payment. In the event that a payment in respect of breakage costs becomes payable to Buyer under a Specified Investment Agreement due to the occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the amount of such payment no later than one Business Day following receipt of such payment by Buyer.

Section 17.5 Replacement of Swaps.
<!-- Page 595 -->
(a) Neither Party shall exercise any optional right it may have to terminate this Agreement as a result of the termination of any Seller Swap or any Buyer Swap without first complying with this Section 17.5. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees that it will not replace any Buyer Swap or Seller Swap, as applicable, unless the other Party is replacing its Buyer Swap or Seller Swap, as applicable, with the same replacement Swap Counterparty.

(b) If:
(i) any Buyer Swap or any Seller Swap terminates,
(ii) Buyer or Seller delivers a termination notice under a Buyer Swap or Seller Swap,
(iii) a Swap Counterparty delivers a termination notice under a Buyer Swap or Seller Swap, or
(iv) any Buyer Swap or any Seller Swap is otherwise reasonably anticipated to become subject to immediate termination,

then each Party whose swap is affected shall notify the other Party of the existence of such circumstances and identify the affected Buyer Swap or Seller Swap (the “Affected Swap”).

(c) Following receipt of a notice under Section 17.5(b), the Parties shall attempt to replace both the Affected Swap and the corresponding unaffected Seller Swap or Buyer Swap with the same Swap Counterparty (the “Unaffected Swap”) by:
(i) if a Buyer Swap and a Seller Swap with another Swap Counterparty are in effect and otherwise are not subject to termination, (A) exercise any rights they may have to increase their notional quantities under such Buyer Swap and Seller Swap in order to effect a replacement upon termination of the Affected Swap (which increase shall be deemed to be a replacement of both the Buyer Swap and Seller Swap for purposes of Section 17.5 if the full notional quantities of the Affected Swap are thereby replaced), and (B) subsequent to such a replacement, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to locate replacement agreements with a second Swap Counterparty and, upon locating a second Swap Counterparty, Seller and Buyer shall reduce their notional quantities under the remaining Seller Swap and Buyer Swap to their original levels and enter into a replacement Seller Swap and Buyer Swap with the replacement Swap Counterparty for the remaining notional quantities; or
(ii) to the extent Seller or Buyer cannot increase their notional quantities under another Buyer Swap and Seller Swap as contemplated by clause (i), cooperate in good faith to locate replacement agreements with an alternate Swap Counterparty to replace both the relevant Seller Swap and Buyer Swap within the Swap Replacement Period.

(d) The “Swap Replacement Period” is a period (I) commencing on the earlier of the date of (x) any termination of a Buyer Swap or Seller Swap designated by a Swap Counterparty, and (y) delivery of a notice of anticipated termination of a Buyer Swap or Seller.

the Swap Counterparty to receive Unpaid Amounts (as defined therein) (any such payment under clause (iii), excluding any such Unpaid Amounts, a “Seller Swap MTM Payment”). As additional consideration hereunder, Buyer hereby transfers and assigns to Seller all of Buyer’s right, title, and interest to all payments and rights to receive payments, if any, that Buyer receives or becomes entitled to receive in the future arising as a result of or otherwise in respect of a Seller Swap MTM Payment. Buyer agrees that it will not take any steps to enforce any right to receive any payments that it has assigned to Seller pursuant to this Section 17.6(a).

(b) The Parties further acknowledge that the terms of the Seller Swaps do not entitle Seller to any payments in respect of any termination of a Seller Swap other than Unpaid Amounts (as defined therein). Nonetheless, Seller hereby presently transfers and assigns to Buyer all of Seller’s right, title and interest to any payments and rights to receive payments that Seller receives or becomes entitled to receive in the future arising as a result of or otherwise in respect of any early termination of a Seller Swap, excluding only any right for Seller to receive Unpaid Amounts thereunder.

Section 17.7 Limitation on Damages. THE PARTIES CONFIRM THAT THE EXPRESS REMEDIES AND MEASURES OF DAMAGES PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT SATISFY THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSES HEREOF. FOR BREACH OF ANY PROVISION FOR WHICH AN EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS HEREIN PROVIDED, SUCH EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, THE OBLIGOR’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED AS SET FORTH IN THIS PROVISION, AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES FOR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE WAIVED. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION, OR OTHERWISE. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT THE LIMITATIONS HEREIN IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE NEGLIGENCE OF EITHER PARTY, WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE. TO THE EXTENT ANY DAMAGES REQUIRED TO BE PAID UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE LIQUIDATED, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE, OTHERWISE OBTAINING AN ADEQUATE REMEDY IS INCONVENIENT, AND THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES CONSTITUTE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE HARM OR LOSS. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF DAMAGES THAT WOULD MAKE THE PARTIES WHOLE, THE PARTIES HAVE THOROUGHLY CONSIDERED, INTER ALIA, THE UNCERTAINTY OF FLUCTUATIONS IN COMMODITY PRICES, THE ABILITY AND INTENTION OF THE PARTIES TO HEDGE SUCH FLUCTUATIONS, THE BARGAINED-FOR ALLOCATION OF RISK, THE KNOWLEDGE, SOPHISTICATION AND EQUAL BARGAINING POWER OF THE PARTIES, THE ARMS-LENGTH NATURE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS TRANSACTION, THE ACCOUNTING AND TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTION BY THE PARTIES, AND THE ENTERING INTO OF OTHER TRANSACTIONS IN RELIANCE ON THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISIONS CONTAINED HEREIN. THE PARTIES
<!-- Page 598 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A SALE OF GOODS SUBJECT TO ARTICLE 2 OF THE NEW YORK UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, §§ 2-706(6), 2-711, 2-718, AND 2-719.

**Section 17.8 Option to Purchase Bonds.** In connection with any new Interest Rate Period established under the Bond Indenture after the initial Interest Rate Period, Seller shall have the option to purchase Bonds to be remarked on the relevant Mandatory Purchase Date by delivering written notice to Buyer and the Trustee no later than the last Business Day of the Reset Period that Seller will purchase a quantity of Bonds necessary to avoid the occurrence of a Failed Remarketing. In the event that Seller exercises such option, (x) Seller shall be obligated to pay the purchase price of such Bonds in immediately available funds on the Mandatory Purchase Date, and (y) to the extent any CSC Remarketing Elections are in effect with respect to the Reset Period commencing immediately prior to such Interest Rate Period, then Seller shall be required to remarket the Contract Quantities associated with such CSC Remarketing Elections, provided that:

(a) Seller shall be entitled to purchase such Commodities for its own account,

(b) for all such Commodities, regardless of how it is remarked, Seller shall pay Buyer the amount determined pursuant to Section 5(d)(ii) of Exhibit C, and

(c) to the extent that it is determined that interest on the Bonds purchased by Seller is not excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, Section 7 through Section 10 of Exhibit C shall not apply to any such remarketing.

**Section 17.9 Termination Payment Adjustment Schedule.** Seller shall prepare revisions to the then-current Exhibit D-2 (Termination Payment Adjustment Schedule) in connection with each successive Interest Rate Period pursuant to the terms of the Re-Pricing Agreement by delivering a revised Exhibit D-2 to Buyer no later than the last day of the applicable Reset Period, in which case such amendments will be effective as of the first day of the next Interest Rate Period.

**ARTICLE XVIII. RECEIVABLES PURCHASES**

In accordance with the provisions of Exhibit E, Seller has the option to purchase Call Receivables (as defined in Exhibit E). The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Call Receivables purchased by Seller under Exhibit E shall be re-purchased by J.

assume its investigation and defense, including employment of counsel, and shall be obligated to pay related court costs, attorneys’ fees and experts’ fees and to post any appeals bonds; provided, however, that the indemnified Party shall have the right to employ at its expense separate counsel and participate in the defense of any Claim. The indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of a Claim without its express written consent thereto. In order to prevent double recovery, the indemnified Party shall reimburse the indemnifying Party for payments or costs incurred in respect of an indemnity with the proceeds of any judgment, insurance, bond, surety or other recovery made by the indemnified Party with respect to a covered event.

**Section 19.8 Winding Up Arrangements.** All indemnity and confidentiality obligations, audit rights, and other provisions specifically providing for survival shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. The expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not relieve either Party of (a) any unfulfilled obligation or undischarged liability of such Party on the date of such termination or (b) the consequences of any breach or default of any warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement. All obligations and liabilities described in the preceding sentence of this Section 19.8, and applicable provisions of this Agreement creating or relating to such obligations and liabilities, shall survive such expiration or termination.

**Section 19.9 Relationships of Parties.** The Parties shall not be deemed to be in a relationship of partners or joint venturers by virtue of this Agreement, nor shall either Party be an agent, representative, trustee or fiduciary of the other, except that Seller shall act on behalf of Buyer in marketing Commodities pursuant to Exhibit C. Neither Party shall have any authority to bind the other to any agreement. This Agreement is intended to secure and provide for the services of each Party as an independent contractor.

**Section 19.10 Immunity.** Buyer represents and covenants to and agrees with Seller that it is not entitled to claim immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or other similar grounds with respect to itself from (i) suit or (ii) jurisdiction of any court because of its status as a political subdivision of the State of California; provided that the foregoing relates only to contractual claims and not to any claim based in tort.

**Section 19.11 Rates and Indices.**

(a) **Daily Gas Reference Prices.**

(i) **Price Replacement Process for Gas, Fewer than Six Consecutive Gas Days.** If a Daily Commodity Reference Price for Gas is not available for any Gas Day for any reason, then such Daily Commodity Reference Price for such Gas Day shall be the average of the following: (A) the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price for the first Gas Day for which a price has been published that immediately precedes the relevant Gas Day; and (B) the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price for the first Gas Day for which a Daily Commodity Reference Price is published that immediately follows the relevant Gas Day; provided that any unavailability of a Daily Commodity Reference Price lasting for six (6) or more consecutive Gas Days or arising from a permanent cessation of publication of such Daily Commodity Reference Price shall be resolved in accordance with clause (ii) or clause (iii) of this Section 19.11(a), respectively.

(ii) **Price Replacement Process, Electricity or Six or More Consecutive Gas Days.** If a Daily Commodity Reference Price for Electricity is not available for any Hour or a Daily Commodity Reference Price for Gas is not available for six (6) consecutive Gas Days but, either case, such Daily Commodity Reference Price has not permanently
<!-- Page 602 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**Price Replacement Process for Non-Published Index.** If a Daily Commodity Reference Price is not available because it has permanently ceased to be published, then the Parties shall promptly endeavor to agree on an alternative source for determination of such Daily Commodity Reference Price for the applicable Gas Days or Hours. If such agreement is not reached by the Parties within three (3) Business Days, the Parties shall request quotations for the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price from four (4) recognized dealers in the applicable Commodity (two (2) selected by each Party) for the period that such Daily Commodity Reference Price is expected to be unavailable. If four (4) quotations are provided as requested, the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price for the applicable Gas Days or Hours shall be the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided by each recognized dealer after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then one (1) of such quotations shall be disregarded. If exactly three (3) quotations are provided, the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price for the applicable Gas Days or Hours shall be the quotation provided by the relevant dealer that remains after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then the value of the two (2) quotations with the same value shall control. If fewer than three (3) quotations are provided, the Parties shall seek additional quotations until at least three (3) have been received.

(iii) **Price Replacement Process for Non-Published Index.** If a Daily Commodity Reference Price is not available because it has permanently ceased to be published, then the Parties shall promptly endeavor to agree on an alternative source for determination of such Daily Commodity Reference Price, which may include relying upon a published index or a basket of published indices (“Daily Replacement Index”) from which to seek quotes for basis differentials as the replacement for the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price. If such agreement is not reached by the Parties within three (3) Business Days, then the Daily Replacement Index shall be selected by Seller, acting reasonably. The Parties shall request quotations from four (4) recognized dealers in the applicable Commodity (two (2) selected by each Party) for a basis differential (“Daily Basis Differential”) between the Daily Replacement Index and physical prices at the relevant Delivery Point for the remaining term of this Agreement. If four (4) quotations are provided as requested, the Daily Basis Differential will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided by each recognized dealer, after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then one (1) of such quotations shall be disregarded. If exactly three (3) quotations are provided, the Daily Basis Differential shall be the quotation provided by the relevant dealer that remains after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then the value of the two (2) quotations with the same value shall control. If fewer than three (3) quotations are provided, the Parties shall seek additional quotations until at least three (3) have been received. The applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price shall be the Daily Replacement Index plus the Daily Basis Differential calculated in accordance with the provisions of this clause (iii).

(b) **Monthly Index Prices.**
<!-- Page 603 -->
(i) Price Replacement Process. If a Monthly Index Price is not available for any Gas Day for any reason (but such Monthly Index Price has not permanently ceased to be published), then the Parties shall promptly endeavor to negotiate in good faith to select a suitable substitute price. If such agreement is not reached by the Parties within three (3) Business Days, the Parties shall request quotations from four (4) recognized dealers in Gas (two (2) selected by each Party). If four (4) quotations are provided as requested, the applicable Monthly Index Price for that Gas Day shall be the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided by each recognized dealer after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then one (1) of such quotations shall be disregarded. If exactly three (3) quotations are provided, the applicable Monthly Index Price for that Gas Day shall be the quotation provided by the relevant dealer that remains after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then the value of the two (2) quotations with the same value shall control. If fewer than three (3) quotations are provided, the Parties shall seek additional quotations until at least three (3) have been received.

(ii) Price Replacement Process for Non-Published Index. If a Monthly Index Price is not available because it has permanently ceased to be published, then the Parties shall promptly endeavor to agree on an alternative source for determination of such Monthly Index Price, which may include agreeing upon a published index or a basket of published indices (“Monthly Replacement Index”) from which to seek quotes for basis differentials as the replacement for the applicable Monthly Index Price. If agreement is not reached by the Parties within three (3) Business Days, then the Monthly Replacement Index shall be selected by Seller, acting reasonably. The Parties shall request quotations from four (4) recognized dealers in Gas (two (2) selected by each Party) for a basis differential (“Monthly Basis Differential”) between the Monthly Replacement Index and physical prices at the relevant Delivery Point for the remaining term of this Agreement. If four (4) quotations are provided as requested, the Monthly Basis Differential shall be the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided by each recognized dealer after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then one (1) of such quotations shall be disregarded. If exactly three (3) quotations are provided, the Monthly Basis Differential shall be the quotation provided by the relevant dealer that remains after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then the value of the two (2) quotations with the same value shall control. If fewer than three (3) quotations are provided, the Parties shall seek additional quotations until at least three (3) have been received. The applicable Monthly Index Price shall be the Monthly Replacement Index plus the Monthly Basis Differential calculated in accordance with the provisions of this clause (ii).

(c) Corrections. If a value published for any rate or index used or to be used in this Agreement is subsequently corrected and the correction is published or announced by the Person responsible for that publication or announcement within thirty (30) days after the original publication or announcement, either Party may notify the other Party of (i) that correction and (ii) the amount (if any) that is payable as a result of that correction. If not later than thirty (30) days after publication or announcement of that correction, a Party gives notice that an amount is payable, then the correction shall apply.
<!-- Page 604 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

so payable, the Party that originally either received or retained such amount shall, not later than three (3) Business Days after the effectiveness of that notice, pay, subject to any other applicable provisions of this Agreement, to the other Party that amount, together with interest on that amount at the Default Rate for the period from and including the day on which a payment originally was (or was not) made to but excluding the day of payment of the refund or payment resulting from that correction.

**Section 19.12 Limitation of Liability.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, including without limitation all obligations to make payments of any kind whatsoever, are special, limited obligations of Buyer, payable solely from the Trust Estate (as such term is defined in the Bond Indenture) as and to the extent provided in the Bond Indenture, including with respect to Operating Expenses (as such term is defined in the Bond Indenture). Buyer shall not be required to advance any moneys derived from any source other than the Revenues (as such term is defined in the Bond Indenture) and other assets pledged under the Bond Indenture for any of the purposes in this Agreement mentioned. Neither the faith and credit of Buyer nor the taxing power of the State of California or any political subdivision thereof is pledged to payments pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall not be directly, indirectly, contingently or otherwise liable for any costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims or actions, of any conceivable kind on any conceivable theory, under or by reasons of or in connection with this Agreement, except solely to the extent Revenues (as such term is defined in the Bond Indenture) are received for the payment thereof and may be applied therefor pursuant to the terms of the Bond Indenture.

**Section 19.13 Counterparts.** This Agreement may be executed and acknowledged in multiple counterparts and by the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which shall be and constitute one and the same instrument.

**Section 19.14 Modification of and Compliance with Bond Indenture.** Buyer agrees and covenants that, as long as this Agreement is in effect, it shall not amend or consent to the amendment of any provision of the Bond Indenture (including without limitation Article V of the Bond Indenture), or fail to comply with any covenant applying to Buyer thereunder, that would, in any such case, be reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on Seller, J. Aron, the effectiveness of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

**Section 19.15 Rights of Trustee.** Pursuant to the terms of the Bond Indenture, Buyer has irrevocably appointed the Trustee as its agent to issue notices (including Remarketing Notices) and as directed under the Bond Indenture, to take any other actions that Buyer is required or permitted to take under this Agreement. Seller may rely on notices or other actions taken by Buyer or the Trustee and Seller has the right to exclusively rely on any notices delivered by the Trustee, regardless of any conflicting notices that it may receive from Buyer.

**Section 19.16 Waiver of Defenses.** Seller waives all rights to set-off, counterclaim, recoupment and any other defenses that might otherwise be available to Seller with regard to Seller’s obligations pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

**Section 19.17 Rate Changes.**

(a) Absent the agreement of the Parties to the proposed change, the standard of review for changes to any rate, charge, classification, term or condition of this Agreement, whether proposed by a Party (to the extent that any waiver in Section 19.17(b) below is unenforceable or ineffective as to such Party), a non-party or FERC acting sua sponte, shall solely be the “public interest” application of the “just and reasonable” standard of review set forth in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332 (1956) and Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U.S. 348 (1956) and clarified by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish, 554 U.S. 527 (2008).

(b) In addition, and notwithstanding Section 19.17(a), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Party, for itself and its successors and assigns, hereby expressly and irrevocably waives any rights it can or may have, now or in the future, whether under Section 205 and/or 206 of the Federal Power Act or otherwise, to seek to obtain from FERC by any means, directly or indirectly (through complaint, investigation or otherwise), and each hereby covenants and agrees not at any time to seek to obtain, an order from FERC changing any section of this Agreement specifying the rate, charge, classification, or other term or condition agreed to by the Parties, it being the express intent of the Parties that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, neither Party shall unilaterally seek to obtain from FERC any relief changing the rate, charge, classification, or other term or condition of this Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent changes in applicable Law or market conditions that may occur. In the event it were to be determined that applicable Law precludes the Parties from waiving their rights to seek changes from FERC to their market-based power sales contracts (including entering into covenants not to do so) then this Section 19.17(b) shall not apply; provided that, consistent with Section 19.17(a), neither Party shall seek any such changes except solely under the “public interest” application of the “just and reasonable” standard of review and otherwise as set forth in Section 19.17(a).

Section 19.18 U.S. Resolution Stay Provisions. Seller and Buyer hereby confirm that they are adherents to the ISDA 2018 U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol (“ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol”), the terms of the ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol are incorporated into and form a part of this Agreement, and for the purposes of such incorporation, (i) Seller shall be deemed to be a Regulated Entity, (ii) Buyer shall be deemed to be an Adhering Party, and (iii) this Agreement shall be deemed a Protocol Covered Agreement. In the event of any inconsistencies between this Agreement and the ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol, the ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol will prevail.7

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Prepaid Commodity Sales Agreement to be duly executed and delivered by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the date first above written.

Neither Seller nor any Person acting on Seller’s behalf shall owe any fiduciary duties to Buyer with respect to the remarketing of any Commodities. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller or a Person acting on Seller’s behalf in remarketing Commodities may have other supplies of Commodities available to sell to potential remarketing buyers, and Commodities designated for remarketing shall not be entitled to any preference over any such other supplies of Commodities.

(iii) In the event the payment due date under a Qualified Sale or Non-Private Business Sale has not yet occurred prior to the date upon which payment is due under this Agreement for the applicable Month, the Parties shall nonetheless issue statements as if the full amount from such Qualified Sale or Non-Private Business Sale had been paid and, if such full payment is not received prior to the next Monthly due date under this Agreement, the Parties shall issue the appropriate statements to reflect the actual proceeds received and true-up any difference.

(d) Proceeds from Private Business Sales.

(i) For any Commodities specified in a Monthly Remarketing Notice that are not remarketed in a Qualified Sale or Non-Private Business Sale, Seller shall pay to Buyer the positive result determined by the following formula with respect to each Delivery Point to which such Monthly Remarketing Notice applied:

Q  =  The quantity of such Commodities remarketed with respect to such Delivery Point  
IP  =  Either (A) during the Gas Delivery Period, the Monthly Index Price for such Delivery Point, or (B) during the Electricity Delivery Period, the Day-Ahead Market Price for such Delivery Point.  
RF  =  The Remarketing Fee  

(ii) For any Commodities specified in a Daily Remarketing Notice that are not remarketed in a Qualified Sale or Non-Private Business Sale, Seller shall pay to Buyer the positive result determined by the following formula with respect to each Delivery Point to which such Daily Remarketing Notice applied:  
P  =  Q x (IPL - RF)  
Where:  
P  =  The amount payable by Seller under this Section 5(d)(ii)

IPL  =  Either (A) during the Gas Delivery Period, the Index Price (Low) for such Delivery Point for the Delivery Point, or (B) during the Electricity Delivery Period, the Real-Time Market Price for such Delivery Point  
RF  =  The Remarketing Fee  

(e) Any proceeds received by Buyer under this Section 5 for Commodities remarketed in sales other than Qualified Sales that exceed the amount Buyer would have received for the same quantity of Commodities at the Net Participant Price shall be deposited in the Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund.

For purposes of the foregoing, Seller shall be considered to have resold such Electricity to the extent Seller shall have entered into one or more arrangements in a Commercially Reasonable manner whereby Seller repurchases its obligation to purchase and receive Electricity from another party at the Delivery Point

RF = The Remarketing Fee

AF = The Administrative Fee, provided that the Administrative Fee shall not apply during the Electricity Delivery Period unless such Deemed Remarketing Notice results from Buyer’s failure to Schedule pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Agreement

Section 7. Tracking Remarketing Proceeds. Seller shall maintain four (4) separate ledgers related to remarketing proceeds as described below:

(a) One (1) ledger (the “Non-Private Business Sales Ledger”) shall include, (A) as dollar credits, the Non-Private Business Remarketing Proceeds, and (B) as a Unit credit, the Units of Commodities corresponding to such Non-Private Business Remarketing Proceeds.

(b) Another ledger (the “Private Business Sales Ledger”) shall include, (A) as dollar credits, Private Business Remarketing Proceeds, and (B) as a Unit credit, the Units of Commodities corresponding to such Private Business Remarketing Proceeds.

(c) The other two (2) ledgers shall be maintained as described in Section 9(a) of this Exhibit C.

(d) The credits to be recorded in the ledgers described in Section 7(a) and (b) of this Exhibit C (collectively, the “Ledger Entries”) shall be dated as of the first day of the Month prior to the Month in which Buyer or Project Participant receives the proceeds corresponding to such Ledger Entries.
<!-- Page 618 -->
(e) The four (4) ledgers described in Section 7 of this Exhibit C and all debits and credits to such ledgers shall be kept on an aggregate basis for purposes of this Exhibit C.

(f) Buyer shall provide to Seller all reports provided by a Project Participant pursuant to Section 7.5 of the applicable Commodity Supply Contract. To the extent set forth in Section 7.6(a) of the applicable Commodity Supply Contract, Seller will add “Disqualified Sale Proceeds” to the appropriate ledgers described above.

**Section 8. Remediation Remarketing and Bond Redemptions.**

(a) At any time that the net Ledger Entry balance of either the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger or the Private Business Sales Ledger is greater than zero (0):

(b) Buyer shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to utilize the proceeds represented by the dollar balances of such Ledger Entries to purchase Commodities for resale in Qualified Sales and shall promptly notify Seller following such purchase and sale.

(c) Seller shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to locate opportunities for Buyer to purchase Commodities to sell in Qualified Sales to remediate the proceeds represented by the dollar balances of the Ledger Entries. In this regard, if Seller locates a Remediation Remarketing opportunity, then

(i) Seller shall notify Buyer of such opportunity;

(ii) Buyer shall, upon receipt of such notice, purchase Commodities from Seller at a price determined by Seller in a Commercially Reasonable manner based upon applicable market prices at the location where the remarketing opportunity sale will occur (the “Remediation Remarketing Purchase Price”);

(iii) Seller shall remarket such Commodities on Buyer’s behalf in a Qualified Sale;

(iv) Seller shall remit to Buyer the proceeds collected from such Qualified Sale, but in no event shall Seller remit less than the Minimum Remarketing Sales Price for the remarketing transaction; provided, however, that to the extent Seller does not receive the Remediation Remarketing Purchase Price from Buyer prior to the Remediation Remarketing described herein, Seller shall credit the proceeds collected from such remarketing sale against the Remediation Remarketing Purchase Price owed to Seller, and Seller shall be reimbursed from the Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund to the extent necessary to make Seller whole for such Qualified Sale; and

(v) Seller shall issue to Buyer a confirmation notice (including the dollar price and Units) of each purchase of Commodities by or on behalf of Buyer, and each sale of Commodities on Buyer’s behalf, under this Section 8, and amounts due from or to Buyer shall be separately stated on the Billing Statement for the Month in which such remarketing transactions occur.

C-9
<!-- Page 619 -->
For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not sell, nor be required to sell, Commodities to Buyer for a Remediation Remarketing if such Commodities are to be remarketed by Seller on behalf of Buyer for less than the Minimum Remarketing Sales Price.

(d) Unless the terms of a Remediation Remarketing undertaken by Seller on Buyer’s behalf are specifically assumed by Buyer, Seller shall indemnify Buyer for any costs or liabilities associated with such Remediation Remarketing (other than costs related to the price at which such Commodities are sold and the risk of collecting the sale proceeds from the remarketing buyer), including, without limitation, any cover or replacement costs; termination payments; fees, penalties, costs or charges (in cash or in kind) assessed by any Transporter for failure to satisfy its balance or nomination requirements; Claims for breach of warranty; taxes, fees, levies, penalties, licenses or charges imposed by any Government Agency; and Claims from personal injury or property damages.

(e) The total purchase price of any Commodities purchased by Buyer or Seller pursuant to Section 8(c) of this Exhibit C will be entered by Seller as a dollar debit on (i) first, the Private Business Sales Ledger, if and to the extent such ledger has a positive balance and such Commodities are remarketed in a Qualified Sale and (ii) second, on the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger, if and to the extent such ledger has a positive balance, the Private Business Sales Ledger has a zero (0) balance, and such Commodities are remarketed in a Qualified Sale, with such debit in the case of (i) or (ii) dated as of the last day of the Month in which such Commodities were purchased. Each dollar debit shall offset and reverse an equal amount of the dollar credits to such ledger that had previously been entered to the expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger or the Expired Private Business Sales Ledger in the order in which they were made (beginning with the oldest credit not previously offset and reversed by any prior debit). Whenever a debit is made to the dollar balance of the Ledger Entries of either such ledger, Seller shall also debit the Commodities balance of the Ledger Entries of such ledger based on (i) such dollar debit divided by (ii) an average Commodities price calculated from the net Ledger Entry then present on the relevant ledger being debited. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger nor the Private Business Sales Ledger shall ever have a negative balance, and the same purchase transaction shall not result in a debit to more than one ledger except to the extent that a debit for the transaction causes one (1) ledger to have a zero (0) balance and the remaining portion of the permitted debit is made to the other ledger.

(f) In addition to the ability of Seller or Buyer to engage in Remediation Remarketing to reduce the balances of any Ledger Entries through Qualified Sales of the Commodity (either Gas or Electricity) that was originally remarketed the proceeds represented by the dollar balances of such Ledger Entries may also be remediated through the purchase of the other Commodity (either Electricity or Gas) that will be remarketed in Qualified Sales. If Seller locates an opportunity for Buyer to purchase the other Commodity for a Remediation Remarketing, the provisions of Section 8c shall apply to such opportunity provided that the entry of Unit debits shall be made as follows:

(i) To the extent the Ledger Entries for Units consist of MMBtus, for any Remediation Remarketing of Electricity, a quantity of MMBtus will be debited based on (i) the total proceeds paid for such Electricity divided by (ii) an average Gas price.
<!-- Page 620 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image) 

calculated from the net Ledger Entry balance then present on the relevant ledger being debited.

(ii) To the extent the Ledger Entries for Units consist of MWhs, for any Remediation Remarketing of Gas, a quantity of MWhs will be debited based on (i) the total proceeds paid for such Gas divided by (ii) an average Electricity price calculated from the net Ledger Entry balance then present on the relevant ledger being debited.

(g) In the event that (i) the Project Participant remediates the proceeds represented by the dollar balances of the Ledger Entries pursuant to Section 7.5 of the Commodity Supply Contract or (ii) Bonds are redeemed pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.6(c) of the Commodity Supply Contract and Section 4.01(b) of the Bond Indenture, the corresponding Ledger Entries then present on any ledger shall be debited.

(h) Upon the Switch Date, all Ledger Entries for Units consisting of MMBtus shall be converted to MWhs based on an average Gas price calculated from the net Ledger Entry balance then present on the relevant ledger being debited.

(a) In addition to the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger and the Private Business Sales Ledger described in Section 7(a) and (b) of this Exhibit C, above, Seller shall also maintain an “Expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger” and an “Expired Private Business Sales Ledger.” Whenever a credit to the dollar balance of the Ledger Entries of the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger has not been reversed in full within two (2) years of such credit by an offsetting dollar debit in accordance with Section 8(c) or (d) of this Exhibit C, then Seller shall (i) debit the remaining portion of such dollar credit and the Unit balance of the Ledger Entries in the manner described in the penultimate sentence of Section 8(c) and (ii) record such debits as credits to the Expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger. Similarly, whenever a credit to the dollar balance of the Ledger Entries of the Private Business Sales Ledger has not been reversed in full within two (2) years of such credit by an offsetting dollar debit in accordance with Section 8(c) or (d) of this Exhibit C, then Seller shall (i) debit the remaining portion of such dollar credit and the Unit balance of the Ledger Entries in the manner described in the penultimate sentence of Section 8(c) and (ii) record such debits as credits to the Expired Private Business Sales Ledger.

(b) No later than the tenth (10th) day of each Month, Seller shall provide to Buyer copies of the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger, the Private Business Sales Ledger, the Expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger and the Expired Private Business Sales Ledger showing all credits and debits to each such ledger since the Execution Date, in each case if a credit has been recorded in such ledger since the Execution Date.

(d) The occurrence of a Ledger Event and any remedies associated therewith in Article XVII of the Agreement shall be Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedies with respect to any inability by Seller to purchase and remarket Commodities for Buyer pursuant to, or any breach by Seller of its obligations under, this Exhibit C.

Section 10. Remarketing of Contract Quantities under Gas Assignment Agreement or PPA Assignment Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein but subject to the immediately following sentence of this Section 10, if (a) a quantity of Commodities less than (x) the Assigned Gas Quantity as defined in a Gas Assignment Agreement or (y) the Assigned Prepay Quantity as defined in a PPA Assignment Agreement is delivered or taken hereunder in any Month during an Assignment Period for any reason other than Force Majeure, then (i) Buyer will be deemed to have requested Seller to remarket the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered (regardless of whether a Remarketing Notice was delivered) and (ii) Seller shall sell such Commodities or cause such Commodities to be sold in a Private Business Sale at the Contract Specified Price minus the applicable Remarketing Fee. Seller shall pay Buyer for any such Month the product of (I) the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered, multiplied by (II) the Contract Specified Price minus the applicable Remarketing Fee, and such sales shall constitute a Private Business Sale and shall be reflected on the Private Business Sales Ledger.

Section 2.1 Reserved.

Section 2.2 Swap Deficiency Receivables. Prepay LLC shall have an option to purchase certain Swap Deficiency Receivables from Issuer as described in this Section 2.2. Issuer shall sell to Prepay LLC, and Prepay LLC shall purchase, certain Swap Deficiency Receivables under the following circumstances:

(a) If (i) the Project Participant defaults on its obligation to make any payment under the Commodity Supply Contract with Issuer and (ii) such payment default results in a Swap Payment Deficiency, then on the Business Day following the day on which such default occurs, Issuer shall deliver a written offer a “Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer”) in the form of Attachment 3 to this Exhibit to sell to Prepay LLC, at par, sufficient receivables (“Swap Deficiency Receivables”) (such amount, less any undisputed amounts owed by Issuer to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, the “Swap Deficiency Receivables Amount”) to fund the Swap Payment Deficiency. Such Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer shall identify the Project Participant and include aging information and the face amount of the corresponding Swap Deficiency Receivables.

(b) No later than the Business Day following Prepay LLC’s receipt of a Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer, Prepay LLC may, but shall be under no obligation to, elect to purchase the Swap Deficiency Receivables referenced in the Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer by delivering a written notice (a “Swap Deficiency Receivable Option Notice”) in the form of Attachment 4 to this Exhibit to Issuer and the Trustee of Prepay LLC’s intent to purchase such Swap Deficiency Receivables (collectively, the “Swap Deficiency Identified Receivables”). The Swap Deficiency Receivable Option Notice will specify a Purchase Date that will be no later than the Payment Date (as defined in the Confirmation to the Buyer Swap) for the month in which Prepay LLC receives the Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer.

Section 2.3 Elective Receivables. Prepay LLC shall have an option to purchase certain Elective Receivables from Issuer as described in this Section 2.3. Issuer shall sell to Prepay LLC, and Prepay LLC shall purchase, certain Elective Receivables under the following circumstances:

(a) To the extent the Project Participant defaults on its obligation to make any payment under the Commodity Supply Contract and such payment default does not result in a Swap Payment Deficiency, then on such Business Day, Issuer shall deliver a written offer (a “Elective Receivables Offer”) in the form of Attachment 5 to sell to Prepay LLC, at the receivables relating to such payment default (“Elective Receivables”) (such amount, less any undisputed amounts owed by Issuer to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, the “Elective Receivables Amount”). Such Elective Receivables Offer shall identify the Project Participant and include aging information and the face amount of the corresponding Elective Receivables.

(b) At any time after the receipt of an Elective Receivables Offer, Prepay LLC may, but shall be under no obligation to, elect to purchase the Elective Receivables referenced in the Elective Receivables Offer by delivering a written notice (an “Elective Receivable Option Notice”) in the form of Attachment 6 to this Exhibit to Issuer and the Trustee of Prepay LLC’s intent to purchase such Elective Receivables (collectively, the “Elective Identified Receivables”).

If any amounts are paid to Issuer or the Trustee by the Project Participant with respect to an Identified Receivable that has been sold in whole or in part to the Transferee under this Exhibit, Issuer shall promptly pay any such receipts to the Transferee without setoff of any kind.

The Transferee shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee and Issuer from and against and in respect of any and all claims, actions, demands, losses, costs, expenses, liabilities, penalties, and other damages, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and other costs and expenses reasonably incurred in investigating, and attempting to avoid, or in opposing the imposition thereof, resulting to the Trustee or Issuer from: (i) any inaccurate representation or warranty by the Transferee in this Exhibit; (ii) the breach or default in the performance by the Transferee of any of the obligations to be performed by the Transferee hereunder; or (iii) any non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement in this Exhibit on the part of the Transferee.

(d) Notice and Defense of Third-Party Claims. If any proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an indemnified party or any successor thereto (the “Indemnified Person”) in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Section 5.2 from an indemnifying person or any successor thereto (the “Indemnifying Person”), the Indemnified Person shall give written notice of such proceeding to the Indemnifying Person who shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Person and the payment of all expenses; provided, that any delay or failure so to notify the Indemnifying Person shall relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is prejudiced by such delay or failure. In no event shall the Indemnifying Person be required to make any expenditure or bring any cause of action to enforce the Indemnifying Person’s obligations and liability under and pursuant to the indemnities set forth in this Section 5.2. The Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any of the foregoing proceedings and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Person unless the Indemnified Person shall in good faith determine that there exist actual or potential conflicts of interest which make representation by the same counsel inappropriate. In the event that the Indemnifying Person, within five days after notice of any such proceeding, fails to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to undertake the defense, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to assume the defense of such proceeding with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Person at any time prior to the settlement, compromise or final determination thereof. Anything in this Section 5.2 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Indemnifying Person shall not, without the Indemnified Person’s prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, settle or compromise any proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any proceeding; provided that the Indemnifying Person may, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any proceeding for the payment of money with no other liability and no admission of responsibility.

(e) Survival. The indemnifications included in this Exhibit shall survive termination of the Agreement.

Section 5.3 Modification of Bond Indenture. Issuer agrees and covenants that, as long as this Agreement is in effect, it shall not amend or consent to the amendment of any

provision of the Bond Indenture (including without limitation Article V of the Bond Indenture) that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the effectiveness of this Exhibit or the transactions contemplated by this Exhibit without the prior written consent of the Transferee, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

Section 5.4 Non-Severability; Miscellaneous. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the parties pursuant to this Exhibit are an integral part of this Agreement and may not be severed from such agreement in any way whatsoever, whether by transfer, assignment or otherwise.

Section 5.5 Certain Terms Relating to the Trustee.

(a) The Trustee shall have no duties or obligations under or in respect of this Exhibit other than those specifically enumerated in this Exhibit and the Trustee has assumed no implied duties hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, nothing herein shall be construed to impose upon the Trustee any duties, obligations or liabilities of Issuer, or to make the Trustee responsible for the actions or omissions of Issuer.

(b) In taking any action (or forbearing from action) under or pursuant to this Exhibit, and with respect to all matters arising under this Exhibit, the Trustee shall have the rights, powers, indemnities and other protections granted or made available to it under the terms of the Bond Indenture.

(c) The Trustee has acted solely in its capacity as Trustee under the Bond Indenture in accepting certain responsibilities set forth in this Exhibit. Notwithstanding any term herein or elsewhere to the contrary, and for the avoidance of doubt, any obligation hereunder on the part of the Trustee to sell Receivables shall be limited to such rights, title and interests in such applicable Receivables as it may hold under the Bond Indenture, and any obligation hereunder on the part of the Trustee to purchase Receivables shall be limited to such funds as may be held by it under, and available for such purpose under the terms of, the Bond Indenture; and in each such case any recourse hereunder against the Trustee with respect to such Receivables or such obligation to sell or purchase Receivables shall be limited to such rights, title and interests in the applicable Receivables, or such funds available for the purchase thereof, as the case may be, as it may hold in its capacity as Trustee under the Bond Indenture.

(d) Notwithstanding any term hereof to the contrary and for the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged and agreed that the Trustee shall have the authority to take such actions as it may deem necessary under this Exhibit as agent and on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to and as provided in the Bond Indenture (subject to the rights retained by the Issuer thereunder, in the absence of conflicting actions by the Trustee, to exercise its rights hereunder), including without limitation the right of the Trustee upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Bond Indenture to notify the Issuer to cease exercising its rights hereunder.

Any invocation of Force Majeure by Prepay LLC under the Prepaid Agreement shall constitute Force Majeure under this Agreement. Force Majeure shall not be based on (i) the loss of Purchaser’s markets; (ii) Purchaser’s inability economically to use or resell the Commodities purchased hereunder; (iii) the loss or failure of Issuer’s supply except if such loss or failure results from curtailment by a Transmission Provider; or (iv) Issuer’s ability to sell the Commodities at a higher price. Neither Party may raise a claim of Force Majeure based in whole or in part on curtailment by a Transmission Provider unless (i) such Party has contracted for firm transmission with such Transmission Provider for the Commodities to be delivered to or received at the Delivery Point and (ii) such curtailment is due to “force majeure” or “uncontrollable force” or a similar term as defined under the Transmission Provider’s tariff; provided, however, that existence of the foregoing factors shall not be sufficient to conclusively or presumptively prove the existence of Force Majeure absent a showing of other facts and circumstances which in the aggregate with such factors establish that Force Majeure as defined in the first sentence of this sub-paragraph (b) has occurred. In addition to the foregoing and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that a PPA Assignment Agreement is terminated early, such termination shall constitute Force Majeure with respect to Issuer hereunder until the end of the first Month following the Month in which such early termination occurs.

The Parties shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts required by the Critical Notice within the time prescribed by the applicable Transporter. Each Party shall, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 18.1, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party from any Claims associated with any Critical Notice (i) of which the indemnifying Party failed to give the indemnified Party the notice required under this Agreement or (ii) under which the indemnifying Party failed to take the action required by the Critical Notice within the time prescribed; provided that the notice from the indemnified Party was timely delivered.

Issuer shall arrange and be responsible for transmission service of Hourly Quantity to the Delivery Point and shall Schedule or arrange for Scheduling services with its Transmission Providers, to deliver Electricity to the Delivery Point. Purchaser shall arrange and be responsible for transmission service at and from the Delivery Point and shall Schedule or arrange for Scheduling services with its Transmission Providers to receive Electricity at the Delivery Point.

Section 5.3 Title and Risk of Loss.

(a) Title to Commodities delivered under this Agreement and risk of loss shall pass from Issuer to Purchaser at the Delivery Point; provided that the transfer of title and risk of loss for all Assigned Gas and Assigned Electricity shall be in accordance with the applicable Gas Assignment Agreement or PPA Assignment Agreement while any such assignment agreement is in effect; provided furthermore that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no indemnity obligations shall apply as between the Parties with respect to any Assigned Product or Assigned Gas (as defined in a Gas Assignment Agreement).

(b) With respect to Gas, as between the Parties, Issuer shall be deemed to be in exclusive control and possession of the Gas delivered under this Agreement, and responsible for any damage or injury caused thereby, prior to the time such Gas has been delivered to Purchaser at the Delivery Point. After delivery of Gas to Purchaser at the Delivery Point, Purchaser shall be deemed to be in exclusive control and possession thereof and responsible for any injury or damage caused thereby. Each Party (each, an “Indemnifying Party”) assumes all liability for and, subject to the provisions of Section 18.1, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party from any Claims, including death of Persons, arising from any act or incident occurring when title to Gas is vested in the Indemnifying Party.

**Period at each Delivery Point in accordance with standard Firm service requirements of the Receiving Transporter and Delivering Transporter at such Delivery Point, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, neither Party in any case shall be obligated to incur additional costs by procuring additional services, running imbalances or taking any other actions to accommodate non-standard scheduling requirements of the other Party.**

### Section 5.5 Imbalances
The Parties shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to avoid the imposition of any Imbalance Charges. If Purchaser or Issuer receives an invoice from a Transporter that includes Imbalance Charges related to the obligations of either Party under this Agreement, the Parties shall determine the validity as well as the cause of such Imbalance Charges. If the Imbalance Charges were incurred as a result of Purchaser’s taking of quantities of Gas greater than or less than the Contract Quantity at any Delivery Point, then Purchaser shall pay for such Imbalance Charges or reimburse Issuer for such Imbalance Charges paid by Issuer. If the Imbalance Charges were incurred as a result of Issuer’s delivery of quantities of Gas greater than or less than the Contract Quantities at any Delivery Point, then Issuer shall pay for such Imbalance Charges or reimburse Purchaser for such Imbalance Charges paid by Purchaser. Additionally, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5, Issuer shall have no liability for Imbalance Charges in respect of any Gas required to be scheduled or delivered under an Upstream Supply Contract (as defined in the Prepaid Agreement).

### Section 5.6 Communications Protocol
Purchaser and Issuer shall comply with the communications protocols set forth in Exhibit G-1 for Gas deliveries and Exhibit G-2 for Electricity deliveries; provided that, for any Gas delivery in which a Gas Assignment Agreement or a PPA Assignment Agreement is in effect, Scheduling shall be in accordance with the applicable assignment agreement.

### Section 5.7 Gas Quality and Measurement
Purchaser shall not be required to accept Gas delivered by Issuer that does not meet the pressure, quality and heat content requirements of the Receiving Transporter as detailed in the applicable pipeline tariff. Purchaser’s sole and exclusive remedy against Issuer with respect to any Gas that fails to meet such pressure, quality and heat content requirements shall be the right to reject such non-conforming Gas and to receive payment under Article IV. If such rejected Gas meets the pressure, quality and heat content requirements of the Delivering Transporter, but does not meet such requirements of the Receiving Transporter, any such rejection by Purchaser and failure to deliver by Issuer shall be deemed to be excused by Force Majeure. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Article XI shall apply to any such event of Force Majeure. If such rejected Gas does not meet such requirements of either the Receiving Transporter or the Delivering Transporter, Issuer shall be deemed to have failed to deliver any such Gas that is properly rejected. With respect to any measurement of Gas delivered or received under this Agreement at any Delivery Point, the measurement of such Gas (including the definition of Btu used in making such measurement) by the operator of such Delivery Point shall be deemed to be conclusive; provided, however, if the operator of such Delivery Point revises its measurement statements for Gas, such revision shall be effective as the measurement of Gas for the purposes of this Agreement and may be corrected pursuant to Section 14.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but without prejudice to any right of Project Participant to reject Assigned Gas under and as defined in a Gas Assignment Agreement, measurement of Assigned Gas shall be as set forth in the applicable Upstream Supply Contract and Issuer shall not have any liability for the failure of any Assigned Gas to meet any applicable quality requirements.

ARTICLE VII  
USE OF COMMODITIES

Section 7.1 Tax Exempt Status of the Bonds. Purchaser acknowledges that the Bonds will be issued with the intention that the interest thereon will be exempt from federal taxes under Section 103 of the Code. Accordingly, Purchaser agrees that it will (a) provide such information with respect to its utility system as may be requested by Issuer in order to establish the tax-exempt status of the Bonds, and (b) act in accordance with such written instructions as Issuer may provide from time to time in order to maintain the tax-exempt status of the Bonds.

Purchaser agrees to take the Contract Quantities to be delivered under this Agreement (a) in priority over and in preference to all other Commodities available to Purchaser that are not Priority Commodities; and (b) on at least a pari passu and non-discriminatory basis with other Priority Commodities.

Section 7.3 Assistance with Sales to Third Parties. If, notwithstanding Purchaser’s compliance with Section 7.1, Purchaser does not require or is unable to receive all or any portion of the Contract Quantity that it is obligated to purchase under this Agreement as a result of (i) decreased Gas requirements due to reduced generation requirements during the Gas Delivery Period, (ii) decreased demand by Purchaser’s retail customers or (iii) a change in Law, Issuer shall, upon reasonable notice from Purchaser, issue a remarketing notice in the form attached to Exhibit G-1 or Exhibit G-2, as applicable, use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, to the extent permitted in the Prepaid Agreement, to arrange for the sale of such quantities by Prepay LLC (A) to another.

Purchaser shall remain obligated to pay Issuer the Contract Price for any portion of the Contract Quantity for which it requests remarketing pursuant to this Section 7.3, provided that, if Issuer succeeds in arranging such a sale by Prepay LLC, Issuer shall credit against the amount owed by Purchaser for such Contract Quantities the amount received by Issuer from Prepay LLC for such sales less all directly incurred costs or expenses, including but not limited to remarketing administrative charges paid to Prepay LLC under the Prepaid Agreement, but in no event shall the amount of such credit be more than the Contract Price.

### Section 7.4 Qualifying Use
Without limiting Purchaser’s other obligations under this Article VII, Purchaser agrees that, subject to Section 7.5, it will use all of the Commodities purchased under this Agreement in compliance with the Qualifying Use Requirements. Purchaser agrees that it will provide such additional information, records and certificates as Issuer may reasonably request to confirm Purchaser’s compliance with this Section 7.4.

### Section 7.5 Remediation
The Parties acknowledge that Purchaser may at times need to remarket, or inadvertently remarket, Commodities received hereunder in a manner that does not comply with Qualifying Use Requirements due to daily and hourly fluctuations in Purchaser’s Commodity needs. To the extent Purchaser does so, Purchaser shall (a) exercise commercially Reasonable Efforts to use any Disqualified Sale Proceeds of such remarketing to purchase Commodities (other than Prior Commodities) that Purchaser uses in compliance with Qualifying Use Requirements and (b) reserve funds in an amount equal to any Disqualified Sale Proceeds until such Disqualified Sale Proceeds are remediated or transferred to the Trustee pursuant to Section 7.6(c) below.

### Section 7.6 Semi-Annual Report: Ledger Entries; Redemption
(a) To track compliance with the requirements of Section 7.5, Purchaser will provide a semi-annual report to Issuer (delivered not later than the fifteenth (15th) day of each April and October until the end of the Delivery Period) showing the following (each a “Semi-Annual Report”): the total quantity of proceeds from sales of Commodities received hereunder that (i) were sold by Purchaser to any Person other than a Municipal Utility and (ii) have not been remediated by Purchaser by applying such proceeds to purchase Gas or Electricity that is used in compliance with the Qualifying Use Requirements (such portion as units, “Disqualified Sale Units” and such portion as value received, “Disqualified Sale Proceeds”);

(b) Issuer will cause such unremediated Disqualified Sale Proceeds and the associated Disqualified Sale Units to be added to the appropriate remarketing ledgers maintained by Prepay LLC under the Prepaid Agreement, with the ledgers entries dated as of the end of the first month of the relevant six (6) Month period; and

(c) Purchaser shall transfer (to the extent such unremediated Disqualified Sale Proceeds and associated Disqualified Sale Units remain reflected on the appropriate remarketing ledgers under Section 7.6(a) at the time such transfer is required by this Section 7.6(c)) any such unremediated Disqualified Sale Proceeds and any other required funds (i.e., all additional funds)

(b) No later than the 12th day of each Month during the Delivery Period (excluding the first Month of the Delivery Period) and the first Month following the end of the Delivery Period (the “Billing Date”), Issuer shall deliver a statement (a “Billing Statement”) to Purchaser indicating (i) the total amount due to Issuer for Commodities delivered in the prior Month, (ii) any other amounts due to Issuer or Purchaser in connection with this Agreement with respect to the prior Month(s), and (iii) the net amount due to Issuer or Purchaser. If the actual quantity delivered is not known by the Billing Date, Issuer may provisionally prepare a Billing Statement based on Issuer’s best available knowledge of the quantity of Commodities delivered, which shall not exceed the sum of the Contract Quantity of all the Gas Days or Hours (as applicable) in such Month plus any make-up quantities delivered during such Month. The invoiced quantity and amounts paid thereon (with interest calculated on the amount overpaid or underpaid by Purchaser at the Default Rate) will then be adjusted on the following Month’s Billing Statement, as actual delivery information becomes available based on the actual quantity delivered.

(c) Upon request by either Party, the other Party shall deliver such supporting documentation of the foregoing as such requesting Party may reasonably request.

Section 14.2 Payment.

<!-- Page 690 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

**Section 14.3 Payment of Disputed Amounts.** If Purchaser disputes any amounts included in Issuer’s Billing Statement, Purchaser shall (except in the case of manifest error) nonetheless pay any amount required by the Billing Statement in accordance with Section 14.2 without regard to any right of set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or other defenses to payment that Purchaser may have; provided, however, that Purchaser shall have the right, after payment, to dispute any amounts included in a Billing Statement or otherwise used to calculate amounts due under Section 14.5. If Issuer disputes any amounts included in the Purchaser’s Statement, Issuer may withhold payment to the extent of the disputed amount; provided, however, that interest shall be due at the Default Rate for any withheld amount later found to have been properly due.

**Section 14.4 Late Payment.** If Purchaser fails to remit the full amount payable within one Business Day of when due, interest on the unpaid portion shall accrue from the date due until the date of payment at the Default Rate.

**Section 14.5 Audit; Adjustments.**

(a) A Party shall have the right, at its own expense, upon reasonable notice to the other Party and at reasonable times, to examine and audit and to obtain copies of the relevant portion of the books, records, and telephone recordings of the other Party to the extent reasonably necessary, but only to such extent, to verify the accuracy of any statement, charge, payment, or computation made under this Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any such examination and audit reveals any material discrepancy in the other Party’s books and records, the examining Party shall have a right to be reimbursed by the other Party for costs reasonably incurred in connection with such examination and audit. This right to examine, audit, and obtain copies shall not be available with respect to proprietary information not directly relevant to transactions under this Agreement.

(b) Each Purchaser’s Statement and each Billing Statement shall be conclusively presumed final and accurate and all associated claims for under- or overpayments shall be deemed waived unless such Purchaser’s Statement or Billing Statement is objected to in.

writing, with adequate explanation and/or documentation, within two (2) years after the applicable Month of Commodity delivery.

(c) All retroactive adjustments shall be paid in full by the Party owing payment within 30 days of notice and substantiation of such inaccuracy. If the Parties are unable to agree upon any retroactive adjustments requested by either Party within the time period specified in Section 14.5(b), then either Party may pursue any remedies available with respect to such adjustments at law or in equity. Retroactive adjustments for payments made based on incorrect Billing Statement(s) shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date such payment was made.

Section 14.6 Netting: No Set-Off. The Parties shall net all amounts due and owing, including any past due amounts (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include any accrued interest), arising under this Agreement such that the Party owing the greater amount shall make a single payment of the net amount to the other Party in accordance with this Article XIV. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment for all amounts set forth in a Billing Statement provided to Purchaser shall be made without set-off or counterclaim of any kind.

Section 14.7 Source of Purchaser’s Payments. Purchaser covenants and agrees to make payments due hereunder from Utility Revenues, and only from such Utility Revenues, as an operating expense of its utility system or an Energy Payment (as defined in Section 14.9); provided, however, that Purchaser may apply any legally available monies to the payment of amounts due hereunder.

Section 14.8 Rate Covenant. Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees that it will establish, fix, prescribe, maintain, and collect rates, fees, and charges from the customers of its utility system so as to provide Utility Revenues sufficient to enable Purchaser to pay any other amounts legally payable from Utility Revenues, and to maintain any required reserves for Purchaser’s utility system. Purchaser further covenants and agrees that it shall not furnish or supply services free of charge to any Person, except any such service free of charge that Purchaser is supplying on the date hereof as has been specifically identified by Purchaser to Issuer in writing, and it shall promptly enforce the payment of any and all accounts owing to Purchaser for the sale of Commodities or the provision of distribution or other services to its customers. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall not be obligated to make any payments hereunder except from Utility Revenues.

Section 14.9 Pledge of Utility Revenues. Purchaser shall not grant any lien on or security interest in, or otherwise pledge or encumber, the Utility Revenues if the terms or effect of such lien, pledge or other encumbrance results in such lien, pledge or other encumbrance having priority over the obligations of Purchaser to pay the Contract Price for its Contract Quantities hereunder, which obligations constitute operating expenses or Energy Payments (as such term is defined in Purchaser’s Resolution No. 6649, adopted January 7, 1971, as amended and supplemented through May 18, 2024) of Purchaser.

**Section 15.1 Generally.** From time to time, Purchaser may be a party to one or more power purchase agreements other than this Agreement (each such agreement, an “Assignable Contract”) pursuant to which Purchaser is purchasing Electricity, RECs and other products that may be assigned pursuant to Exhibit H. In accordance with this Article XV and Exhibit H, Purchaser may assign, and pursuant to Section 15.1 of the Prepaid Agreement, Issuer shall request that J. Aron accept the assignment of a portion of Purchaser’s rights and obligations under such Assignable Contract (the “Assigned Rights and Obligations”), and J. Aron, to the extent it accepts such assignment, will deliver Assigned Product it receives from such Assigned Rights and Obligations to Issuer under the Prepaid Agreement, and Issuer will deliver such Assigned Product to Purchaser under this Agreement; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any such assignment shall constitute a partial assignment and delegation. Any such assignments must be proposed and agreed pursuant to Exhibit H and the Prepaid Agreement. To the extent so assigned, Issuer’s obligation to deliver, and Purchaser’s obligation to receive, the Hourly Quantity shall be reduced in accordance with Exhibit H to reflect the Assigned Product acquired by Issuer pursuant to such assignment.

**Section 15.2 Early Termination of Assignment Period.** Except for any Assignment Period that terminates contemporaneously with this Agreement, upon termination for any reason of the Assignment Period for any PPA Assignment Agreement, all reductions that have been made under Exhibit H to the Hourly Quantity shall be increased for all future periods to reverse any reductions to the Hourly Quantity made in connection with such PPA Assignment Agreement.

**Proposed by a Party (to the extent that any waiver in Section 18.16(b) below is unenforceable or ineffective as to such Party), a non-party or FERC acting sua sponte, shall solely be the "public interest" application of the "just and reasonable" standard of review set forth in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332 (1956) and Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U.S. 348 (1956) and clarified by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish, 554 U.S. 527 (2008).**

(b) In addition, and notwithstanding Section 18.16(a), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Party, for itself and its successors and assigns, hereby expressly and irrevocably waives any rights it can or may have, now or in the future, under Section 205 and/or 206 of the Federal Power Act or otherwise, to seek to obtain from FERC by any means, directly or indirectly (through complaint, investigation or otherwise), and each hereby covenants and agrees not at any time to seek to obtain, an order from FERC changing any section of this Agreement specifying the rate, charge, classification, or other term or condition agreed to by the Parties, it being the express intent of the Parties that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, neither Party shall unilaterally seek to obtain from FERC any relief changing the rate, charge, classification, or other term or condition of this Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent changes in applicable Law or market conditions that may occur. In the event it were to be determined that applicable Law precludes the Parties from waiving their rights to seek changes from FERC to their market-based power sales contracts (including entering into covenants not to do so) then this Section 18.16(b) shall not apply; provided that, consistent with Section 18.16(a), neither Party shall seek any such changes except solely under the "public interest" application of the "just and reasonable" standard of review and otherwise as set forth in Section 18.16(a).

**IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Amended & Restated Commodity Supply Contract to be duly executed and delivered by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the date first above written.**

[___], 2024

This Federal Tax Certificate is executed in connection with the Amended & Restated Commodity Supply Contract dated as of [___], 2024 (the “Supply Contract”), by and between Northern California Energy Authority (“Issuer”) and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“Purchaser”). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Supply Contract, in the Tax Certificate and Agreement, or in the Bond Indenture.

WHEREAS Purchaser acknowledges that Issuer is issuing the Bonds to fund the prepayment price under the Prepaid Agreement; and

WHEREAS the Bonds are intended to qualify for tax exemption under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and

WHEREAS Purchaser’s use of Commodities acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract and certain funds and accounts of Purchaser will affect the Bonds’ qualification for such tax exemption.

NOW, THEREFORE, PURCHASER HEREBY CERTIFIES AS FOLLOWS:

1. Purchaser is a municipal utility district created and existing pursuant to the provisions of organized under the provisions of the Municipal Utility District Act (Division 6, Chapter 2, Articles 2 and 3, Sections 11581 through 11614 of the California Public Utilities Code, as amended).

2. Purchaser will resell Electricity acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract and use all Gas acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract to generate Electricity that is resold, in each case, to its retail Electricity customers within its service area, with retail sales in all cases being made pursuant to regularly established and generally applicable tariffs or under authorized requirements contracts. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the term “service area” means (x) the area throughout which Purchaser provided Electricity transmission or distribution service at all times during the 5-year period ending on [December 31, 2023], and from then until the date of issuance of the Bonds (the “Closing Date”), and (y) any area recognized as the service area of Purchaser under state or federal law.

3. The annual average amount during the testing period of Gas purchased (other than for resale) used by Purchaser to generate Electricity that is purchased (other than for resale) by customers of Purchaser who are located within the service area of Purchaser is [______] MMBtu. The maximum annual amount of Gas in any year being acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract is [______] MMBtu. The annual average amount of Gas that Purchaser holds in storage as of the Closing Date is [______] MMBtu. The annual average amount of Gas that Purchaser otherwise has a right to acquire as of the Closing Date is [______] MMBtu. The sum of (a) the maximum amount of Gas in any year being acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract, (b) the annual average amount of Gas which Purchaser holds in storage, and (c) the amount of Gas which Purchaser otherwise has a right to acquire in the year described in the foregoing clause (a) is D-1.
<!-- Page 706 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
[_____] MMBtu. Accordingly, the amount of Gas to be acquired under the Supply Contract by Purchaser, supplemented by the amount of Gas otherwise available to Purchaser as of the Closing Date, during any year does not exceed the sum of (i) [__]% of the annual average amount during the testing period of Gas purchased to generate Electricity that is purchased (other than for resale) by customers of Purchaser who are located within the service area of Purchaser; and (ii) the amount of Gas to be used to transport the prepaid Gas to Purchaser during such year. For purposes of this paragraph 3, the term "testing period" means the 5 calendar years ending [December 31, 2023], and the term "service area" means (x) the area throughout which Purchaser provided Gas distribution service at all times during the testing period, (y) any area within a county contiguous to the area described in (x) in which retail customers of Purchaser are located if such area is not also served by another utility providing Gas services, and (z) any area recognized as the service area of Purchaser under state or federal law.

4. Purchaser expects to pay for Gas acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract solely from funds derived from its Electricity distribution operations. Purchaser expects to use current net revenues of its to pay for current Gas acquisitions. There are no funds or accounts of Purchaser or any person who is a Related Person to Purchaser in which monies are invested and which are reasonably expected to be used to pay for Gas acquired more than one year after it is acquired. No portion of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used directly or indirectly to replace funds of Purchaser or any persons who are Related Persons to Purchaser that are or were intended to be used for the purpose for which the Bonds were issued.

5. The authorization, execution and delivery of the Supply Contract and compliance with the provisions thereof (a) will not conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default under, (i) any instrument relating to the organization, existence or operation of Purchaser, (ii) any ruling, regulation, ordinance, judgment, order or decree to which Purchaser (or any of its officers in their respective capacities as such) is subject or (iii) any provision of the laws of the State relating to Purchaser and its affairs, and (b) to our knowledge will not result in, or require the creation or imposition of, any lien on any of the properties or revenues of Purchaser pursuant to any of the foregoing.

4.1.1 Prior to each Month during which Gas is required to be delivered under the Prepaid Agreement, the Receipt Scheduling Entity shall deliver an operational nomination in writing in a form substantially similar to  
G-1-2
<!-- Page 713 -->
![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

Attachment 2 (the “Operational Nomination”) to each other Relevant Party no later than 8:30 am CPT on the second Business Day prior to the last day of exchange trading for Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange (or any successor thereto) for deliveries in such Month. The Operational Nomination shall be delivered electronically to the notice addresses set forth on Attachment 1.

4.1.2 The Delivery Scheduling Entity shall update appropriate nomination details on the relevant Receipt Scheduling Entity’s Operational Nomination and forward to all other Relevant Parties by the close of the Business Day prior to nominations leaving control of the nominating Scheduling Entity for the first timely nomination cycle for the Transporters at the Delivery Points for deliveries in each Month in which Gas is to be delivered.

4.1.4 The Scheduling Entities acknowledge and understand that changes to Operational Nomination details may occur after the deadline set forth in Section 4.1.1. The Scheduling Entity initiating the change will forward a revised Operational Nomination to the other Scheduling Entity (with a copy to each other Relevant Party) and the other Scheduling Entity will exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to accommodate such change(s).

The designation of Alternate Delivery Point(s) by

G-1-3
<!-- Page 714 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

**4.2.2** Each Scheduling Entity shall notify the other Relevant Parties as soon as practicable in the event of: (i) any deficiencies in scheduling related to such Scheduling Entity or such Scheduling Entity’s Transporter; (ii) any deficiencies in scheduling related to the other such Scheduling Entity or such other Scheduling Entity’s Transporter of which the notifying Scheduling Entity becomes aware; and (iii) any action taken by such Scheduling Entity’s Transporter that would reasonably be expected to create issues related to Gas flow under the Prepaid Agreement.

**5. ACCESS AND INFORMATION**

**5.1** The Relevant Parties agree to provide relevant records from Transporters and any other Relevant Transporters necessary to document and verify Gas flows within and after the Month as needed to facilitate settlement under the Gas Contracts.

**5.2** Each Relevant Party acknowledges that the Scheduling Entities may not have immediate access to Gas flow information at the Delivery Points. Therefore, the Scheduling Entities will closely monitor the available nomination information at the Delivery Points and promptly notify each other upon obtaining knowledge of any discrepancies in such nomination information and the quantities required to be delivered and taken under the applicable Gas Contracts at the Delivery Points. Each Relevant Party acknowledges and agrees that the inability of a Relevant Party to immediately access Gas flow information at the Delivery Points shall not impact or be construed as a waiver of any of the rights and obligations of the Relevant Parties set forth in the applicable Gas Contract.

**5.3** Each Scheduling Entity will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with J. Aron to ensure that J. Aron has sufficient agency rights from each such Scheduling Entity with respect to each Transporter to allow J. Aron to view Gas flows at the Delivery Points.

**6. NOTICES**  
Any notice, demand, request or other communication required or authorized by this Communications Protocol to be given by one Relevant Party to another Relevant Party shall be in writing, except as otherwise expressly provided herein.

or (iii) when actually received if delivered by courier or personal delivery (including overnight delivery service). Each Relevant Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the other Relevant Parties, to change its address at any time, and to designate that copies of all such notices be directed to another Person at another address. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Relevant Party may at any time notify the others that any notice, demand, request or communication to it must be provided by email transmission for a specified period of time or until further notice, and any communications delivered by means other than email transmission during such time shall be ineffective.

7. NO IMPACT ON CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  
Except as expressly set forth herein or in an applicable Gas Contract, nothing in this Communications Protocol nor any Relevant Party’s actions or inactions hereunder shall have any impact on any Relevant Party’s rights or obligations under the Gas Contracts.

8. UPSTREAM SUPPLY CONTRACT  
8.1 J. Aron and Participant may designate a contract as an “Upstream Supply Contract” by entering into an Assignment Agreement (as defined below) and notifying the other Relevant Parties of the execution of such Assignment Agreement; provided that (i) any such Upstream Supply Contract must include this Communications Protocol, (ii) any Upstream Supplier thereunder must be contract-enabled with J. Aron; (iii) any Upstream Supplier thereunder must be able to satisfy J. Aron’s internal requirements that are necessary to “know your customer” rules, policies and procedures, anti-money laundering rules and regulations, Dodd-Frank Act, Commodity Exchange Act, PATRIOT Act and similar rules, regulations, requirements and corresponding policies; (iv) any Upstream Supply Contract must have a delivery period of a minimum of two years; (v) any such Upstream Supplier, Participant and J. Aron must enter into a Limited Assignment Agreement substantially in the form of Attachment 4 (an “Assignment Agreement”); and (vi) an Affiliate of Participant may only act as an Upstream Supplier (a) to the extent that it is acting as a replacement supplier due to the early termination of an Upstream Supply Contract and (b) for the remaining term for deliveries under such terminated Upstream Supply Contract. An “Upstream Supplier” is the seller of Gas to J. Aron under any Upstream Supply Contract.

8.2 Not later than 180 days prior to the expiration of any Upstream Supply Contract or immediately upon the early termination of any Upstream Supply Contract, J. Aron and Participant will begin to cooperate in good faith and exercise commercially reasonable efforts to locate a replacement Upstream Supply Contract. J. Aron agrees that it will not unreasonably delay or withhold its consent to any Upstream Supply Contract proposed by Participant, provided that it shall not be unreasonable for J. Aron to withhold its consent if the proposed Upstream Supply Contract or Upstream Supplier thereunder (i) fails to satisfy the requirements set forth in Section 8.1 above or (ii) poses materially different risks to J. Aron or the other Relevant Parties (other than Participant) relative to the Upstream Supply Contract and Upstream Supplier that is being replaced (without regard to any adverse changes relating to the Upstream Supplier being replaced that arose after such).  

G-1-5

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

8.3 If the Assigned Contract Price (as defined in any Assignment Agreement) is a fixed price, the Contract Quantity for each Gas Day under the Commodity Supply Contract (and the portion of the Contract Quantity associated therewith under the Prepaid Agreement and the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement) shall equal the (i) Contract Quantity for each Gas Day of the applicable Assignment Period (as defined in the relevant Assignment Agreement) multiplied by (ii) the result of (A) the relevant Assigned Contract Price, divided by (B) [NOTE: To list the result of the following formula as determined at pricing: Front End Fixed Price + (Active Swap Fee – Standby Swap Fee).]. For the avoidance of doubt, such updates to the Contract Quantities shall only apply for the relevant Assignment Period, and, in the event of an early termination of any such Assignment Period, such adjusted Contract Quantities shall be reversed effective as of the first day of the second Month following the Month in which such early termination occurs.

8.4 The declaration of “Force Majeure” by an Upstream Supplier under an Upstream Supply Contract shall be deemed Force Majeure for purposes of each of the Gas Contracts.

# EXHIBIT H
## ASSIGNMENT OF ASSIGNABLE CONTRACTS

1. **General Requirements.**

   1.1. During the Electricity Delivery Period, Assigned Rights and Obligations under a Assignable Contract may only be assigned under this Exhibit H if the following requirements are satisfied:

   1.1.1. The seller under such Assignable Contract (the “APC Party”) either (i) has a long-term senior unsecured credit rating that is “Baa3” or higher from Moody’s Investor’s Service, Inc. (or any successor to its credit rating service operation), “BBB-” or higher from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (or any successor to its credit rating service operation) or “A” or higher from Fitch Ratings, Inc. (or any successor to its credit rating service operation), (ii) provides alternative credit support that is reasonably satisfactory to J. Aron or (iii) otherwise provides evidence of its creditworthiness that is reasonably satisfactory to J. Aron;

   1.1.2. The APC Party can satisfy J. Aron’s internal requirements as they relate to “know your customer” rules, policies and procedures, anti-money laundering rules and regulations, Dodd-Frank Act, Commodity Exchange Act, Patriot Act and similar rules, regulations, requirements and corresponding policies;

   1.1.3. The APC Party is organized in the United States and in a jurisdiction that does not present material and adverse tax consequences to J. Aron or Issuer in connection with such proposed assignment, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Issuer shall have an obligation to reimburse J. Aron for any adverse tax consequences that are not material;

   1.1.4. The Applicable Project (as defined below) is reasonably expected to be able to generate the P99 Generation (as defined below), as agreed by Purchaser and J. Aron; provided that, if Purchaser and J. Aron are unable to reach agreement after good faith discussions, then J. Aron shall make such determination in its sole discretion.

   1.1.5. J. Aron, Purchaser, and Issuer have agreed on and executed an Assignment Schedule for such assignment;

   1.1.6. J. Aron, Purchaser, Issuer, and the applicable APC Party have agreed on and executed an Assignment Agreement for such assignment;

   1.1.7. Any such Assignable Contract must terminate on or before the end of the Electricity Delivery Period; and

H-1
<!-- Page 749 -->
1.1.8. The contract price (in $/MWh) payable by Purchaser under the applicable Assignable Contract (the “APC Contract Price”) is a fixed price unless Issuer, Purchaser and J. Aron agree, each in their sole discretion, to appropriate changes to the relevant documents to accommodate a floating APC Contract Price. For purposes of this Exhibit H, a “fixed price” shall be deemed to include any price that is fixed but for a periodic escalation (whether pre-determined or by reference to a price index).

2. Proposed Assignment. Purchaser may propose an assignment under Article XV of the Commodity Supply Contract by delivering the following items to Issuer and to J. Aron:

2.1. A written notice of the proposed assignment signed by Purchaser;

2.2. A true and complete copy of the Assignable Contract under which such Assigned Rights and Obligations would arise;

2.3. Evidence reasonably satisfactory to Issuer and J. Aron that all authorizations, consents, approvals, licenses, rulings, permits, exemptions, variances, orders, judgments, decrees, declarations of or regulations by any Government Agency necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Assignable Contract and the assignment of the Assignable Contract to J. Aron have been obtained and are in full force and effect;

2.4. For any Assignable Contract to be assigned during the Electricity Delivery Period, a description and information regarding the applicable project to which the Assignable Contract applies (the “Applicable Project”), including but not limited to information on the location, interconnection(s), and operating history of Applicable Project;

2.5. For any Assignable Contract to be assigned during the Electricity Delivery Period, Purchaser shall deliver monthly historical generation and meteorological data of the Applicable Project dating back to the commercial operation date and, if readily available, a report from a nationally recognized consultant in the energy industry that is reasonably acceptable to Issuer and J. Aron showing the “P99” forecasted generation (“P99 Generation”); and

2.6. Such additional information as Issuer and J. Aron may reasonably request regarding the Assignable Contract and the APC Party.

Following Issuer’s and J. Aron’s receipt of such information, Purchaser and Issuer will, and Issuer will cause J. Aron to, (i) negotiate in good faith with one another regarding a potential Assignment Schedule, with the initial draft of such Assignment Schedule to be developed by J. Aron, and (ii) negotiate in good faith with one another and the APC Party regarding an Assignment Agreement, in each case related to the proposed assignment. If such Assignment Schedule and Assignment are agreed to by the representative parties thereto, the applicable parties will execute such Assignment Agreement and Assignment Schedule to be effective upon the assignment of the Assigned Rights and Obligations from Purchaser to J. Aron pursuant to the Assignment Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser acknowledges that J. Aron will not be required. 

H-2
<!-- Page 750 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

to execute any Assignment Agreement, Assignment Schedule, or otherwise accept any Assigned Rights and Obligations unless the APC Party (i) satisfies J. Aron’s internal requirements as they relate to “know your customer” rules, policies and procedures, anti-money laundering rules and regulations, Dodd-Frank Act, Commodity Exchange Act, Patriot Act and similar rules, regulations, requirements and corresponding policies, (ii) is organized in the United States, and (iii) satisfies all other requirements in Section 1 of this Exhibit H.

3. Assignment Schedule. In connection with each assignment, an “Assignment Schedule” will be prepared in the form attached hereto as Attachment 1 (with such changes as agreed by the Parties in their sole discretion), must be executed by Purchaser, Issuer and J. Aron, and must include each of the following:

3.1. The term of such Assigned Rights and Obligations (the “Assignment Period”) shall have the meaning specified in each applicable Assignment Agreement and shall (i) end not later than one (1) Month prior to the end of the current Reset Period, (ii) not commence any earlier than sixty (60) days after Purchaser’s original notice under Section 2.1 above, and (iii) have a primary term that does not exceed 12 Months in duration (provided, for the avoidance of doubt, the primary term references the term of the Assignment Period and not the term of a Assignable Contract). To the extent mutually agreed upon by all parties to the Assignment Schedule, the Assignment Period may include a month-to-month or annual renewal term that may be terminated upon written notice of termination 30 days prior to the end of any renewal term.

3.2. For any Assignable Contract to be assigned during the Electricity Delivery Period, a description of the Applicable Project or upstream supplier.

3.3. For any Assignable Contract to be assigned during the Electricity Delivery Period, the P99 Generation and P50 Generation of the Applicable Project and, if the Assigned Quantities that Purchaser wishes to include in the Assigned Rights and Obligations is less than the total P99 forecasted generation available from the Applicable Project, the Assigned Quantities as so limited. Purchaser and J. Aron shall in good faith attempt to agree upon the P99 Generation based on the information provided pursuant to Section 2.5 above; provided that, if Purchaser and J. Aron are unable to reach agreement, then J. Aron shall make such determination in its sole discretion.

3.4. The “Assigned Prepay Quantity” for each Month of the Assignment Period, which Assigned Prepay Quantity will be the lesser of (i) the P99 Generation of the Applicable Project for such Month, and (ii) the Assigned Quantities as described in Section 3.3 for such Month; provided that, in the case of clause (b), the Assigned Prepay Quantity for each Month may not exceed the limit expressed in the proviso to Section 3.5 below.

3.5. An updated Exhibit A to the Commodity Supply Contract reflecting a reduction in Hourly Quantity during the Assignment Period after giving effect to the Assignment Schedule (the “Reduced Hourly Quantity”), which Reduced Hourly
<!-- Page 751 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Quantity for each Delivery Hour will equal (i) the Assigned Prepay Quantity for such Delivery Hour (which will be determined by dividing the Assigned Prepay Quantity for the applicable Month by the number of Delivery Hours in such Month), multiplied by (ii) the result of (A) the APC Contract Price applicable for such Month, divided by (B) S[____]/MWh while deliveries are to the Primary Electricity Delivery Point; provided that, in each case, if the Reduced Hourly Quantity for any Month would result in a Contract Quantity of less than zero (0), then the Assigned Prepay Quantity for such Month will be reduced to the closest whole MWh, such that the Contract Quantity is not reduced below zero (0).

3.6. The APC Contract Price, which as set forth in Section 1.7 above must be a fixed price unless Issuer, Purchaser and J. Aron agree to appropriate changes to the relevant documents to accommodate a floating APC Contract Price.

3.7. The Assigned Delivery Point for all Assigned Electricity.

3.8. The APC Contract Price must be inclusive of all Assigned Products. Assigned Products may not include (i) capacity or (ii) any other products that are separately delivered from Electricity (during the Electricity Delivery Period) other than RECs whose delivery may be accomplished through the delivery of a certificate or reporting to an applicable tracking agency.

6 NTD: This amount will be the result of the following formula as determined at pricing: Front End Fixed Price + (Active Swap Fee – Standby Swap Fee).

**FORM OF ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT**

NOTE: To be attached to the Commodity Supply Contract and may be included as an exhibit to any new Commodity Supply Contract or PPA executed by the municipal utility (offtaker) along with this language to be added to the Commodity Supply Contract or PPA: “[Seller] agrees that [Buyer] may assign a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to J. Aron and Company, LLC (“J. Aron”) at any time upon not less than [___] days’ notice by delivering a written request for such assignment, which request must include a proposed assignment agreement in the form attached hereto as [Exhibit __], with the blanks in such form completed in [Buyer’s] sole discretion. Provided that [Buyer] delivers a proposed assignment agreement complying with the previous sentence, [Seller] agrees to (i) comply with J. Aron’s reasonable requests for know-your-customer and similar account opening information and documentation with respect to [Seller], including but not limited to information related to forecasted generation, credit rating, and compliance with anti-money laundering rules, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity Exchange Act, the PATRIOT Act and similar rules, regulations, requirements and corresponding policies; and (ii) promptly execute such assignment agreement and implement such assignment as contemplated thereby, subject only to the countersignature of J. Aron and Company, LLC and [Buyer].**

This Limited Assignment Agreement (this “Assignment Agreement” or “Agreement”) is entered into as of [___], by and among [___], a [___] (“PPA Seller”), [Municipal Participant], a [___] (“PPA Buyer”), and J. Aron & Company LLC, a New York limited liability company (“J. Aron”), and relates to that certain power purchase agreement between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller as further described in Appendix 1 (the “PPA”). Unless the context otherwise specifies or requires, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth in the PPA.

In consideration of the premises above and the mutual covenants and agreements herein set forth, PPA Seller, PPA Buyer and J. Aron (the “Parties” hereto; each is a “Party”) agree as follows:

1. **Limited Assignment and Delegation.**

   (a) PPA Buyer hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to J. Aron all right, title and interest in and to the rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA to receive delivery of the products described in Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Products”) during the Assignment Period (as defined in Appendix 1), as such rights may be limited or further described in the “Further Information” section on Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Product Rights”). All Assigned Products shall be delivered pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the Assignment Period as provided in Appendix 1. All other rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly reserved for PPA Buyer.

   (b) PPA Buyer hereby delegates to J. Aron the obligation to pay for all Assigned Products that are actually delivered to J. Aron pursuant to the Assigned Product Rights during the Assignment Period (the “Delivered Product Payment Obligation” and together with the Assigned Product Rights, collectively the “Assigned Rights and Obligations”); provided that (i) all other obligations of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly retained by PPA Buyer and PPA Buyer shall be solely responsible for any amounts due to PPA Seller that are not directly related to Assigned Products; and (ii) the Parties acknowledge and agree that PPA Seller will only be obligated to deliver a single consolidated invoice during the Assignment Period (with a copy to J. Aron).
<!-- Page 754 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

(c) J. Aron hereby accepts and PPA Seller hereby consents and agrees to the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delegation described in clauses (a) and (b) above.

(d) All scheduling of Assigned Products and other communications related to the PPA shall take place pursuant to the terms of the PPA; provided that (i) title to Assigned Product will pass from PPA Seller to J. Aron upon delivery by PPA Seller of Assigned Product in accordance with the PPA; (ii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to J. Aron of any Notice of a Force Majeure Event or Event of Default or default, breach or other occurrence that, if not cured within the applicable grace period, could result in an Event of Default contemporaneously upon delivery thereof to PPA Seller and promptly after receipt thereof from PPA Seller; (iii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to J. Aron of any forecasts of Energy generation provided by PPA Seller under the PPA; (iv) PPA Seller will provide copies to J. Aron of all invoices and supporting data provided to PPA Buyer pursuant to Section [ ], provided that any payment adjustments or subsequent reconciliations occurring after the date that is 10 days prior to the payment due date for a monthly invoice, including pursuant to Section [ ], will be resolved solely between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller and therefore PPA Seller will not be obligated to deliver copies of any communications relating thereto to J. Aron; and (v) PPA Buyer and PPA Seller, as applicable, will provide copies to J. Aron of any other information reasonably requested by J. Aron relating to Assigned Products.

(e) PPA Seller acknowledges that (i) J. Aron intends to immediately transfer title to any Assigned Products received from PPA Seller through one or more intermediaries such that all Assigned Products will be re-delivered to PPA Buyer; and (ii) in the event that PPA Buyer fails to pay the relevant intermediary entity for any such Assigned Products, the receivables owed by PPA Buyer for such Assigned Products (“PPA Buyer Receivables”) may be transferred to J. Aron. To the extent any such PPA Buyer Receivables are transferred to J. Aron, J. Aron may transfer such PPA Buyer Receivables to PPA Seller and apply the face amount thereof as a reduction to any Delivered Product Payment Obligation. To effect such transfer, J. Aron shall deliver to PPA Seller a notice of intent to transfer PPA Buyer Receivables not later than the payment due date for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation and shall deliver to PPA Seller a bill of sale signed by J. Aron not later than five Business Days thereafter. Thereafter, PPA Seller shall be entitled to pursue collection on such PPA Buyer Receivables directly against PPA Buyer.

(f) The Assigned Prepay Quantity set forth in Appendix 2 relates to obligations by and between J. Aron and PPA Buyer and has no impact on PPA Seller’s rights and obligations under the PPA.

2. Assignment Early Termination.

(a) The Assignment Period may be terminated early upon the occurrence of any of the following:

(1) delivery of a written notice of termination specifying a termination date by either J. Aron or PPA Buyer to each of the other Parties;
<!-- Page 755 -->
(2) delivery of a written notice of termination specifying a termination date by PPA Seller to each of J. Aron and PPA Buyer following J. Aron’s failure to pay when due any amounts owed to PPA Seller in respect of any Delivered Product Payment Obligation and such payment is not made by J. Aron within five (5) business days following receipt by J. Aron and PPA Buyer of written notice;

(3) delivery of a written notice by PPA Seller if any of the events described in the definition of [Bankrupt] in the PPA occurs with respect to J. Aron; or

(4) delivery of a written notice by J. Aron if any of the events described in the definition of [Bankrupt] [John: Some of the PPAs I just reviewed called this Bankruptcy Event, bracketing for future.] in the PPA occurs with respect to PPA Seller.

(b) The Assignment Period will end at the end of last delivery hour on the date specified in the termination notice provided pursuant to Section 2(a), which date shall not be earlier than the end of the last day of the calendar month in which such notice is delivered if termination is pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) or 2(a)(2) above. All Assigned Rights and Obligations shall revert from J. Aron to PPA Buyer upon the early termination of the Assignment Period, provided that (i) J. Aron shall remain responsible for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation with respect to any Assigned Product delivered to J. Aron prior to the end of the Assignment Period, and (ii) any legal restrictions on the effectiveness of such reversion (whether arising under bankruptcy law or otherwise) shall not affect the expiration or early termination of the Assignment Period

(c) The Assignment Period will automatically terminate upon the expiration of any termination of the PPA. All Assigned Rights and Obligations shall revert from J. Aron to PPA Buyer upon the expiration of or early termination of the PPA, provided that (i) J. Aron shall remain responsible for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation with respect to any Assigned Product delivered to J. Aron prior to the end of the Assignment Period, and (ii) any legal restrictions on the effectiveness of such reversion (whether arising under bankruptcy law or otherwise) shall not affect the expiration or early termination of the Assignment Period.

3. Representations and Warranties. The PPA Seller and the PPA Buyer represent and warrant to J. Aron that (a) the PPA is in full force and effect; (b) no event or circumstance exists (or would exist with the passage of time or the giving of notice) that would give either of them the right to terminate the PPA or suspend performance thereunder; and (c) all of its obligations under the PPA required to be performed on or before the Assignment Period Start Date have been fulfilled.

4. Notices. Any notice, demand, or request required or authorized by this Assignment Agreement to be given by one Party to another Party shall be delivered in accordance with [Article]/[Section] [__] of the PPA and to the addresses of each PPA Seller and PPA Buyer specified in the PPA. PPA Buyer agrees to notify J. Aron of any updates to such notice information, including any updates provided by PPA Seller to PPA Buyer. Notices to J. Aron shall be provided to the following address, as such address may be updated by J. Aron from time to time by notice to the other Parties:

![Exhibit A](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Exhibit+A)

The Calculation Agent will undertake the following steps in determining the Available Discount Percentage for any Reset Period (each, a “New Reset Period”):

- **Step 1: Determine the “Prior Remaining Commodity Value”**
  - The Calculation Agent will determine the Remaining Commodity Value for the last month of the current Reset Period (the “Old Reset Period”) based on Attachment 1 hereto, as such Attachment 1 initially existed or was last updated at the beginning of the prior Reset Period (the “Prior Remaining Commodity Value”).
  - “Remaining Commodity Value” means, for any month, the amount set forth on Attachment 1 of the Exhibit A as the “Remaining Commodity Value” for such month, as Attachment 1 may be updated pursuant to this Exhibit A in connection with the establishment of any new Reset Period.

- **Step 2: The Calculation Agent will specify the length of the New Reset Period pursuant to Section 3 of the Agreement**

- **Step 3: The Calculation Agent will specify a Reset Period Implied Rate for the New Reset Period and a Delivery Period Implied Rate**
  - “Reset Period Implied Rate” means, for any Reset Period other than the Current Reset Period, a fixed rate offered by the Funding Recipient for such Reset Period as of the Bond Pricing Date for such Reset Period, which rate the Parties acknowledge (i) will be determined by Funding Recipient in its sole and absolute discretion based on the rate of Funding Recipient, and (ii) for which the Funding Recipient may consider all relevant factors, including (w) the nature of the source of funding provided by the Funding Agreement, including any applicable regulatory or capital charges, (x) the tenor, (y) market interest for such funding at the time, and (z) any other unique attributes of the Funding Agreement funding relative to other sources available to Funding Recipient. The Parties acknowledge that, for purposes of providing an Estimated Available Discount Percentage, the Calculation Agent may rely on indicative pricing proposals from a Qualified Funding Recipient.
  - “Delivery Period Implied Rate” means, for any remaining portion of the Delivery Period that is not covered by a Reset Period, a fixed rate determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole and absolute discretion as of the Pricing Date for such Reset Period which the Calculation Agent determines (in its sole discretion) that Funding Recipient would be able to acquire, as of the date of determination, funding from other sources comparable to the funding provided by the Funding Agreement as of the date of determination if such Funding Agreement were extended for the entire Delivery Period. In determining such a rate, and the Calculation Agent may consider all relevant factors, including (w) the nature of the source of funding provided by the 

Exhibit A – Page 1
<!-- Page 768 -->
![Funding Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Funding+Agreement)

- **Step 4: Determine the “New Remaining Delivery Cost”**
  - The Calculation Agent will determine the “Remaining Delivery Cost” for each month of the Delivery Period after the Old Reset Period. The Remaining Delivery Cost for the first month of the New Reset Period is the “New Remaining Delivery Cost”.
  - “Remaining Delivery Cost” means, for any determination month, an amount calculated by the Calculation Agent equal to the net present value of a stream of monthly payments equal to the Monthly Contract Quantities multiplied by the applicable Fixed Price (as defined in the Prepaid Agreement) for the remainder of the Delivery Period (including such determination month), Discount Percentage at the Reset Period Implied Rate for the New Reset Period and the Delivery Period Implied Rate for the remainder of the Delivery Period after the New Reset Period.

- **Step 5: Additional Reduction Amount or Changing Monthly Contract Quantities**
  - If the Prior Remaining Commodity Value is less than the New Remaining Delivery Cost:
    - If the Reset Period will go to the end of the Delivery Period, the Calculation Agent will reduce the Monthly Contract Quantities to zero in as many months as necessary at the end of the Delivery Period (and, to the extent necessary, reduce the Monthly Contract Quantities in the last remaining month of the Reset Period to a quantity greater than zero) such that the Prior Remaining Commodity Value is equal to the New Remaining Delivery Cost.
    - If the Reset Period will end prior to the Delivery Period, the Calculation Agent may reduce the Monthly Contract Quantities as provided above to the extent such reduction results in a greater Available Discount Percentage for such Reset Period.
  - If the Prior Remaining Commodity Value is greater than the New Remaining Delivery Cost:
    - Subject to the following bullet, the Calculation Agent will pay to the Issuer the amount, if any, by which (A) the Prior Remaining Commodity Value exceeds (B) the New Remaining Delivery Cost (the “Additional Reduction Amount”) on the first day of the contemplated Interest Rate Period, which payment shall be applied by the Issuer to the retirement of Bonds.
    - Notwithstanding the prior bullet, the Calculation Agent shall elect to retain a portion of the Excess Amount to the extent (i) the Reset Period will end prior to the Delivery Period, (ii) such retention results in a greater Available Discount Percentage, and (iii) doing so is.
<!-- Page 769 -->
![Exhibit A – Page 3](attachment://exhibit-a-page-3.png)

- consistent with the amortization requirement of the Bonds. If the Calculation Agent elects to retain a portion of such Excess Amount pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the Additional Reduction Amount shall be the portion of such Excess Amount that the Calculation Agent elects to pay.
  - Any Additional Reduction Amount or changes in Monthly Contract Quantities will then be included in calculating the New Remaining Delivery Cost. An Additional Reduction Amount will reduce the Prior Remaining Commodity Value for this purpose.
  - The Calculation Agent will amend Attachment 1 hereto effective as of the beginning of the New Reset Period such that the Remaining Commodity Value for each month in the New Reset Period and the remainder of the Delivery Period is equal to the Remaining Delivery Cost for such month as determined under Step 4 and updated under this Step 5.

- **Step 6: Determine the Fixed Rate for the Bonds for the term of such contemplated Interest Rate Period**
  - The remarketing agent or underwriter of the Bonds for such contemplated Interest Rate Period will specify the Fixed Rate.
  - “Fixed Rate” means, for any New Reset Period, the fixed rate or rates of interest payable by the Issuer with respect to a Series of Bonds or, in the case of a Series of Variable Rate Bonds (as defined in the Bond Indenture), the fixed rate payable by the Issuer under the related fixed rate swap transaction, which Fixed Rates will be determined on the Bond Pricing Date at a rate sufficient to enable all the Bonds to be sold or remarketed on such Bond Pricing Date in accordance with the Bond Indenture (which sale price may include a premium or Discount Percentage to par), as determined based on market information then available.

- **Step 7: Determine Monthly Discount Percentage Portion of Available Discount Percentage**
  - The Calculation Agent will determine the Monthly Discount Percentage portion of the Available Discount Percentage for each portion of the Reset Period based on the expected differences between monthly revenues and monthly debt service and other obligations of the Commodity Project (as defined in the Bond Indenture).

- **Step 8: Determine Annual Refund Portion of Available Discount Percentage**
  - The Calculation Agent and Issuer shall mutually agree upon the projected Annual Refund (as defined in the Commodity Supply Contracts) for the Reset Period, which shall be determined consistent with the Commodity Supply Contracts and shall be the remaining portion of the Available Discount Percentage.

such instructions (i) are reasonably believed to have been given by an Authorized Officer and (ii) are authorized or permitted to be given under this Custodial Agreement. In the event that the SPE Custodian shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Custodial Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be directed otherwise in writing by all of the other parties hereto or by a final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The SPE Custodian may interplead all of the assets held hereunder into a court of competent jurisdiction or may seek a declaratory judgment with respect to certain circumstances, and thereafter be fully relieved from any and all liability or obligation with respect to such interpleaded assets or any action or non-action based on such declaratory judgment. Anything in this Custodial Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the SPE Custodian be liable for special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages, losses or penalties of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), regardless of the form of action.

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the SPE Custodian is not a fiduciary by virtue of accepting and carrying out its obligations under this Custodial Agreement and has not accepted any fiduciary duties, responsibilities or liabilities with respect to its services hereunder. The SPE Custodian shall not be required to risk or expend its own funds in performing its obligations under this Custodial Agreement. If and to the extent that Prepay LLC instructs the SPE Custodian to settle transactions in the Prepay LLC Revenue Account, Prepay LLC (i) shall cause such transactions to be funded by depositing with the SPE Custodian sufficient immediately available funds (provided that this requirement shall be satisfied if sufficient funds are available in the Prepay LLC Capital Account for transfer to the Prepay LLC Revenue Account consistent with Section 5(d) of this Custodial Agreement), (ii) shall not rely on the SPE Custodian to extend credit in order to settle any such transaction, and (iii) acknowledges that any transactions not fully funded by Prepay LLC may fail to settle. Subject to the requirements of Section 5(d) of this Custodial Agreement, if the SPE Custodian, in its sole discretion, permits an overdraft in the Prepay LLC Revenue Account or if Prepay LLC is for any other reason indebted to the SPE Custodian, Prepay LLC shall immediately deliver for credit to the Prepay LLC Revenue Account sufficient cash to eliminate such debit balance, plus accrued interest at a rate then charged by the SPE Custodian to its institutional custody clients in the relevant currency, which rate shall be supplied by the SPE Custodian to Prepay LLC from time to time.

Section 8. Removal, Resignation and Succession.

(a) The SPE Custodian may be removed with 30 days’ prior written notice by Prepay LLC, with a copy to each of the other parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such removal of the SPE Custodian shall not be effective until a successor SPE Custodian has been appointed pursuant to this Section 8. The SPE Custodian’s rights under this Custodial Agreement to indemnity and any amounts due and payable to the SPE Custodian shall survive any such removal.
<!-- Page 790 -->
(b) The SPE Custodian may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving not less than 30 days’ advance notice in writing of such resignation to the other parties hereto specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect; and such resignation shall take effect upon the date specified in such notice unless a successor has not been appointed by the other parties to this Custodial Agreement on such date, in which event such resignation shall not take effect until a successor is appointed.

(c) In case at any time the SPE Custodian shall resign or shall be removed or shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or if a receiver, liquidator or conservator of the SPE Custodian, or of its property, shall be appointed, or if any public officer shall take charge or control of the SPE Custodian, or of its property or affairs, Prepay LLC, Issuer and J. Aron shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor custodian in a timely fashion, provided that any custodian appointed in succession to the SPE Custodian shall be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of any state or a national banking association and shall have capital stock, surplus and undivided earnings aggregating at least $50,000,000 and shall be a bank with trust powers or a trust company willing and able to accept the office on reasonable and customary terms and authorized by law to perform all the duties imposed upon it by this Custodial Agreement. Any corporation or association into which the SPE Custodian may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or association to which all or substantially all of the SPE Custodian’s corporate trust line of business may be transferred, shall be the SPE Custodian under this Custodial Agreement without further act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no appointment as successor SPE Custodian shall be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 8 within 30 days after (i) Prepay LLC has given notice to the SPE Custodian and the other parties hereto of the SPE Custodian’s removal as provided in this Section 8 or (ii) the SPE Custodian has given to the other parties hereto written notice of its resignation as provided in this Section 8, the SPE Custodian may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor SPE Custodian. Said court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as such court may deem proper, appoint a successor SPE Custodian.

**Section 9. Fees.** J. Aron, as the sole member of Prepay LLC, agrees to pay the SPE Custodian reasonable compensation for the services to be rendered hereunder, which compensation shall be $32,500.00 for each year that this Custodial Agreement is in effect and shall be invoiced annually. The initial fee shall be calculated on a pro rata basis and shall be invoiced on May 1, 2024, and thereafter, on May 1 of each subsequent year. J. Aron further agrees to pay or reimburse the SPE Custodian upon request for all expenses, disbursements and advances, including reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses, incurred or made by it in connection with the preparation, execution, performance, delivery, modification and termination of this Custodial Agreement.

**Section 10. Reimbursement.** Prepay LLC agrees to reimburse the SPE Custodian and its directors, officers, agents and employees for any and all loss, liability or expense (including the fees and expenses of in-house or outside counsel and experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) arising out of or in connection with (a) its acting as the SPE Custodian under this Custodial Agreement, except to the extent that such loss, liability or expense is finally adjudicated to have been caused primarily by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the SPE Custodian or such director, officer, agent or employee seeking

**Section 11. Taxpayer Identification Numbers; Tax Matters.**  
Prepay LLC represents that its correct taxpayer identification number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority is set forth on the signature page hereof. Any tax returns or reports required to be prepared and filed in connection with the Prepay LLC Revenue Account and the Prepay LLC Capital Account will be prepared and filed by Prepay LLC and the SPE Custodian shall have no responsibility for the preparation and/or filing of any tax return with respect to any income earned on the Prepay LLC Revenue Account and the Prepay LLC Capital Account. In addition, any tax or other payments required to be made pursuant to such tax return or filing shall be paid by Prepay LLC. The SPE Custodian shall have no responsibility for making such payment unless directed to do so by the appropriate authorized party.

**Section 12. Notices.**  
All communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to be duly given and received (a) upon delivery if delivered personally or upon confirmed transmittal if by facsimile; (b) on the next Business Day if sent by overnight courier; or (c) for Business Days after delivery if mailed by prepaid registered mail, return receipt requested, to the appropriate notice address for each of the parties set forth in Exhibit A.

Any party may provide a new or different address for such notices or its wire instructions set forth in Exhibit A if furnished to the other parties in writing by registered mail, return receipt requested, provided furthermore that Prepay LLC may provide updated wire instructions pursuant to the foregoing for any of its contractual counterparties who are not party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Section 12, (i) in the case of communications delivered to the SPE Custodian pursuant to clause (b) or clause (c) of this Section 12 above, such communications shall be deemed to have been given on the date received by the SPE Custodian and (ii) in the case of the notifications required pursuant to Section 3(b), such notices may be given by e-mail to an e-mail address provided by the Funding Recipient to the SPE Custodian from time to time. In the event that the SPE Custodian, in its sole discretion, shall determine that an emergency exists, the SPE Custodian may use such other means of communication as the SPE Custodian deems appropriate.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Custodial Agreement to the contrary, the SPE Custodian shall have the right to accept and act upon instructions or directions provided by a party pursuant to this Custodial Agreement or by the Trustee, or any other document reasonably relating to the Bonds, if delivered using Electronic Means (as defined below); provided, however, that the applicable party shall provide to a Responsible Officer of the SPE Custodian an incumbency certificate listing designated individuals with the authority to provide such instructions (each an “Authorized Officer”) and containing specimen signatures of such Authorized Officers, which incumbency certificate shall be amended, with written notice to a Responsible Officer of the SPE Custodian, whenever an individual is to be added or deleted from the list.

the listing. If a party elects to give the SPE Custodian directions or instructions using Electronic Means and the SPE Custodian in its discretion elects to act upon such directions, the SPE Custodian’s understanding of such directions shall be deemed controlling. The party giving such instructions to the SPE Custodian understands and agrees that the SPE Custodian cannot determine the identity of the actual sender of such directions and that the SPE Custodian may conclusively presume that directions that purport to have been sent by an Authorized Officer listed on the incumbency certificate provided to a Responsible Officer of the SPE Custodian have been sent by such Authorized Officer. The party giving such instructions shall be solely responsible for ensuring that only Authorized Officers of such party transmit such directions to the SPE Custodian and that the party and all Authorized Officers treat applicable user authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys as confidential and with extreme care. The SPE Custodian shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from its reliance upon and compliance with such instructions notwithstanding that such instructions conflict or are inconsistent with a subsequent written instruction. The party giving such instructions to the SPE Custodian agrees: (i) to assume all risks arising out of the use of Electronic Means (as defined below) to submit directions to the SPE Custodian, including without limitation the risk of the SPE Custodian acting on unauthorized directions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties; (ii) that it is fully informed of the protections and risks associated with the various methods of transmitting directions to the SPE Custodian and that there may be more secure methods of transmitting directions; (iii) that the security procedures (if any) to be followed in connection with its transmission of directions provide to it a commercially reasonable degree of protection in light of its particular needs and circumstances; (iv) to notify the SPE Custodian immediately upon learning of any compromise or unauthorized use of the security procedures; and (v) to indemnify and hold harmless the SPE Custodian against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred or sustained by the SPE Custodian as a result of or in connection with the SPE Custodian's reliance upon and compliance with instructions or directions given by Electronic Means (as defined below), except for any claim, damage or loss resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the SPE Custodian (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts due under clause (v) of this Section 12 above shall not duplicate any other amounts due under this Custodial Agreement, including without limitation amounts due under Section 10 or Section 17 hereof).  
As used herein, “Electronic Means” shall mean instructions sent by S.W.I.F.T, e-mail, facsimile and other similar secure electronic transmission platform containing applicable authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys issued by the SPE Custodian (“Secure Platform”) or another method or system specified by a Responsible Officer of the SPE Custodian as available for use in connection with the SPE Custodian’s services hereunder. Access to and use of the SPE Custodian’s systems shall be subject to the terms and conditions contained in a separate written agreement. Prepay LLC, J. Aron and the Issuer shall be responsible for requesting access to any such system of the SPE Custodian and completing the documentation required for such access and nothing herein shall obligate the SPE Custodian to ensure any such access and the SPE Custodian shall have no responsibility or liability should such parties fail to, elect not to, avail itself of such access. If the parties elect to use an on-line communications system owned or operated by a third party, the SPE Custodian shall have no responsibility or liability for the reliability or availability of any such service. All funds transfer instructions shall be sent utilizing a Secure Platform unless otherwise agreed by the SPE Custodian. When

It is acknowledged and agreed that the SPE Custodian may require any assignee to furnish to the SPE Custodian certain requested information to allow the SPE Custodian to complete its “Know Your Customer” procedures and such assignment is subject to the satisfactory completion by the SPE Custodian of its applicable customer identification procedures as in effect from time to time.
<!-- Page 794 -->
(c) This Custodial Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed, enforced, and performed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to any conflicts of law principle that would direct the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

(d) Each party hereto irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds of venue, forum non-conveniens or any similar grounds and irrevocably consents to service of process by mail or in any other manner permitted by applicable law and consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of (A) the courts of the State of New York located in the Borough of Manhattan, (B) the federal courts of the United States of America for the Southern District of New York or (C) the federal courts of the United States of America in any other state. The parties further hereby waive any right to a trial by jury with respect to any lawsuit or judicial proceeding arising or relating to this Custodial Agreement.

(e) No party to this Agreement shall be liable to any other party hereto for losses due to, or if it is unable to perform its obligations under the terms of this Agreement because of, strikes, work stoppages, acts of war or terrorism, insurrection, revolution, epidemics, pandemics, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, or interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer (software and hardware) services, or other causes reasonably beyond its control; provided that a party affected by any such event shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to resume performance as quickly as possible.

(f) This Custodial Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Custodial Agreement and solely in connection with the Centralized Functions and/or Outsourced Functions, Prepay LLC consents to the disclosure of, and authorizes the SPE Custodian to disclose, the Customer Information to (i) other members of the BNY Mellon Group (and their respective officers, directors and employees) and to (ii) third-party service providers (but solely in connection with Outsourced Functions), in each case, who are required to maintain the confidentiality of the Customer Information.

collected and/or calculated by the BNY Mellon Group (the “Aggregated Data”).

Prepay LLC represents that it is authorized to consent to the foregoing and that the disclosure of the Customer Information in connection with the Centralized Functions and/or Outsourced Functions does not violate any relevant data protection legislation.

(b) In the event any Covered Entity or any of its affiliates becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. special resolution regime, default rights with respect to this Custodial Agreement that may be exercised against such Covered Entity are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than the default rights could be exercised under the U.S. special resolution regime if this Custodial Agreement were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.

Section 20. Sanctions.

(a) Throughout the term of this Agreement, J. Aron (on behalf of itself and Prepay LLC): (i) will have in place and will implement policies and procedures designed to prevent violations of Sanctions (defined below), including measures to accomplish effective and timely scanning of all relevant data with respect to its clients and with respect to incoming or outgoing assets or transactions relating to this Agreement; (ii) shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that neither it nor any of its affiliates, directors, employees is an individual or entity that is, or is owned or controlled by an individual or entity that is: (A) the target of Sanctions; or (B) located, organized or resident in a country or territory that is, or whose government is, the target of Sanctions.

(b) J. Aron and Prepay LLC shall not, directly or indirectly, use the services and/or the Prepay LLC Revenue Account or the Prepay LLC Capital Account in any manner that would result in its violation of Sanctions.

Aron and the Prepay LLC Revenue Account and the Prepay LLC Capital Account and the cash or Cash Equivalents held, therein in relation to which services are to be provided hereunder and the source thereof, and the identity of any individual or entity having or claiming an interest therein. The SPE Custodian may decline to act or provide services in respect of an account, and take such other actions as it, in its reasonable discretion, deems necessary or advisable, in connection with the matters referenced in this Section. If the SPE Custodian declines to act or provide services as provided in the preceding sentence, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law or official request, the Custodian will inform the other parties hereto as soon as reasonably practicable.

# SCHEDULE I
## Valuation Services Terms and Conditions

1. On each Valuation Date, Valuation Agent shall determine the Delivery Amount and the Return Amount as herein described. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Support Annex to the Back-End Commodity Swap.

2. On the Business Day prior to each Valuation Date as set forth in the Credit Support Annex to the Back-End Commodity Swap, Prepay LLC shall provide the Exposure under the Back-End Commodity Swap to the Valuation Agent. The Valuation Agent shall calculate the Delivery Amount and the Return Amount consistent with the terms of the Credit Support Annex (i.e., the Exposure minus the Posted Collateral and the rounding and Minimum Transfer Amount specified in the Credit Support Annex). On each Valuation Date prior to the Notification Time specified in the Credit Support Annex to the Back-End Commodity Swap, Valuation Agent shall transmit to Prepay LLC and Swap Counterparty a report (“Report”) via e-mail of the values and other amounts determined in accordance with the preceding sentence. By electing to use e-mail for this purpose, Prepay LLC acknowledges that such transmissions are not encrypted and therefore are unsecured. Prepay LLC further acknowledges that there are other risks inherent in communicating through the internet such as the possibility of virus contamination and disruptions in service, and agrees that Valuation Agent shall not be responsible for any loss, damage or expense suffered or incurred by any of the parties hereto or any other person claiming by or through the parties as a result of the use of such method.

3. Reports shall be produced on a basis and in such form and content as shall be mutually agreed between Valuation Agent and Prepay LLC. Prepay LLC shall examine (or cause to be examined) each Report and notify Valuation Agent of any error, omission or discrepancy by the close of business on the Business Day immediately following receipt of such Report. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that unless Valuation Agent is notified in writing of any error, omission or discrepancy by the close of the Business Day following receipt, each Report shall be deemed to be correct and conclusive in all respects, absent manifest error. In the event of any errors or omissions in any Report, Valuation Agent’s sole responsibility and liability shall be the preparation of a corrected Report at no additional cost.

In each case on a pay-as-you-go basis and that Contract provides respect to the Commodity Supply Contract which includes specified amounts. The amounts payable by the Project Participant will provide sufficient revenues to cover swap payments and receipts, and subsequently income from the Debt Service Account to make the required scheduled deposits to the Debt Service Account.

6. **Commodity Swaps:** During the Gas Delivery Period, NCEA will pay and receive fixed amounts from the Commodity Swap Counterparty against the payment obligations per the contract which includes fixed revenues available to meet its fixed debt service obligations.

# OFFICIAL STATEMENT

**$000,000,000***

**NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY**  
**COMMODITY SUPPLY REVENUE REFUNDING BONDS, SERIES 2024**

## INTRODUCTION

This Official Statement, which includes the cover page and appendices attached hereto, contains information concerning (a) Northern California Energy Authority (“NCEA”), a joint powers authority organized under the laws of the State of California (the “State”), (b) NCEA’s Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024 (the “Bonds”), being issued in the aggregate principal amount of $000,000,000* and (c) the Commodity Project (defined below) being financed with proceeds of the Bonds. Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings shown in APPENDIX C.

## NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY

The Northern California Energy Authority (“NCEA”) is a joint powers authority formed pursuant to Chapter 5 of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code of the State of California, as amended and supplemented (the “Act”), by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority (“SFA”). NCEA is authorized to undertake all actions permitted by the Act that are necessary or convenient to assist SMUD with the acquisition and financing of supplies of natural gas and electricity, including undertaking the Commodity Project and selling the Commodity Project to SMUD, as described herein. See “NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY.”

## THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT

SMUD operates the sixth largest community-owned electric utility system in the United States. SMUD’s electric system has provided retail electric service since 1946, and it currently serves a population of approximately 1.5 million persons in a 900 square mile service area that covers the principal parts of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. See APPENDIX B for additional information regarding SMUD.

## THE COMMODITY PROJECT

NCEA previously issued its Commodity Supply Revenue Bonds, Series 2018 (the “2018 Bonds”), pursuant to a Trust Indenture (the “2018 Indenture”) between NCEA and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, to finance the acquisition of an approximately thirty-year supply of natural gas and electricity (together, the “Commodities”) under a Prepaid Commodity Sales Agreement (the “2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement”) with J. Aron & Company LLC, a New York limited liability company (“J. Aron”). Deliveries of natural gas under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement began on June 1, 2019. NCEA entered

* Preliminary, subject to change.
<!-- Page 814 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

into a Commodity Supply Contract (the “2018 Commodity Supply Contract”) with the Project Participant for the sale of all of the Commodities to be delivered under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement.

The 2018 Bonds mature and are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on July 1, 2024, and a portion of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used to current refund the 2018 Bonds. See “PLAN OF REFUNDING.” Effective as of the Initial Issue Date of the Bonds: (a) J. Aron will transfer by novation of all its interests under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement and its other contracts and agreements related to the 2018 prepayment transaction to Aron Energy Prepay 33 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Commodity Supplier”); (b) in consideration of a lump sum payment for its acceptance of the obligations under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement and such other contracts and agreements, the Commodity Supplier will accept such transfer by novation from J. Aron; (c) NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will enter into an Amended & Restated Prepaid Commodity Sales Agreement (the “Commodity Purchase Agreement”), together with amendments and restatements of various other contracts and agreements entered into in connection with the 2018 prepayment transaction; (d) NCEA will make a prepayment to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement for additional quantities of Commodities to be delivered through September 2054; and (e) NCEA and the Project Participant will enter into an Amended & Restated Commodity Supply Contract (as so amended and restated, the “Commodity Supply Contract”) to provide for the purchase and sale of additional quantities of Commodities through September 2054.

Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier will continue to deliver natural gas until NCEA exercises its option to switch from gas deliveries to electricity deliveries (the “Gas Delivery Period”). The switch from gas deliveries to electricity deliveries will occur on a date (the “Switch Date”) determined pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement, but may not occur prior to June 1, 2028. Scheduled deliveries of electricity under the Commodity Purchase Agreement will commence on the Switch Date and will continue to the end of the delivery period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (the “Electricity Delivery Period”). The “Commodity Project” consists of NCEA’s purchase of natural gas and electricity pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement and all of its related contractual arrangements and agreements. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT.”

The Project Participant uses the natural gas that is now being delivered during the Gas Delivery Period as fuel for the generation of electricity that is distributed and sold to retail customers within its service area. If the Switch Date occurs, the Project Participant will distribute and sell the electricity that will be delivered during the Electricity Delivery Period to retail customers within its service area. See “THE COMMODITY SUPPLY CONTRACT.”

PLAN OF REFUNDING
Proceeds of the Bonds together with other available moneys will be deposited with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to an Escrow Agreement to establish an irrevocable trust escrow account (the “Escrow Account”), consisting of cash and noncallable direct full faith and credit obligations of the United States of America. The amounts in the Escrow Account will be used to refund the $537,295,000 principal amount of 2018 Bonds maturing on and after July 1, 2024 (the “Refunded Bonds”), and are pledged solely for the payment of the Refunded Bonds. Upon the deposit of such amounts and satisfaction of certain requirements of the 2018 Indenture, the Refunded Bonds will be deemed to be paid and will no longer be secured by the pledge of the Trust Estate under the 2018 Indenture. The Refunded Bonds will be called for redemption on July 1, 2024. See “PLAN OF REFUNDING” below.
<!-- Page 815 -->
# THE BONDS

From their Initial Issue Date to and including __________, 20__ (the “Interest Rate Reset Period”), the Bonds will bear interest in a Fixed Rate Period, with interest payable semiannually on each [January 1] and [July 1], commencing __________, 20__*, as described herein.

The Bonds are subject to optional redemption and extraordinary mandatory redemption during the Interest Rate Reset Period, and the Bonds maturing on __________, 20__* are required to be tendered for purchase on __________, 20__* (the “Mandatory Purchase Date”), which is the day following the end of the Interest Rate Reset Period. The Purchase Price of Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date is equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest. See “THE BONDS—Redemption” and “—Tender—Mandatory Tender.” Under the Indenture, a “Failed Remarketing” will occur upon the failure (a) of the Trustee to receive the Purchase Price of any Bond required to be purchased or redeemed on a Mandatory Purchase Date by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the fifth Business Day preceding such Mandatory Purchase Date or (b) to purchase or redeem such Bond in whole by such Mandatory Purchase Date. A Failed Remarketing will result in early termination of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the extraordinary redemption of the Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date. See “THE BONDS—Redemption” and “—Tender.”

The Bonds are issued pursuant to the authority contained in the Act, and are issued and secured under an Amended and Restated Trust Indenture, dated as of the first day of the month in which the Bonds are issued (the “Indenture”), between NCEA and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association), as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Bonds are special and limited obligations of NCEA, are payable solely from and secured solely by the Trust Estate pledged by the Indenture, and are expected to be paid from the Revenues of the Commodity Project. See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS.”

# THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT

## Delivery of Commodities. 
Pursuant to the terms and conditions and subject to the limitations set forth in the Commodity Purchase Agreement:

(a) on each gas day during the Gas Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier agrees to deliver and NCEA agrees to take, in each case on a firm basis, the Contract Quantity of gas;

(b) during each hour during the Electricity Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier agrees to deliver and NCEA agrees to take, in each case on a firm basis, the Contract Quantity of electricity; and

(c) during each Month of the Electricity Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier agrees to deliver and NCEA agrees to purchase and take, the Assigned Prepay Quantity of electricity, if any.

“Contract Quantity” is defined in the Commodity Purchase Agreement to mean: (a) during the Gas Delivery Period for each gas day and each gas delivery point, the daily quantity of gas (in MMBtu) specified for such

* Preliminary, subject to change. 

-3-
<!-- Page 816 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

delivery point for the Month in which such gas day occurs: and (b) during the Electricity Delivery Period, (i) the specified Hourly Quantity of electricity for each hour and each electricity delivery point and (ii) the Assigned Prepay Quantity, if any, of Assigned Electricity for each Month. The delivery points designated in the Commodity Purchase Agreement are located on the natural gas pipelines and electricity transmission lines that serve the Project Participant.

**Switch Date.** On June 1, 2028 or such later date as may be established pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement (the “Switch Date”), deliveries of gas under the Commodity Purchase Agreement will cease, and the Electricity Delivery Period and deliveries of electricity will commence.

**Assigned Electricity.** From and after the Switch Date, the Project Participant may enter into assignment agreements (“PPA Assignment Agreements”) to assign a portion of its rights and obligations (the “Assigned Rights and Obligations”) under power purchase agreements (“Assigned PPAs”) to J. Aron. If such assignments are accepted by J. Aron, the electricity delivered under the Assigned PPAs (the “Assigned Electricity”) will be delivered to J. Aron for sale to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. The monthly quantities of Assigned Electricity that are allocated to the prepayment transaction pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Commodity Supply Contract (the “Assigned Prepay Quantities”) will offset (on an equivalent value basis), and will be used to meet, the Commodity Supplier’s obligations to deliver the Hourly Quantity of electricity to NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. NCEA will then deliver such Assigned Prepaid Quantities to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract.

**Commodity Remarketing, Ledger Event and Additional Interest.** Under the circumstances described in the Commodity Purchase Agreement and during the Gas Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier agrees to remarket, on a daily or monthly basis, all or such portion of the Contract Quantity of gas as is designated by NCEA or the Trustee. In the event that the Commodity Supplier is unable to remarket any such gas, the Commodity Supplier has agreed to purchase such gas for its own account. During the Electricity Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier further agrees to remarket or purchase all or such portion of the Hourly Quantity of electricity as is designated by NCEA or the Trustee, and may agree to remarket Assigned Electricity upon mutual agreement with NCEA.

Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement (described below), J. Aron has agreed to provide all Commodity marketing services necessary for the Commodity Supplier to meet its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. These services include requirements to (a) enter all remarketing sales or purchases of Commodities on a ledger system that tracks compliance with the requirements of the U.S. Treasury Regulations applicable to tax-exempt bonds that finance prepaid natural gas and electricity supplies, and (b) exercise commercially reasonable efforts to remediate any non-complying sales (i.e., non-qualified use sales and private business use sales) through “qualifying use” sales within two years.

In the event that any non-complying Commodities remarketing sales are not remediated within two years and exceed certain cumulative limits, a “Ledger Event” will occur, subject to certain provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If a Ledger Event occurs, and an Early Termination Payment Date has not been designated, J. Aron will be obligated to pay the Commodity Supplier, and the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to pay NCEA, scheduled amounts (the “Ledger Event Payments”) calculated to provide a sum sufficient (together with the interest component of the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits) to enable NCEA to pay interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate of 8.00% per annum. The Indenture provides that, subject to NCEA’s receipt of such Ledger Event Payments from the Commodity Supplier, interest on the Bonds will be -4-
<!-- Page 817 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

paid at the Increased Interest Rate after the occurrence of a Ledger Event. See “THE BONDS—Increased Interest Rate Upon Ledger Event,” “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Commodity Remarketing” and “—Ledger Event,” and “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT—J. Aron as Agent” and “—Ledger Event Payments.”

Commodity Delivery Termination Events. A Commodity Delivery Termination Date (a) will occur automatically under the Commodity Purchase Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events (“Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Events”), and (b) may be designated at the option of the Commodity Supplier upon the occurrence of a Ledger Event and certain other events (“Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Events”). Certain of these Commodity Delivery Termination Events also constitute Termination Payment Events under the Commodity Purchase Agreement as described below.

If a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs, the Delivery Period for Commodities under the Commodity Purchase Agreement will end and the Commodity Supplier will be required:

(a) in the case of a Commodity Delivery Termination Event that is a Termination Payment Event, to pay a scheduled termination payment (the “Termination Payment”) to the Trustee on the last Business Day of the Month following the Month in which the Termination Payment Event or, in the case of a Termination Payment Event due to a Failed Remarketing, on the last Business Day of the then-current Interest Rate Period (in either case, the “Early Termination Payment”); or

(b) in the case of a Commodity Delivery Termination Event that is not a Termination Payment Event, to pay scheduled monthly amounts to NCEA until the earlier of (i) the Month in which a Termination Payment Event occurs or (ii) the last date for such scheduled payments.

Termination Payment Events. The Commodity Delivery Termination Events that constitute a Termination Payment Event are described under the caption “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Early Termination” below, and include: (a) a failure of the Commodity Supplier to pay any amounts owed to NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement because of a failure by [__________] (the “Funding Recipient”) to pay when due any amounts owed to the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Funding Agreement (defined below) and such failure continues for 30 days after receipt by the Commodity Supplier and the Funding Recipient of notice thereof from NCEA; and (b) [exercise of Funding Recipient/Commodity Supplier Acceleration Option(s)].

If an Early Termination Payment Date occurs, the Bonds will be subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole on the first day of the following Month. The amount of the Termination Payment declines over time as the Commodity Supplier performs its Commodities delivery obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The amount of the Termination Payment, together with the amounts required to be on deposit in certain Funds and Accounts held by the Trustee, has been calculated to provide a sum at least sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of the Bonds, assuming that the Commodity Supplier, the Funding Recipient, the Investment Agreement Providers and the Project Participant pay and perform their respective contract obligations when due. A performance shortfall from any one of these entities could result in a payment shortfall to Bondholders.

If a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs that is not a Termination Payment Event, an Early Termination Payment Date will not occur under the Commodity Purchase Agreement until the earlier of (a) the
<!-- Page 818 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

occurrence of a Termination Payment Event or (b) the end of the Interest Rate Reset Period. In the event that the Funding Recipient does not exercise its option to prepay the Final Payment Amount, the scheduled monthly amounts required to be paid by the Commodity Supplier will be applied to make the debt service payments on the Bonds. The use of these scheduled payments (in lieu of payments made by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract) to make debt service payments could, under certain circumstances, adversely affect the continued tax-exempt status of the Bonds. See “INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS—Loss of Tax Exemption on the Bonds.”

See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT” and “THE BONDS—Redemption—Extraordinary Mandatory Redemption.” A schedule of the Termination Payment as of specified Early Termination Payment Dates under the Commodity Purchase Agreement during the Interest Rate Reset Period is attached as APPENDIX I.

THE FUNDING AGREEMENT

[to be revised/conformed]

The Commodity Supplier will use proceeds from the prepayment it receives from NCEA to purchase a Funding Agreement (the “Funding Agreement”) from the Funding Recipient. Such amount will be deposited into the “Funding Account” established under the Funding Agreement and will earn a fixed rate of interest. The Funding Agreement will mature by its terms on the Business Day preceding the Mandatory Purchase Date of the Bonds (the “Maturity Date”) unless terminated earlier. The Funding Agreement provides for monthly withdrawals of scheduled amounts (the “Scheduled Withdrawals”) from the Funding Account, including a final Scheduled Withdrawal of the unamortized balance of the Funding Account on the Maturity Date or any earlier termination date of the Funding Agreement. For a summary of certain provisions of the Funding Agreement, see “THE FUNDING AGREEMENT.” For certain information regarding [ ], see APPENDIX J.

The monthly Scheduled Withdrawals provide amounts sufficient to enable the Commodity Supplier to meet its payment obligations (other than those in respect of the Receivables Purchase Provisions) under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap.

The ability of the Commodity Supplier to meet its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap will directly and materially depend upon full and timely performance by the Funding Recipient under the Funding Agreement. Any failure by the Funding Recipient to timely pay the Scheduled Withdrawals or the Final Payment Amount when due under the Funding Agreement will result in an inability of the Commodity Supplier to meet its contract obligations to NCEA and a shortfall in the amounts necessary for NCEA to pay the principal, interest, Redemption Price and purchase price due on the Bonds. The Funding Agreement is an unsecured obligation of the Funding Recipient. See “INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS—Performance by Others.”

THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT

Under a Commodity Purchase, Sale and Service Agreement (the “Commodity Sale and Service Agreement”) between J. Aron and the Commodity Supplier, J. Aron has agreed to sell Commodities to the
<!-- Page 819 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Commodity Supplier on a pay-as-you-go basis in the quantities and at the delivery points necessary to enable the Commodity Supplier to meet its commodity delivery obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. J. Aron is obligated to make payments to the Commodity Supplier for Commodities not delivered or taken under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement for any reason, including force majeure events. J. Aron has also agreed to remarket Commodities and make payments to the Commodity Supplier that enable it to meet its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. J. Aron is appointed as the Commodity Supplier’s agent for taking all actions that the Commodity Supplier is required or permitted to take under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Re-Pricing Agreement and, with respect to ordinary course transactions, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. J. Aron’s commodity delivery, payment, remarketing and receivables purchase obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement mirror the Commodity Supplier’s obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The Commodity Supplier may net any amounts due and owing to it by J. Aron against its monthly payments to J. Aron, but J. Aron is not entitled to net any amounts due and owing to it against its monthly payments to the Commodity Supplier.

The payment obligations of J. Aron to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by GSG. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT.”

THE COMMODITY SUPPLY CONTRACT

Gas deliveries began under the 2018 Commodity Supply Contract on June 1, 2019. The Commodity Supply Contract provides for the sale to the Project Participant, on a pay-as-you-go basis, of all of the Commodities to be delivered to NCEA over the term of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. Under the Commodity Supply Contract, NCEA has agreed to deliver, and the Project Participant has agreed to purchase, the specified Contract Quantities of gas at designated delivery points during the Gas Delivery Period and the specified Hourly Quantities of electricity at designated delivery points during the Electricity Delivery Period. The Project Participant is obligated to pay NCEA for the quantities of Commodities delivered under the Commodity Supply Contract, including contracted quantities tendered for delivery by NCEA but not taken by the Project Participant (for which the Project Participant is eligible to receive a credit based on revenues received for the remarketed Commodities under certain circumstances described in such Commodity Supply Contract). The Project Participant has no obligation to pay for Commodities that NCEA fails to deliver. The Commodities sold under the Commodity Supply Contract are priced at the applicable “Contract Price,” which (a) in the case of the Contract Quantity of gas, is the applicable monthly market index price for the gas delivery point plus any applicable delivery point premium and (b) in the case of the Hourly Quantity of electricity, is the day-ahead market price for the electricity delivery point, in each case less a specified discount.

In addition to the provisions with respect to Assigned PPAs described above (see “The Commodity Purchase Agreement—Assigned Electricity”), the Commodity Supply Contract includes provisions that enable the Project Participant to enter into assignment agreements (“Gas Assignment Agreements”) to assign upstream gas supply contracts (“Upstream Supply Contracts”) to J. Aron during the Gas Delivery Period. If such assignments are accepted by J. Aron, the assigned quantities of gas (the “Assigned Gas Quantities”) under the Upstream Supply Contracts will be delivered to J. Aron for sale to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, and will be used to meet the Commodity Supplier’s obligations to deliver the Contract Quantity of gas to NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and the Commodity Swaps contain various provisions and adjustments that accommodate the assignment of Upstream Supply Contracts and Assigned PPAs.
<!-- Page 820 -->
Payments made by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract are paid to NCEA for deposit into the Revenue Fund. The required payments under the Commodity Supply Contract, together with any net amounts received by NCEA under the NCEA Commodity Swap described below, constitute the primary and expected sources of the revenues pledged to the payment of the Bonds. The obligations of the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract are payable solely from the revenues of its electric system. Under the Commodity Supply Contract, the Project Participant makes payments directly to the Trustee for deposit into the Revenue Fund. See “THE COMMODITY SUPPLY CONTRACT.”

THE COMMODITY SWAPS

Upon the execution of the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement, NCEA and J. Aron entered into commodity price swap agreements with RBC Europe Limited (“RBCEL”), as commodity swap counterparty. Under these swap agreements and during the Gas Delivery Period under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement: (a) NCEA pays an index (floating) natural gas price and receives a fixed natural gas price for notional quantities of natural gas at delivery points that correspond to the quantities and related delivery points under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement; and (b) J. Aron pays a fixed natural gas price and receives a floating natural gas price at the same pricing points for the same notional quantities, also corresponding to the quantities and related delivery points under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement.

Effective as of the Initial Issue Date:

(a) NCEA’s 2018 swap agreement will be amended and restated to (i) replace RBCEL with Royal Bank of Canada (“Royal Bank”) as the Commodity Swap Counterparty (by novation), and (ii) include notional quantities of natural gas with respect to the additional quantities of gas to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement; (as so novated, amended and restated, the “NCEA Commodity Swap”);

(b) J. Aron will novate and transfer all of its interests under its 2018 swap agreement to the Commodity Supplier and such 2018 swap agreement will be amended and restated to (i) replace RBCEL with Royal Bank as the Commodity Swap Counterparty (by novation), and (ii) include notional quantities of natural gas with respect to the additional quantities of gas to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (as so novated, amended and restated, the “Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap”); and

(c) The Commodity Supplier will enter into a Custodial Agreement with the Commodity Swap Counterparty and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee and as custodian (in such capacity, the “Custodian”), to administer payments under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap. NCEA will enter into a Custodial Agreement (the “NCEA Custodial Agreement” and, together with the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement, the “Custodial Agreements”), with the Commodity Swap Counterparty, the Trustee and the Custodian, to administer payments under the NCEA Commodity Swap. See “THE COMMODITY SWAPS—Custodial Agreement.”

During the Gas Delivery Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement: (a) under the NCEA Commodity Swap, NCEA pays a floating price to Royal Bank and receives a fixed price from Royal Bank for notional quantities that correspond to the Contract Quantity of gas and pricing points under the Commodity Purchase Agreement; and (b) under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Supplier pays
<!-- Page 821 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
a fixed price to Royal Bank and receives floating price from Royal Bank for the same notional quantities at the same pricing points. During the Electricity Delivery Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement: (a) under the NCEA Commodity Swap, NCEA pays a floating price based on the day-ahead market price of electricity to Royal Bank and receives a fixed price from Royal Bank for notional quantities that correspond to the Hourly Quantity of electricity and pricing points under the Commodity Purchase Agreement; and (b) under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Supplier pays a fixed price to Royal Bank and receives floating price from Royal Bank for the same notional quantities at the same pricing points. The notional quantities under the Commodity Swaps will be reduced to the extent of gas quantities delivered under fixed price Upstream Supply Contracts during the Gas Delivery Period and to the extent of electricity deliveries under fixed price Assigned PPAs during the Electricity Delivery Period.

The NCEA Commodity Swap and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap (together, the “Commodity Swaps”) have rolling two-month terms that renew automatically upon the payment due date of each monthly net settlement amount due thereunder through the term of the Delivery Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, unless an early termination date occurs under the Commodity Swaps. Each of the Commodity Swaps is subject to early termination upon the occurrence of certain events as described herein, including upon a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY SWAPS” and “THE COMMODITY SWAP COUNTERPARTY.”

DEBT SERVICE AND COMMODITY SWAP RESERVES

The Indenture establishes requirements for various funds and accounts, including the Debt Service Account, the Debt Service Reserve Account and the Commodity Swap Reserve Account. Scheduled Debt Service Deposits are required to be made monthly into the Debt Service Account in amounts equal to the accrued debt service on the Bonds. It is expected that the Debt Service Account, the Debt Service Reserve Account and the Commodity Swap Reserve Account will be invested pursuant to the Investment Agreements described herein. The providers of the Investment Agreements (the “Investment Agreement Providers”) are required to meet certain qualifications specified in the Indenture and will be selected on the date of Bond pricing pursuant to a competitive bidding process. See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS—Investment of Funds.”

The Debt Service Reserve Account and the Commodity Swap Reserve Account provide reserves for debt service deposits and payments under the NCEA Commodity Swap in the event of payment defaults by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract. The Debt Service Reserve Requirement is $________, which approximately equals the maximum monthly Scheduled Debt Service Deposit during the Interest Rate Reset Period. The Minimum Amount required to be on deposit in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account is approximately $________. The Debt Service Reserve Requirement and the Minimum Amount are sufficient to cover payment defaults by the Project Participant for two months of maximum natural gas deliveries during the Interest Rate Reset Period at a monthly market gas index price of approximately $______/MMBtu. The monthly market index prices of the gas for delivery under the Commodity Supply Contract in the month of [________] is $______/MMBtu.

# RECEIVABLES PURCHASE PROVISIONS

**Swap Call Receivables.** If a payment default by the Project Participant results in a deficiency of the funds necessary to pay amounts due under the NCEA Commodity Swap (a “Swap Payment Deficiency”), the Commodity Supplier has the option under the Receivables Purchase Provisions to purchase from the Trustee the rights to payment of net amounts owed by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract (“Swap Call Receivables”) in an amount sufficient to fund the Swap Payment Deficiency. The failure of the Commodity Supplier to exercise its option to purchase Swap Call Receivables is an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Receivables Purchase Provisions.”

**Elective Call Receivables.** If the Project Participant defaults on its obligation to make any payment under its Commodity Supply Contract and such payment default does not result in a Swap Payment Deficiency, the Commodity Supplier has the option under the Receivables Purchase Provisions to purchase from the Trustee the receivables relating to such payment default (the “Elective Call Receivables” and, together with the Swap Call Receivables, “Call Receivables”). The Commodity Supplier may elect, in its discretion, to purchase the Elective Call Receivables at any time. The failure of the Commodity Supplier to not make such election does not constitute an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Receivables Purchase Provisions” herein.

**Purchase by J. Aron.** Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, J. Aron has agreed to purchase all Receivables purchased by the Commodity Supplier under the Receivables Purchase Provisions, provided that such obligation is subject to J. Aron having consented to the purchase of such Call Receivables by the Commodity Supplier. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT.”

## RE-PRICING PROVISIONS

On the Initial Issue Date of the Bonds, NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will enter into an Amended and Restated Re-Pricing Agreement (the “Re-Pricing Agreement”), which provides for (a) the determination of Commodity delivery periods (“Reset Periods”) subsequent to the Reset Period that corresponds to the Interest Rate Reset Period on the Bonds and (b) the calculation of the amount of the discount (in cents per MMBtu or in dollars per MWh, as applicable) from the Contract Price of the Commodities that is available (the “Available Discount”) for sales of Commodities to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract during each Reset Period.

The Reset Period that corresponds to the Interest Rate Reset Period on the Bonds begins on __________ and ends on the last day of __________, and the next Reset Period is expected to begin on __________. In the event that the Available Discount for any Reset Period is less than the minimum discount specified in the Commodity Supply Contract (which includes both monthly discounts and any annual refunds), the Project Participant may elect not to take Commodities during the Reset Period and to have the Commodities remarketed for the duration of the Reset Period (a “Remarketing Election”) by giving notice of such election to NCEA. Any Commodity that is covered by a Remarketing Election will be remarketed in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Commodity Purchase Agreement. In the event that the Project Participant makes a Remarketing Election with respect to such Reset Period, J. Aron will have the right, but not the obligation, to designate a CSSA Early Termination Date under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, which designation is a Termination Payment Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE RE-

<!-- Page 825 -->
# STRUCTURE OF THE COMMODITY PROJECT

The expected and intended source of the Revenues and other amounts to be used to pay the debt service on the Bonds are (a) the amounts payable by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, (b) any net amounts payable to NCEA under the NCEA Commodity Swap and (c) the principal amounts payable by the Investment Agreement Provider for the Debt Service Account. The Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract, the Investment Agreements, the Commodity Swaps, the Indenture, the Bonds and related agreements have been structured so that, assuming timely performance and payment by the Funding Recipient, GSG (as the guarantor of J. Aron’s payment obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement), the Investment Agreement Providers and the Project Participant of their respective contract obligations, the Revenues (defined herein) available to NCEA from the Commodity Project are calculated to be sufficient at all times to provide for the timely payment of the scheduled Debt Service requirements on the Bonds and the amounts due by NCEA under the NCEA Commodity Swap and the other Operating Expenses of the Commodity Project. These arrangements include:

- The Commodity Supplier is required to deliver Commodities under the Commodity Purchase Agreement in specified quantities at designated delivery points that correspond to the quantities of Commodities and delivery points that NCEA has committed to serve under the Commodity Supply Contract. In the event the Commodity Supplier fails to deliver the Commodities for any reason, including force majeure events, it is required to pay specified amounts to NCEA. In the event that the Assigned Gas Quantity or the Assigned Prepay Quantity is not delivered or taken under an Upstream Supply Contract or an Assigned PPA, NCEA is deemed to have requested that the Commodity Supplier remarket such assigned quantity, and the Commodity Supplier is required to pay specified amounts to NCEA.

- J. Aron is required to sell and deliver Commodities under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement in specified quantities at designated delivery points that correspond to the quantities of Commodities and the delivery points that the Commodity Supplier has committed to serve under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. In the event J. Aron fails to deliver such Commodities for any reason, including force majeure events, it is required to pay certain specified amounts to the Commodity Supplier. The Commodity Supplier may not any amounts due and owing to it by J. Aron against its monthly payments to J. Aron, but J. Aron is not entitled to net any amounts due and owing to it against its monthly payments to the Commodity Supplier.

- The Scheduled Withdrawal Amounts required to be paid by the Funding Recipient under the Funding Agreement will provide the Commodity Supplier with amounts sufficient to make the payments it is required to make to J. Aron under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and any net amounts due to the Commodity Swap Counterparty under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap.

- The Project Participant has agreed to pay for Commodities tendered for delivery under the Commodity Supply Contract at the applicable Contract Price, and to pay specified damages to NCEA for a failure to accept Commodities tendered for delivery by NCEA, subject to the terms of the Commodity Supply Contract and the provisions with respect to a failure to take the Assigned Gas Quantity or the Assigned Prepay Quantity.

-13-
<!-- Page 826 -->
- In the event that the Project Participant fails to pay when due any amounts owed under the Commodity Supply Contract (whether for Commodities taken or damages for Commodities tendered but not taken), NCEA has covenanted in the Indenture to exercise its right under the Commodity Supply Contract to suspend further deliveries of Commodities to the Project Participant.

- In the event of a suspension of Commodity deliveries, J. Aron will remarket such quantities of Commodities pursuant to the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement in compliance with the requirements of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The Commodity Purchase Agreement requires specified payments for all Commodities remarketed or purchased, less certain applicable fees.

- In the event that any non-complying remarketing sales of Commodities are not remediated within two years and exceed certain cumulative limits, a Ledger Event will occur, subject to certain provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If a Ledger Event occurs, J. Aron will be obligated to pay the Commodity Supplier, and the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to pay NCEA, scheduled Ledger Event Payments calculated to provide a sum sufficient (together with the interest component of the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits) to enable NCEA to pay interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate of 8.00% per annum. The Indenture provides that, subject to NCEA’s receipt of such Ledger Event Payments from the Commodity Supplier, interest on the Bonds will be paid at the Increased Interest Rate after the occurrence of a Ledger Event.

- If the Commodity Swap Counterparty does not make a required payment under the NCEA Commodity Swap and such payment remains unpaid after the expiration of any grace period, the Custodian under the terms of the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement will pay the amount that the Commodity Supplier paid under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap (or in the event of termination of the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the amount that the Commodity Supplier paid into the custodial account as if the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap were still in effect), which such amount is held in custody, to NCEA, and such payment will be treated as a Commodity Swap Receipt for purposes of the Indenture.

- If the Commodity Swap Counterparty does not make a required payment under the NCEA Commodity Swap and such payment remains unpaid after the expiration of any grace period, the Custodian under the terms of the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement will pay the amount that the Commodity Supplier paid under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap (or in the event of termination of the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the amount that the Commodity Supplier paid into the custodial account as if the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap were still in effect), which such amount is held in custody, to NCEA, and such payment will be treated as a Commodity Swap Receipt.

- If a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier is required to pay scheduled monthly amounts to NCEA in lieu of Commodity deliveries, which amounts are sufficient to enable NCEA to make the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits required by the Indenture.
<!-- Page 827 -->
- If an [Event of Default] occurs under the Funding Agreement, the Funding Recipient is required to pay the [Final Payment Amount] to the Commodity Supplier.

- If a Termination Payment Event occurs under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier is required to pay the scheduled Termination Payment to the Trustee.

- The amounts required to be paid by the Investment Agreement Providers under the Investment Agreements will, together with the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits and the other amounts required to be deposited into the Debt Service Account, provide sufficient monies to NCEA to pay debt service.

**PERFORMANCE BY OTHERS**

The ability of NCEA to pay timely the scheduled debt service on the Bonds depends on the timely performance and payment by (a) the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, (b) the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract and (c) the Investment Agreement Providers under the Investment Agreements. The failure by any one or more of such parties to meet such obligations could materially and adversely affect the ability of NCEA to pay timely the scheduled debt service on the Bonds, and to meet its other obligations under the Indenture, the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract and the NCEA Commodity Swap.

The ability of the Commodity Supplier to meet its performance and payment obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and the Commodity Swap will depend directly and materially on timely payment by the Funding Recipient of the scheduled payments due under the Funding Agreement and on timely payment and performance by J. Aron of its obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. The failure by the Funding Recipient or J. Aron to meet such obligations would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Commodity Supplier to meet its contract obligations to NCEA and, in turn, the ability of NCEA to meet its contract obligations to the Project Participant. The failure by the Funding Recipient to meet such obligations would materially and adversely affect the ability of NCEA to pay timely the scheduled debt service on the Bonds.

The events and conditions that could result in a default in the payment of debt service on the Bonds, include items that may be within or outside the control of NCEA or the Commodity Supplier (or both), such as:

- failure by the Funding Recipient to make timely payment of the scheduled amounts due under the Funding Agreement would result in an Early Termination Payment Event and a default in the payment of debt service on the Bonds;

- failure by the Project Participant in the timely payment of the amounts due under the Commodity Supply Agreement could result in a default in the payment of debt service on the Bonds if such non-payments exceed the amount on deposit in the Debt Service Reserve Account;

- failure by an Investment Agreement Provider to make timely payment of the required amounts due or payable under the Investment Agreements, including upon non-payment by the Project. 

-15-
<!-- Page 828 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Page)  
Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, could result in a default in the payment of debt service on the Bonds; and and  
• failure by the Commodity Swap Counterparty to make timely payment of the amounts due under the NCEA Commodity Swap coupled with a failure in the timely performance and enforcement of the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap could result in a default in the payment of debt service on the Bonds.  

The Commodity Purchase Agreement will terminate automatically upon the occurrence of a Termination Payment Event. If a Termination Payment Event occurs during the Initial Interest Rate Period (a) the Funding Recipient will be obligated to pay to the Commodity Supplier the final [Scheduled Withdrawal] due under the Funding Agreement, (b) the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to pay the scheduled Termination Payment on the Early Termination Payment Date, and (c) the Bonds will be subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption.  

The scheduled amount of the Termination Payment, together with the amounts required to be on deposit in certain Funds and Accounts held by the Trustee, has been calculated to provide NCEA with an amount at least sufficient to redeem all of the Bonds, assuming that the Commodity Supplier, the Funding Recipient and the Investment Agreement Providers pay and perform their respective contract obligations when due. If the Termination Payment becomes payable, the Bonds are to be redeemed at their Amortized Value, regardless of reinvestment rates at the time. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Early Termination” and “THE BONDS—Redemption—Extraordinary Mandatory Redemption.”  

COMMODITY REMARKETING  

If the Project Participant does not require or is unable to receive all or any portion of the Commodities that it is obligated to purchase under the Commodity Supply Contract as a result of decreased gas requirements due to reduced generation requirements during the Gas Delivery Period or decreased demand by the Project Participant’s retail customers or for other reasons permitting remarketing thereunder, it may request that NCEA arrange for the Commodity Supplier to remarket such Commodity. Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier has agreed, upon written notice from NCEA or the Trustee, to use commercially reasonable efforts to remarket or cause to be remarked on, a daily or monthly basis, such amounts of Commodities as are identified by NCEA, including Commodities that are covered by a Remarketing Election given by the Project Participant with respect to a Reset Period. In the event that the Commodity Supplier is unable to remarket all or any portion of such Commodity, the Commodity Supplier will purchase the Commodity for its own account.  

The Commodity Supplier has agreed to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remarket the Commodities to Municipal Utilities pursuant to provisions that are intended to maintain the tax-exempt status of interest on the Bonds (“Qualified Sales”), but, if the Commodity Supplier cannot do so, the Commodity Supplier is also permitted to remarket such Commodity to other governmental entities in non-private business sales (“Non-Private Business Sales”), although it is not required to remarket Commodities at a price that is less than the minimum remarketing price specified in the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If the Commodity Supplier is unable to remarket Commodity in Qualified Sales or Non-Private Business Sales, it must purchase the Commodity for its own account (a private business use sale). Under certain circumstances and upon reaching certain thresholds that are not timely remediated, the remarketing of Commodities to entities other than  

-16-
<!-- Page 829 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

Municipal Utilities and the purchase of Commodities by the Commodity Supplier could result in a Ledger Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

The Commodity Supplier will depend upon performance by J. Aron under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to meet its commodity remarketing obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, including particularly the ability of J. Aron to remarket Commodities in Qualified Sales to Municipal Utilities and to remediate any non-complying sales in order avoid the occurrence of a Ledger Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. In the event that any non-complying remarketing sales of Commodities are not remediated within two years and exceed certain cumulative limits, a Ledger Event will occur, subject to certain provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

The occurrence of a Ledger Event [provides the Commodity Supplier with the option to designate a Commodity Delivery Termination Date, and provides the Funding Recipient with the option to exercise the Funding Recipient Acceleration Option which, if exercised, would result in a Termination Payment Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement and a mandatory redemption of the Bonds. If a Ledger Event occurs, and J. Aron does not exercise the [________] Acceleration Option, J. Aron will be obligated to pay the Commodity Supplier, and the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to pay NCEA, scheduled Ledger Event Payments calculated to provide a sum sufficient to enable NCEA to pay interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate of 8.00% per annum. The Indenture provides that, subject to NCEA’s receipt of such Ledger Event Payments from the Commodity Supplier, interest on the Bonds will be paid at the Increased Interest Rate after the occurrence of a Ledger Event. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Commodity Remarketing” and “—Ledger Event Payments,” and “THE BONDS—Increased Interest Rate Upon Ledger Event.” 

The Commodity Project will deliver an average of [____] million MMBtu of natural gas each year to the Project Participant during the Gas Delivery Period [and is expected to deliver [____] MWh of electricity each year to the Project Participant during the Electricity Delivery Period]. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Commodities Remarketing.”

LIMITATIONS ON EXERCISE OF REMEDIES

The remedies available to NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement are limited to those described herein. NCEA has no rights to enforce the provisions of the Funding Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement or the related CSSA Guaranty (defined below) provided to the Commodity Supplier. Neither the Trustee nor the Bondholders have any rights to enforce the Funding Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement or the CSSA Guaranty. See “GSG, J. ARON AND THE COMMODITY SUPPLIER—The Commodity Supplier—Organization” for a description of certain consent and voting rights of the director appointed by NCEA to the Commodity Supplier’s board of directors and related covenants of NCEA.

The remedies available to the Trustee, NCEA and the Holders of the Bonds upon an Event of Default under the Indenture are in many respects dependent upon judicial actions which are often subject to discretion and delay. Under existing constitutional and statutory provisions and judicial decisions, the remedies provided in the Indenture may not be readily available or may be limited.

-17-
<!-- Page 830 -->
![ENFORCEABILITY OF CONTRACTS](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=ENFORCEABILITY+OF+CONTRACTS)

**ENFORCEABILITY OF CONTRACTS**

The enforceability of the various legal agreements relating to the Commodity Project may be limited by bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors or secured parties generally and by the exercise of judicial discretion in accordance with general principles of equity and by principles of equity, public policy and commercial reasonableness. The Commodity Purchase Agreement and other agreements relating to the Commodity Project are executory contracts. If NCEA or the Funding Recipient, the Commodity Supplier, J. Aron, GSG, the Commodity Swap Counterparty, the Investment Agreement Provider, the Project Participant or any of the parties with which NCEA has contracted under such agreements (including the Commodity Purchase Agreement) is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, the relevant agreement could be discharged in return for a claim for damages against the party’s estate with uncertain value. In particular, an insolvency event with respect to the Funding Recipient that results in a delay or a reduction in the payments due under the Funding Agreement will result in insufficient amounts being available for the payment of the Bonds, whether on a Bond Payment Date, the Mandatory Tender Date or any extraordinary mandatory redemption date. In the event that NCEA is involved in an insolvency proceeding, the exercise of the remedies afforded to the Trustee under the Indenture may be stayed, and the availability of the Revenues necessary for the payment of the Bonds could be materially and adversely affected.

**NO ESTABLISHED TRADING MARKET**

The Bonds constitute a new issue with no established trading market. The Bonds have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance upon exemptions contained therein. The Underwriter has informed NCEA that it currently intends to make a market in the Bonds, the Underwriter is not obligated to do so and may discontinue any such market making at any time without notice. There can be no assurance as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Bonds. If an active public market does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Bonds may be adversely affected.

**LOSS OF TAX EXEMPTION**

As described below, the opinion of Bond Counsel with respect to the exclusion of interest on the Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment of the Bonds for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or the courts, and is not a guarantee of a result.

The Indenture, NCEA’s Tax Agreement with respect to the Bonds, the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Supply Contract contain various covenants and agreements on the part of NCEA, the Commodity Supplier and the Project Participant that are intended to establish and maintain the tax-exempt status of the interest on the Bonds. NCEA, the Commodity Supplier and the Project Participant have each agreed to abide by the various covenants and agreements designed to protect the tax-exempt status of the Bonds. A failure by NCEA, the Commodity Supplier and the Project Participant to comply with such covenants and agreements could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the tax-exempt status of the Bonds.

The IRS has an ongoing program of auditing tax-exempt obligations to determine whether, in the view of the IRS, interest on such tax-exempt obligations is includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. It cannot be predicted whether or not the IRS will commence an audit of the Bonds.

-18-
<!-- Page 831 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

If an audit is commenced, under current procedures the IRS may treat NCEA as a taxpayer and the Bondholders may have no right to participate in such procedure. The commencement of an audit could adversely affect the market value and liquidity of the Bonds until the audit is concluded, regardless of the ultimate outcome.

Any loss of the tax-exempt status of the Bonds could be retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds and could cause all of the interest on the Bonds to be includable in gross income for purposes of federal income taxation. The loss of the tax-exempt status of the Bonds is not a termination event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement and will not result in a mandatory redemption of the Bonds. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Ledger Event” and “TAX MATTERS.”

# SECURITY FOR THE BONDS

## THE INDENTURE

The Bonds are limited obligations of NCEA payable solely from and secured solely by a pledge of and lien on the “Trust Estate,” which is defined in the Indenture as follows: (a) the proceeds of the sale of the Bonds, (b) all right, title and interest of NCEA in, to and under the Commodity Supply Contract, (c) the Revenues, (d) any Termination Payment or the right to receive such Termination Payment (subject to the Collateral Agency Agreement), (e) all right, title and interest of NCEA in, to and under the Receivables Purchase Provisions, including payments received from the Commodity Supplier pursuant thereto, (f) all right, title and interest of NCEA in, to and under each Interest Rate Swap and the Interest Rate Swap Receipts, and (g) the Pledged Funds (but excluding Rebate Payments held in any Fund or Account), including the investment income, if any, therefrom.

- Fees of rating agencies necessary to maintain ratings on the Bonds
- Litigation judgments and settlements and indemnification payments in connection with the payment of any litigation judgment or settlement and Extraordinary Expenses are not Operating Expenses.

**Bonds and Obligations**

The BONDS DO NOT CONSTITUTE A DEBT OR LIABILITY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR OF ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF (INCLUDING THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT), OTHER THAN NCEA, BUT SHALL BE PAYABLE SOLELY FROM THE FUNDS PROVIDED THEREFOR UNDER THE INDENTURE. NCEA SHALL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO PAY THE PRINCIPAL OR REDEMPTION PRICE OF OR INTEREST ON THE BONDS, EXCEPT FROM THE FUNDS PROVIDED THEREFOR UNDER THE INDENTURE AND NEITHER THE FAITH AND CREDIT NOR THE TAXING POWER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR OF ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF, INCLUDING NCEA, OR OF THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT IS PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OR REDEMPTION PRICE OF AND INTEREST ON THE BONDS. THE ISSUANCE OF THE BONDS SHALL NOT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OR CONTINGENTLY OBLIGATE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF (INCLUDING THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT) TO LEVY OR TO PLEDGE ANY FORM OF TAXATION OR TO MAKE ANY APPROPRIATION FOR THEIR PAYMENT. NCEA HAS NO TAXING POWER.

The obligation of the Project Participant to make payments to NCEA under the Commodity Supply Contract is not, nor shall it be construed as, a guaranty or endorsement of or a surety for, the Bonds. Such obligation of the Project Participant is not a general obligation of the Project Participant, and is payable solely from the revenues derived from the operation of its electric system. The Indenture does not mortgage the Commodity Project or any tangible properties or assets of NCEA or the Project Participant.

![Flow of Funds](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Flow+of+Funds)

See APPENDIX C for the meanings of certain defined terms, and see APPENDIX D for a further description of certain provisions of the Indenture.

**FLOW OF FUNDS**

All Revenues are required by the Indenture to be deposited upon receipt thereof to the credit of the Revenue Fund. Moneys must be disbursed from the Revenue Fund monthly, on or before the days and to the extent and in the manner and order set forth below:

1. First, into the Operating Fund, not later than the 25th day of such Month, the amount, if any, required so that the balance therein shall equal the amount estimated to be necessary for the payment of Commodity Swap Payments coming due for such Month and other Operating Expenses coming due for the following Month (but no such payments or expenses for any prior Month); provided that, in the event that the amount on deposit in the Operating Fund is not sufficient to pay the Commodity Swap Payments due in any Month, the amount available therein shall be applied to the payment of the amounts due under the NCEA Commodity Swap in effect;

2. Second, into the Debt Service Fund, not later than the last Business Day of such Month for the credit to the Debt Service Account an amount equal to the greater of (A) the Scheduled Debt Service Deposit, as set forth in Schedule II to the Indenture, or (B) the amount necessary to cause the cumulative Scheduled Debt Service Deposits to be on deposit therein (without credit for undisbursed Interest Rate Swap Receipts on deposit therein);

3. Third, into the Commodity Swap Reserve Account in the Project Fund, not later than the last Business Day of such Month, the amount, if any, required so that the balance in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account is at least equal to the Minimum Amount;

4. Fourth, into the Debt Service Fund, not later than the last Business Day of such Month, for deposit in the Debt Service Reserve Account, the amount, if any, required so that the balance in such Debt Service Reserve Account shall equal the Debt Service Reserve Requirement related thereto as of the last day of the then current Month; and

5. Fifth, to the Commodity Supplier, not later than the last Business Day of such Month, the amount, if any, required for the repurchase of Call Receivables and the payment of interest on all Call Receivables sold to the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Provisions.

If, after the scheduled monthly deposit to the Debt Service Account, the balance therein is below the cumulative Scheduled Debt Service Deposits for such month as specified in the Indenture, the Trustee shall (a) promptly notify NCEA of such deficiency and if the Project Participant is in default under the Commodity Supply Contract and NCEA has not previously done so, cause NCEA to suspend all deliveries of all quantities of natural gas or electricity to the Project Participant, and (b) promptly give notice to the Commodity Supplier to follow the provision set forth in the remarketing provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

On each [_____] 1, 20[__], after making such transfers, credits and deposits as described in the first paragraph of this section “Flow of Funds,” and after the applicable Principal Installment payment date, the Trustee shall credit to the General Fund the remaining balance in the Revenue Fund. See

-21-
<!-- Page 834 -->
“Revenues and Revenue Fund; Deposits of Other Amounts” and “Payments from Revenue Fund” in APPENDIX D.

As noted above, certain amounts are pledged as a part of the Trust Estate but do not constitute Revenues and are not deposited into the Revenue Fund, including (a) any Termination Payment received under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, which is to be deposited directly into the Redemption Account of the Debt Service Fund, (b) any Assignment Payment shall be deposited directly into the Assignment Payment Fund, (c) amounts received from the Commodity Supplier under the Receivables Purchase Provisions shall be deposited by the Trustee into the Commodity Swap Reserve Account as provided in the Indenture, (d) any Interest Rate Swap Receipts shall be deposited directly into the Debt Service Account, (e) any Seller Swap MTM Payment shall be deposited into the Swap Termination Account and applied as provided in the Indenture, (f) any amounts to be deposited into the Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund shall be deposited directly therein, (g) any Additional Termination Payment shall be paid to, or upon Written Instructions provided by, NCEA, (h) Ledger Amount Payments received from the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement shall be deposited directly into the Debt Service Account, (i) any Investment Agreement Breakage Amount payable to NCEA shall be deposited into the Investment Agreement Breakage Account, and [j] amounts received from the Project Participant in respect of the Supply Administration Fee shall be remitted to NCEA.]

DEBT SERVICE ACCOUNT

The Indenture establishes a Debt Service Account, which is held by the Trustee. The amounts deposited into the Debt Service Account, including capitalized interest deposited on the Initial Issue Date, must be held in such Account and applied to the payment of Debt Service payable on the Bonds on each Bond Payment Date when due and to the payment of the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on Bonds to be redeemed on each redemption date. Amounts on deposit in the Debt Service Account will be invested pursuant to the Investment Agreement, which will permit scheduled withdrawals to pay debt service on the Bonds and, in the case of extraordinary redemption, to pay the Redemption Price without penalty or market value adjustments.

DEBT SERVICE RESERVE ACCOUNT

The Indenture establishes a Debt Service Reserve Account which is held by the Trustee. Amounts in the Debt Service Reserve Account must be applied only to (a) make the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits to the Debt Service Account when the Revenues and other available amounts are insufficient or (b) redeem or defease Bonds.

The Debt Service Reserve Requirement is $_________*, which approximately equals 200% of the maximum monthly Scheduled Debt Service Deposit to be made to the Debt Service Account during the Interest Rate Reset Period from the amounts payable by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract. On the date of issuance of the Bonds, NCEA will deposit an amount equal to the Debt Service Reserve Requirement into the Debt Service Reserve Account, which amount will be invested pursuant to the Investment Agreement. See “ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS” above. See also “—Investment Agreement” below.

* Preliminary, subject to change.  
-22-
<!-- Page 835 -->
# REDEMPTION ACCOUNT

The Indenture establishes a Redemption Account, which is held by the Trustee. On any Early Termination Payment Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier is directed to pay the Termination Payment directly to the Trustee for the account of NCEA into the Redemption Account. The Trustee will deposit the Termination Payment into the Redemption Account and will apply such amounts to the payment of the Redemption Price of the Bonds as described below under “THE BONDS—Redemption—Extraordinary Mandatory Redemption.”

# COMMODITY SWAP RESERVE ACCOUNT

The Indenture establishes a Commodity Swap Reserve Account in the Project Fund, which is held by the Trustee. NCEA will deposit in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account a portion of the proceeds in an amount equal to $ * (the “Minimum Amount”), which shall be paid from time to time by the Trustee solely to the payment of Commodity Swap Payments in the event the amounts on deposit in the Operating Fund are not sufficient to make such payments; provided, however, that (a) in the event that the amount on deposit in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account is not sufficient to pay the Commodity Swap Payments due in any Month, the amount available in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account shall be applied pro rata to the payment of the amounts due under the Commodity Swaps then in effect, (b) any amounts in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account in excess of the Minimum Amount shall be transferred to the Revenue Fund and (c) any amounts remaining on deposit in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account on the final date for payment of the principal of the Bonds, whether upon maturity, redemption or otherwise, shall be applied to make such payment. The amount deposited in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account will be invested pursuant to the Investment Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT – Receivables Purchase Provisions—Call Option” and “– Investment of Funds” below.

# NO ADDITIONAL BONDS

Other than the Bonds and any refunding bonds, no additional bonds may be issued under the Indenture.

# AMENDMENT OF INDENTURE

NCEA and the Trustee may, subject to the conditions and restrictions in the Indenture, enter into a Supplemental Indenture or Indentures without the consent of the Bondholders for certain purposes and upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. See “Supplemental Indenture Not Requiring Consent of Bondholders,” “General Provisions” and “Powers of Amendment” in APPENDIX D hereto.

# INVESTMENT OF FUNDS

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, amounts on deposit in the Funds and Accounts may be invested in, among other things, guaranteed investment contracts, forward delivery agreements or similar agreements that provide for a specified rate of return over a specified time period with providers (or their guarantors) rated at the time the investment is made at least at the same credit rating level as the Funding Recipient. See APPENDIX C—DEFINITIONS OF CERTAIN TERMS and “Investment of Certain Funds” in APPENDIX D.

-23-
<!-- Page 836 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

On the Initial Issue Date of the Bonds, it is expected that the Trustee will enter into one or more investment agreements with respect to the Debt Service Account (the “Debt Service Account Investment Agreement”) and the Commodity Swap Reserve Account and the Debt Service Reserve Account (the “Reserve Accounts Investment Agreement”) and, together with the Debt Service Account Investment Agreement, the “Investment Agreements.” Each Investment Agreement will have a term coterminous with the Initial Interest Rate Period and is required to meet all of the criteria of a Qualified Investment under the Indenture. The Investment Agreements will be bid out on the day of Bond pricing to qualified investment providers.

Required qualifications for the initial Investment Agreement providers (the “Investment Agreement Providers”) include: (a) a minimum credit rating requirement for the provider (or its guarantor) of at least “[__]” from Moody’s, (b) a requirement that upon a credit rating withdrawal, suspension or downgrade of an Investment Agreement Provider (or its guarantor) below the lower of “[Baa1]” by Moody’s or the then-current credit rating of the Funding Recipient, the Investment Agreement Provider will provide a credit remedy, such as providing credit support, or NCEA will have the right to terminate the Investment Agreement and (c) a requirement that upon a credit downgrade of the provider (or its guarantor) below the lower of “[Baa3]” by Moody’s, NCEA will have the option to terminate the Investment Agreement.

If an Investment Agreement terminates, all invested funds are returned to the Trustee and a market value adjustment payment is made or received, as applicable.

Each Investment Agreement will provide for a fixed interest rate to be paid on the funds invested. The Debt Service Account Investment Agreement will provide for scheduled withdrawals in connection with each Bond Payment Date. The Reserve Accounts Investment Agreement will permit (a) withdrawals from the Commodity Swap Reserve Account to make up payment shortfalls to the Commodity Swap Counterparty, and (b) withdrawals from the Debt Service Reserve Account to cure any deficiencies in the Debt Service Account. Upon transaction termination, whether by extraordinary mandatory redemption or final maturity, the funds invested under the Investment Agreements will be used to pay the redemption price or debt service due on the Bonds.

**ENFORCEMENT OF PROJECT AGREEMENTS**

**Commodity Supply Contract.** NCEA has covenanted in the Indenture that it will enforce the provisions of the Commodity Supply Contract, as well as any other contract or contracts entered into relating to the Commodity Project, and that it will duly perform its covenants and agreements thereunder.

NCEA has also covenanted to exercise promptly its right to suspend all Commodity deliveries under the Commodity Supply Contract if the Project Participant fails to pay when due any amounts owed thereunder and to promptly give notice to the Commodity Supplier to follow the Commodity remarketing provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement for each month of such suspension with respect to the quantities of Commodities for which deliveries have been suspended.

In the event that the Project Participant makes a Remarketing Election with respect to any Reset Period, NCEA will promptly give notice to the Commodity Supplier to follow the provisions set forth in the Remarketing Exhibit to the Commodity Purchase Agreement for each month of such Reset Period with respect to any quantities of Commodities that would otherwise have been delivered to the Project Participant. See “THE RE-PRICING AGREEMENT.”

<!-- Page 837 -->
NCEA has further covenanted that it will not consent or agree to or permit any termination or rescission of, any assignment or novation (in whole or in part) by the Project Participant of, or any amendment to, or otherwise take any action under or in connection with, a Commodity Supply Contract that will impair the ability of NCEA to comply during the current or any future year with the collection of fees and charges pursuant to the Indenture without a Rating Confirmation. Under the Indenture, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, including delivery of a Rating Confirmation, NCEA may amend a Commodity Supply Contract or assign all or a portion of the Project Participant’s rights and obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract.

**Commodity Remarketing.** In the event that the Project Participant fails to pay when due any amounts owed to NCEA under a Commodity Supply Contract, NCEA shall promptly give notice to the Commodity Supplier to follow the provisions set forth in the Remarketing Exhibit to the Commodity Purchase Agreement for each Month of such suspension with respect to the quantities of Commodities for which deliveries have been suspended.

**Trustee as Agent.** Under the Indenture, NCEA has appointed, authorized and directed the Trustee as its agent, subject to the terms of the Indenture, to issue notices and to take any other actions that NCEA is required or permitted to take under (a) the Commodity Supply Contract, (b) the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (c) the Receivables Purchase Provisions, and (d) the NCEA Commodity Swap. NCEA has retained, in the absence of any conflicting action by the Trustee, the right to exercise any rights for which it has appointed the Trustee as its agent as described in the preceding sentence; provided, however, if an Event of Default has occurred, the Trustee will have the right to notify NCEA to cease exercising such rights, and upon NCEA’s receipt of such notice, and subject to certain rights of the Commodity Supplier and the Commodity Swap Counterparty, the Trustee will have exclusive authority to exercise such rights.

**Commodity Purchase Agreement.** NCEA has covenanted in the Indenture that it will enforce the provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and that it will duly perform its covenants and agreements under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

The Trustee will promptly notify NCEA upon becoming aware of any payment default that has occurred and is continuing on the part of the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. NCEA will provide the Trustee with Written Notice of the Early Termination Payment Date (a) by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the fifth Business Day preceding a Mandatory Purchase Date if an amount equal to the Purchase Price of the Bonds that are subject to such Mandatory Purchase Date has not been deposited with the Trustee and (b) in all other cases, not more than five days after such date is determined.

NCEA has further covenanted that it will not consent or agree to or permit any rescission or assignment of or amendment to or otherwise take any action under or in connection with the Commodity Purchase Agreement which would in any manner materially impair or materially adversely affect its rights thereunder or the rights or security of the Bondholders under the Indenture; provided, that the Commodity Purchase Agreement may be assigned or amended without Bondholder consent upon receipt of a Rating Confirmation.

**NCEA Commodity Swap.** Amounts due to NCEA under the NCEA Commodity Swap are payable directly to the Trustee for deposit into the Revenue Fund. The following restrictions apply to the replacement or termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap: 

-25-
<!-- Page 838 -->
(a) NCEA agrees that it will not exercise any right to declare an early termination date under the NCEA Commodity Swap unless either (i) it has entered into a replacement NCEA Commodity Swap in accordance with the provisions described below, and such replacement NCEA Commodity Swap will be effective as of such early termination date and cover price exposure from and after such early termination date, or (ii) a “Commodity Delivery Termination Date” has occurred or has been designated under (and as such term is defined in) the Commodity Purchase Agreement prior to or as of such early termination date.

(b) NCEA may replace the NCEA Commodity Swap (and any related guaranty of a Commodity Swap Counterparty’s obligations thereunder) with a similar agreement for the same hedging purposes with an alternate Commodity Swap Counterparty at any time upon delivery to the Trustee of a Rating Confirmation.

(c) If the NCEA Commodity Swap is subject to termination or is terminated by either party in accordance with its terms, then (i) NCEA may, subject to clause (a) above, terminate such NCEA Commodity Swap if NCEA has the right to do so, and (ii) (A) NCEA may replace such NCEA Commodity Swap by exercising its right to increase its notional quantities under another NCEA Commodity Swap with another Commodity Swap Counterparty if such NCEA Commodity Swap is in effect and is not subject to termination, or (B) if NCEA cannot increase its notional quantities as described in clause (A) or if NCEA desires to enter into a new NCEA Commodity Swap in order to reduce its notional quantities under the NCEA Commodity Swap to their level previous following an existing Commodity Swap with an alternate Commodity Swap Counterparty without Rating Confirmation, but only if the replacement NCEA Commodity Swap is identical in all material respects to the existing NCEA Commodity Swap, except for the identity of the Commodity Swap Counterparty, and (1) the replacement Commodity Swap Counterparty (or its credit support provider under such NCEA Commodity Swap) is then rated at least the lower of (a) the Minimum Rating or (b) the rating then assigned by each Rating Agency to the Bonds, or (2) such Commodity Swap Counterparty provides such collateral and security arrangements as NCEA shall determine to be necessary, and (3) in either case, such replacement Commodity Swap Counterparty enters into a replacement Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement with the Commodity Supplier and the Custodian that is identical in all material respects to the existing Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement for the Commodity Swap being replaced.

(d) If the NCEA Commodity Swap is not otherwise replaced but the Commodity Supplier is obligated under the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement to continue paying Commodity Swap Receipts in the same amount that would have applied under such NCEA Commodity Swap, then such NCEA Commodity Swap will be deemed to be replaced by such obligation under such Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement and such obligation under the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement will be treated as the NCEA Commodity Swap thereafter until such terminated NCEA Commodity Swap is otherwise replaced by another NCEA Commodity Swap.

Upon the occurrence of a Commodity Swap Replacement Event (defined below), NCEA agrees in the Indenture that it shall notify the Commodity Supplier of such event pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and in accordance with the Commodity Purchase Agreement, either (a) replace the affected NCEA Commodity Swap by exercising its right to increase its notional quantities under an NCEA Commodity Swap.

¹ Includes available amounts on deposit in the Debt Service Fund and Working Capital Account under the 2018 Indenture.  
² Includes additional payment to the Commodity Supplier.  
³ Includes management, consulting, underwriting, rating agency, trustee, financial advisor and legal fees and other expenses related to the issuance of the Bonds and the refinancing and acquisition of the Commodity Project.

**PLAN OF REFUNDING**

Proceeds of the Bonds together with other available moneys will be deposited with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to an Escrow Agreement to establish an irrevocable trust escrow account (the “Escrow Account”), consisting of cash and noncallable direct full faith and credit obligations of the United States of America. The amounts in the Escrow Account will be used to refund the $537,295,000 principal amount of 2018 Bonds maturing on and after July 1, 2024 (the “Refunded Bonds”), and are pledged solely for the payment of the Refunded Bonds.

The investments held in the Escrow Account will bear interest and mature in amounts that are, together with the uninvested cash held in the Escrow Account, sufficient to pay the principal and redemption price of and the interest due on the Refunded Bonds on each interest payment date and on the redemption date of the Refunded Bonds. On the Initial Issue Date, NCEA will irrevocably instruct the Escrow Agent, as trustee for the Refunded Bonds, to call the Refunded Bonds maturing on July 1, 2049 for redemption on July 1, 2024. Upon the deposit of such cash and investments and satisfaction of the requirements of the 2018 Indenture, the Refunded Bonds will be deemed to be paid and will no longer be secured by the pledge of the trust estate under the 2018 Indenture.

Registrar in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Bond and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time NCEA shall deposit with the Paying Agent an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to and approved in writing by the Paying Agent for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as provided in the Indenture. The Bond Registrar will then fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which will be not more than 15 days or less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Bond Registrar of written notice of the proposed payment. The Bond Registrar shall promptly notify NCEA of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of NCEA, will cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Bondholder at its address as it appears upon the registry books, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date.

INCREASED INTEREST RATE UPON LEDGER EVENT

If a Ledger Event occurs, J. Aron will be obligated to pay the Commodity Supplier, and the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to pay NCEA, scheduled Ledger Event Payments calculated to provide a sum sufficient (together with the interest component of the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits) to enable NCEA to pay interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate of 8.00% per annum. The Indenture provides that, subject to NCEA’s receipt of such Ledger Event Payments from the Commodity Supplier, interest on the Bonds will be paid at the Increased Interest Rate from and including the day on which a Ledger Event occurs to but not including the earlier of (a) the date on which a Termination Payment Event occurs under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (b) the Mandatory Purchase Date or any prior redemption date or (c) the Interest Payment Date immediately succeeding the last date on which the Commodity Supplier paid the Ledger Event Payments. Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, any Ledger Event would occur on and as of the first day of a Month.

See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Ledger Event” below for a description of the provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement relating to a Ledger Event and the amounts payable by the Commodity Supplier to NCEA following a Ledger Event. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT—Ledger Event Payments” below for a description of the provisions of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement relating to the amounts payable by J. Aron to the Commodity Supplier following a Ledger Event.

Interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate will be payable on each regular Interest Payment Date, any redemption date and the Mandatory Purchase Date. NCEA will give prompt notice to the Trustee of the occurrence of a Ledger Event and whether the Increased Interest Rate becomes payable on the Bonds. Interest on the Bonds at an Increased Interest Rate will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and will be payable in the same manner as the interest borne by the Bonds on the Initial Issue Date.

For purposes of the Indenture:

(a) any Ledger Event Payments received by NCEA from the Commodity Supplier in respect of a Ledger Event shall not constitute an item of “Revenues” and shall be deposited directly into the Debt Service Account; and

-29-
<!-- Page 842 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

(b) the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits required by the Indenture shall be computed on the basis of the interest rates borne by the Bonds on the Initial Issue Date and shall not be re-computed in the event that the Bonds bear interest at an Increased Interest Rate.

# TENDER

**Mandatory Tender.** The Bonds maturing on __________, 20__ are required to be tendered for purchase on __________, 20__ (the “Mandatory Purchase Date”), which is the day following the end of the Interest Reset Period. The Purchase Price of the Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date is equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof and is payable in immediately available funds first from amounts on deposit in the Remarketing Proceeds Account established by the Indenture and second from amounts on deposit in the NCEA Purchase Account established by the Indenture. Accrued interest due on the Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date, which is an Interest Payment Date, shall be paid from amounts in the Debt Service Account.

The Purchase Price of each Bond on the Mandatory Purchase Date shall be payable only upon surrender of such Bond to the Trustee at its designated corporate trust office, accompanied by an instrument of transfer thereof in form satisfactory to the Trustee, executed in blank by the Owner thereof or by the Owner’s duly authorized attorney, with such signature guaranteed by a commercial bank, trust company or member firm of the New York Stock Exchange at or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date specified for such delivery in a notice provided to the Owners by the Trustee, such notice to be given no less than 30 days prior to the Mandatory Purchase Date. In the event that any Owner of a Bond so subject to mandatory tender for purchase shall not surrender such Bond to the Trustee on the Mandatory Purchase Date, then such Bond shall be deemed to be an Undelivered Bond, and that no interest shall accrue thereon on and after such Mandatory Purchase Date and that the Owner thereof shall have no rights under the Indenture other than to receive payment of the Purchase Price thereof.

**Failed Remarketing.** Under the Indenture, “Failed Remarketing” means the failure (i) of the Trustee to receive the Purchase Price of any Bond required to be purchased on a Mandatory Purchase Date by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the fifth Business Day preceding such Mandatory Purchase Date or (ii) to purchase or redeem such Bond in whole by such Mandatory Purchase Date (including from any funds on deposit in the Assignment Payment Fund and required to be used for such redemption). A Failed Remarketing is a Termination Payment Event, and will result in an Early Termination Payment Date, under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and the extraordinary redemption of the Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date. Such an extraordinary redemption of the Bonds has the same economic effect on Bondholders as a mandatory tender of the Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date.

**No Optional Tender.** The Bonds of are not subject to optional tender by Bondholders during the Interest Rate Reset Period.

# REDEMPTION

**Optional Redemption.** The Bonds are subject to redemption at the option of NCEA in whole or in part (in such amounts and by such maturities as may be specified by NCEA and by lot within a maturity) on any date preceding the first Business Day of the third month preceding the Mandatory Purchase Date at a Redemption Price, calculated by a quotation agent selected by NCEA, equal to the greater of:

-30-
<!-- Page 843 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

(a) the sum of the present values of the remaining unpaid payments of principal and interest to be paid on the Bonds to be redeemed from and including the date of redemption (not including any portion of the interest accrued and unpaid as of the redemption date) to the earlier of (i) the stated maturity date(s) of such Bonds or (ii) the Mandatory Purchase Date, discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at a discount rate equal to the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate (as defined in APPENDIX C) for such Bonds minus 0.25% per annum, and

(b) the Amortized Value thereof (described below);

in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption at the Fixed Rate or an Increased Interest Rate, whichever is then in effect.

The Bonds maturing on and after the Mandatory Purchase Date are also subject to redemption at the option of NCEA in whole or in part on and after the first Business Day of the third month preceding the Mandatory Purchase Date at a Redemption Price, calculated by a quotation agent selected by NCEA, equal to the Amortized Value thereof as of the date of redemption, plus $0[_] per $1,000 of the principal amount thereof and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption; provided that, if the redemption date of the Bonds is on the Mandatory Purchase Date, the Redemption Price will be 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In lieu of redeeming Bonds pursuant to this provision, NCEA may direct the Trustee to purchase such Bonds at a Purchase Price equal to the Redemption Price described above. Any Bonds so purchased may be remarketed in a new Interest Rate Period.

“Amortized Value” means, with respect to any Bond to be redeemed during the Interest Rate Reset Period, the principal amount of such Bond multiplied by the price of such Bond expressed as a percentage, calculated by a major market maker in municipal securities, as the quotation agent, selected by NCEA, based on the industry standard method of calculating bond prices (as such industry standard prevails on the date of delivery of the Bonds), with a delivery date equal to the date of redemption, a maturity date equal to the earlier of (a) the stated maturity date of such Bond, or (b) the Fixed Rate Tender Date of such Bond and a yield equal to such Bond’s original reoffering yield (as set forth on the inside cover page of this Official Statement). The Amortized Value of the Bonds as of certain dates during the Interest Rate Reset Period is shown on APPENDIX H.

Extraordinary Mandatory Redemption. The Bonds are subject to mandatory redemption prior to maturity in whole and not in part on the first day of the month following the Early Termination Payment Date (which will be the same day as the Mandatory Purchase Date in the event a Failed Remarketing has occurred) at a Redemption Price equal to the Amortized Value thereof, plus accrued interest to the redemption date.

See APPENDIX H for a schedule showing the Redemption Price (excluding accrued interest) of all of the Bonds upon an extraordinary mandatory redemption following an Early Termination Payment Date that occurs during the Interest Rate Reset Period.

NCEA shall provide the Trustee with Written Notice of the Early Termination Payment Date (x) by noon New York City time on the fifth Business Day preceding a Mandatory Purchase Date if an amount equal to the Purchase Price of the Bonds that are subject to such Mandatory Purchase Date has not been deposited with the Trustee, and (y) in all other cases, not more than five days after such date is determined.

<!-- Page 845 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

With respect to any notice of optional redemption of Bonds, unless upon the giving of such notice such Bonds will be deemed to have been paid under the Indenture, such notice must state that such redemption will be conditioned upon the receipt by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for such redemption of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and interest on the Bonds to be redeemed, and that if such money shall not have been so received said notice will be of no force and effect, and NCEA will not be required to redeem such Bonds. In the event that such notice of redemption contains such a condition and such money is not so received, the redemption will not be made and the Trustee must within a reasonable time thereafter give notice, in the manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such money was not received and that such redemption was not made.

**Effect of Redemption.** On any redemption date, the Redemption Price of each Bond to be redeemed, together with the accrued interest thereon to such date, will become due and payable, and from and after such date, notice having been given and moneys available solely for such redemption being on deposit with the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture governing redemption of such Bonds, then, notwithstanding that any Bonds called for redemption may not have been surrendered, no further interest will accrue on any of such Bonds. From and after such date of redemption (such notice having been given and moneys available solely for such redemption being on deposit with the Trustee), the Bonds to be redeemed will not be deemed to be Outstanding under the Indenture.

**Partial Redemption of Bonds.** If less than all of the Bonds of like maturity and Series are called for redemption, such Bonds or portions of Bonds must be redeemed in increments of Authorized Denominations, and such increments to be called for redemption must be selected by lot in such manner as the Trustee determines (subject to the rules and procedures of DTC, as the Securities Depository). Upon surrender of any Bond called for redemption in part only, NCEA must execute, and the Trustee must authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, a new Bond or Bonds of Authorized Denominations and the same series and maturity in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Bond surrendered.

**BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM**

The Bonds will be initially issued in book-entry only form through the facilities of DTC. The Bonds will be transferable and exchangeable as set forth in the Indenture and, when issued, will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. DTC will act as securities depository for the Bonds. So long as Cede & Co. is the registered owner of the Bonds, principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds are payable by wire transfer by the Trustee to Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, which, in turn, will remit such amounts to DTC participants for subsequent disbursement to the Beneficial Owners. See APPENDIX G—“BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.”

**THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement relating to (i) the purchase and sale of natural gas during the Gas Delivery Period and (ii) the purchase and sale of electricity during the Electricity Delivery Period, if any. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the terms and conditions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and accordingly is qualified by reference to the full text thereof.

**PURCHASE AND SALE**

Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier agrees to deliver specified daily quantities of natural gas each month during the Gas Delivery Period at a fixed price, and NCEA has agreed to make a lump sum advance payment to the Commodity Supplier for all of the cost of the gas to be delivered during the Gas Delivery Period (as well as the electricity to be delivered during the Electricity Delivery Period). The total quantity of gas to be delivered by the Commodity Supplier during the Gas Delivery Period is expected to be approximately [__] million MMBtu.

On the Switch Date, deliveries of gas under the Commodity Purchase Agreement will cease, and deliveries of electricity will commence. NCEA may elect to have the Switch Date occur any time on or after June 1, 2028.

<!-- Page 847 -->
# DELIVERY OF GAS

During the Gas Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier is required to deliver fixed, pre-determined quantities of gas at the primary delivery point specified in the Commodity Purchase Agreement or to an alternate delivery point mutually agreed to by the Commodity Supplier, NCEA and the Project Participant. The Contract Quantity of gas required to be delivered on each day during the term of the Gas Delivery Period matches the Contract Quantity of gas that NCEA has agreed to deliver to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract. The approximate aggregate monthly quantities of gas to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement during the Gas Delivery Period range from a high of approximately 1.1 million MMBtu of gas in some months to no gas in other months.

# DELIVERY OF ELECTRICITY

During each hour during the Electricity Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier is required to deliver fixed Hourly Quantities of electricity at the primary delivery point or one of the secondary delivery points specified in the Commodity Purchase Agreement or to an alternate delivery point mutually agreed to by the Commodity Supplier, NCEA and the Project Participant. The Hourly Quantity of electricity required to be delivered on each day during the term of the Electricity Delivery Period matches the Hourly Quantity of electricity that NCEA has agreed to deliver to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract.

As of the beginning of the Electricity Delivery Period, the Project Participant may assign one or more Assigned PPAs to J. Aron pursuant to PPA Assignment Agreements. During each month that an Assigned PPA is in effect, the Commodity Supplier agrees to deliver and NCEA agrees to take the Assigned Prepay Quantity of Assigned Electricity. Delivery, scheduling and transmission of Assigned Electricity, and title to and risk of loss of Assigned Electricity will be as provided in the applicable Assigned PPA and the applicable Assignment Agreement.

The Assigned Prepay Quantity is generally the “P99” output of the generating project that supplies an Assigned PPA or such lesser amount as may be determined pursuant to the provisions of the Commodity Supply Contract. If the quantity of Assigned Electricity that is delivered under an Assigned PPA exceeds the Assigned Prepay Quantity in any month (such excess being referred to as the “Assigned PAYGO Amount”), NCEA will pay the Commodity Supplier an amount equal to the quantity of the Assigned PAYGO Amount multiplied by the contract price under the Assigned PPA. If the quantity of Assigned Electricity that is delivered under an Assigned PPA is less than the Assigned Prepay Quantity in any month for any reason other than force majeure, NCEA will be deemed to have requested the Commodity Supplier to remarket the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered. The Commodity Supplier will sell such portion in a private business use sale will pay NCEA the product of (a) the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered and (b) the Contract Specified Price minus the applicable Remarketing Fee. All such sales made by the Commodity Supplier will be entered on the private business sales ledger that is maintained pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “Commodity Remarketing” below.

# PPA Payment Custodial Agreement

The Project Participant, J. Aron, the Commodity Supplier, NCEA and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as custodian (in such capacity, the “Custodian”) have entered into a custodial agreement (the “PPA Payment Custodial Agreement”) to administer payments to be received by the sellers of Assigned Electricity pursuant to the Assigned PPAs (the “PPA Sellers”). The PPA Payment Custodial Agreement is not pledged as part of the Trust Estate.

![FAILURE TO DELIVER OR RECEIVE COMMODITIES](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=FAILURE+TO+DELIVER+OR+RECEIVE+COMMODITIES)

Because NCEA will have prepaid for all of the natural gas and electricity to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier will be required to pay NCEA for all Commodities that the Commodity Supplier fails to deliver or NCEA fails to receive for any reason, including events of force majeure. The amount the Commodity Supplier is required to pay is equal to the quantity that was not delivered or received multiplied by a price that is determined in a manner depending upon the reason for such failure:

- If the Commodity Supplier breaches its obligation to deliver gas or electricity (i.e., for reasons other than force majeure or action or inaction by NCEA), NCEA shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to purchase Replacement Gas during the Gas Delivery Period or Replacement Electricity during the Electricity Delivery Period, and the Commodity Supplier is required to pay the higher of (a) the replacement costs incurred by NCEA or the Project Participant to purchase replacement gas or electricity, including in some instances replacement gas purchased after the fact to replace any stored gas that was used to cover the delivery shortfall, or (b) the Monthly Index Price during the Gas Delivery Period or the Day-Ahead Market Price during the Electricity Delivery Period, plus in either case a specified administrative fee of per unit of undelivered gas or electricity. If no replacement gas is actually purchased to cover the delivery shortfall, the Commodity Supplier is required to pay NCEA the Monthly Index Price during the Gas Delivery Period or the Day-Ahead Market Price during the Electricity Delivery Period.

- If NCEA breaches its obligation to take Commodities (i.e., for reasons other than force majeure or action or inaction by the Commodity Supplier), the Commodity Supplier is required to pay (a) during the Gas Delivery Period, the lesser of the Monthly Index Price or a daily low market index price, less specified remarketing fees and (b) during the Electricity Delivery Period, the price at which the Commodity Supplier, acting in a Commercially Reasonable manner, resells at the applicable delivery point any electricity not received by NCEA, deducting from such proceeds any (i) costs reasonably incurred by Seller in reselling such electricity and (ii) additional transmission charges, if any, reasonably incurred by the Commodity Supplier in delivering such electricity to the third party purchasers, or at the Commodity Supplier’s option, the market price at the applicable delivery point for such electricity not received as determined by the Commodity Supplier in a Commercially Reasonable manner.

- If either the Commodity Supplier fails to deliver Commodities or NCEA fails to receive Commodities due to events of force majeure, the Commodity Supplier is required to pay (a) during the Gas Delivery Period, the applicable Index Price and (b) during the Electricity Delivery Period, the applicable Day-Ahead Market Price.

COMMODITY REMARKETING

If the Project Participant is in default under the Commodity Supply Contract or does not require or is unable to receive all or any portion of the Commodities purchased by NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement as a result of (a) Project Participant’s decreased gas requirements due to reduced generation requirements during the Gas Delivery Period or (b) decreased demand by Project Participant’s retail customers, NCEA agrees to require the Commodity Supplier to remarket to other purchasers all or a specified portion of the
<!-- Page 849 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Commodities to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement by delivering Monthly Remarketing Notices or Daily Remarketing Notices as provided in the Commodity Purchase Agreement. J. Aron has agreed to provide all services necessary for the Commodity Supplier to meet its commodity remarketing obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT — J. Aron as Agent.”

There are three types of potential remarketing sales when proper notice has been tendered: qualified sales to Municipal Utilities, non-private business use sales and private business use sales. The Commodity Supplier is required to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remarket Commodities first in qualified sales and next in non-private business use sales. If the Commodity Supplier is unable to remarket the Commodities designated in a remarketing notice in qualified sales or in non-private business use sales, it will purchase the Commodities. Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the Commodity Supplier delegates, and J. Aron assumes, all of the Commodity Supplier’s Commodity remarketing obligations under the remarketing provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT— J. Aron as Agent—Commodity Remarketing.”

The amounts payable by the Commodity Supplier for Commodities remarketed are the actual sale proceeds or the amounts based on the Index Price, depending on the timing of the notice given by NCEA and the type of remarketing, less specified remarketing fees.

The Commodity Supplier must track in dollar and Commodity unit ledgers information relating to the remarketing proceeds and the quantities of Commodities remarketed, including sales made to the Project Participant and other Municipal Utilities, to non-private business users and to private business users. NCEA will seek to make additional qualified sales, and the Commodity Supplier will seek to locate opportunities for NCEA to purchase Commodities to sell in additional qualified sales, in each case to reduce the ledger amounts associated with non-private and private business use sales.

Assigned Electricity. If the quantity of Assigned Electricity that is delivered under an Assigned PPA is less than the Assigned Prepay Quantity in any month for any reason other than force majeure, NCEA will be deemed to have requested the Commodity Supplier to remarket the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered. The Commodity Supplier will sell such portion in a private business use sale and will pay NCEA the product of (a) the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered and (b) the Contract Specified Price minus the applicable Remarketing Fee. All such sales made by the Commodity Supplier will be entered on the private business sales ledger that is maintained pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

LEDGER EVENT

The Commodity Supplier is required to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remarket gas first in Qualified Sales and next in Non-Private Business Sales. If the Commodity Supplier is unable to remarket the Commodity designated in a remarketing notice in Qualified Sales or in Non-Private Business Sales, it will purchase the Commodity. To the extent the Commodity Supplier purchases such Commodity or remarkets such Commodity other than in Qualified Sales to Municipal Utilities, NCEA will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to use the proceeds of such remarketing to purchase Commodities for resale in Qualified Sales. The Commodity Supplier may also propose that NCEA use such proceeds to purchase Commodities for sale to Municipal Utilities identified by the Commodity Supplier.
<!-- Page 850 -->

<!-- Page 851 -->
# PAYMENT PROVISIONS

[The additional prepayment from NCEA to the Commodity Supplier will be due prior to the inception of the term of the Commodity Purchase Agreement.] To the extent amounts become payable by the Commodity Supplier (for example, as a result of a remarketing or a failure to deliver by the Commodity Supplier), such amounts are due on the 22nd day of the month following the month in which such amount accrues (or, if later, the tenth day following receipt of an invoice). Amounts payable by NCEA are due on the 25th day of the month following the month in which such amounts accrue (or, if later, the tenth day following receipt of an invoice).

# FORCE MAJEURE

Each of NCEA and the Commodity Supplier are excused from their respective obligations to receive and deliver Commodities under the Commodity Purchase Agreement to the extent prevented by force majeure, defined generally as an event or circumstance which prevents one party from performing its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, which event or circumstance was not anticipated as of the date of the execution of the Commodity Purchase Agreement, which is not within the reasonable control of, or the result of the negligence of, the claiming party, and which, by the exercise of due diligence, the claiming party is unable to overcome or avoid or cause to be avoided. This excuse to performance includes such events as natural disasters, unusually extreme or severe weather related events, interruption or curtailment of gas transportation or storage, governmental actions, and strikes.

# ASSIGNMENT

Neither party may assign its rights under the Commodity Purchase Agreement without the other party’s consent except:

(a) pursuant to the Indenture, NCEA may transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign the Commodity Purchase Agreement to the Trustee in connection with a financing arrangement; provided that NCEA may not assign its rights under the Commodity Purchase Agreement unless, contemporaneously with the effectiveness of such assignment, NCEA also assigns the NCEA Commodity Swap and the NCEA Custodial Agreement to the same assignee; and

(b) the Commodity Supplier may assign the Commodity Purchase Agreement to an affiliate of the Commodity Supplier, which assignment shall constitute a novation; provided that the assignee agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and (i) the Commodity Supplier delivers a Rating Confirmation to NCEA with respect to such assignment, (ii) contemporaneously with the effectiveness of such assignment, the Commodity Supplier also assigns the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement and the SPE Master Custodial Agreement to the same assignee and either (A) the Commodity Supplier assigns the Funding Agreement and the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to the same assignee or (B) the assignee provides to NCEA a guarantee by GSG of the assignee’s obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, and (iii) the assignee is a special purpose entity approved by NCEA or its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement are guaranteed by a Funding Recipient to the satisfaction of NCEA.

-39-
<!-- Page 852 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  

If either (a) the Commodity Supplier notifies NCEA that the Funding Agreement will not be replaced, re-financed or re-priced as of the end of any Interest Rate Period for the Bonds, (b) the Commodity Supplier is unable to provide, under the Re-Pricing Agreement, an estimated Available Discount for any Reset Period that is equal to or greater than the applicable minimum discount under the Commodity Supply Contract or (c) NCEA can provide reasonable evidence that the Commodity Supplier’s estimated Reset Period Implied Rate (as defined in the Re-Pricing Agreement) is materially less than the rate the Commodity Supplier would offer to a substantially similar counterparty in an arm’s length transaction on the same date, then, at the request of NCEA, the Commodity Supplier will reasonably cooperate with NCEA to cause the Commodity Supplier’s (or the Commodity Supplier’s affiliate’s) right, title and interest in the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Re-Pricing Agreement, the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap and all agreements related to any of the foregoing to be novated to a replacement seller. The Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Indenture impose certain requirements for any such novation, including the delivery of a Rating Confirmation.

FUNDING AGREEMENT

Except (a) to cure any ambiguity, supply any omission, or cure or correct any defect or inconsistent provision in the Funding Agreement, (b) to insert such provisions clarifying matters or questions arising under the Funding Agreement as are necessary or desirable and are not contrary to or inconsistent therewith or (c) to convert or supplement any provision in a manner consistent with the intent of the Funding Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the Commodity Supplier agrees in the Commodity Purchase Agreement that it shall not agree to any amendment, alteration, assignment or modification to the Funding Agreement or any guaranty of the Funding Recipient’s obligations thereunder without receipt of a Rating Confirmation and the prior written consent of NCEA; provided that the consent of NCEA shall not be required in connection with (i) the replacement, refinancing or re-pricing of the Funding Agreement at the end of any Interest Rate Period in accordance with the terms of the Funding Agreement or (ii) the Commodity Supplier’s assignment of its interest in the Funding Agreement or consent to Funding Recipient’s assignment of its interest in the Funding Agreement to the extent the Commodity Supplier provides a Rating Confirmation to NCEA with respect to any such assignment.

EARLY TERMINATION

A Commodity Delivery Termination Date will occur automatically under the Commodity Purchase Agreement upon the occurrence of a Termination Payment Event (which includes a Failed Remarketing with respect to the Bonds) or an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event (as such terms are described below). Upon the occurrence of an Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event (as described below), a Commodity Delivery Termination Date may be designated by the Commodity Supplier, as described below. If a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs, the Delivery Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement will end and, if the Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs as a result of a Termination Payment Event, the Commodity Supplier will be required to make the payment or payments described under “Remedies and Termination” below.

-40-
<!-- Page 853 -->
![Termination Payment Event](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Termination+Payment+Event)

**Termination Payment Event.** A Termination Payment Event will occur under the Commodity Purchase Agreement if:

- [• the exercise by the Funding Recipient of the Funding Recipient Acceleration Option;]
- [• the exercise by the Commodity Supplier of the Commodity Supplier Acceleration Option;]

• the Commodity Supplier fails to pay when due any amounts owed to NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement because of a failure by the Funding Recipient to pay when due any amounts owed to the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Funding Agreement and such failure continues for 30 days after NCEA gives notice thereof to the Commodity Supplier;

• as of three Business Days prior to the last day of exchange trading for Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange (or successor thereto) for deliveries in the first month following a Reset Period, either (a) NCEA has not entered into a bond purchase agreement, firm remarketing agreement or similar agreement with respect to the remarketing or refunding of the Bonds or (b) the Commodity Supplier is unable to replace, refinance or re-price the Funding Agreement for a subsequent Reset Period;

• a Failed Remarketing occurs; or

• both (a) the Project Participant makes a Remarketing Election for a Reset Period, and (b) J. Aron exercises its option to designate a CSSA Early Termination Date under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement.

**Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Events.** The Commodity Supplier will have the right to designate a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement under the following circumstances:

• a Ledger Event occurs; or

• except in the case where an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event has occurred, both (a) an early termination date under the NCEA Commodity Swap is designated by the Commodity Swap Counterparty or occurs automatically based on a termination event where NCEA is the sole affected party and (b) either the NCEA Commodity Swap or the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap is not replaced within the Swap Replacement Period.

**Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Events.** A Commodity Delivery Termination Date will occur automatically, that will not result on its own as a Termination Payment Event, under the Commodity Purchase Agreement under the following circumstances:

• following receipt of an offer by the Trustee to sell Swap Call Receivables under the Receivables Purchase Provisions, the Commodity Supplier does not exercise (or is deemed not to have exercised) its related option to purchase Swap Call Receivables within the timeline set forth in the Receivables Purchase Provisions;

-41-
<!-- Page 854 -->
• both (a) a CSSA Early Termination Date occurs under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, and (b) the Commodity Supplier is unable to enter into a replacement Commodity Sale and Service Agreement in compliance with the requirements of the Commodity Purchase Agreement by the date that is 120 days following such early termination date;

• an early termination date under the NCEA Commodity Swap is designated by the Commodity Swap Counterparty based on an event of default due to NCEA’s insolvency or bankruptcy; or

• both (a) an early termination date under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap is designated by the Commodity Swap Counterparty based on an event of default where the Commodity Supplier is the defaulting party or a termination event where the Commodity Supplier is the sole affected party, or otherwise occurs automatically and (b) except for certain events of default and termination events for which the Swap Replacement Period does not apply, either the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap or the NCEA Commodity Swap is not replaced within the Swap Replacement Period.

REPLACEMENT OF COMMODITY SWAPS

NCEA and the Commodity Supplier agree in the Commodity Purchase Agreement that if any Commodity Swap terminates, is being terminated or is expected to be terminated, in each case for any reason other than the insolvency of NCEA or the Commodity Supplier or the failure of the Commodity Supplier to make payments or post collateral under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, then:

(a) (i) if an NCEA Commodity Swap and a Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap with another Commodity Swap Counterparty are in effect and are not subject to termination, NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will exercise any rights they may have to increase their notional quantities thereunder in order to replace the Commodity Swap affected by the events described above and the other Commodity Swap and (ii) subsequent to such a replacement, NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will cooperate in good faith to locate replacement agreements with a second Commodity Swap Counterparty and, upon locating such second Commodity Swap Counterparty, NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will reduce their notional quantities under the remaining Commodity Swaps to their original levels and enter into replacement Commodity Swaps with the replacement Commodity Swap Counterparty for the remaining notional quantities; and

(b) if NCEA and the Commodity Supplier cannot increase the notional quantities of the Commodity Swaps as described in (a) above, they will cooperate in good faith to locate replacement agreements with an alternate Swap Counterparty to replace both of the Commodity Swaps within the Swap Replacement Period.

The “Swap Replacement Period” is the period that begins on the earlier of the date of (x) any termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap or the Commodity Supplier Swap designated by the Commodity Swap Counterparty and (y) delivery of a notice of anticipated termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap or the Commodity Supplier Swap by a Swap Counterparty, and ends 60 days later. 

-42-
<!-- Page 855 -->
# REMEDIES AND TERMINATION PAYMENT

**Commodity Delivery Termination Date.** A Commodity Delivery Termination Date will occur automatically upon the occurrence of a Termination Payment Event or an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event. If an Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, then the Commodity Supplier, as described above, may designate a Commodity Delivery Termination Date.

**End of Delivery Period.** As of the Commodity Delivery Termination Date:

(a) the Delivery Period will end;

(b) the obligation of NCEA to receive deliveries of Commodities will terminate; and

(c) the obligation of the Commodity Supplier to make any further deliveries of Commodities will terminate and, unless such Commodity Delivery Termination Date resulted from a Termination Payment Event, will be replaced with a continuing obligation of the Commodity Supplier to pay scheduled monthly amounts to NCEA until the earlier of (i) the Month in which a Termination Payment Event occurs and (ii) the last due date for such scheduled payments; and

The Commodity Purchase Agreement will continue in effect after the Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs. The occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date will not prevent the contemporaneous or subsequent occurrence of a Termination Payment Event.

**Termination Payment; Early Termination Payment Date.** Following a Termination Payment Event, the Commodity Supplier is required to pay the Termination Payment to the Trustee on the Early Termination Payment Date. The “Early Termination Payment Date” is the last Business Day of the first Month that commences after a Termination Payment Event occurs. In the case of a Termination Payment Event that results from a Failed Remarketing, the Early Termination Payment Date will be the last Business Day of the current Interest Rate Period. The obligation of the Commodity Supplier to pay the Termination Payment on the Early Termination Payment Date is unconditional, and the Commodity Supplier waives all rights to set-off, counterclaim, recoupment and any other defenses that might otherwise be available with regard to its obligation to pay the Termination Payment on the Early Termination Payment Date.

The amount of the Termination Payment is set forth on a schedule to the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The Termination Payment payable by the Commodity Supplier, together with the amounts required to be on deposit in certain Funds and Accounts held by the Trustee, has been calculated to provide a sum at least sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of the Bonds, assuming that the Funding Recipient, the Project Participant, the Commodity Supplier and the Investment Agreement Provider pay and perform their respective contract obligations when due. If the Debt Service Reserve Account is depleted due to payment defaults by the Project Participant and is not timely replenished, the Termination Payment and the other available funds held under the Indenture will likely not be adequate to redeem the Bonds in full. See APPENDIX I for a schedule of the Termination Payment as of specified Early Termination Payment Dates under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

-43-
<!-- Page 856 -->
# RECEIVABLES PURCHASE PROVISIONS

Under certain circumstances, the Commodity Supplier has agreed to purchase from NCEA the rights to payment of net amounts owed by the Project Participant (“Swap Call Receivables”) under the Commodity Supply Contract.

## Swap Call Receivables
If the Project Participant defaults on its obligation to make any payment under the Commodity Supply Contract, and such nonpayment results in a Swap Payment Deficiency, then on the next succeeding Business Day, NCEA shall deliver a written offer (a “Swap Call Receivables Offer”) to sell to the Commodity Supplier sufficient Swap Call Receivables (such amount, less any undisputed amounts owed by NCEA to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, the “Swap Call Receivables Amount”) to fund such Swap Payment Deficiency. No later than one Business Day following the Commodity Supplier’s receipt of a Swap Call Receivables Offer, the Commodity Supplier may elect, in its discretion, to purchase the Swap Call Receivables referenced in the Swap Call Receivables Offer by delivering a written notice (“Call Option Notice”) to NCEA of the Commodity Supplier’s intent to purchase such Swap Call Receivables. If the Commodity Supplier does not deliver a Call Option Notice to NCEA on or before the Business Day following the Commodity Supplier’s receipt of a Swap Call Receivables Offer, the Commodity Supplier will be deemed to have elected not to purchase the referenced Swap Call Receivables, which constitutes an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

## Elective Call Receivables
If the Project Participant defaults on its obligation to make any payment under its Commodity Supply Contract with PEAK and such payment default does not result in a Swap Payment Deficiency, the Trustee shall deliver a written offer (an “Elective Call Receivables Offer”) to sell to the Commodity Supplier the receivables relating to such payment default (“Elective Call Receivables”) and, together with Swap Call Receivables, “Call Receivables”). Any time after the Commodity Supplier’s receipt of an Elective Call Receivables Offer, the Commodity Supplier may elect, in its discretion, to purchase the Elective Call Receivables referenced in the Elective Call Receivables Offer by delivering a written notice to the Trustee of the Commodity Supplier’s intent to purchase such Elective Call Receivables. The election by the Commodity Supplier not to purchase Swap Call Receivables is not an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

## Conditions to Purchase and Sale of Call Receivables
NCEA’s obligation to offer to sell such Call Receivables is subject to the condition that all of the representations and warranties made by the Commodity Supplier at the time of execution and delivery of the Receivables Purchase Provisions be true and correct on each day that the Trustee is required to offer to sell Call Receivables.

## Call Receivables Purchase by J. Aron
Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, J. Aron has agreed to purchase any Call Receivable purchased by the Commodity Supplier under the Receivables Purchase Provisions; provided that J. Aron’s obligation to purchase Call Receivables is subject to it having provided its prior written consent to the purchase of such Call Receivables by the Commodity Supplier. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT.”

# THE RE-PRICING AGREEMENT

Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of the Re-Pricing Agreement. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the terms and conditions of the Re-Pricing Agreement and accordingly is qualified by reference to the full text thereof.

## GENERAL

The Re-Pricing Agreement provides for (a) the determination of delivery periods (“Reset Periods”) subsequent to the Reset Period that corresponds to the Interest Rate Reset Period on the Bonds and the calculation of the amount of the discount (in cents per Commodity Unit) that is available (the “Available Discount”) for sales of Commodities to the Project Participant during each Reset Period.

“Commodity Unit” means [one MMBtu of gas or one MWh of electricity, as applicable]. [NTD: “Commodity Unit” needs to be defined.]

The Reset Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement that corresponds to the Interest Rate Reset Period begins on the first day of ________ 20__ and ends on the last day of ________ 20__ and the next Reset Period is expected to begin on the first day of ________ 20__.

## REMARKETING ELECTION

In the event that the Available Discount for any Reset Period is less than the minimum discount specified in the Commodity Supply Contract (which includes both monthly discounts and any annual refunds), the Project Participant may elect not to take Commodities during the Reset Period and to have such Commodities remarketed for the duration of the Reset Period (a “Remarketing Election”) by giving notice of such election to NCEA, the Commodity Supplier and NCEA. Any Commodities that are covered by a Remarketing Election will be remarketed in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Commodity Purchase Agreement. In the event that the Project Participant makes a Remarketing Election with respect to a Reset Period, J. Aron will have the option to terminate the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. If J. Aron exercises this option, a Termination Payment Event and an Early Payment Termination Date will occur under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE RE-PRICING AGREEMENT” and “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT — Remarketing” and “— Early Termination.” [NTD: Above description does not match the CSSA which retains the “50% of Contract Quantities” phrasing for the termination option.]

## REPLACEMENT OF FUNDING AGREEMENT

The Re-Pricing Agreement includes provisions that enable the Commodity Supplier to obtain proposals from the Funding Recipient and other qualified funding providers for funding agreements to replace the Funding Agreement upon the maturity date of the Funding Agreement (which coincides with the end of the Interest Rate Reset Period). NCEA agrees to cooperate in good faith with the Commodity Supplier and to take all steps reasonably within its control to cause the Bonds to be remarketed or refunded for the Interest Rate Period that corresponds to each Reset Period.

![THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=THE+COMMODITY+SALE+AND+SERVICE+AGREEMENT)

Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the terms and conditions of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and accordingly is qualified by reference to the full text thereof.

**GENERAL**

Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, J. Aron has agreed to sell and deliver the Contract Quantity of Commodities each gas day during the Gas Delivery Period and each delivery hour during the Electricity Delivery Period, as applicable, in exchange for payment from the Commodity Supplier of an amount equal to the applicable Index Price for the delivery point set forth in the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, plus any price differential for the delivery point, plus a specified fee per Commodity Unit (the “J. Aron Commodity Fee”), regardless of whether or not such Commodities are delivered pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. The daily quantities of gas, hourly quantities of electricity, delivery point provisions and delivery period under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement match the corresponding provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and, in turn, the corresponding provisions of the Commodity Supply Contract. In addition to the J. Aron Commodity Fee, the Commodity Supplier agrees to pay a structuring fee on the effective date of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement in consideration of its services in connection with the arrangement, establishment, hedging and funding of the Commodity Project.

**J. ARON AS AGENT**

**General.** Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the Commodity Supplier appoints and directs J. Aron as its agent and J. Aron agrees to issue notices and other communications, billing statements and to take any other actions that the Commodity Supplier is required or permitted to take under (a) the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (b) the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, (c) the Re-Pricing Agreement, and (d) the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement (collectively, the “Commodity Documents”); provided that J. Aron’s agency role with respect to the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement shall be limited to ordinary course actions required in connection with the Commodity Project and J. Aron shall have no right to waive, modify or amend the terms of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement on the Commodity Supplier’s behalf or to act on the Commodity Supplier’s behalf with respect to any dispute thereunder. In exercising this agency power, J. Aron shall have the authority to take any such actions as it deems necessary under the Commodity Documents.

**Standard of Care.** In the conduct and performance of its agency role, J. Aron shall conduct itself consistent with and observe the same standard of care as it has in similar transactions in which J. Aron has acted as the seller under prepaid natural gas and commodities agreements, and the Commodity Supplier acknowledges and agrees that J. Aron shall have no obligation to observe a standard of care greater than it has in such similar transactions or to take any actions or measures beyond those it typically takes in connection with such transactions. J. Aron shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in acting as agent on behalf of the Commodity Supplier, except as expressly set forth in the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement.

**Commodities Remarketing.** Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the Commodity Supplier delegates, and J. Aron assumes, all of the Commodity Supplier’s Commodities remarketing obligations under the remarketing provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement ([subject to certain limitations set forth

**Call Receivables Purchase.** J. Aron agrees in the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to purchase any Call Receivable purchased by the Commodity Supplier under the Receivables Purchase Provisions. J. Aron accordingly has the right in its sole discretion to direct the Commodity Supplier on the exercise of its right to purchase Call Receivables. J. Aron agrees to accept the transfer of Call Receivables as a credit against amounts owed by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and, to the extent that the amount of such Call Receivables exceeds the amount so owed by the Commodity Supplier in any Month, J. Aron will pay the difference to the Commodity Supplier. J. Aron agrees to pay the purchase price for Call Receivables not later than the applicable purchase date specified in the Receivables Purchase Provisions by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

**FAILURE TO DELIVER OR RECEIVE COMMODITIES**  
J. Aron will be required to pay the Commodity Supplier for all Commodities that J. Aron fails to deliver or the Commodity Supplier fails to receive for any reason, including events of force majeure. The amount J. Aron is required to pay the Commodity Supplier is equal to the amount the Commodity Supplier is required to pay NCEA for Commodities not delivered or received under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

**PAYMENT PROVISIONS**  
Amounts due from J. Aron to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement (for example, as a result of remarketing or failure to deliver by J. Aron) will be due on or before the 22nd day of the month following the month in which such amount accrues (or, if later, the tenth day following receipt of an invoice); provided that the purchase price of any Call Receivables purchased by J. Aron shall be paid on the applicable purchase date under the Receivables Purchase Provisions. Amounts due from the Commodity Supplier to J. Aron will be due on or before the 26th day of the month following the month in which such amount accrued (or, if later, the 10th day following receipt of an invoice). J.

# LEDGER EVENT PAYMENTS

If a Ledger Event occurs under the Commodity Purchase Agreement and (i) [Commodity Supplier/Funding Recipient] has not exercised the [Commodity Supplier/Funding Recipient] Acceleration Option and (ii) an Early Termination Payment Date has not otherwise occurred or been designated thereunder, J. Aron agrees to pay to the Commodity Supplier scheduled Ledger Event Payments calculated to provide a sum sufficient (together with the interest component of the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits) to enable NCEA to pay interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate. Such payments are due to the Commodity Supplier on (a) the Business Day preceding each Interest Payment Date and the Mandatory Purchase Date, and (b) any Early Termination Payment Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT — Ledger Event” and “THE BONDS — Increased Interest Rate Upon Ledger Event.”

# ASSIGNMENT

Neither party may assign its rights or obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement without the other party’s consent, except that J. Aron may assign the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to an affiliate of J. Aron, which assignment will constitute a novation; provided that (a) the CSSA Guaranty continues to apply to the obligations of such assignee under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement or (b) the assignee delivers to the Commodity Supplier a Rating Confirmation with respect to such assignment.

# DEFAULTS AND TERMINATION EVENTS

## J. Aron Default. 
Each of the following events constitutes a “J. Aron Default” under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement:

(a) J. Aron fails to pay when due any amounts owed to the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and such failure continues for five days after receipt by J. Aron of notice thereof, unless GSG has made such payment under the CSSA Guaranty;

(b) certain bankruptcy or insolvency events with respect to J. Aron; or

(c) the CSSA Guaranty ceases to be in full force and effect or is declared to be null and void, or GSG contests the validity or enforceability of the CSSA Guaranty; provided that no such event will occur as a consequence of GSG becoming subject to a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution or similar proceeding.

## Commodity Supplier Default. 
Each of the following events constitutes a “Commodity Supplier Default” under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement:

![Optional Non-Default Termination Event](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Optional+Non-Default+Termination+Event)

**Optional Non-Default Termination Event.** Each of the following events constitutes an “Optional Non–Default Termination Event” under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement:

(a) the Commodity Supplier has the option to terminate the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement during the Gas Delivery Period if a “Persistent Delivery Failure” occurs as a result of;

(i) J. Aron failing to deliver any gas for 12 consecutive gas days at all delivery points;

(ii) J. Aron delivering less than 50% of all gas required to be delivered at all delivery points on any 45 consecutive gas days; or

(iii) J. Aron delivering less than 85% of all gas required to be delivered at all delivery points on any 180 gas days (consecutive or non-consecutive) during any period of 365 consecutive days; or

(b) J. Aron has the option to terminate the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement if the Commodity Supplier provides that the Project Participant has made a Remarketing Election for any Reset Period (a “GSC Remarketing Event”). [NTD: See note on p. 48.]

**Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event.** The occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement constitutes an “Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event” under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement.

**REMEDIES AND TERMINATION**

Upon the occurrence of a J. Aron Default or a Commodity Supplier Default, the non-defaulting party may designate an early termination date under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement (a “CSSA Early Termination Date”). Upon the occurrence of an Optional Non–Default Termination Event due to a Persistent Delivery Failure, the Commodity Supplier may designate a CSSA Early Termination Date. Upon the occurrence of an Optional Non–Default Termination Event due to a GSC Remarketing Event, J. Aron may designate a CSSA Early Termination Date. A CSSA Early Termination Date will occur automatically upon the occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

If a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs, the Delivery Period for gas under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement will end and the obligations of the parties to deliver and receive gas will terminate.

**SECURITY**

GSG has provided to the Commodity Supplier a guaranty of J. Aron’s payment obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement (the “CSSA Guaranty”). None of NCEA, the Trustee or the Bondholders have rights to enforce the CSSA Guaranty.

THE COMMODITY SUPPLIER

Organization. The Commodity Supplier is a Delaware limited liability company organized for the sole purpose of entering into the transactions on its part with respect to the Commodity Project described herein. J. Aron is the sole member of the Commodity Supplier (the “Member”), and has funded the Commodity Supplier with the cash equity contribution and the subordinated loans described below.

The Commodity Supplier is governed by a three-member board of directors. One director is appointed by J. Aron, one director is appointed by NCEA, and the third director is an independent director appointed by J. Aron. The directors have appointed J. Aron as the manager of the Commodity Supplier.

The director appointed by NCEA has the sole consent rights with respect to certain matters, including: (i) the designation of a CSSA Early Termination Date under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement; the designation of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement due to the occurrence of a Ledger Event; the enforcement of the Funding Agreement; under certain circumstances, the removal and replacement of J.

NCEA covenants in the Indenture that, in any vote that comes before the board of directors of the Commodity Supplier regarding the Commodity Supplier Documents, it will instruct the NCEA-appointed director to exercise its voting rights in favor of (a) the Commodity Supplier (i) observing and performing its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement and (ii) observing and performing its obligations and enforcing the provisions of the other Commodity Supplier Documents against the counterparties thereto, and (b) not permitting any assignment, rescission, amendment or waiver to or of the Commodity Supplier Documents which will in any manner materially impair or materially adversely affect the rights of NCEA thereunder or the rights or security of the Bondholders under the Indenture.

The director appointed by J. Aron has sole consent rights with respect to other matters, including: (a) the designation of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement due to a
<!-- Page 864 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

**Subordinated Loan Agreements; Capitalization.** Pursuant to two Subordinated Term Loan Agreements (the “Subordinated Loan Agreements”), J. Aron has agreed (a) to make an initial term loan to the Commodity Supplier in the amount of $ ______ million not later than the closing date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (the “Initial Term Loan”), and (b) if, following an Event of Default (as defined in the Funding Agreement) with respect to the Funding Recipient, the Commodity Supplier exercises its right to demand payment of the entire amount held in the Funding Account (or the Funding Agreement terminates automatically due the dissolution, liquidation or similar proceeding with respect to the Funding Recipient), an additional loan of up to $ ______ million on any Early Termination Payment Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (the “Contingent Term Loan”). The Commodity Supplier’s repayment obligations under the Subordinated Loan Agreements are subordinate to the Commodity Supplier’s obligations under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to the extent set forth in the SPE Master Custodial Agreement described below.

J. Aron will also make a cash equity contribution to the Commodity Supplier. The cash equity contribution, the amount of the Initial Term Loan and, if made, the amount of the Contingent Term Loan together equal at least three percent of the outstanding (unamortized) balance of the prepayment under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (approximately $ ______ million as of the Initial Issue Date).

**SPE Master Custodial Agreement.** The Commodity Supplier, J. Aron, NCEA and The Bank of New York Mellon, as custodian (the “SPE Master Custodian”), will enter into an SPE Master Custodial Agreement (the “SPE Master Custodial Agreement”) to administer:

The amounts payable to the Commodity Supplier under the Funding Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap are to be paid directly into the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account.

Under the SPE Master Custodial Agreement, the SPE Master Custodian will, to the extent of the amounts on deposit in the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account, make monthly transfers for the payment of

-52-
<!-- Page 865 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

amounts due by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. Following these monthly transfers, any remaining funds in the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account are transferred to the Commodity Supplier Capital Account. Pending their application, the amounts in the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account are held in trust for the benefit of the Commodity Supplier.

The Commodity Supplier Capital Account will be initially funded by J. Aron with the cash equity contribution and the Initial Term Loan under the Subordinated Loan Agreements. [From these sources, an amount equal to the Minimum Amount will be deposited in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account. Under the SPE Master Custodial Agreement, the amounts in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account may be invested only in direct obligations of the United States or obligations unconditionally guaranteed by the United States, in either case with a maturity of two years or less, certain certificates of deposit and demand deposits, certain money market funds and cash.

Amounts on deposit in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account shall be withdrawn by the SPE Master Custodian and applied: first, to the extent the SPE Master Custodian determines necessary to meet the Commodity Supplier’s collateral posting obligations under the credit support annex to the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap; and second to make up any deficiency of the amounts on deposit in the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account for the purposes described above.

The SPE Master Custodian shall only withdraw amounts on deposit in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account for payment of principal and interest on the Subordinated Loan Agreements to the extent that the “Commodity Supplier Capital Amount” (defined below) exceeds the greater of (i) three percent of the outstanding (unamortized) balance of the prepayment under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and (ii) $[_____] after the monthly payments from the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account and the Commodity Supplier Capital Account described above. The SPE Master Custodian shall not be required to transfer any amount from the Commodity Supplier Capital Account for the monthly payment of principal and interest on the Subordinated Loan Agreements if the remaining balance in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account following such transfer will be less than $[_____] .

“Commodity Supplier Capital Amount” means, at any time, the sum of (y) amounts then on deposit in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account, and (z) all committed amounts then available for Commodity Supplier to draw under the Subordinated Loan Agreements, as notified by Commodity Supplier to the SPE Master Custodian from time to time.

The SPE Master Custodian shall have a lien, security interest and right of set-off against the Commodity Supplier Capital Account for the payment of any claim by the SPE Master Custodian for compensation, reimbursement or indemnity under the SPE Master Custodial Agreement.

Gas Delivery Period. Commencing with gas deliveries for 20 __, NCEA will pay a floating natural gas price at a specified pricing point and will receive a fixed natural gas price for notional quantities that correspond to the quantities of natural gas and the related delivery point under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. Under the NCEA Commodity Swap, for each calendar month that the relevant floating price of natural gas at the delivery point is greater than the fixed price specified in the NCEA Commodity Swap, NCEA will be obligated to pay the Commodity Swap Counterparty an amount equal to the product of (x) the difference between the floating price and the fixed price multiplied by (y) a notional quantity equal to the quantity of gas scheduled to be delivered at the delivery point during such month by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If the fixed price specified in the NCEA Commodity Swap is greater than the relevant floating price of natural gas at the delivery point for a month, the Commodity Swap Counterparty will be obligated to pay NCEA an amount equal to the product of (x) the difference between the fixed price and floating price multiplied by (y) a notional quantity equal to the quantity of gas scheduled to be delivered at the delivery point during such month by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

Under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Supplier pays a fixed natural gas price and receives a floating natural gas price for the same notional quantities at the same pricing point.

**Electricity Delivery Period.** During the Electricity Delivery Period, the Commodity Swaps will be dormant and no payments will be required to be made under them to the extent that all of the Contract Quantities of electricity are fixed price Assigned Prepay Quantities. To the extent that Hourly Quantities of electricity are delivered by the Commodity Supplier, NCEA will pay a floating electricity price at a specified pricing point and will receive a fixed electricity price for notional quantities that correspond to the quantities of electricity and the related delivery point under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. Under the NCEA Commodity Swap, for each delivery hour that the relevant floating price of electricity at the delivery point is greater than the fixed price specified in the NCEA Commodity Swap, NCEA will be obligated to pay to the Commodity Swap Counterparty an amount equal to the product of (x) the difference between the floating price and the fixed price multiplied by (y) a notional quantity equal to the quantity of electricity scheduled to be delivered at the delivery point during such delivery hour by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If the fixed price specified in the NCEA Commodity Swap is greater than the relevant floating price of electricity at the delivery point for a delivery hour, the Commodity Swap Counterparty will be obligated to pay NCEA an amount equal to the product of (x) the difference between the fixed and floating price multiplied by (y) a notional quantity equal to the quantity of electricity scheduled to be delivered at the delivery point during such delivery hour by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

**PAYMENT**  
For each month of scheduled Commodities deliveries and notional amounts, each party with a net obligation under a Commodity Swap (based on the relative values of the fixed price and relevant index prices) will pay that net obligation to the other party. Payments under the Commodity Swaps are due in the calendar month following the month to which the applicable Commodity index prices relate, on the 24th day of the month (or preceding business day) in the case of the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap and on the 25th day of the month (or next business day) in the case of the NCEA Commodity Swap.

“Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement”), which provides for the administration of payments under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee and as custodian (in such capacity, the “Custodian”). The Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement contains certain provisions designed to mitigate risks to NCEA and Bondholders resulting from a failure of the Commodity Swap Counterparty to make payments to NCEA under the NCEA Commodity Swap.

Payments made by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap will be made to a custodial account maintained by the Custodian under the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement. Such amounts will not be released until the Custodian has received confirmation that the amount payable to NCEA by the Commodity Swap Counterparty under the NCEA Commodity Swap for such month has been paid. If the Commodity Swap Counterparty does not make a required payment under the NCEA Commodity Swap and such payment remains unpaid after the expiration of any grace period, the Custodian will pay the amount that the Commodity Supplier paid under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap (which such amount is held in custody) to the Trustee for deposit in the Revenue Fund and that payment will be treated as a Commodity Swap Receipt. Additionally, if the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap terminates, the Commodity Supplier will continue to make payments to the custodial account as if the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap were still in effect until the earlier of (i) replacement of the Commodity Swaps in accordance with the requirements of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and (ii) termination of the Delivery Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and such payments will be used to ensure that NCEA receives deposits in the Revenue Fund as described in the preceding sentence in the event that the Commodity Swap Counterparty does not make a required payment under the NCEA Commodity Swap.

The Commodities sold under the Commodity Supply Contract are priced at the applicable “Contract Price,” which (a) in the case of the Contract Quantity of gas, is the Monthly Index Price for the gas delivery point plus any applicable delivery point premium, (b) in the case of the Hourly Quantity of electricity, is the Day-Ahead Market Price for the electricity deliver point and (c) in the case of the Assigned Prepay Quantity of Assigned Electricity, is the fixed price per MWh set forth in the Assigned PPA, in each case less a specified discount determined in accordance with the Commodity Supply Contract.

The “Monthly Index Price” means a charge per MMBtu equal to the monthly market index price for the month of delivery reported in the first monthly edition, or the revised edition, if applicable, of the publication Inside FERC’s Gas Market Report, in the section “Monthly Bidweek Spot Gas Prices ($/MMBtu),” for the gas delivery point specified in the Commodity Supply Agreement under the column “Index.” If Inside FERC’s Gas Market Report ceases to be published, the Monthly Index Price shall be derived via an alternative index. The “Day-Ahead Market Price” means the day ahead market price or the locational marginal price for the electricity delivery point for each applicable hour as published by the California Independent System Operator Corporation, or as such price may be corrected or revised from time to time by such independent system operator or other entity in accordance with its rules.

Through the Commodity Project, the Project Participant anticipates realizing a discount to market index natural gas prices. No assurance can be given as to the total actual discounts the Project Participant will realize.

[The Project Participant must pay to NCEA a monthly Supply Administration Fee based on the Project Participant’s Daily Quantity of Commodities. The Supply Administration Fee is not included as part of the Revenues and is not pledged to the payment of the Bonds.]

**BILLING AND PAYMENT**

Not later than the 12th day of the month following the end of the delivery month, NCEA must provide a monthly billing statement to the Project Participant of the amount due for Commodities delivered during the prior month. The due date for payment by the Project Participant will be on or before the later of (a) the 22nd day of the month following the most recent month to which the billing statement relates or (b) the 10th day

-59-
<!-- Page 872 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  

following the Project Participant’s receipt of NCEA’s billing statement (or if either such day is not a business day, the preceding business day). If the Project Participant disputes the appropriateness of any charge or calculation in any billing statement, the Project Participant still must pay (absent manifest error) all amounts billed by NCEA, including any amounts in dispute, and must object to such billing statement within two years after the applicable month of delivery. If it is ultimately determined that the Project Participant did not owe the disputed amount, NCEA must pay the Project Participant the disputed amount plus interest.

**ANNUAL REFUNDS**

NCEA has agreed to provide annual refunds to the Project Participant from amounts available for distribution pursuant to the Indenture. In determining the amount of such refunds, NCEA may reserve such funds as may be required under the terms of the Indenture or as it deems reasonably necessary and appropriate to cover anticipated costs and expenses to be incurred in the next succeeding bond year, with certain limitations.

**COVENANTS OF THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT**

**Operating Expense.** The Project Participant has agreed to make payments under the Commodity Supply Contract from the revenues of its electric utility system as an operating expense of its electric utility system.

**Maintenance of Rates and Charges.** The Project Participant has covenanted and agreed that it will fix, prescribe, maintain, and collect rates, fees, and charges for the electricity or services furnished by its electric utility system so as to provide revenues sufficient to enable it to pay all amounts payable under the Commodity Supply Contract and all other amounts payable from the revenues of the Project Participant’s electric system, and to maintain any required reserves.

**Pledge of Electric System Revenues.** The Project Participant agrees that it will not grant any lien on or security interest in, or otherwise pledge or encumber, the revenues of its electric utility system that would create a lien, pledge or other encumbrance having priority over the obligations of the Project Participant to pay the amounts due to NCEA under the Commodity Supply Agreement.

**Tax-Exempt Status of Bonds.** The Project Participant acknowledges that the Bonds will be issued with the intention that the interest thereon will be exempt from federal taxes under Section 103 of the Code. Accordingly, the Project Participant agrees that it will (a) provide such information with respect to its utility system as may be requested by NCEA in order to establish the tax-exempt status of the Bonds, and (b) act in accordance with such written instructions as NCEA may provide from time to time in order to maintain the tax-exempt status of the Bonds. The Project Participant further agrees that it will not at any time take any action, or fail to take any action, that would adversely affect the tax-exempt status of the Bonds.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Project Participant has further agreed, subject to certain remediation rights, to use the Commodities purchased under the Commodity Supply Contract (a) in a “qualifying use” as defined in the applicable Treasury Regulations, (b) in a manner that will not result in any “private business use” within the meaning of Section 141 of the Code, and (c) in a manner consistent with its Federal Tax Certificate (collectively, the “Qualifying Use Requirements”).

**Remediation.** The Project Participant may at times need to remarket, or inadvertently remarket, Commodities received under the Commodity Supply Contract in a manner that does not comply with Qualifying Use Requirements.
<!-- Page 873 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Page)

Use Requirements due to daily and hourly fluctuations in the Project Participant’s Commodity needs. To the extent the Project Participant does so, the Project Participant shall, to the extent possible, use the proceeds of such remarketing to purchase Commodities (other than Priority Commodities) that the Project Participant uses in compliance with the Qualifying Use Requirements not later than the end of the semi-annual period in which such proceeds were received. To track compliance with these requirements, the Project Participant will provide a semi-annual report to NCEA (delivered not later than the fifteenth day of each April and October until the end of the Delivery Period) showing the following: the total quantity of proceeds from sales of Commodities received under the Commodity Supply Contract that (a) were sold by the Project Participant to any person other than a Municipal Utility and (b) have not been remediated by the Project Participant by applying such proceeds to purchase gas or electricity that is used in compliance with the Qualifying Use Requirements.

**TRANSPORTATION; TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS**

Except as otherwise provided in the Commodity Supply Contract, NCEA must make arrangements for all transportation and transmission services required to effect, and must bear all costs and expenses of, transportation and transmission prior to the delivery of the Contract Quantity at the applicable delivery point specified in the Commodity Supply Contract. The Project Participant must make all arrangements for all transportation and transmission services required to receive the Contract Quantity at such delivery point and to transport it from such delivery point.

Title to the Commodities delivered under the Commodity Supply Contract and risk of loss pass from NCEA to the Project Participant at the applicable delivery point; provided that title and risk of loss for Assigned Gas and Assigned Electricity shall be in accordance with the applicable Gas Assignment Agreement or PPA Assignment Agreement. With respect to gas, NCEA will be deemed to be in exclusive control and possession of gas prior to the time of delivery to the Project Participant at the delivery point, and the Project Participant will be deemed to be in exclusive control and possession of gas thereafter.

**FAILURE TO PERFORM**

Except in the case of a “Force Majeure” event, for each Commodity Unit that NCEA is obligated to deliver to the Project Participant but fails to deliver, NCEA must pay to the Project Participant an amount equal to the difference between the Contract Price per Commodity Unit which would have been applicable to the undelivered Commodity and any higher cost per Commodity Unit which the Project Participant actually incurred to obtain an equivalent quantity of replacement gas or electricity.

In the event that NCEA tenders the Contract Quantity for delivery to the Project Participant and the Project Participant fails to take the full amount of the Contract Quantity (except in the case of a “Force Majeure” event, described below), the Project Participant will remain obligated to pay NCEA the Contract Price for the full amount of the Contract Quantity. NCEA will credit to the Project Participant’s account the net amount described under the heading “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Commodity Remarketing.”

**REMARKETING OF COMMODITIES**

In the event the Project Participant (a) does not require or is unable to receive all or any portion of the Contract Quantity that it is obligated to purchase under the Commodity Supply Contract as a result of (i) 

-61-
<!-- Page 874 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

decreased gas requirements due to reduced generation requirements during the Gas Delivery Period, (ii) decreased demand by the Project Participant’s retail customers or (iii) a change in law, or (b) makes a Remarketing Election for any Reset Period (as described under “THE COMMODITY PROJECT—Re-Pricing Agreement”), NCEA will arrange for the sale by the Commodity Supplier of the affected quantities of Commodities to another Municipal Utility or other purchaser pursuant to the remarketing provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement; provided that, in the case of a remarketing request to the Commodity Supplier under clause (a)(iii) above, notice of such a remarketing must be provided at least six months in advance as set forth in the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Supplier must consent to such a remarketing, with such consent to be provided in its sole discretion. Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, NCEA arranges for sales through the Commodity Supplier in accordance with the remarketing provisions and procedures set forth in that agreement. Except in the case of a Remarketing Election given by the Project Participant, if the Commodity Supplier successfully makes such a sale or sales, NCEA must credit, in circumstances described in the Commodity Supply Contract, against the amount owed by the Project Participant for such gas revenues received by NCEA from the sales of such gas less all directly incurred costs or expenses (which include remarketing fees paid to the Commodity Supplier), but in no event more than the Contract Price. If the Project Participant that makes a Remarketing Election in accordance with the provisions of the Commodity Supply Contract, it will have no obligation to purchase or receive Commodities, and NCEA shall have no obligation to sell or deliver Commodities, under the Commodity Supply Contract, during the applicable Reset Period.

See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Commodity Remarketing” and “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT—Commodity Remarketing.”

FORCE MAJEURE

Except with regard to a party’s obligation to make payments under the Commodity Supply Contract that are then due or becoming due with respect to performance prior to the Force Majeure, neither party shall be liable to the other for failure to perform its obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract to the extent such failure was caused by an event of “Force Majeure,” which is defined in the Commodity Supply Contract during the Gas Delivery Period as (i) physical events such as acts of God, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, storms or storm warnings, such as hurricanes, which result in evacuation of the affected area, floods, washouts, explosions, breakage or accident or necessity of repairs to machinery or equipment or lines of pipe; (ii) weather related events affecting an entire geographic region, such as low temperatures which cause freezing or failure of wells or lines of pipe; (iii) interruption and/or curtailment of transportation and/or storage by Transporters (provided that if the affected Party is using interruptible or secondary Firm transportation, only if primary, in-path, Firm transportation is also curtailed by the same event, or, if the relevant Transporter does not curtail based on path, if primary Firm transportation is also curtailed); (iv) acts of others such as strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances, riots, sabotage, insurrections, wars or acts of terror; and (v) governmental actions such as necessity for compliance with Law promulgated by a government agency having jurisdiction.

During the Electricity Delivery Period, “Force Majeure” means an event or circumstance which prevents one party from performing its obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract, which event or circumstance was not anticipated as of date of execution of the Commodity Supply Contract, which is not within the reasonable control of, or the result of the negligence of, the party claiming Force Majeure, and which, by the exercise of due diligence, the claiming party is unable to overcome or avoid or cause to be avoided.

-62-
<!-- Page 875 -->
In addition, any invocation of Force Majeure by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement constitutes Force Majeure under the Commodity Supply Contract.

**DEFAULT AND REMEDIES**

**NCEA Default.** Each of the following events constitute a “NCEA Default” under the Commodity Supply Contract:

(a) any representation or warranty made by NCEA in the Commodity Supply Contract proves to have been incorrect in any material respect when made; or

(b) NCEA fails to perform, observe or comply with any covenant, agreement or term contained in the Commodity Supply Contract, and such failure continues for more than 30 days following the earlier of (i) receipt by NCEA of notice thereof or (ii) an officer of NCEA becoming aware of such default;

**Project Participant Default.** Each of the following events shall constitute a “Project Participant Default” under the Commodity Supply Contract:

(a) the Project Participant fails to pay when due any amounts owed to NCEA pursuant to the Commodity Supply Contract and such failure continues for one business day following the earlier of (i) receipt by the Project Participant of notice thereof or (ii) an officer of the Project Participant becoming aware of such default;

(b) the Project Participant’s insolvency or bankruptcy;

(c) any representation or warranty made by the Project Participant in the Commodity Supply Contract proves to have been incorrect in any material respect when made; or

(d) the Project Participant fails to perform, observe or comply with any covenant, agreement or term contained in the Commodity Supply Contract, and such failure continues for more than 15 days following the earlier of (i) receipt by the Project Participant of notice thereof or (ii) an officer of the Project Participant becoming aware of such default.

**Termination.** If at any time an NCEA Default or a Project Participant Default has occurred and is continuing, then the non-defaulting party may do any or all of the following by notice to the defaulting Party specifying the relevant NCEA Default or Project Participant Default, as applicable, terminate the Commodity Supply Contract effective as of a day not earlier than the day such notice is deemed given under the Commodity Supply Contract and/or declare all amounts due to the non-defaulting party under the Commodity Supply Contract immediately due and payable, and the same shall thereupon become immediately due and payable, without notice, demand, presentment, notice of dishonor, notice of intent to demand, protest or other formalities of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by the defaulting party; provided, however, the Commodity Supply Contract will automatically terminate and all amounts due to the non-defaulting party thereunder will immediately become due and payable as of the time immediately preceding the institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant petition that upon the occurrence of certain events relating to a Project Participant Default described in (b) above. In addition, during the existence of an NCEA Default or

**GENERAL**

SMUD and SFA formed NCEA by their execution of a Joint Powers Agreement, dated as of November 8, 2018 (the “Joint Powers Agreement”). SFA is itself a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and the Modesto Irrigation District in 1992. NCEA has the power, among others, under the Act and the Joint Powers Agreement to take all action necessary or convenient to assist SMUD in the acquisition and financing of supplies of natural gas and electricity.

**GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT**

Under the Joint Powers Agreement, the Board of Directors of SMUD is the governing body (the “Commission”) of NCEA. The current members of the Commission are listed in APPENDIX B under the caption “INTRODUCTION—Independent Governance.” Certain of SMUD’s officers, including its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Controller and Secretary, jointly serve in the same or similar capacities as officers of NCEA. NCEA has no independent employees. The Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel of SMUD serves as general counsel to NCEA.

Pursuant to the Joint Powers Agreement, SMUD will provide or cause to be provided such technical and general and administrative services as NCEA may reasonably require. NCEA may reimburse SMUD for its actual costs of providing such services. Although SMUD has provided and will continue to provide NCEA with staffing and consultant support pursuant to the Joint Powers Agreement SMUD does not have any obligation or liability to NCEA beyond that specifically provided in the Joint Powers Agreement and the Commodity Supply Contract. SFA and the Modesto Irrigation District have no obligations or liabilities to NCEA.

**LIMITED LIABILITY**

THE BONDS DO NOT CONSTITUTE A DEBT OR LIABILITY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR OF ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF (INCLUDING THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT), OTHER THAN NCEA, BUT SHALL BE PAYABLE SOLELY FROM THE FUNDS PROVIDED THEREFOR UNDER THE INDENTURE. NCEA SHALL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO PAY THE PRINCIPAL OR REDEMPTION PRICE OF OR INTEREST ON THE BONDS, EXCEPT FROM THE FUNDS PROVIDED THEREFOR UNDER THE INDENTURE AND NEITHER THE FAITH AND CREDIT NOR THE TAXING POWER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR OF ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF, INCLUDING NCEA, OR OF THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT IS PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OR REDEMPTION PRICE OF AND INTEREST ON THE BONDS. THE ISSUANCE OF THE BONDS SHALL NOT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OR CONTINGENTLY OBLIGATE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF (INCLUDING THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT) TO LEVY OR TO PLEDGE ANY FORM OF TAXATION OR TO MAKE ANY APPROPRIATION FOR THEIR PAYMENT. NCEA HAS NO TAXING POWER.

**CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING NCEA AND THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT**

**GENERAL**

Various factors will affect the operations of NCEA and Project Participant, including, for example:

- retention of existing customers by the Project Participant; 

-65-
<!-- Page 878 -->
- local, regional and national economic conditions;
- the market price of gas, electricity and the market price of alternate forms of energy;
- fuel conservation measures;
- the availability of alternate energy sources;
- climatic conditions;
- government regulation and deregulation of the energy industry;
- federal and state regulation of, and private sector initiatives to limit, greenhouse gas emissions; and
- technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices.

NCEA is unable to predict the impact of the foregoing factors, and other factors, on the Project Participant and their respective gas and electricity system operations. However, the gas and electricity supply and services to be provided by NCEA are intended to maintain and improve the competitive position of the Project Participant by providing them with additional services and competitive prices for a portion of their gas supply.

## DISRUPTIONS IN THE NATURAL GAS MARKET

The Project Participant engages in various transactions in the natural gas markets, including the purchase and sale of natural gas and transactions to hedge their exposure to changes in the market price of natural gas. The ability of the Project Participant to enter into these transactions is dependent upon a variety of factors, including most notably prevailing conditions in the natural gas market.

At various times in the past, the natural gas market experienced severe disruptions, including extremely high and volatile commodity prices, inverted forward price curves and constrained transportation and sources of supply. The factors giving rise to these conditions — demands for gas and other forms of energy, economic conditions, weather patterns, inadequate regulation by federal and state authorities, and the exercise of market power and the manipulation of the gas markets by marketers or others are beyond the control of NCEA and the Project Participant. To the extent that disruptions in the natural gas market prevent the Project Participant from engaging in those transactions that are necessary to enable it to manage risks, its financial and operating position may be adversely affected.

On February 13 through February 17, 2021, a major winter and ice storm had widespread impacts across the central, southeastern and eastern United States, northern Mexico, and parts of Canada (“Winter Storm Uri”), which resulted in electricity blackouts for over 9.9 million people in the United States and contributed to significant shortages of, and substantially increased costs for, natural gas across the United States. [NCEA did not experience any material supply or payment disruptions under its long-term supply and sales contracts due to the events of Winter Storm Uri.] 

-66-
<!-- Page 879 -->
On February 24, 2022, Russia commenced a military invasion of Ukraine. The invasion, subsequent economic sanctions imposed by nations opposed to the invasion, and reductions and suspensions of Russian gas deliveries impacted global natural gas markets and resulted in significant increases in the market price of natural gas in the United States. While these impacts have subsided, it is not possible to predict the ongoing effects of the continuing military conflict in Ukraine on natural gas markets and gas prices:

**THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT**

For information regarding Sacramento Municipal Utility District, see APPENDIX B—INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT.

**CONTINUING DISCLOSURE**

NCEA, the Project Participant and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., will enter into a Continuing Disclosure Agreement (the “Undertaking”) for the benefit of the beneficial owners of the Bonds to send certain information annually and to provide notice of certain events to the MSRB’s EMMA system for municipal securities disclosures, pursuant to the requirements of Section (b)(5) of Rule 15c2-12 (“Rule 15c2-12”) adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

A failure by NCEA or the Project Participant to comply with the Undertaking will not constitute an event of default under the Indenture, the Bonds or the Commodity Supply Contract, and Beneficial Owners of the Bonds shall only be entitled to the remedies for any such failure described in the Undertaking. A failure by NCEA or the Project Participant to comply with certain provisions of the Undertaking must be reported in accordance with Rule 15c2-12 and must be considered by any broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer before recommending the purchase or sale of the Bonds in the secondary market. Consequently, such a failure may adversely affect the transferability and liquidity of the Bonds and their market price.

The Undertaking and commitments of NCEA and the Project Participant described under this heading and in APPENDIX E hereto to furnish the above-described documents and information are agreements and commitments solely of NCEA and the Project Participant, and the Underwriter has no responsibility to ensure that NCEA and the Project Participant comply with the Undertaking and such commitments. In addition, the Underwriter makes no representation that any such documents or information will be furnished, or that any such documents or information so furnished will be accurate or complete, or sufficient for the purposes for which they may be used.

NCEA and the Project Participant report that there have been no instances in the five years previous to the date of this Official Statement in which they failed to comply in all material respects with their prior continuing disclosure undertakings pursuant to Rule 15c2-12. [NTD: update/confirm]

NCEA and the Project Participant have adopted a written policy that sets forth procedures for compliance with the federal tax and continuing disclosure requirements applicable to its bonds. The policy includes, among other things, procedures that are intended to promote NCEA and the Project Participant’s compliance with the Undertaking.

![Tax Matters](https://example.com/image.png)

NCEA has furnished to each rating agency expected to rate the bonds being offered certain information, including information not included in this Official Statement, about NCEA and the Bonds. Generally, rating agencies base their ratings on that information and on independent investigations, studies and assumptions made by each rating agency. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. There is no assurance that a rating, once obtained, will continue for any given period of time or that it will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely if, in the opinion of the rating agency, circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision or withdrawal could have an adverse effect on the marketability or market price of the Bonds. NCEA has not undertaken any responsibility after issuance of the Bonds to assure the maintenance of the ratings applicable thereto or to oppose any revision or withdrawal of such ratings.

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to NCEA (“Bond Counsel”), based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Code, and the Bonds and interest thereon are exempt from all state, county, municipal and other taxation in the State of California. Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the Bonds included in a financial statement income of certain corporations may be subject to the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in APPENDIX F hereto.

The Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount higher than their principal amount payable at maturity (or, in some cases, at their earlier call date) (“Premium Bonds”) will be treated as having amortizable bond premium. No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the case of bonds, like the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. However, the amount of tax-exempt interest received, and a Beneficial Owner’s basis in a Premium Bond, will be reduced by the amount of amortizable bond premium properly allocable to such Beneficial Owner. Beneficial Owners of Premium Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the proper treatment of amortizable bond premium in their particular circumstances.

The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the Bonds. NCEA and SMUD have made certain representations and covenanted to comply with certain restrictions, conditions and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the Bonds will not be included in federal gross income. Inaccuracy of these representations or failure to comply with these covenants may result in interest on the Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the Bonds. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants. Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken), or events occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond Counsel’s attention after the date of issuance of the Bonds may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the Bonds.

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds may otherwise affect a Beneficial Owner’s federal, state or local tax liability. The nature and extent of these other tax consequences depend upon the particular tax status of the Beneficial Owner or the Beneficial Owner’s other items of income or deduction. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences.

Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Code or court decisions may cause interest on the Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal income taxation or to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent Beneficial Owners from realizing the full benefit of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals, clarification of the Code or court decisions may also affect, perhaps significantly, the market price for, or marketability of, the Bonds. Prospective purchasers of the Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding any pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, and regarding the impact of future legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment of the Bonds for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of NCEA or SMUD, or about the effect of future changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the IRS. NCEA and SMUD must comply with the requirements of the Code.

Bond Counsel’s engagement with respect to the Bonds and the issuance of the Bonds, and, unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to defend NCEA, SMUD or the Beneficial Owners regarding the tax-exempt status of the Bonds in the event of an audit examination by the IRS. Under current procedures, parties other than NCEA, SMUD and their appointed counsel, including the Beneficial Owners, would have little, if any, right to participate in the audit examination process. Moreover, because achieving judicial review in connection with an audit examination of tax-exempt bonds is difficult, obtaining an independent review of IRS positions with which NCEA or SMUD legitimately disagrees may not be practicable. Any action of the IRS, including but not limited to selection of the Bonds for audit, or the course or result of such audit, or an audit of bonds presenting similar tax issues, may affect the market price for, or the marketability of, the Bonds, and may cause NCEA, SMUD or the Beneficial Owners to incur significant expense.

Payments on the Bonds generally will be subject to U.S. information reporting and possibly to “backup withholding.” Under Section 3406 of the Code and applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, a non-corporate Beneficial Owner of Bonds may be subject to backup withholding with respect to “reportable payments,” which include interest paid on the Bonds and the gross proceeds of a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of the Bonds. The payee will be required to deduct and withhold the prescribed amounts if (i) the payee fails to furnish a U.S. taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) to the payor in the manner required, (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect, (iii) there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in Section 3406(c) of the Code or (iv) the payee fails to certify under penalty of perjury that the payee is not subject to withholding under Section 3406(a)(1)(C) of the Code. Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a Beneficial Owner’s federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

# INTRODUCTION

## General

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) owns and operates an electric system that has provided retail electric service since 1946. SMUD’s current service area is approximately 900 square miles, and includes the principal parts of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. See “THE SERVICE AREA AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM – The Service Area.”

## Independent Governance

SMUD is an independently run community-owned organization. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government.

SMUD is governed by a Board of Directors (the “Board”), which consists of seven directors elected by ward for staggered four-year terms. The Board determines policy and appoints the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, who is responsible for SMUD’s overall management and day-to-day operations. The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager is responsible for the hiring and removal of all employees, other than the Chief Legal and Government Affairs Officer and General Counsel, the Internal Auditor and the Special Assistant to the Board, who are hired and may be removed only by the Board. The employment status of nearly all SMUD employees is governed by a civil service system administered by the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager.

The Board elects its President and Vice President annually to take office in January. The current members of the Board are as follows:

| Name                     | Occupation                                               | Ward  | Term Expires     |

**THE SERVICE AREA AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM**

**The Service Area**

SMUD is the primary distributor of electric power within an area of approximately 900 square miles in central California. The service area includes the State Capital, Sacramento, the populous areas principally to the northeast and south of the City of Sacramento (the “City” or “Sacramento”) and the agricultural areas to the north and south. The City is located 85 miles northeast of San Francisco.

SMUD’s electric system supplies power to a population of approximately 1.5 million with a total annual retail load of approximately 10,104 million kilowatt-hours (“kWh”) for the year ended December 31, 2023. As the capital of the nation’s most populous state, Sacramento benefits from the historically stabilizing influence of a large government sector. Sacramento is home to the State government headquarters, the Sacramento County seat, the City government and various special districts that combine to make government the largest single employment sector in the Sacramento area. Information technology, transportation, education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and construction round out the other major sectors of employment and industry in the area.

SMUD’s annual peak load has averaged 3,045 Megawatts (“MW”) over the last three years, with SMUD’s record peak load of 3,299 MW occurring on July 24, 2006. In 2022, SMUD recorded its second highest peak load of 3,263 MW. SMUD reviews its load forecast, at a minimum, on an annual basis.

**The Electric System**

SMUD owns and operates an integrated electric system that includes generation, transmission and distribution facilities.

SMUD supplies power to its bulk power substations through a 230 kilovolt (“kV”) and 115 kV transmission system. This system transmits power from SMUD’s generation plants and interconnects with Pacific Gas & Electric (“PG&E”) and the Western Area Power Administration (“WAPA”). Power is distributed throughout Sacramento County via a 69 kV sub-transmission system with the exception of the City’s downtown area, which is served from the 115 kV transmission system. The downtown area is served from 115/12 kV and 115/21 kV substations. The distribution system serving the remainder of SMUD’s service territory is comprised of 69/12 kV substations with overhead and underground 12 kV distribution circuits.

with current energy market prices. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges.”

**Renewable Options.** SMUD’s customers have been increasingly interested in distributed energy resources, mainly through the installation of solar systems. As of December 2023, approximately 51,374 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, approximately 8% of retail customers, had installed solar systems, representing approximately 360 MW of solar installations.

As the cost of energy storage continues to decline, SMUD anticipates an increase in behind-the-meter energy storage, mainly through the installation of battery storage systems. As of December 2023, approximately 1,532 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, had installed storage systems, representing approximately 10 MW of storage.

As another option for solar, SMUD’s SolarShares® pilot program (the “SolarShares Pilot”) was established as a cost-effective and convenient way for commercial customers to meet their energy needs from solar power. The SolarShares Pilot offered SMUD commercial customers the opportunity to receive solar power without upfront costs or equipment installation through 5-, 10- or 20-year purchase contracts. Customers that entered into purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot receive up to half of their power from a utility-scale solar system. SMUD supplies solar power for the SolarShares Pilot either by building and maintaining utility-scale solar systems or by procuring solar power from third parties through power purchase agreements. The SolarShares Pilot generation was approximately 3.2% of retail sales in 2023. As of April 30, 2021, SMUD had completed the SolarShares Pilot and is not entering into new purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot.

Since January 2020, the California Building Code has required all new constructed residential buildings under three stories to be powered by photovoltaic solar systems. A new home satisfies this requirement if it installs on-site solar or participates in an approved community solar or energy storage program. In February 2020, SMUD obtained approval from the California Energy Commission (“CEC”) to administer its own community solar program, called Neighborhood SolarShares® (“Neighborhood SolarShares”). SMUD’s Neighborhood SolarShares program can be used by developers of new low-rise residential buildings to satisfy the mandatory solar requirement. See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Rooftop Solar Mandate.” Starting in 2023, the California Building Code’s mandatory solar requirement extends beyond low-rise residential properties, and other changes to the California Building Code’s community solar regulations took effect. SMUD revised its program to align with the new regulations and, in May 2023, obtained approval from the CEC to continue offering its Neighborhood SolarShares compliance option to newly constructed low rise residential homes in its service territory.

In addition to the SolarShares Pilot and Neighborhood SolarShares, SMUD maintains a voluntary green energy pricing program called Greenergy® (“Greenery”). The Greenery program allows customers the opportunity to pay an additional amount per month to ensure that either all or part of their electricity comes from green or carbon free energy sources. In 2023, the program allocated Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”) equivalent to approximately 4.2% of retail sales to its participating customers.

**Energy Efficiency.** To further assist customers in managing energy use and reducing regional carbon emissions and air pollution, SMUD offers an extensive array of energy efficiency and building electrification programs and services including financial incentives, loans, energy audits and education. In addition, SMUD has partnered with local developers to incorporate energy efficiency and all-electric construction measures into new residential and commercial construction, which helps developers plan and design efficient, cost-effective and low or zero-emission buildings. As part of SMUD’s 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”), SMUD set a goal for regional carbon emissions through transport and building A-7
<!-- Page 898 -->

electrification that aims to reduce carbon emissions in buildings and transport by 64% over the next 20 years. SMUD’s focus on electrification is continued in the Zero Carbon Plan (defined and discussed below). SMUD was the first electric utility in the country to set its efficiency goals based on carbon reductions, allowing building electrification and energy efficiency to both count toward meeting SMUD’s efficiency goals. This is a significant opportunity, as converting a typical home today to all-electric saves more than three times the carbon emissions compared to doing a major energy efficiency upgrade alone to the same building. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources.”

**Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission**

Maintaining a sustainable power supply entails focusing efforts on researching, promoting and implementing new renewable energy technologies and sources to meet SMUD’s long-term commitment to reducing carbon emissions and providing a reliable energy supply. SMUD defines a sustainable power supply as one that reduces SMUD’s GHG emissions to serve retail customer load to zero by 2030. See “– 2030 Zero Carbon Plan”. Below, SMUD is planning to achieve zero GHG emissions to serve retail customer load through investments in energy efficiency, clean distributed energy resources, renewables portfolio standard (“RPS”) eligible renewables, energy storage, large hydroelectric generation, clean and emissions free fuels, carbon capture and sequestration, and new technologies and business models. Additionally, SMUD plans to continue pursuing GHG emissions reductions through vehicle, building and equipment electrification. At the same time, SMUD’s plans for maintaining a sustainable power supply include assuring the reliability of SMUD’s electric system, minimizing environmental impacts on land, habitat, water and air quality, and maintaining competitive rates relative to other electric providers in the State.

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills regulate GHG emissions and promote the development of sustainable generation alternatives, principally through more stringent RPS. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings” herein.

**2030 Zero Carbon Plan.** In July 2020, the Board declared a climate emergency and adopted a resolution calling for SMUD to take significant and consequential actions to reduce its carbon footprint by 2030. On April 28, 2021, the Board approved SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan (the “Zero Carbon Plan”). The Zero Carbon Plan is intended to be a flexible roadmap for SMUD to eliminate carbon emissions from its electricity production by 2030 while maintaining reliable and affordable service. To achieve these goals the Zero Carbon Plan is focused on four main areas: natural gas generation repurposing, proven technologies, new technologies and business models and financial impacts and options. SMUD plans to revisit the Zero Carbon Plan annually.

The natural gas generation repurposing focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for exploring the replacement of two of SMUD’s five Local Gas-Fired Plants (as defined herein) and the retooling of the other three Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” Based on SMUD’s studies to date, SMUD estimates that McClellan (as defined herein) and the Campbell Soup Project (as defined herein) can be replaced in the next several years depending on SMUD’s success with replacement resources. Final decisions about the replacement of these two Local Gas-Fired Plants will be based on additional reliability studies and engagement with the community. As part of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is also exploring converting the Carson Project (as defined herein) and the Procter & Gamble Project (as defined herein) to reliability use operations only and investigating the use of alternative fuels like Renewable Natural Gas-biomethane (RNG-biomanthene), hydrogen and other biofuels for the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, and the Consumers Power Plant (as defined herein). In addition, SMUD is investigating new technologies such as long duration energy storage, carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen and other clean fuel alternatives to help support

A-8
<!-- Page 899 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

the reduction of GHG emissions in SMUD’s energy supply. All final generator configurations are subject to reliability assessments.

The proven clean technologies focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for SMUD to procure approximately 1,100 to 1,500 MW of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (“PV”) generating capacity, 700 to 1,100 MW of local utility-scale battery storage, 300 to 500 MW of wind generating capacity, and 100 to 220 MW of geothermal generating capacity. The Zero Carbon Plan also estimates that customer installation of approximately 500 to 750 MW of behind-the-meter solar PV generating capacity and approximately 50 to 250 MW of behind-the-meter battery storage will assist SMUD with achieving the Zero Carbon Plan goals.

With respect to new technologies and business models, the Zero Carbon Plan focuses on evaluating, prioritizing and scaling the emerging technologies that SMUD expects will have the largest impact on reducing carbon in SMUD’s 2030 resource mix. SMUD is currently focused on various areas of technology and customer-focused programs, including electrification, demand flexibility, virtual power plants, vehicle-to-grid technology, and new grid-scale technologies. The Zero Carbon Plan forecasts that customer-owned devices and SMUD customer-focused programs will contribute between 360 and 1,300 MW of capacity to SMUD’s grid by 2030.

The financial impacts and options focus of the Zero Carbon Plan aims to keep SMUD rate increases at or below the rate of inflation while achieving SMUD’s goal of eliminating carbon emissions from its power supply by 2030. To pay for the expected costs of the Zero Carbon Plan and keep rate increases at or below the rate of inflation, the Zero Carbon Plan estimates the need for SMUD to realize between $50 million and $150 million of sustained annual savings. SMUD currently plans to achieve these sustained annual savings by exploring the implementation of operational savings and pursuing partnership and grant opportunities.

While the ultimate impacts of the Zero Carbon Plan on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative costs of procuring energy from clean technologies, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers, such impacts could be material.

Renewable Energy and Climate Change. The California Renewable Energy Resources Act, established by Senate Bill X1-2 (“SBX1-2”) and the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015, enacted by Senate Bill 350 (“SB 350”) require that SMUD meets 33% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2020 and 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2030. Senate Bill 100 (“SB 100”), passed by the legislature and approved by then-Governor Brown on September 10, 2018, accelerates the RPS targets and establishes a new 60% target by 2030. The bill also created a planning goal to meet all of the State’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Renewables Portfolio Standards” for a discussion of the State RPS requirements.

SMUD’s compliance with State RPS requirements is evaluated over 3- or 4-year compliance periods. SMUD met the State RPS requirements for the first compliance period (2011-2013) and second compliance period (2014-2016). The third compliance period (2017-2020) required SMUD to source one-third of its energy from renewable resources, and SMUD had sufficient RECs to meet the third compliance period requirements. SMUD filed its 2020 and third compliance period RPS compliance report with the CEC in the second quarter of 2021 and the CEC adopted SMUD’s third compliance period verification report in December 2023. SMUD expects the confirmation letter from the CEC indicating that SMUD was

in full compliance with its third compliance period RPS obligations in the first quarter of 2024. As of the end of the third compliance period (2020), SMUD had approximately one million surplus RECs available to help meet future RPS targets. SMUD expects to file its 2023 RPS compliance report by July 1, 2024, showing that SMUD will have provided approximately 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources in 2023, which is greater than the interim 2023 RPS target of 41.25%. RPS compliance is determined by compliance period and not by individual years and SMUD anticipates having sufficient surplus procured and/or under contract resources in the fourth compliance period (2021-2024) to be in compliance with the RPS requirements. In addition to meeting RPS standards, SMUD serves an additional 7.4% of its customer load with renewable energy through its voluntary SolarShares and Greenergy pricing programs described above. SMUD estimates that it has sufficient renewable energy deliveries, new power supply contract commitments, new power supply commitments under active discussion, and RPS-eligible surplus carryover to meet its RPS requirements through 2025. Additional resources have been identified that are expected to provide sufficient RPS-eligible resources to cover most of SMUD’s RPS requirements through 2030. Future solicitations may be needed to fill any remaining gaps. The following chart illustrates SMUD’s current RPS requirements through 2030 and its existing and committed resources utilized to meet those requirements.

In addition to procuring new sources, meeting the RPS requirements will require replacement of certain existing renewable contracts which expire in future years. While SMUD anticipates it will meet much of its renewable resource requirements through purchased contracts with third parties, it continues to explore additional options, including wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal developments, partnering with other utilities on future projects, and local development options. SMUD’s resource forecast (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources”) accounts for future renewable resources as a component of “Uncommitted Purchases.” To meet SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan goals, SMUD anticipates meeting loads in 2030 with approximately 70-80% renewable resources, in addition to hydro and other new zero carbon technologies. See “– 2030 Zero Carbon Plan” above.

Given the intermittent nature of power from renewable resources such as wind and solar, SMUD is exploring and investing in options that provide the flexibility to manage the intermittency of such renewable resources. Potential options include energy storage resources, which SMUD has committed to as part of the Zero Carbon Plan, and expanding load management resources. Additionally, on April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its membership in BANC, a joint exercise of powers agency formed in 2009, and currently comprised of SMUD, the Modesto Irrigation District (“MID”), the City of Roseville (“Roseville”), the City of Redding (“Redding”), the City of Shasta Lake and the Trinity Public Utilities District, commenced participation in the California Independent System Operator Corporation (“CAISO”) western energy imbalance market (“WEIM”). Participation in the WEIM benefits SMUD by providing it with broader access to balancing resources within the region to help manage its expanding renewable portfolio. In addition, other entities within the BANC Balancing Authority Area began participation in the WEIM on March 25, 2021. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Operational Independence and Local Control” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

In 2022, SMUD’s Board formally adopted the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan as SMUD’s updated IRP. SMUD filed the approved IRP update with the CEC on September 14, 2022, pursuant to the CEC’s guidelines, which called for updating SMUD’s IRP filing within five years of SMUD’s previous filing of April 29, 2019. SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan built upon the April 2019 IRP and set a goal for zero carbon emissions by 2030. SMUD’s next formal IRP process is expected to be completed and filed with the CEC in 2027. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

The State’s carbon cap-and-trade market established pursuant to Assembly Bill 32 (“AB 32”) began in 2013. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Greenhouse Gas Emissions” for a discussion of AB 32 and the State’s cap-and-trade program. SMUD anticipates that allowances allocated to SMUD will nearly equal SMUD’s compliance obligations under normal water year conditions. Under low water year conditions, SMUD may need to purchase additional allowances to cover its compliance obligations, including carbon obligations related to wholesale energy sales from SMUD’s natural gas power plants. As SMUD implements its clean power goals, SMUD expects its need for these allowances to decline.

There is scientific consensus that increasing concentrations of GHG have caused and will continue to cause a rise in temperatures in the State and around the world. The change in the earth’s average atmospheric temperature, generally referred to as “climate change,” is, among other things, expected to result in a wide range of changes in climate patterns, including increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including droughts and heat waves, more frequent incidences of wildfires, changes in wind patterns, sea level rise and flooding, any of which alone or in combination could materially adversely affect SMUD’s financial results or operations. See also “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION” and “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY – Other Factors.” As described above, SMUD is actively working to meet its sustainable power supply goals,

A-11

reduce its own GHG emissions, and assist the local governments in the territory it serves with their desired GHG reductions. In 2016, SMUD introduced the Pilot Natural Refrigerant Incentive Program, its first customer program providing incentives for GHG reduction in addition to kWh savings. SMUD is a founding member and active participant in the Capital Region Climate Readiness Collaborative, a public-private partnership formed to better understand and plan for climate impacts expected in the region. SMUD is also an active member of the United States Department of Energy (the “DOE”) Partnership for Energy Sector Climate Resilience. SMUD regularly reviews scientific findings related to climate change and in 2016 published its Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan. In 2024, SMUD is planning to update the Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan along with other climate resiliency actions.

Energy Storage Systems. Assembly Bill 2514 (“AB 2514”) requires the Board to re-evaluate energy storage goals every three years. In compliance with AB 2514, the Board established a target of 9 MW of energy storage procurement by December 31, 2020, which SMUD has procured. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Energy Storage Systems” for further discussion of AB 2514. In September 2020, the Board directed that energy storage forecasts be implemented through SMUD’s IRP process going forward. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” above for a discussion of SMUD’s IRP. SMUD is also evaluating how to couple utility-scale solar with utility-scale storage to support future system reliability needs and enable energy goals.

Meeting Peak Load. A significant consideration for SMUD will be how it addresses its system peak load. SMUD has implemented programs and tools, such as advanced metering, energy efficiency options, and TOD rates for residential customers, to help customers manage their costs while helping SMUD reduce its peak load. Analysis of 2022 data showed a reduction of approximately 108 MW, weather continue to monitor the progress and results of the implementation of TOD rates and will use this information to inform future rate actions and load forecasts. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Time-of-Day Rates.”

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved an optional residential Critical Peak Pricing rate (the “Peak Pricing Rate”), which went into effect June 1, 2022. The Peak Pricing Rate is designed to reduce load by increasing the price of energy when the grid is most impacted, up to 50 hours per summer. In exchange, customers on the rate will receive a per kWh discount on summer Off-Peak and Mid-Peak rates. SMUD is also exploring the use of more distributed energy resources and demand response programs that could further reduce SMUD’s system peak.

Operational Independence and Local Control. A key component of SMUD’s business strategy is focused on maintaining its independence in operating and maintaining its resources. As such, SMUD has taken a number of actions to mitigate the potential impacts of various federal and state regulatory actions. For example, in 2002 SMUD established itself as an independent control area (now termed “Balancing Authority”) within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (“WECC”) region. By removing itself from CAISO’s Balancing Authority area, SMUD became responsible for balancing electric supply and demand within its own service territory. This move substantially reduced fees paid to CAISO, preserved operational flexibility and helped to insulate SMUD from the uncertain regulatory environment and tariff structure of CAISO. In addition to decreased financial risks, this independence also reduced SMUD’s exposure to the impacts of capacity and energy shortages in the CAISO Balancing Authority area. Further, as an independent Balancing Authority, SMUD continued to support the statewide electric grid in events of electrical emergencies requiring rotating outages, such as loss of major transmission lines or equipment, as provided in the statewide emergency plan. By 2006, the SMUD Balancing Authority footprint expanded north to the California-Oregon border and south to Modesto, to include the service areas of the WAPA, MID, Redding and Roseville, and TANC-owned 340-mile 500-kV California-Oregon Transmission Project.

Managing Risks  
SMUD maintains an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program, a strategic approach to managing enterprise-wide risks as a portfolio, to help reduce the chance of loss, create greater financial stability and protect SMUD resources. It is designed to maintain an early warning system to monitor changes in, and the emergence of, risks that affect the organization’s business objectives. Under the purview of the Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee, composed of executive members and chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, ERM conducts ongoing risk identification, assessments, monitoring, mitigation, risk-based budgeting and reporting. To ensure accountability and oversight, each identified risk is assigned to an executive-level risk owner. Risk status and mitigation efforts are reported monthly to the Board.

Competitive Challenges  
In the coming decade, utilities like SMUD may face competition from companies in other industries looking to diversify into the energy sector. Examples of developing competitive areas include retail sale of electricity, distributed electric storage resources, renewable distributed generation (mostly solar in Sacramento), customer installation of fuel cells, third-party electric vehicle charging, home or business automation that enables greater customer participation in energy markets, and third-party provision of energy management software and solutions.

SMUD has a wide range of initiatives to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions and new industry participants. Key areas of focus include:

- **Enhancing customer experience.** Recognizing the importance of meeting customer expectations, SMUD introduced the Customer Experience Strategy in 2016 to provide customers “value for what they pay” and further strengthen customer loyalty. The initiative is focused on ensuring SMUD has the people, systems, technology, programs and services to consistently meet or exceed customers’ changing expectations. The customer experience is measured via surveys with the goal of achieving 80% of customers agreeing that SMUD provides them with value for what they pay by 2030.

- **Restructuring electric rates.** In 2017, the Board approved TOD rates as the standard rate for residential customers. The residential rate transition began in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the full transition was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. All of SMUD’s business customers are also on time-based rates. In 2019, the Board approved a restructuring of commercial rates to collect a greater portion of fixed costs through fixed charges and to better align time periods and prices with energy markets. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges” and “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

- **Ongoing integrated resource planning.** SMUD monitors and updates its integrated resource planning to ensure future sources of energy balance cost, reliability and environmental requirements with the flexibility to meet challenges of changing market and regulatory conditions, customer energy resources, and emerging technologies.

Leveraging Core Competencies  
In addition to these initiatives, SMUD is leveraging core competencies to improve industry safety and help communities serve their customers’ energy needs.

![Sacramento Power Academy](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**Sacramento Power Academy.** The Sacramento Power Academy is SMUD’s operational training center providing training support for all of SMUD’s skilled trades professionals. Operating on a 10-acre training facility the academy oversees SMUD’s 14 skilled trades apprenticeships. The academy’s experienced training professionals serve as liaisons and mentors to apprentices progressing through on-the-job training, program testing, night schooling, and extensive training components. The academy also ensures SMUD’s skilled trades professionals are safe and compliant by coordinating and delivering annual regulatory and safety training. The academy is also a workforce development hub utilized by SMUD to increase awareness of and interest in skilled trades careers at SMUD, in SMUD’s community, and in the utility industry.

**Community Energy Services.** In 2002, Assembly Bill 117 was passed to establish Community Choice Aggregation in the State by authorizing Community Choice Aggregators (“CCAs”) to aggregate customer electric load and purchase electricity for customers. SMUD’s Community Energy Services department was established in 2017 to support organizations with values closely aligned with SMUD’s values, while also generating additional revenue for SMUD. CCA programs are proliferating in the State thanks to support for expanding renewable energy use and desire for local control particularly for electricity procurement. There are numerous CCAs operating in the State, and more are anticipated to launch in the future. CCAs are responsible for procuring wholesale power, setting the generation rate, and staffing a call center to handle opt-outs and questions about the power portfolio. The local investor-owned utility (“IOU”) continues to deliver electricity from the electric grid, maintain its electric infrastructure, bill customers and collect payments.

In October 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Valley Clean Energy (“VCE”) to provide technical, energy and support services, including data management and call center services, wholesale energy services, and business operations support, to VCE for a term set to end in 2023. SMUD and VCE recently executed a new contract for data management, contact center, consulting and debt collection services that expires on December 31, 2028. VCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the City of Woodland, the City of Davis and Yolo County to implement a local CCA program. The service territory expanded to include the City of Winters in 2021. The mission of VCE is to deliver cost-competitive clean electricity, product choice, price stability, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions reductions to its customers in Yolo County. VCE began electric services to its customers in the summer of 2018, giving Yolo County residents a choice between two electricity providers, VCE and PG&E.

In November 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of East Bay Community Energy (“EBCE”) to provide call center and data management services for a three-year term beginning in January 2018. SMUD signed a new contract with EBCE in January 2022 for call center and data management services for an additional three-year term. EBCE recently changed its name to Ava Community Energy (“Ava”). Ava is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Oakland, Piedmont, San Leandro and Union City in Alameda County to implement a local CCA program. Ava expanded its territory to the cities of Pleasanton, Newark, and Tracy in April 2021.

In June 2019, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Silicon Valley Clean Energy (“SVCE”) to provide program services to help local SVCE communities reduce carbon pollution while delivering engaging customer experiences. SVCE programs are focused on grid integration, as well as electrifying transportation, buildings and homes. This contract was extended through September of 2024. In June 2023, SMUD was selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s concierge service vendor for three years. In December 2023, SMUD was again selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s programs administrator for five years. SVCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Campbell, Cupertino, Gilroy, Lost Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos, Milpitas, Monte Sereno, Morgan Hill,

Mountain View, Saratoga, Sunnyvale and Unincorporated Santa Clara County to implement a local CCA program.

In July 2022, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Marin Clean Energy (“MCE”) to provide data management, billing, data analytic and system assessment services to MCE. MCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2010 and represents 37 member communities across four Bay Area counties: Contra Costa, Marin, Napa and Solano.

In September 2022, SMUD was selected through a competitive process by the governing board of Sonoma Clean Power (“SCP”) to provide market research services to SCP. In January of 2023, SMUD was selected to provide strategic consulting services, providing recommendations related to programs and marketing. SCP is a joint powers agency that serves Sonoma and Mendocino counties.

While CCAs have had success in the State, they are susceptible to business, regulatory and other risks that could lead to a financial loss and/or result in a cessation of operations for the CCA. These risks could extend to a CCA’s counterparties, including SMUD. SMUD has made an effort to identify and mitigate potential counterparty risks to the extent possible in service agreements with the CCAs described above. SMUD may pursue opportunities to provide similar services to additional CCAs in the future. SMUD management does not expect its current arrangements to have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

## FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION

### Precipitation Variability

SMUD uses a precipitation measuring station located at Fresh Pond, California to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s Upper American River Project (the “UARP”) hydropower reservoir. As of January 31, 2024, precipitation at Fresh Pond, California totaled 21 inches for the October-September hydropower water supply period. This is 75% of the 50-year rolling median of 28 inches. Total reservoir storage in the UARP hydropower reservoirs was 238 thousand acre-feet as of January 31, 2024, which was about 63% of capacity and approximately 6% above the historical average. SMUD manages its reservoirs to maximize water storage going into the summer season, which preserves generating capacity during SMUD’s high load months and ensures that SMUD meets its UARP FERC license requirements, including requirements for recreational and environmental flows.

There can be wide swings in precipitation from year to year. In years with below average rainfall, SMUD may have to generate or purchase replacement energy at additional cost. To hedge against variations in the volume of energy received from SMUD-owned UARP hydroelectric resources, SMUD uses the HRSF to help offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

SMUD is also exposed to precipitation variability through its contract with the WAPA. In an average water year this contract provides roughly 661 gigawatt hours (“GWh”) of power. WAPA’s actual deliveries are based on hydroelectric generation (minus energy used for pumping) at Central Valley Project reservoirs in Northern California, which varies based on annual precipitation patterns, water deliveries for agriculture, and flow requirements in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Unlike the UARP, SMUD does not monitor precipitation stations to approximate power deliveries under the WAPA contract, and instead relies on a forecast of power deliveries from WAPA. As of January 31, 2024, WAPA has forecasted power deliveries of 703 GWh for 2024, approximately 6% more than an average water year. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration.”

# Wildfires

## General
Wildfires in the State have become increasingly common and destructive. Frequent drought conditions and unseasonably warm temperatures have increased, and could further increase, the possibility of wildfires occurring in areas where SMUD maintains generation, transmission and distribution facilities. The number of diseased and dead trees has increased, and could further increase this possibility. As a result, SMUD faces an increased risk that it may be required to pay for wildfire related property damage or

**Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory).** In 2018, the CPUC approved a new statewide fire map that identifies areas of elevated and extreme wildfire risk from utility-associated assets located throughout the State. SMUD directly participated in the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map. In connection with the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map, a peer review and a team of independent nationwide experts led by Cal Fire affirmed that SMUD’s electric service area is properly located outside of these elevated (“Tier 2”) and extreme (“Tier 3”) high fire threat areas; however, SMUD’s UARP facilities are located within both Tier 2 and Tier 3 areas. According to the CPUC, Tier 2 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an elevated wildfire risk from utility assets and Tier 3 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an extreme risk from utility assets. As of June 8, 2021, approximately 37 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 19 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. SMUD is also a member of TANC. As of July 2022, approximately 116.3 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 4.5 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. In accordance with its FERC license, SMUD adheres to a FERC-approved Fire Prevention and Response Plan for its UARP facilities. On May 17, 2018, in accordance with State law, SMUD’s Board of Directors determined that the UARP area may have a “significant risk of catastrophic wildfire” resulting from overhead electric facilities and that SMUD’s FERC-approved UARP Fire Prevention and Response Plan meets requirements for presenting wildfire mitigation measures to the Board for its approval.

**Wildfire Mitigation.** In response to potential wildfire risk, SMUD has implemented and is continuing to implement a series of measures intended to prevent wildfires from occurring, minimize the spread of any fire that does occur and improve the resiliency of its system. These measures include an increase in the number of inspections for fuel reduction inside and adjacent to rights-of-ways, utilization of Cal Fire-approved operational material to reduce the risk of sparking; enhanced inspection and maintenance programs; increased use of ignition reduction techniques, including undergrounding of conductors; increased monitoring of identified responses to fire conditions, including operational procedures for the de-energization of lines during high fire conditions; and elimination of automatic reclosing on SMUD’s transmission lines and on SMUD’s distribution lines in certain areas during fire season.

SMUD’s proactive approach to vegetation management has been expanded to include the use of advanced technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (“LiDAR”), ortho and oblique imagery that is used to pinpoint tree health and/or condition that may not yet be visible to the naked eye. In addition, SMUD has installed additional weather stations in transmission corridors and substations for increased situational awareness and has continued coordination and collaboration with local agencies and first responders as well as vulnerable populations.

State legislation enacted in 2018 and 2019 (SB 901 and AB 1054, respectively) requires publicly owned utilities (“POUs”) to prepare and present Wildfire Mitigation Plans to their governing boards by January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter. SB 901 requires POUs, including SMUD, before January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter, to prepare a wildfire mitigation plan and present it in a public meeting to their governing board. SB 901 requires POU’s to accept comments on the wildfire mitigation plan from the public, other local and State agencies, and interested parties, and to verify that the plan complies with all applicable rules, regulations, and standards, as appropriate. The bill requires a qualified independent evaluator to review and assess the comprehensiveness of its wildfire mitigation plan and present its report to the board in a public meeting. AB 1054 created a new Wildfire Safety Division within the CPUC to prioritize wildfire safety throughout the State, and established an appointed Wildfire Safety Advisory Board (“WSAB”) to advise and make recommendations relating to wildfire safety to this new Division. For POUs, the bill requires submittal of annual wildfire mitigation plans to the WSAB for review and advisory opinions relating to the content and sufficiency of the plans.

A-18
<!-- Page 909 -->
SMUD assembled an enterprise-wide team of subject-matter experts to prepare its plan in compliance with this legislation. SMUD’s initial Wildfire Mitigation Plan (“WMP”) was adopted by the Board in the fourth quarter of 2019, after circulation for public comment and review of the comprehensiveness of the plan by a qualified independent evaluator. The WMP and evaluator’s report were submitted to the WSAB in 2020.

SMUD reviews its WMP each year, presenting the updated plan to the Board for adoption at duly noticed public meetings. The updated plans and evaluator reports are submitted to the WSAB for advisory opinion and recommendations. SMUD responds to the WSAB’s comments regarding SMUD’s WMP as part of its WMP process. SMUD will continue to annually review and update its WMP, conducting a comprehensive review at least every third year.

SMUD recently completed a comprehensive review and update of its WMP after soliciting public input and independent evaluation. The 2023-2025 WMP was adopted by the Board on June 15, 2023, and duly submitted to the WSAB.

**Wildfire Insurance.** Wildfires both in California and nationally have not only increased potential liability for utilities, but have also adversely impacted the insurance markets, leading to higher costs for coverage; coverages becoming prohibitively expensive; limited or restricted coverage to certain types of risks; or coverage at insufficient levels. SMUD most recently renewed its general and wildfire liability insurance coverage on June 15, 2023, increasing the coverage limit by $25 million to $275 million. SMUD increased the commercially insured portion of its wildfire coverage program from $176 million to $212.5 million and maintained the self-insured layers and quota share portions of the coverage at $6.5 million.

In addition, it is expected that SMUD will have a portion of the $500 million aggregate limit amount of its commercial paper and line of credit program to provide operational flexibility in the event of the occurrence of a wildfire or other operational event. However, SMUD has not covenanted to maintain the availability of the commercial paper program and line of credit program for these purposes and no assurances can be given that the commercial paper and line of credit program will be available at the time of, or during, such an event.

**August 2020 Heat Wave**

The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from August 14, 2020 through August 18, 2020. The CAISO was forced to institute rotating electricity outages in the State during this extreme heat wave. SMUD, as a member of BANC, and being outside of the CAISO did not have to implement any planned power disruptions. Additionally, SMUD was able to support the CAISO during some hours of the heat wave with both requested emergency assistance and wholesale market sales. SMUD’s peak demand between August 14, 2020 and August 18, 2020, varied between 2,874 MW and 3,057 MW, well below SMUD’s record peak of 3,299 MW.

**September 2022 Heat Wave**

The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from September 5, 2022 through September 8, 2022. On September 6, 2022, SMUD experienced its second highest peak demand of 3,263 MW. SMUD did not have to implement any planned power disruptions.

**Storm Damage**

In January 2023, SMUD experienced a series of winter storms that brought heavy rains and high winds causing damage to SMUD’s grid and widespread outages for SMUD’s customers. By the time the  
A-19

**storm response was complete, SMUD had experienced the largest mobilization of personnel and restoration crews in its history. SMUD incurred costs related to removing downed trees, restoring power from downed poles and broken lines, replenishing inventory, communicating with and providing assistance to customers, maintaining IT systems, and coordinating with local emergency agencies. SMUD is pursuing claims with Federal and State agencies to attempt to recover certain of SMUD’s costs related to the storms. The material financial impacts have been reflected in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, [which are included in APPENDIX B].**

**Cosumnes Power Plant Outage**

On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant (as defined herein) was shut down due to a ground fault in the Steam Turbine Generator (“STG”) stator. The ground fault was caused by delamination of the insulation on one of the through bolts. Damage from the ground fault resulted in a full rewind and restack of the stator core, replacement of all stator through bolts, and a full rewind of turbine rotor. The Cosumnes Power Plant repairs were completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. During the extended outage, SMUD shifted generation to the other local gas-fired plants and the Sutter Energy Center and procured additional energy and resource adequacy capacity. SMUD also requested and received approval from the California Air Quality Board and California Energy Commission to operate one or both of the gas turbines without the STG. During the September 2022 heatwave, both of the gas turbines at the Cosumnes Power Plant were operated without the STG, providing 270 MW at peak.

To mitigate the financial impact of unplanned outages from its thermal assets, SMUD carries commercial property insurance with a business interruption endorsement. At the time of the loss, the coverage provided up to $30.8 million of business interruption recovery per month at the Cosumnes Power Plant, with a sub-limit of $310 million over any 18-month period. During the period of loss, the claims were subject to a $5 million equipment damage deductible and a 60-day business interruption claims waiting period.

SMUD has settled the equipment damage portion of the loss for $18.6 million, resulting in a $13.6 million recovery. The business interruption portion of the claim remains in process, with SMUD receiving a $50 million advance in December of 2022. As of January 2024, the carriers have confirmed an additional $51 million in undisputed recovery, which is anticipated to be received in the first quarter of 2024. Thus far, SMUD has recovered $114.6 million of the loss and will continue to work toward full settlement of the disputed portion of the claim, which is approximately $68 million.

**Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic**

While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD has lessened since the height of the pandemic in 2020, SMUD is still experiencing impacts from the pandemic. However, compared to weather adjusted load levels, SMUD’s overall load is near or above pre-pandemic levels.

Part of the governmental response to the economic consequences of the pandemic required utility providers (including SMUD) to provide additional grace periods and flexible payment plans for the payment of utility bills or to refrain from pursuing collection remedies for unpaid bills for a period of time. SMUD also implemented a no-shutoff policy through January 2022 under which SMUD did not disconnect power to a customer for non-payment of their electric bill. Beginning in February 2022, SMUD resumed its normal payment, late fee, and disconnection process and began disconnections of unpaid accounts in late April 2022. As a result, SMUD has experienced an increase in delinquencies for customer electric accounts versus pre-pandemic levels. In December 2021, SMUD received $41 million from the California Arrearage Payment Program (“CAPP”) initial funding, and an additional $9.9 million in 2022. All funds were applied to delinquent balances. As of December 31, 2023, the total delinquencies for customer electric

**A-20**
<!-- Page 911 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

accounts were $38.2 million, after the CAPP credit, which is an increase from the February 2020 balance of total delinquencies for customer electric accounts of $16.9 million. The financial impacts stemming from delinquent accounts have been accounted for in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the preceding years. Any successful recovery of delinquent accounts will contribute to an increase in net income.

SMUD also paused the recertification process for existing customers in SMUD’s low-income discount program during the pandemic. The number of customers participating in the low-income assistance program increased by 16,407, or approximately 22% from February 2020 to December 2023. SMUD has resumed the recertification process for existing customers in the low-income discount program in 2023.

While the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD have lessened, if the pandemic and its consequences again become more severe or another similar event occurs, the impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations could be material.

## RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE

### Rates and Charges

SMUD’s Board of Directors has autonomous authority to establish the rates charged for all SMUD services. Unlike IOUs and some other municipal utility systems, retail rate and revenue levels are not subject to review or regulation by any other federal, State or local governmental agencies. Changes to SMUD rates only require formal action by the Board of Directors after two public workshops and a public hearing. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government. SMUD typically reviews and sets rates on a two-year cycle.

### 2019 Rate Action.

On June 24, 2019, the Board approved a 3.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2020, a 3.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2020, a 2.50% rate increase effective January 1, 2021, and a 2.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2021, for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved a restructuring of the commercial rates, including new time periods and an overall increase in the fixed bill components, such as the System Infrastructure Fixed Charge and demand charges, and a corresponding decrease in energy charges, making the restructuring revenue neutral by rate category. To minimize bill impacts, rate categories will be restructured over an eight-year period.

### 2021 Rate Action.

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved a 1.5% rate increase effective March 1, 2022 and a 2.0% rate increase effective January 1, 2023 for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved the Solar and Storage Rate, the optional residential Peak Pricing Rate, and updates to certain schedules of SMUD’s Open Access Transmission Tariff (“OATT”). The Board also approved a new timeline for the commercial rate restructure transition, and all impacted commercial customers were transitioned to the new rates by the end of the first quarter of 2022.

SMUD also implemented a solar interconnection fee based on the size of solar interconnection and supporting programs such as battery incentives, incentives to enroll in SMUD’s Peak Pricing Rate, battery incentives for Virtual Power Plants, and a program to bring the benefits of solar to under-resourced multi-family communities. These programs and fees are not subject to Board approval. 

A-21
<!-- Page 912 -->
![2023 Rate Action](https://example.com/image.png)

**2023 Rate Action**

On September 21, 2023, the Board approved a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2025, and a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2025 for all customer classes. The Board also approved establishing the Energy Assistance Program Rate (“EAPR”) Rate Stabilization Fund, which will provide an additional discount to those low-income customers with the greatest need. The discount will be funded with discretionary, non-retail rate revenue, as to not have an impact on any future required rate changes. There is currently pending litigation concerning the adoption of the 2023 rates. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”

**Rate Stabilization Funds**

The Rate Stabilization Fund (“RSF”) is maintained by SMUD to reduce the need for future rate increases when costs exceed existing rates. At the direction of the Board, amounts may be either transferred into the RSF (which reduces revenues) or transferred out of the RSF (which increases revenues). The Board authorizes RSF transfers on an event driven basis. The RSF includes funds to hedge variations in the volume of energy received from WAPA hydroelectric generation, variation in AB 32 revenue and variations in Low Carbon Fuel Credit (“LCFS”) revenue. As of December 31, 2023, the balance in the RSF was $115.8 million, which is approximately 7.2% of annual retail revenue.

Effective July 2008, SMUD implemented the HGA, which is a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from the UARP (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric”). The HGA is designed to increase the deposits to the HRSF in wet years when SMUD has more hydroelectric generation than expected. Each year SMUD determines the impact of precipitation variances on projected hydroelectric generation from the UARP. When the precipitation variance results in a deficiency of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, transfers from the HRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is zero. When the precipitation variance results in a projected surplus of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, deposits will be made into the HRSF in an amount approximating the positive impact to SMUD from the surplus hydroelectric generation (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is not sufficient to cover transfers that would otherwise be made in the event of a projected deficiency in UARP hydroelectric generation, a 12-month HGA surcharge will automatically be included on customers’ electric bills at a level that generates up to 4% of retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue on any precipitation variance calculation date and the precipitation variance results in a projected UARP hydroelectric generation surplus, the positive impact of the surplus may be used for other purposes at staff’s recommendation, with the approval of the Board, including returned to customers through an electric bill discount up to 4% of retail revenue. SMUD calculates HRSF transfers based on an April-March (water year) precipitation period at Fresh Pond, California. This precipitation station is used to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s UARP hydropower reservoirs. As of January 31, 2024, and based on the current HRSF water year precipitation forecast, SMUD anticipates transferring $20.8 million out of the HRSF in April 2024.

In September 2023, SMUD added a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from WAPA. Each year SMUD determines the WAPA Energy Delivery Variance (“EDV”) based on forecasted energy delivery minus the actual energy delivery. When the EDV variance is positive, transfers from the WRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 2% of cash).

**Low Income Discount**

As of December 2023, approximately 91,407 customers received the low-income discount offered by SMUD, which represents approximately 16% of all residential customers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, SMUD suspended recertification during the pandemic. In 2023, the total discount was approximately $32.7 million. As a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn, SMUD experienced an increase in low-income discount applicants. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

While the low-income discount has provided substantial benefits to low-income customer bills for years, multiple economic variables, such as inflation and rate increases, have had disproportionately negative impacts on low-income customers, particularly those in the 0-50% Federal Poverty Level (“FPL”). In 2023, SMUD established an EAPR Rate Stabilization Fund (“ERSF”) to provide an additional discount to the electricity usage charge up to an established maximum discount (“ERSF Additional Discount”) for customers in the 0-50% FPL. The ERSF is funded by discretionary non-retail rate revenue, reviewed on an annual basis, and the specific monthly ERSF Additional Discount is set before the year the value is in effect. SMUD expanded its programs and services starting in 2016 to help customers with energy assistance, home improvement packages and education. SMUD is creating tailored solutions to best meet the needs of low-income customers. These solutions include free solar panels and inspecting homes to identify energy saving and fuel switching opportunities. As of December 2023, SMUD has performed 30,000 energy retrofits and, in partnership with Grid Alternatives (a non-profit organization that focuses on implementing solar power and energy efficiency for low-income families), 230 customers have benefited from free solar installations. Forty-eight additional homes received solar and energy efficiency through a partnership with Habitat for Humanity of Greater Sacramento. As part of SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan and the focus on building electrification, SMUD has also been ramping up electrification investments for low-income customers. Additionally, since 2019, SMUD has assisted more than 2,600 households with electrification upgrades. Additionally, SMUD has installed nearly 450 electric vehicle chargers and more than 400 electric vehicle circuits in low-income households or areas that serve low-income customers.

# Customer Base: Largest Customers

A stabilizing influence on SMUD’s revenues is that a substantial proportion is derived from residential customers (49.2% in 2023). Historically, revenue from commercial and industrial consumption has been more sensitive to economic fluctuation. Furthermore, SMUD has no dominant customers that account for a significant percentage of annual revenues. In 2023, no single customer contributed more than 3% of revenues. The top ten customers generated approximately 9% of revenues and the top 30 generated approximately 15% of revenues. The following table presents information on SMUD’s top ten customers as of December 31, 2023.

# Power Generation Facilities

## Hydroelectric
The UARP consists of three relatively large storage reservoirs (Union Valley, Loon Lake and Ice House) with an aggregate water storage capacity of approximately 400,000 acre-feet and eight small reservoirs. Project facilities also include eight tunnels with a combined length of over 26 miles and eight powerhouses containing 11 turbines. In addition to providing clean hydroelectric power and operating flexibility for SMUD, the UARP area provides habitat for fish and wildlife and a variety of recreational opportunities, including camping, fishing, boating, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking and cross-country skiing.

The combined capacity of the UARP is approximately 685 MW at SMUD’s load center in Sacramento. Under current licensing and mean water conditions, these facilities are expected to generate approximately 1,600 GWh of electric energy annually, which represents approximately 15% of SMUD’s current average annual retail energy requirements. In 1957, the Federal Power Commission (predecessor agency to FERC) issued a license to SMUD for the UARP. This 50-year license was subsequently amended to add and upgrade facilities and now includes all segments of SMUD’s hydroelectric facilities located on the South Fork of the American River and its tributaries upstream from the Chili Bar Project (described below). On July 23, 2014, FERC issued to SMUD a new 50-year license for the UARP.

On November 9, 2016 FERC issued an Order authorizing SMUD to construct the South Fork Powerhouse downstream of the UARP’s Slab Creek Dam. Construction was substantially completed in the fall of 2020, and the new powerhouse was placed into operation on October 25, 2022, adding 1.8 MW of generation to the UARP’s overall capacity.

On June 16, 2021, pursuant to Board authorization, SMUD approved the Chili Bar Hydroelectric Project which consists of a 7 MW powerhouse, reservoir, dam and spillway, north of Placerville on the South Fork of the American River for approximately $10.4 million (the “Chili Bar Project”). The Chili Bar Project is immediately downstream from the UARP and operates as the regulating reservoir for the UARP’s largest powerhouse. Owning the UARP and the Chili Bar Project enables SMUD to operate the two projects with a holistic approach to license compliance and generation efficiency.

## Solano 2 Wind Project
SMUD owns and operates an 87 MW wind project, located in Solano County, known as Solano 2. Solano 2 consists of 29 wind turbine generators (“WTGs”) rated at 3.0 MW. Energy from the project is collected at 21 kV and transmitted over a dedicated 3-mile overhead system to the SMUD-owned Russell substation. At the Russell facility, the energy is transformed to 230 kV and interconnected to PG&E’s Birds Landing Switching Station. Energy deliveries are scheduled through the CAISO.

## Solano 3 Project
In 2011 and 2012, SMUD constructed a 128 MW wind project adjacent to Solano Phase 2, known as Solano 3. The Solano 3 project consists of 31 WTGs rated at 1.8 MW and 24 WTGs rated at 3.0 MW. The project interconnects through a 34.5 kV underground collection system to the Russell substation. Like the Solano Phase 2 project, this energy is transformed to 230 kV and delivered through the CAISO.

## Solano 4 Project
SMUD has developed the Solano 4 Wind Project on land with a wind easement owned by SMUD near the Solano 3 project, known as the Collinsville and Roberts properties, to install 10 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW, and to remove the Solano 1 turbines and replace them with 9 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW. SMUD has met all of the CAISO requirements and has executed a Large Generator Interconnection Agreement (“GLIA”) as of June 2021 that will allow for 90.8 MW of capacity at the point of interconnection. In April 2021, SMUD submitted an application for advisory review by the Solano County Airport Land Use Commission (the “Solano ALUC”) of the Solano 4 Wind Project’s consistency.

with the 2015 Travis Air Force Base Land Use Compatibility Plan (the “Travis Plan”). In May 2021, the Solano ALUC purported to resolve that the Solano 4 Wind Project was inconsistent with the Travis Plan. In August 2021, the Board approved the Project Environmental Impact Report, made findings overriding the Solano ALUC’s finding of inconsistency, made findings there was no alternative to the project, and approved the Solano 4 Wind Project. In September 2021, Solano County filed a writ petition challenging SMUD’s approval of the Solano 4 Wind Project based on procedural, environmental, zoning and land use grounds. The parties entered into a settlement agreement on December 14, 2022, and the suit was dismissed on January 10, 2023. The settlement agreement allows for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project as planned.

In addition, SMUD applied for and obtained extensions of the Federal Aviation Administration Determinations of No Hazard allowing for construction of the turbines. A contract for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project was awarded to Vestas Corporation and the Solano 4 Wind Project is currently under construction. The expected operation date for the Solano 4 Wind Project is May 2024. PG&E identified upgrades needed to interconnect the Solano 4 Wind Project that will not be complete before the expected Solano 4 commercial operation date. PG&E has an approved project and expects to complete the needed upgrades by May of 2025. Realization of the full capacity of the Solano 4 Wind Project may be delayed into the second quarter of 2025 due to the timeframe established for the PG&E required transmission upgrades. SMUD has developed a mitigation plan for the limited interconnection capacity for the first year of operation, in coordination with CAISO and PG&E, of using all of the existing SMUD Solano Russell substation interconnection capacity combined for the dispatch of all the Solano Wind Project. SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process, which combines all phases of the Solano 4 Wind Project so it may operate as one project. This was fully executed by SMUD, CAISO, and PG&E on February 27, 2023.

As of the end of 2023, all of the turbine site delivery roads and foundations for the Solano 4 Project have been completed, all of the turbine components have been delivered to the Solano 4 Project site and 10 of the Solano 4 Project turbines have been fully erected.

At the completion of the Solano 4 project, SMUD will have an installed wind capacity of 303 MW in connection with the overall Solano Wind Project, leaving 18 MW at the point of interconnection for future development.

**Distributed Solar Photovoltaic.** SMUD owns and operates approximately 2 MW of solar photovoltaic generating facilities. These facilities include installations at the Hedge Substation property, SMUD Headquarters, the East Campus Operations Center, and other smaller photovoltaic systems throughout the service area on parking lots.

**Hedge Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 4 MW, 8 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached commercial operation in January 2023.

**ESS Flow Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 0.45 MW, 3 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached test operation in September 2023, and commercial operation is planned for March 2024.

**Local Gas-Fired Plants.** SMUD constructed five local natural gas-fired plants in its service area: the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, the Campbell Soup Project, McClellan and the Cosumnes Power Plant (each defined below). These five plants are referred to collectively as the “Local Gas-Fired Plants.” These plants are a strategic component of SMUD’s resource mix. In addition to providing SMUD a total capacity of approximately 1,139 MW, the Local Gas-Fired Plants provide SMUD with needed

**A-31**

**Local Gas-Fired Plants Overview**

SMUD has entered into long-term agreements with SFA providing for the purchase by SMUD of all of the power from each of the Local Gas-Fired Plants on a take-or-pay basis. This consolidation created operational and administrative efficiencies without changing any of the functionality of the power plants. Although the Local Gas-Fired Plants are owned by SFA, SMUD has exclusive control of their dispatch and manages their operations as part of its overall power supply strategy.

Payments under the power purchase agreements are payable from the revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of the principal of or interest on SMUD’s Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the caption “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below), as are other maintenance and operation costs and energy payments. For further discussion of SMUD’s obligations to make these payments to SFA, see “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Joint Powers Authorities.”

**Description of the Five Local Gas-Fired Plants:**

1. **The Cosumnes Power Plant (the “Cosumnes Power Plant”)**  
   The Cosumnes Power Plant is a 612 MW natural gas-fired, combined cycle plant located in the southern portion of Sacramento County adjacent to SMUD’s decommissioned Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant. Commercial operation of the Cosumnes Power Plant commenced on February 24, 2006. SFA increased the net generating capacity of the facility by 81 MWs via an Advanced Gas Path (“AGP”) upgrade. The additional AGP generation was realized after hardware and software upgrades were completed. The Cosumnes Power Plant is owned by SFA, a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and MID. The existing take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA expires no earlier than when the related bonds have been paid in full (the outstanding related bonds are scheduled to mature on July 1, 2030). On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant was shut down due to a ground fault in the STG stator. The repair was completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Cosumnes Power Plant Outage”.

2. **The Carson Cogeneration Project (the “Carson Project”)**  
   The Carson Project, a 103 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project consisting of separate cycle and peaking plants, provides steam to the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) wastewater treatment plant adjacent to the site. The Carson Project was originally owned by the Central Valley Financing Authority (“CVFA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and the SRCSD. Construction of the Carson Project was completed and the plant began commercial operation on October 11, 1995. The CVFA bonds issued to finance the Carson Project were defeased in September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Carson Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

3. **The Procter & Gamble Cogeneration Project (the “Procter & Gamble Project”)**  
   The Procter & Gamble Project, a 182 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, is located in an established industrial area of Sacramento. The initial combined cycle portion of the plant began commercial operation on March 1, 1997. Construction of the peaking plant portion of the Procter & Gamble Project commenced during 2000 and the unit achieved commercial status on April 24, 2001. The Procter & Gamble Project produces steam for use in Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Company’s oleochemical manufacturing processes and electricity for sale to SMUD. The Procter & Gamble Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Cogeneration Authority (“SCA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA, a separate joint powers authority. The SCA bonds issued to finance the Procter & Gamble Project were defeased in.

September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Procter & Gamble Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Procter & Gamble Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

**The Campbell Soup Cogeneration Project (the “Campbell Soup Project”).** The Campbell Soup Project, a 170 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project, was completed and began commercial operations on December 4, 1997. Upgrades were implemented during 2000, which increased the plant’s peaking capacity to 180 MW, well above its net demonstrated capacity of 159.8 MW. The plant is located in south Sacramento adjacent to the Capital Commerce Center (formerly the Campbell Soup Company food processing facility). The Campbell Soup Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Power Authority (“SPA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA. The SPA bonds issued to finance the Campbell Soup Project were redeemed in July 2015. In late 2021, ownership of the Campbell Soup Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Campbell Soup Project (the “Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA”) covers both the Campbell Soup Project and McClellan and will be in effect until terminated by SMUD. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing the Campbell Soup Project in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

**The McClellan Gas Turbine (“McClellan”).** McClellan is a 72 MW natural gas-fired simple cycle combustion turbine generating plant at McClellan Business Park in Sacramento. This turbine is connected to SMUD’s electric system and is operated to meet SMUD’s peak-load requirements. McClellan is aligned for remote starting and operation with black start and fast start capabilities. SMUD constructed the McClellan unit in 1986 as a 50 MW emergency power source for the McClellan Air Force Base. In 2001, following the closure of the Air Force base, McClellan was repurposed for SMUD’s use. In May 2007, SMUD transferred ownership of McClellan to SPA for more efficient operation. SPA did not issue debt related to McClellan. In late 2021, ownership of McClellan was transferred to SFA. SFA pays all costs of operations and maintenance through to SMUD in accordance with the terms of the Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA. In exchange for paying all costs related to McClellan, SMUD receives all of the power generated thereby on a take-or-pay basis. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing McClellan in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

**General.** SMUD is obligated to arrange for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Management of the natural gas procurement and delivery process is a key focus of SMUD’s reliability and risk policies. Although the natural gas consumption of the power plants for SMUD’s load can vary significantly depending on the season, precipitation, and the market price of power and natural gas, the plants are forecasted to need, on average in 2024, a total of approximately 91,000 Decatherms per day (“Dth/day”) with a daily peak slightly more than 171,000 Dth/day of natural gas. SMUD has implemented a comprehensive strategy to secure a reliable and diversified fuel supply through a variety of agreements for the supply, transportation, and storage of natural gas.

**Supply.** SMUD hedges a significant portion of its expected gas needs to meet customer power requirements. This includes gas for the Local Gas-Fired Plants and for the Sutter Energy Center. See “Power Purchase Agreements – Sutter Energy Center”. This is accomplished through a combination of long-term supply arrangements and an exposure reduction program. The program consists of a primarily rolling three-year exposure reduction component, a fuel hedging component on a rolling three-year basis, as well as supplemental fixed calendar year components reaching out up to five calendar years. Long-term

arrangements may consist of a combination of physical commodity supply contracts, financial hedges, or options. Natural gas is purchased from a wide variety of producers and marketers at the northern and southern California borders, and from the San Juan and the Rocky Mountain supply basins. SMUD has a number of both fixed-price supply agreements and financial hedging contracts to fix gas costs ranging from one month to several years in duration. Including fixed price biogas contracts as of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted.

SMUD has contracted with NCGA to purchase an approximate average of 8,700 Dth/day over the remaining life of a contract expiring May 31, 2027 (the “NCGA Contract”). Under the NCGA contract, SMUD pays a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. Until November 1, 2023 the delivery point for the NCGA Contract was the AECO hub in Alberta. Starting November 1, 2023, to increase delivery efficiencies, SMUD has exchanged the gas delivered at the AECO hub under the NCGA Contract with gas delivered at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border. From there SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants.

SMUD has also contracted with NCEA to purchase an approximately 22,000 Dth/day on average, or to be converted to the appropriate cash flow value in Megawatt-hours (“MWh”) of electricity over the remaining life of a contract expiring on May 31, 2049. The gas will be delivered to the SMUD system via the Malin receipt point on the PG&E backbone system. SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants. SMUD will pay a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. In connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement), SMUD expects to amend and restate the contract with NCEA in connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement.)

**Renewable Natural Gas Supply.** As a component of meeting SMUD’s RPS goals, SMUD procures renewable natural gas and digesters gas as fuels to generate renewable electricity from the Cosumnes Power Plant. Descriptions of the renewable natural gas supply agreements are provided below.

In March 2009, SMUD entered into a 15-year contract (that qualifies as renewable energy) with Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. (“Shell Energy”) to purchase up to 6,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from a landfill project in Texas. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in April 2009. In March 2012, SMUD amended the contract with Shell Energy to increase the maximum volumes to 7,300 Dth/day and extended the term by 10 years to March 31, 2034. Currently, the delivery point is PG&E Topock and SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In 2016, SMUD entered into a 3-year contract with Shell Energy to sell back the entire volume of renewable natural gas purchased, less 500 Dth/day, to be sold into the vehicle transportation markets. Upon expiration of the initial 3-year contract for the sale of biogas to Shell Energy, SMUD extended the sell back of the entire volume of biogas twice for an additional three years with Element Markets (now RNG, LLC), starting in 2020 and 2023. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

SMUD contracted with Heartland Renewable Energy, LLC (“HRE”) in December 2009 for a 20-year supply of up to 7,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas from a digester facility in Colorado. Deliveries began in March of 2014. Currently, the delivery point is Opal, Wyoming and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. HRE has not delivered volumes from the project to SMUD since December 2016 due to litigation with Weld County, Colorado regarding odor and
<!-- Page 924 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

permit issues. EDF Renewables, the majority owner of HRE, notified SMUD in August of 2017 that it is in discussions with a short list of bidders to sell its interests in the facility. In June of 2020, the project was purchased and SMUD’s contract was assigned to the new owner, Platte River Biogas, LLC (“PRB”). SMUD and PRB reached a settlement in the third quarter of 2021 that could lead to terminating the contract.

In September 2011, SMUD and CVFA entered into a “Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement” through which the Carson Project cleans nearly all of the digester gas received from Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) and sells it to SMUD for delivery to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In return, SMUD pays all of the Carson Project’s costs in acquiring, cleaning and making the gas available to SMUD. The Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement, along with the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The Carson Project is currently receiving, processing and selling up to 1,500 Dth/day with provisions for volume increases over time to 2,500 Dth/day. Digester gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations.

In December 2011, SMUD entered into a 20-year agreement with EIF KC Landfill Gas LLC (“EIF”) to purchase up to 7,050 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from multiple landfill projects. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in January 2014. Currently the delivery point is Kern River – Opal and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. Renewable natural gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations. In April 2022, SMUD entered into a transaction to sell the renewable natural gas purchased into the renewable natural gas markets. The transaction expires in March 2025. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

AB 2196 is a law that defines the criteria by which existing and future renewable natural gas contracts will qualify for the State RPS program. The CEC adopted a RPS Eligibility Guidebook on April 30, 2013, which includes detailed rules for implementation of AB 2196. SMUD received an updated certificate of eligibility from the CEC in July 2014 for the Cosumnes Power Plant that included the quantities of renewable natural gas from all contracts. The CEC adopted a revised RPS Eligibility Guidebook (Ninth Edition) on April 27, 2017. This latest guidebook did not change the RPS eligibility of any of the above SMUD renewable natural gas and digester gas contracts, but did simplify reporting requirements for these contracts.

Gas Transmission

SMUD has satisfied its obligation to deliver natural gas to its power plants by constructing a natural gas pipeline, purchasing an equity interest in two PG&E backbone gas transmission lines, and contracting for capacity on a number of existing interstate natural gas transmission lines.

The Local Pipeline. SMUD constructed and owns a 20-inch, 50-mile natural gas pipeline in the greater Sacramento area (the “Local Pipeline”) that transports gas to all of the Local Gas-Fired Plants except McClellan. The Local Pipeline is interconnected with PG&E’s major State gas transmission lines 300 and 401. Additionally, it may be interconnected with one or more private gas gathering pipelines located in the area, a gas storage project and/or other FERC approved pipelines that may be built in the local area. In conjunction with the construction of the Cosumnes Power Plant, SMUD extended the Local Pipeline to the plant site. The 26-mile extension was completed in 2004. The extension is 24 inches in diameter and was designed to serve both the Cosumnes Power Plant and an additional second phase, if constructed.

![PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401](https://example.com/image.png)

**PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401.** In 1996, SMUD purchased an equity interest in PG&E’s backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 (referred to as the PG&E backbone). The total capacity acquired at that time was approximately 85,000 Dth/day and consisted of approximately 43,600 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, Oregon and 44,700 Dth/day from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California. SMUD was also entitled to a share of non-firm capacity, which was approximately 4,360 Dth/day; making the total capacity potentially available to SMUD almost 90,000 Dth/day. This purchase made SMUD a co-owner of the PG&E backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 and obligated SMUD to pay PG&E to operate the pipelines on its behalf subject to the terms of the purchase agreement and operating protocols. PG&E reduced operating pressures on Line 300 after PG&E suffered a natural gas explosion in San Bruno, CA in September of 2010. Operating pressures and capacity may also fluctuate due to regulatory and other changes. As of December 1, 2021, SMUD holds a total capacity of approximately 87,000 Dth/day, consisting of approximately 47,572 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, and 39,193 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California.

**Kern River Gas Transmission Company Long Term Agreement.** SMUD has an agreement with Kern River Gas Transmission Company for 200,000 Dth/day of firm capacity through April 30, 2028. This capacity gives SMUD access to the Rocky Mountain supply basin at Opal, Wyoming, and connects to PG&E Line 300 (owned in part by SMUD) at Daggett, California.

SMUD’s diversified portfolio of gas transmission arrangements allows for the purchase of gas from a variety of suppliers and locations, and the opportunity to capitalize on regional price differentials where possible. In addition, it ensures diversity in the SMUD/PG&E backbone and enhances the reliability of SMUD’s gas supply.

**Gas Storage**

SMUD also employs gas storage as part of its overall fuel supply strategy. Gas storage is useful in helping to balance gas supply, mitigate market price volatility, and provide a reliable supply to meet peak day delivery requirements.

SMUD has a contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2023 and expires in March 2026, for capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity.

SMUD also has a second contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2022 and expires in March 2024, for additional capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity. SMUD does not plan to renew this contract upon expiration.

SMUD has a contract with Wild Goose Storage LLC, that will begin in April 2024 (but which allows for early injection (December 2023 – March 2024)) for capacity in the Wild Goose Storage project located near Gridley in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 0.2 million Dth of storage inventory, ratcheted (12,500-14,000 Dth/day) volumes of injection rights and ratcheted (10,000 – 24,000 Dth/day) volumes of withdrawal capacity.

# Power Purchase Agreements

SMUD has a number of power purchase agreements to help meet its power requirements. Some of these agreements are described below.

## Western Area Power Administration
Effective January 1, 2005, SMUD entered into a 20-year contract with WAPA. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement extending the term by 30 years for the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2054. Power sold under this contract is generated by the Central Valley Project (“CVP”), a series of federal hydroelectric facilities in northern California operated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. The contract provides WAPA’s CVP Base Resource customers (including SMUD) delivery of a percentage share of project generation in return for reimbursement of an equivalent share of project costs. SMUD’s CVP Base Resource share is roughly 25% of project generation and costs. This is expected to be approximately 318 MW of capacity and 661 GWh of energy in an average water year but will vary depending on precipitation. Energy available under the contract is determined by water releases required for water supply and flood control and is then shaped into higher value periods within other CVP operating constraints. More capacity and energy are typically available in spring and summer months and less in fall and winter.

SMUD also has a contract with WAPA expiring December 31, 2024, by which WAPA delivers an additional 200-300 MW per hour from projects located in the Pacific Northwest based on certain contractual parameters. In 2022, SMUD received 1,913 GWh of energy under this contract. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement for the period January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2030.

## Avangrid (formerly Iberdrola Renewables (“Iberdrola”))
SMUD has a contract with Iberdrola for 126 GWh of wind power generated in Solano County, California. The SMUD Board approved an extension of the wind contract through June 30, 2025.

## Patua Project LLC
In April 2010, SMUD entered into a power purchase agreement with Patua Project LLC (“Patua”), a subsidiary of Gradient Resources, for the delivery of up to 132 MW (expected to be 120 MW nominal power output) of renewable energy from geothermal generation being developed in north central Nevada, from a Gradient Resources project known as the Patua Project. The Patua Project was to have been developed in three phases. Since 2010, the agreed upon capacity has been reduced several times. In December 2013, Phase 1 of the project, which had been reduced to 30 MW, finally achieved commercial operation. In 2014, the parties concluded negotiations on the fourth amendment to the power purchase agreement with Patua, which reduced the total capacity down to 40 MW, extended the commercial operation date of Phase 2 to January 1, 2016, and allowed Patua to add up to 13 MW of solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production. In addition, this amendment shifted responsibility to Patua for a portion of the long-term transmission service agreements that have been underutilized due to the project not meeting its targets. In November 2015, the Patua Project was acquired by TL Power, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cyrq Energy, Inc. (“Cyrq”). In December 2015, Cyrq terminated Phase 2. Upon termination of Phase 2, the contractual right for Cyrq to add solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production was reduced to 10 MW. As a result of poor performance during the first year of operation, SMUD reduced its obligation to take power from 30 MW to 25 MW. Performance continued to lag in 2015 and 2016 and SMUD further reduced its obligation to take power from 25 MW to 19 MW.

## Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff
In September 2009, SMUD’s Board authorized a feed-in tariff program for the purchase of renewable energy from local renewable energy projects connected to SMUD’s distribution system. SMUD’s Board authorized connection of up to 100 MW under the feed-in tariff which included standard payment rates and standard purchase terms for power. The feed-in tariff program became effective on January 1, 2010. Under the feed-in tariff, SMUD has executed 20-year term power purchase

A-36

agreements for solar projects totaling 98.5 MW. Construction and start-up were completed on all projects between 2010 and 2012.

**CalEnergy LLC.** In August 2014, SMUD entered into a 22-year power purchase agreement with CalEnergy LLC for the purchase of 30 MW per year of renewable energy from its Salton Sea geothermal facilities. As of July 1, 2017, SMUD began receiving up to 10 MW from the CalEnergy portfolio, which escalated to the full 30 MWs on May 1, 2020.

**Rancho Seco Solar.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Rancho Seco Solar LLC for the purchase of energy from a 10.88 MW solar PV project sited on SMUD’s property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station. Commercial operation was achieved in August of 2016. Rancho Seco Solar LLC leased the property from SMUD under a land lease agreement. The output of this project directly serves two large commercial customers that executed agreements with SMUD for retail supply of solar power.

In May 2019, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement for an additional 160 MW solar PV project with Rancho Seco Solar II, LLC. The project is located on SMUD-owned property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station, adjacent to the existing 10.88 MW solar PV project. Construction began in 2019, and the project became commercially operable in February 2021.

**Grady Wind Energy.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Grady Wind Energy LLC (“Grady”) for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW wind project located in New Mexico (the “Grady Project”). The Grady Project began commercial operations on August 5, 2019. Energy from the Grady Project is delivered to CAISO. SMUD purchases 100% of the Grady Project output, which includes energy, renewable energy credits, and capacity attributes.

**Great Valley Solar 2, LLC.** In January 2017, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Great Valley Solar 2, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 60 MW solar PV project located in Fresno County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was December 28, 2017.

**ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC.** On September 14, 2016, Senate Bill 859 (“SB 859”) was signed into law. Under SB 859, a POUs must procure its proportionate share of 125 MW of renewable energy from biomass plants burning high hazard forest fuels, subject to terms of at least five years. Seven POUs (SMUD, MID, Turlock Irrigation District (“TID”), Anaheim Public Utilities, Imperial Irrigation District, Los Angeles Department of Water & Power and Riverside Public Utilities, collectively described herein as the “ARP-Loyalton POUs”) jointly solicited proposals for up to 29 MW of contract capacity for renewable energy to meet the requirements of SB 859. In January 2018, SMUD entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC to fulfill 18 MW of the required 29 MW with SMUD’s share being just over 23 percent (the “ARP-Loyalton PPA”). See “—Roseburg Forest Products Co.” below for a discussion of the remaining SB 859 capacity. The contract became effective on April 1, 2018. On February 18, 2020, ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and stopped producing and selling energy from the biomass plant. On May 7, 2022, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the Loyalton facility to Sierra Valley Enterprises, LLC (“SVE”). SVE initially expressed interest in bringing the facility back into service; however, the bankruptcy trustee requested requested extension of the deadline for SVE to accept or reject the ARP-Loyalton PPA. The latest deadline was April 19, 2023, the date of expiration of the ARP-Loyalton PPA terms. SVE did not resume operations before the end of the ARP-Loyalton PPA term, the ARP-Loyalton POUs have negotiated a settlement agreement with the bankruptcy trustee (the “ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement”). The ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement, which SMUD executed and is filed with the court, defines funds from the performance security that the ARP-Loyalton POUs will keep to cover legal and administrative fees, along with a contingency amount to cover potential risk of future damages. Since the ARP-Loyalton POUs entered into a five-year agreement to

A-37
<!-- Page 928 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

procure compliant biomass and provided SVE the opportunity to accept the ARP-Loyalton PPA and restart operations, the ARP-Loyalton POUs consider their statutory obligations to have been fulfilled.

**Roseburg Forest Products Co.** For the remaining SB 859 biomass obligation of 11 MW, SMUD and the other ARP-Loyalton POUs have entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with Roseburg Forest Products Co. SMUD’s share of the contract capacity is 2.5795 MW, and the plant began operating under the contract on February 26, 2021.

**Sutter Energy Center.** SMUD entered into an initial two-year contract (with a third-year exercisable option) with Calpine Energy Services, L.P. (“Calpine”) for the ability to schedule up to 258 MW of energy from Sutter Energy Center. The Sutter Energy Center is a natural gas-fired, combined-cycle facility located in Yuba City, California. The initial contract became effective on April 1, 2018. SMUD exercised its option to extend the contract, which expired November 1, 2020. SMUD entered into a new contract with Calpine for the same 258 MW of energy that became effective January 1, 2021, and had an original expiration date of January 1, 2024. In December 2021, SMUD extended this contract through December 31, 2026.

**Drew Solar, LLC.** In June 2018, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Drew Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 100 MW solar PV project located in Imperial County, California. The project’s scheduled commercial operation date was set to be December 31, 2021. The commercial operation date was delayed due to Force Majeure claims surrounding the COVID pandemic and supply chain constraints caused by changes in Federal regulatory requirements. The project began commercially operating on November 3, 2022.

**Wildflower Solar, LLC.** In October 2018, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Wildflower Solar I, LLC, for the purchase of energy, capacity, and RECs from a 13 MW solar PV project located in Rio Linda, California. The project began commercially operating on December 18, 2020.

**Coyote Creek (Formerly Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC.)** In August 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW solar PV and 100 MW four-hour Battery Energy Storage System (“BESS”) capacity project located in Sacramento County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was originally expected to be December 31, 2023, but has been delayed to 2026 due to ongoing development and permitting delays.

**SloughHouse Solar, LLC.** In September 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with SloughHouse Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 50 MW solar PV project located in Sacramento County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was originally expected to be December 31, 2023, but the commercial operation date has been delayed to March 31, 2025 due to ongoing development and permitting delays.

**Country Acres Solar.** In November 2023, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Country Acres Clean Power LLC for the purchase of energy from a 344 MW solar PV project, with a 20-year term for 172 MW four-hour BESS capacity, located in Placer County, California. The project’s commercial operation is expected to be December 15, 2026.

**Geysers Power Company, LLC.** In March 2021, SMUD executed a 10-year power purchase agreement with Geysers Power Company, LLC for 100 MW of energy and capacity from the Geysers geothermal energy plant located in Lake and Sonoma Counties, California. SMUD started to receive deliveries on January 1, 2023.

# Transmission Service Agreements

## TANC California-Oregon Transmission Project
The 340-mile COTP is one part of a three 500-kV line coordinated system known as the California-Oregon Intertie (“COI”). The COTP is allocated one-third of the 4,800 MW capability of the COI system (see related agreements below). TANC is entitled to 1,390 MW and is obligated to pay approximately 80% of the operating costs of the COTP. SMUD is a member of TANC and a party to Project Agreement No. 3 (“PA3”), under which it is entitled to 378 MW and obligated to pay on an unconditional take-or-pay basis about 27.5% of TANC’s COTP debt service and operations costs, subject to a “step-up” obligation of up to 25% of its entitlement share upon the unremedied default of another TANC member-participant. In 2009, SMUD entered into a long-term layoff agreement with certain members that increased SMUD’s entitlement by 35 MW. In 2014, SMUD entered into another long-term layoff agreement with certain other members that increased SMUD’s COTP entitlements by 128 MW and amended the 2009 layoff agreement that returned 13 MW to a member. In January 2024, SMUD entered into an agreement to extend the 2009 long-term layoff agreement with certain members to January 31, 2034. As of January 31, 2024, SMUD was entitled to approximately 528 MW of TANC’s transfer capability for imports and 405 MW for exports, and is obligated to pay approximately 38.6% of COTP debt service and operations costs. SMUD’s payments under this contract, like SMUD’s payments under its other power purchase and transmission service agreements, are treated as “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the resolution securing the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the caption “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below). SMUD relies on its COTP rights to purchase power, access contingency reserves through the Western Power Pool, and obtain renewable resources to supplement its own resources to serve its load. TANC maintains a contingency reserve budget for COTP costs, support services and advocacy expenses about $45.4 million for 2023. SMUD’s obligation on the TANC budget is about $7 million for 2023.

## TANC Tesla-Midway Transmission Service
TANC has a long-term contract with PG&E to provide TANC with 300 MW of transmission service between PG&E’s Midway Substation and the electric systems of the TANC Members (the “Tesla-Midway Service”). SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service had been 46 MW. As part of the 2009 long-term layoff agreement, SMUD acquired an additional 2 MW of South-of-Tesla Principles (“SOTP”) transmission rights for 15 years starting February, 2009 from another TANC member, bringing SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service to 48 MW.

## Bonneville Power Administration
In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with the Bonneville Power Administration (“BPA”) for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service from BPA’s Hilltop substation in northeastern California to the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua geothermal project over BPA’s 230kV transmission lines. In early 2013, in accordance with BPA’s transmission tariff, the transmission service was split into two 30 MW services and deferred as appropriate to better fit the timing of expected commercial operation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Patua Project LLC.” SMUD submitted another request for the 30 MW of transmission procured for Phase 2 of the Patua Project to split the service into a 10 MW and a 20 MW service, with the 10 MW service deferred and timed with the originally expected commercial operation date of Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 1 of the Patua Project and SMUD’s reduced obligation due to the poor performance of Phase 1 of the Patua Project, much of the transmission reserved for it will no longer be needed. BPA does not have a provision in its transmission tariff for early termination of transmission service. However, the power purchase agreement with Patua requires Patua to cover unused transmission that SMUD has procured for the Patua purchases. On January 1, 2020, SMUD’s transmission rights with BPA were reduced to 19 MW. This now aligns with SMUD’s PacifiCorp transmission rights of 19 MW described in the immediately following paragraph.

A-39

**PacifiCorp.** In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with PacifiCorp for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service across PacifiCorp’s high voltage step-up transformer at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In early 2013, in accordance with PacifiCorp’s transmission tariff, the commencement of the 60 MW of transmission service was deferred to fit the timing of first deliveries expected from the 30 MW of Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In 2013, SMUD terminated the 60 MW of transmission service and requested two new transmission services of 30 MW each, with service start dates timed to better fit with the expected start dates of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the reduction in expected output of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the second 30 MW transmission agreement, and replaced it with a 10 MW transmission service agreement for Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 2 of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the 10 MW PacifiCorp transmission service agreement and as a result of the reduced obligation to take power from the Patua Project, SMUD has reduced its remaining PacifiCorp transmission service from 30 MW to 19 MW.

**Western Area Power Administration.** SMUD does not have a direct interconnection of its power system to the COTP. To receive power deliveries that use its COTP rights, SMUD has a long-term transmission service agreement with WAPA for transmission of 342 MW of power from the COTP line (received at WAPA’s Tracy or Olinda substations) to SMUD’s system. In May of 2011, WAPA completed the Sacramento Voltage Support Transmission Project. Completion of this project has given SMUD an additional 165 MW of transmission service rights on WAPA’s system from the COTP at the Olinda Substation to SMUD’s system at the Elverta Substation.

**Projected Resources**

The following tables titled “Projected Requirements and Resources to Meet Load Requirements Energy Requirements and Resources” (the “Energy Table”) and “Capacity Requirements and Resources Net Capacity – Megawatts” (the “Capacity Table”) describe SMUD’s contracted commitments and owned resources available to meet its forecasted load requirements through the year 2033. Resources are shown on an annualized basis with market purchases netted against surpluses to arrive at a single net position for each year. Because SMUD’s available resources do not exactly match its actual load requirements on an hourly basis, there are times during a year when resources available will either exceed or be insufficient to meet SMUD’s needs. Expected actual capacity values are included in the tables. These values may differ from measured net demonstrated capacity values of the Local Area Gas-Fired Plants. The table below also includes the impact energy efficiency has on resource requirements as discussed below under “Demand Side Management Programs.” See “BUSINESS STRATEGY” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.”

Resources listed in both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table are listed as either renewable or non-renewable. Generally, SMUD follows the CEC guidelines for eligibility requirements. Some of SMUD’s renewable resources listed include solar, wind, geothermal, small hydroelectric facilities with a capacity of 30 MW or less, and biomass (representing generation from a fuel comprised of agricultural wastes and residues, landscape and tree trimmings, wood and wood waste).

As in any forecast, assumptions are made. In both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table the WAPA and UARP forecasts assume average water conditions throughout the period. On the capacity table, WAPA and Cosumnes Power Plant renewable capacity is estimated based on the ratio of renewable energy to total WAPA or Cosumnes Power Plant energy. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric.”

<!-- Page 931 -->
The Uncommitted Purchases (Sales) on the tables represent either anticipated future needs or surpluses. Future needs are met well in advance of delivery. They also include both renewable and non-renewable resources.

The Transmission Losses represent reductions in the amount of energy or capacity from the location it was purchased to the point of entering SMUD’s electrical system. This amount reduces the Total Resources available to meet the Total Projected Energy Requirements of the electrical system.

## Demand Side Management Programs

SMUD’s demand-side management initiatives represent an integral element of its total resource portfolio, and are organized into two major components: energy efficiency and load management programs. Energy efficiency offerings include a wide variety of programs and services to customers to retrofit or upgrade existing equipment and fixtures and to install new energy efficiency measures in existing and new construction facilities. Load management allows SMUD to reduce the load on the electric system by cycling residential air conditioning, and calling upon commercial/industrial customers to curtail energy usage when energy is constrained during the summer or system emergencies. Load management programs are projected to allow SMUD to shed approximately 60 MW of peak load in an emergency on a hot day, representing about 2% of SMUD’s maximum system peak demand.

The customer “smart meter” system with 2-way communication capability provides information regarding customer usage patterns, which is expected to help SMUD tailor rate designs that provide customers with both the information and ability to manage their energy usage around high energy cost periods.

# Balancing Authority Area Agreements

## Background
SMUD began operating as an independent control area, later termed a Balancing Authority, on June 18, 2002 within the WECC reliability organization’s region. This reduced SMUD’s exposure to the costs and reliability risks of the CAISO’s markets. SMUD expanded its operational footprint beyond SMUD’s service territory to include WAPA’s electric system, including the MID, Roseville, and Redding service areas (on January 1, 2005) and the COTP (on December 1, 2005). As described further below, SMUD ceased to be the Balancing Authority on April 30, 2011, as BANC took SMUD’s place as the Balancing Authority. SMUD remains the operator of the Balancing Authority through a contract with BANC. SMUD administers the contracts with WAPA and TANC to provide specified Balancing Authority-related and other services, and is compensated by WAPA and TANC. TANC recovers such Balancing Authority services costs as a part of its annual operating budget from the COTP Participants and WAPA recovers its Balancing Authority services costs through its rates for power and transmission service. The agreement with WAPA, among other terms, establishes operating procedures and reserve obligations between the parties and terminates on December 31, 2024. BANC, SMUD and WAPA will develop successor agreements in 2024 to take effect upon expiration of the existing contract. WAPA in turn has agreements with electric systems connected to it to assure that such systems also operate reliably (i.e., MID, Roseville and Redding). As a result of the transition to BANC as the Balancing Authority, SMUD assigned or terminated its interconnection and operations agreements with other connecting Balancing Authority areas (i.e., CAISO, BPA and TID). BANC is now the party to these agreements as they primarily address only Balancing Authority matters required for compliance with the reliability standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”), such as emergency assistance arrangements. See also “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY” – Western Energy Imbalance Market.”

## Reliability Standards
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave FERC authority to enforce reliability standards for the bulk electric system. In June 2007, these standards became mandatory for SMUD and BANC.

In 2022, SMUD and BANC underwent a combined NERC/WECC audit to evaluate compliance with applicable reliability standards. These audits occur every three years. At the conclusion of the audit, regulators determined that neither entity had any compliance violations related to the Operations and Planning or Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards. SMUD and BANC will undergo another NERC/WECC audit sometime in 2025.

## Balancing Authority of Northern California
SMUD, MID, Redding and Roseville executed a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement (the “BANC JPA Agreement”) creating BANC on May 8, 2009. BANC became operational on May 1, 2011 as a Balancing Authority and replaced SMUD as the entity responsible for Balancing Authority-related reliability standards. Since that time, the Trinity Public Utilities District and the City of Shasta Lake have also become members of BANC. As provided in the BANC member agreement, liability for penalties associated with such Balancing Authority-related reliability standards are shared on a pro rata basis among the members of BANC. SMUD is the Balancing Authority operator under contract and performs Balancing Authority operational functions on behalf of BANC, much as it did when it was the Balancing Authority. The BANC JPA Agreement assigns cost responsibility based on member load within the BANC Balancing Authority, with SMUD representing approximately 70% of the total load.

## Power Pool and Other Agreements

### Western Power Pool Agreement
The Western Power Pool (“WPP”) is an agreement among over 30 utilities and public agencies in the western United States to coordinate contingency reserve sharing.

**TANC-SMUD OASIS Administration Agreement.** SMUD entered into an agreement with TANC to provide OASIS services (transmission sales and scheduling related services in the BANC BA of TANC members’ COTP rights) on September 29, 2005. SMUD is compensated for performing these services. TANC and SMUD entered into a letter agreement dated October 25, 2010 to clarify each party’s role for regulatory reliability standards compliance responsibilities and take into account SMUD’s increased efforts related to supporting TANC’s compliance requirements. SMUD and TANC entered into an agreement to transition this service to the Western Area Power Administration, effective on May 1, 2023. Going forward, SMUD will only have a minor role in receiving payments and distributing revenues to the TANC members.

**Other Interconnection Agreements**

**Background.** SMUD’s electric system was originally purchased from PG&E in 1947. SMUD’s service area is mostly surrounded by PG&E’s and WAPA’s service areas. The SMUD and PG&E electric systems are interconnected at SMUD’s Rancho Seco and Lake 230-kV substations. SMUD and WAPA are interconnected at SMUD’s Hurley, Elverta, Natomas and Folsom 230-kV substations.

**PG&E Interconnection Agreement.** PG&E and SMUD executed a Replacement Interconnection Agreement (“RIA”) which became effective on January 1, 2010. The RIA provides that SMUD and PG&E operate their interconnections reliably, plan their electric systems to meet their load requirements, and avoid or mitigate impacts they cause by certain electric system modifications. The agreement has a termination date of December 31, 2024, subject to FERC approval. SMUD and other Northern California utilities have similar interconnection agreements with PG&E, albeit with different expiration dates. PG&E filed a successor interconnection agreement with one of these utilities, TID, on November 1, 2023, to become effective on January 1, 2024. Many interconnection customers, including SMUD, intervened and submitted comments or protests in the FERC docket. FERC accepted the filing and TID and PG&E are now in a settlement process, pending litigation of the parties and resolve the disputed items. SMUD anticipates that PG&E will seek to negotiate a successor interconnection agreement with SMUD which will be informed by the TID settlement or litigation process. While some functional mechanisms in the interconnection agreement may change, SMUD expects that its successor interconnection agreement will substantially preserve the balance of burdens and benefits consistent with FERC’s standard of requiring rates and terms of service that are just and reasonable. SMUD expects this process to be completed by the current expiration date of the RIA.

**PG&E Generator Interconnection Agreements.** SMUD signed a LGIA with CAISO and PG&E for the Solano 3 Wind Project, effective December 16, 2008, with a 50-year term. The Solano 2 Wind Project has interconnection rights granted through a LGIA, also with CAISO and PG&E. The agreement became effective in January 2010 and has a term of 20 years. On June 3, 2021, SMUD entered into a LGIA with the CAISO and PG&E, for the planned 90.8 MW Solano 4 Wind project with a 10-year term and automatic renewal for successive one-year terms thereafter. On February 27, 2023, SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process which combines the Solano 2, 3 & 4 projects into one Solano Wind Project. The original agreement conditions for the individual projects are carried forward with
<!-- Page 936 -->
a new combined project maximum production limit of 320.8 MW at the point of interconnection at the Russell Substation.

Other PG&E generator interconnection agreements include a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for Slab Creek with a 22-year term which became effective on January 14, 2010, and a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for the Chili Bar Project with a 10-year term which became effective on June 2, 2021.

WAPA Interconnection Agreement and other WAPA Agreements. SMUD and WAPA executed an interconnection agreement on May 8, 2008 for a term of 40 years which establishes the terms and conditions under which the SMUD and WAPA transmission systems are interconnected and memorializes related understandings. SMUD is working with WAPA on a reconfiguration at the shared Elverta interconnection to increase reliability and accommodate new generation interconnection in the area. SMUD has other agreements with WAPA including for operation of the Sutter Energy Center generating facility, communication systems terms and fiber optic access, training and for use of WAPA labor and heavy equipment to assist SMUD’s maintenance activities on an as-available basis.

![Management's Discussion of SMUD's Operating Results](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Management's+Discussion+of+SMUD's+Operating+Results)

**Management’s Discussion of SMUD’s Operating Results**

**Year Ended December 31, 2023.** For the year ended December 31, 2023, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $218.1 million as compared to an increase of $70.7 million for 2022.

Operating revenues were $228.5 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower sales of surplus gas ($118.3 million), transfers to the RSF ($67.2 million), sales to customers ($28.3 million), transfers from the RSF ($21.9 million), and LCFS revenue ($3.9 million), partially offset by higher sales of surplus power ($136.6 million), AB 32 revenue ($3.7 million), customer fees ($1.1 million), and lower transmission revenue ($2.3 million).

Operating expenses were $292.8 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower purchased power expenses ($175.5 million), production operating expenses ($146.4 million), depreciation expenses ($22.7 million), production maintenance expenses ($12.3 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($7.2 million), partially offset by higher administrative and general expenses ($33.4 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($15.8 million), public good expenses ($8.8 million), and customer service and information expenses ($6.6 million).

Non-Operating income increased by $55.2 million primarily due to fair market value assessment and gain on sale of land ($33.3 million), higher interest income ($21.7 million), higher unrealized holding gains ($11.4 million), higher CCA revenue ($5.7 million), partially offset by lower investment income ($39.1 million).

Interest expense decreased $27.9 million from 2022.

**Year Ended December 31, 2022.** For the year ended December 31, 2022, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $70.7 million as compared to an increase of $347.3 million for 2021.

Operating revenues were $363.0 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher sales to customers ($130.7 million), sales of surplus gas ($96.0 million), sales of surplus power ($62.2 million), transfers to the RSF ($28.9 million), transfers from the RSF ($24.3 million), customer fees ($9.5 million), AB 32 revenue ($4.9 million) and LCFS revenue ($2.2 million), partially offset by lower gain on sale of carbon allowance futures ($3.7 million).

Operating expenses were $601.2 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher purchased power expenses ($263.6 million), amortization of pension and OPEB ($126.9 million), production operating expenses ($125.1 million), depreciation expenses ($49.5 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($22.1 million), production maintenance expenses ($18.4 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($8.1 million), public good expenses ($7.4 million), and customer service and information expenses ($4.5 million), partially offset by lower administrative and general expenses ($27.4 million).

Non-Operating income decreased by $19.0 million primarily due to lower grant revenue ($39.6 million), unrealized holding losses ($3.7 million), partially offset by higher investment income ($19.7 million), closeout of escrow account ($2.8 million), and loss on asset retirements ($1.9 million).

Interest expense increased $19.5 million from 2021.

**Regulatory Assets.** In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” SMUD defers, as regulatory assets, certain types of expenditures. These assets are amortized and collected through future rates.

As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had a total of $916.1 million recorded for regulatory assets. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 68 which requires SMUD to record a net pension liability was $323.5 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 68 was $174.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 75 which requires SMUD to record a net Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) liability was $268.2 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 75 was $39.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with Rancho Seco decommissioning costs totaled $108.0 million at December 31, 2023. Nuclear fuel storage costs and non-radiological decommissioning costs have been collected in rates since 2009. For a complete description of these regulatory assets, see Note 8 (Regulatory Deferrals) to SMUD’s financial statements.

The Board has authorized the deferral of any charges or credits that result from the change in valuation of ineffective hedges that should be reported as Investment Revenue/Expense on the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and changes in net position. The Board’s resolution establishes that such charges or credits are not included in rates based on market value changes but are included in rates when the underlying transactions occur. Therefore, under GASB No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” any such changes are included in the Statement of Net Position as regulatory assets or liabilities. For a complete description of these derivative financial instruments, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s financial statements.

RANCHO SECO DECOMMISSIONING

Overview. The 913 MW Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant (“Rancho Seco”) began operation in 1970 and was licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) in 1980. In June 1989, the Board voted against allowing SMUD to continue to operate Rancho Seco as a nuclear generating facility, and the plant was shut down. In 1991, SMUD submitted a report (the “Financial Assurance Plan”) providing financial assurance to the NRC that SMUD will have sufficient funds available to pay for the cost of decommissioning. On March 17, 1992, the NRC granted SMUD a change from operating to a possession-only license for Rancho Seco that relieved SMUD from compliance with a number of NRC regulations applicable to operating nuclear power plants. SMUD also filed a proposed decommissioning plan with the NRC (the “Decommissioning Plan”), which was approved in March 1995.

After the decommissioning efforts began, no suitable disposal option was available to SMUD for the Class B and Class C low level radioactive waste generated during the plant decommissioning. With the used nuclear fuel stored onsite requiring oversight staff, SMUD opted to store the Class B and Class C radioactive waste in an existing interim onsite storage building until a suitable disposal option was available. In November 2007, the possession-only license for Rancho Seco was amended to update the Decommissioning Plan to terminate the possession-only license for the Class B and Class C waste in two phases. Phase I of the decommissioning was completed at the end of 2008. Following verification of the site conditions, SMUD submitted a request to the NRC to reduce the licensed facility from 2,480 acres to the interim onsite storage building and about one acre surrounding it. The request was approved by the NRC in September 2009. Phase II of decommissioning included the approximately two-acre interim storage building containing the Class B and Class C radioactive waste and surrounding area. In September 2013, SMUD entered into a contract with the operator of the low-level radioactive waste disposal facility located in Andrews, Texas. Shipment of the Class B and Class C radioactive waste for disposal was completed in November 2014. SMUD conducted additional clean-up activities and radiological surveys, which were followed by NRC confirmatory surveys. The results of these surveys demonstrated unit dose criteria well below NRC release criteria, and the NRC approved the Phase II area for unrestricted use. On September 21, 2017, SMUD formally requested the termination of the possession-only license. On August A-51

31, 2018, the NRC officially terminated SMUD’s possession-only license for the remaining Class B and Class C waste at Rancho Seco.

As part of the Decommissioning Plan, the nuclear fuel and Greater Than Class C (“GTCC”) radioactive waste is being stored in a dry storage facility (the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation or “ISFSI”) constructed by SMUD, adjacent to the former reactor facility. The NRC has separately licensed this facility. The DOE, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, is responsible for permanent disposal of used nuclear fuel and GTCC radioactive waste. SMUD has a contract with the DOE for the removal and disposal of this waste. The DOE was to have a waste repository operating by 1998, but has experienced significant and ongoing delays. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act designates Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the final and exclusive repository for the nation’s used nuclear fuel. The DOE discontinued the Yucca Mountain license review activities in 2010, but after a court ordered the NRC to resume its review in 2013, the NRC published its final safety evaluation report in 2015. The final safety report, and the final environmental impact statement, concluded that the proposed repository would be safe and environmentally sound for one million years.

Nevertheless, seeking alternatives to Yucca Mountain, the Blue-Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future delivered its final report in January 2012 with several recommendations. The DOE responded to the recommendations by issuing a report in January 2013 (Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste). Key to both documents is a focus on used fuel from decommissioned sites including Rancho Seco. The DOE report accepts most of the Blue-Ribbon Commission recommendations, and contains timelines for fuel management options which proposed removing the fuel from Rancho Seco as early as 2021. However, any progress on the strategies proposed by the DOE is dependent on legislative action by Congress. With no legislative action taken to date, the 2021 projected date for removal slips year-for-year. Therefore, SMUD continues to incur costs at this time when the DOE will fulfill its contractual obligations to remove the nuclear fuel and GTCC waste from the Rancho Seco facility. In the meantime, SMUD continues to incur costs of approximately $5 to $7 million per year for storage of used nuclear fuel at the ISFSI. SMUD has filed a series of successful lawsuits against the federal government for recovery of past spent fuel costs. SMUD has recovered over $14 million in 2023. SMUD plans to continue pursuing cost recovery claims to ensure it is reimbursed for all such costs in the future. The ISFSI will be decommissioned, and its license terminated after the fuel and GTCC is removed.

Financial Assurance Plan. In accordance with the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD established and funded an external decommissioning trust fund currently held by Computershare Corporate Trust (the “Decommissioning Trust Fund”). Pursuant to the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD made the final deposit into the Decommissioning Trust Fund in 2008. Additional deposits are not expected but will be made if increased cost estimates or reduced fund interest earnings require it. In 2011, the NRC began requiring that SMUD demonstrate financial assurance for decommissioning the ISFSI as well as the former power facility, increasing the overall cost for decommissioning Rancho Seco. The estimated total cost for decommissioning the ISFSI was approximately $7.1 million on December 31, 2023. The decommissioning cost estimate is required to be updated every three years. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of the Decommissioning Trust Fund was $9.4 million, excluding unrealized gains and losses. Based on the current decommissioning cost estimate and the value of the fund, SMUD’s existing Decommissioning Trust Fund provides sufficient funds to complete decommissioning and terminate the ISFSI license.

In addition to these costs, SMUD also estimates that it would cost approximately $13.1 million to restore the site to make it available for other SMUD uses with some major structures remaining intact. Site restoration is not a legal requirement. No site restoration is currently underway.

# EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

SMUD has approximately 2,334 employees, most of whom are covered by a civil service system. SMUD is a contracting member of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“PERS”). Approximately 50% of SMUD’s work-force is represented as to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment, by one of three recognized employee organizations, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”) Local 1245, the Organization of SMUD Employees (“OSE”), and the SMUD Public Safety Officers’ Association (“PSOA”). The remaining 50% of SMUD’s workforce, which includes managers, professional, administrative, supervisory, confidential and security staff, is unrepresented.

SMUD negotiated a four-year Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with IBEW and the OSE, effective January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2025. Both contracts contain a no-strike/no-lockout clause effective during the life of the agreements. SMUD has an MOU with PSOA effective through December 31, 2026. SMUD has experienced only one labor interruption, which occurred in January 1980 that lasted four days.

# RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POST-EMPLOYMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

## Pension Plans

SMUD participates in PERS, an agent multiple-employer public employee defined benefit plan. PERS provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. PERS acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating public entities within the State. Benefit provisions are established by State statute and SMUD policies. The pension plan provides retirement benefits, survivor benefits, and death and disability benefits based upon employees’ years of credited service, age, and final compensation.

As of June 30, 2022, the last actuarial valuation date for SMUD’s plan within PERS, the market value of the SMUD plan assets was $2.32 billion. The plan is 87.8% funded on a market value of assets basis, a decrease of 12.3% compared to the June 30, 2021 funded status based on the market value of assets.

As an employer, SMUD is required to contribute a percentage of payroll each year to PERS to fund SMUD’s plan based on actuarial valuations performed by PERS. PERS collects the normal cost based on a percentage of payroll and the unfunded liability portion is based on a dollar amount. SMUD also makes partial contributions required of SMUD employees on their behalf and for their account. At the PERS fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, SMUD’s required employer contribution rate for normal cost was 9.8% of payroll and the unfunded liability contribution was $22.4 million. During 2023, SMUD contributed $37.4 million to PERS (including SMUD’s contributions to cover required employee contributions), and SMUD employees paid $18.3 million for their share of the PERS contribution.

For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2025, SMUD is required to contribute 9.6% and 9.5% of payroll for normal costs and $10.7 million for fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 for the unfunded liability contribution. There is no estimated employer contribution to the unfunded liability for fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Assuming no amendments to the plan and no liability gains or losses (which can have a significant impact), PERS has projected that SMUD will be required to contribute 9.4% of payroll to the plan for normal costs and $15.7 million for the unfunded liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026, not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions. The amount SMUD is required to contribute to PERS is expected to increase in the future. The actual amount of such increases
<!-- Page 944 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

SMUD has the option to prepare an annual lump sum payment to PERS for the unfunded accrued liability portion only (not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions). SMUD made an annual lump sum prepayment of $19.5 million, and also voluntarily made an additional payment of $47.3 million, for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. SMUD was not required to make an annual lump sum prepayment and, to date, has not voluntarily made additional payments for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.

While SMUD has some ability to adjust the retirement benefits provided to its employees, PERS determines the actuarial methods and assumptions used with respect to assets administered by PERS (including the SMUD plan assets) and makes the investment decisions with respect to such assets. For a description of such actuarial methods and assumptions (including the smoothing conventions used by PERS when setting employer contribution rates) and investments, see the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS (SMUD’s plan is part of the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund of PERS) available on its website at www.calpers.ca.gov. SMUD cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information and neither the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS nor any other information contained on the PERS website is incorporated by reference in or part of this Official Statement. Actuarial assessments are “forward-looking” information that reflect the judgment of the fiduciaries of the pension plans, and are based upon a variety of assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be inaccurate or be changed in the future. Actuarial assessments will change with the future experience of the pension plans.

GASB issued Statement No. 68 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – An Amendment of GASB Statement No. 27” (“GASB No. 68”). The primary objective of GASB No. 68 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for pensions. Under GASB No. 68, SMUD is required to report the net pension asset or net pension liability (i.e., the difference between the total pension liability and the pension plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of investment gains and losses. GASB No. 68 separates financial reporting from funding requirements for pension plans. The pension liability as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is $259.0 million and $235.5 million, respectively.

SMUD provides its employees with two cash deferred compensation plans: one pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 401(k) (the “401(k) Plan”) and one pursuant to IRC Section 457 (the “457 Plan” and collectively, the “Plans”). The Plans are contributory plans in which SMUD’s employees contribute the funds. Each of SMUD’s eligible full-time or permanent part-time employees may participate in either or both Plans, and amounts contributed by employees are vested immediately. Such funds are held by a trustee in trust for the employees upon retirement from SMUD service and, accordingly, are not subject to the general claims of SMUD’s creditors. SMUD makes annual contributions to the 401(k) Plan on behalf of certain employees pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with both of its collective bargaining units. SMUD matches the non-represented employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to a set amount. SMUD also makes limited discretionary contributions to non-represented employees hired after January 1, 2013, which contributions fully vest after five years. Prior to 2022, SMUD did not match employee contributions, nor make contributions on behalf of its employees to the 457 Plan. Beginning in 2022, SMUD makes annual contributions to the 457 Plan on behalf of certain employees and matches employee contributions up to a set amount pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with one of its collective bargaining units. SMUD made contributions to both Plans of $6.9 million in 2023 and to the 401(k) Plan of $7.0 million in 2022. Participating employees made contributions into both Plans totaling $34.3 million in 2023 and $32.4 million in 2022.

# Other Post-Employment Benefits

SMUD provides post-employment healthcare benefits, in accordance with SMUD policy and negotiated agreements with employee representation groups in a single employer defined benefit plan, to all employees who retire from SMUD, and their dependents. SMUD also provides post-employment healthcare benefits to covered employees who are eligible for disability retirement. SMUD contributes the full cost of coverage for retirees hired before January 1, 1991, and a portion of the cost based on credited years of service for retirees hired after January 1, 1991. SMUD also contributes a portion of the costs of coverage for these retirees’ dependents. Retirees are required to contribute the portion that is not paid by SMUD. The benefits, benefit levels, retiree contributions and employer contributions are governed by SMUD and can be amended by SMUD through its personnel manual and union contracts.

SMUD’s post-employment health care benefits are funded through the PERS California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust (“CERBT”), an agent multiple-employer plan. The funding of a plan occurs when the following events take place: the employer makes payments of benefits directly to or on behalf of a retiree or beneficiary; the employer makes premium payments to an insurer; or the employer irrevocably transfers assets to a trust or other third party acting in the role of trustee, where the plan assets are dedicated to the sole purpose of the payments of the plan benefits, and creditors of the government do not have access to those assets.

SMUD has elected to contribute the normal costs to the CERBT but annually receive reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT. In 2024, SMUD’s contribution for the normal costs to CERBT is $10.6 million. In 2023, SMUD made a contribution to the CERBT for normal costs in the amount of $8.6 million. In 2022, SMUD decided to forgo making a contribution for the normal costs to the CERBT because there was a net OPEB asset as of December 31, 2021. SMUD made additional contributions to the trust. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD made healthcare benefit contributions by paying actual medical costs of $24.7 million and $24.5 million, respectively. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD received $24.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively, reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT.

At June 30, 2023 and 2022, SMUD estimated that the actuarially determined accumulated post-employment benefit obligation was approximately $403.6 and $381.7 million, respectively. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the plan was 92.3% and 97.9% funded, respectively.

SMUD’s actuary uses PERS economic and other assumptions as the basis for the calculation of the post-employment benefit obligation. The actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will vary substantially if such PERS assumptions, such as interest rate and life expectancy, among others, prove to be inaccurate or different than SMUD’s actual experience. Although SMUD believes that such assumptions and estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that any such assumptions will prove to be accurate, or that SMUD’s actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will not materially exceed its estimates. Additional information is available in Note 15 (Other Postemployment Benefits) and “Required Supplementary Information” to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

GASB previously issued SGAS No. 75 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions”. The primary objective of GASB No. 75 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for post-employment benefits other than pensions (“OPEB”). Under GASB No. 75, SMUD is required to report the net OPEB asset or net OPEB liability (i.e., the difference between the total OPEB liability and the OPEB plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of

## Outstanding Indebtedness

### General

SMUD typically finances its capital requirements through the sale of revenue bonds, the sale of commercial paper, from draws on its Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and from internally generated funds. With the enactment of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and the 2024 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, SMUD is monitoring and exploring new methods of financing, including those afforded under these two federal laws, that provide not-for-profit public power utilities with direct federal incentive payments.

SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Senior Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 (the “Senior Resolution”) adopted in 1971, as amended and supplemented (the “Senior Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Senior Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $1,783,965,000 outstanding. The Senior Bonds are payable solely from the Net Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Senior Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of “Maintenance and Operation Costs” and “Energy Payments” as defined in the Senior Resolution, including payments by SMUD to TANC under PA3, payments by SMUD under power purchase agreements related to the Authorities and payments by SMUD to NCGA and NCEA under their respective gas supply contracts. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD’s Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Subordinated Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 85-11-1 of SMUD, adopted on November 7, 1985, as amended and supplemented (the “Subordinated Resolution”).

**“Subordinate Resolution”**. As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Subordinated Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $332,020,000 outstanding. The Subordinated Bonds are payable solely from the Net Subordinated Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Subordinated Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds.

SMUD issues commercial paper notes (the “Notes”) from time to time. As of March 21, 2024, SMUD’s Notes were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000. Currently, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 may be outstanding at any one time, but SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be outstanding at any one time in the future. The Notes are secured by letters of credit issued by commercial banks. The Notes (and SMUD’s obligations to repay drawings under the letters of credit) are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. Drawings under the letters of credit, to the extent not repaid immediately from the proceeds of commercial paper or other available SMUD funds, are repayable with interest over a period of five years. The letters of credit currently expire in August of 2025 and March of 2027. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD also entered into a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank and issued its taxable and tax-exempt revolving notes thereunder (collectively, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in February 2022. As of December 31, 2023, no principal amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Currently, the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at any one time is limited to $100,000,000. However, SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the Revolving Credit Facility in the future. SMUD’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. The current term of the Revolving Credit Facility expires in February 2026.

**Joint Powers Authorities.** SMUD has entered into long-term take-or-pay purchase agreements with SFA relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Under such agreements, SMUD has exclusive control of the dispatch of all five of the Local Gas-Fired Plants and takes all of the power produced by the Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” The Authorities are each treated as component units of SMUD for accounting purposes. Only SFA has outstanding debt, which relates solely to the Cosumnes Power Plant and is payable solely from capacity payments made by SMUD under the related power purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2023, bonds issued by SFA to finance the Cosumnes Power Plant were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $87,890,000. SMUD’s payments under the power purchase agreements relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal of and interest on the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and Subordinate Resolution.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCGA as a joint powers authority. NCGA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCGA issued $757,055,000 in bonds in May 2007 for the purpose of paying Morgan Stanley Capital Group in advance for natural gas to be delivered to NCGA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas supplies delivered by NCGA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the 

A-57

![NCGA bonds](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=NCGA+bonds)

NCGA bonds. As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $120,070,000 remain outstanding.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCEA as a joint powers authority. NCEA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCEA issued $539,615,000 in bonds in December 2018 for the purpose of paying J. Aron & Company LLC in advance for natural gas or electricity to be delivered to NCEA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas or electricity supplies delivered by NCEA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the NCEA bonds. [As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $537,295,000 remain outstanding. As described in the forepart of this Official Statement, the bonds issued by NCEA in 2018 are expected to be refunded with proceeds of the Bonds (as defined in the forepart of this Official Statement.)] [to be revised for 2024 Senior Bond offering documents]

**Interest Rate Swap Agreements.** SMUD has two interest rate swap agreements relating to previously or currently outstanding Subordinated Bonds, as shown in the following table. For more information, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

| Effective Date | Termination Date | SMUD Pays | SMUD Receives | Notional Amount (000's) | Counterparty |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 7/2/1997       | 7/1/2024         | Floating  | SIFMA          | 5.154%                  | $19,570      | J Aron & Company LLC |
| 07/12/2023     | 08/15/2041       | Fixed     | 0.718%         | [70% of 1M SOFR]       | 132,020      | Barclays Bank |

The obligations of SMUD under the swap agreements are not secured by a pledge of revenues of SMUD’s electric system or any other property of SMUD. SMUD does not currently have any collateral posting requirements with respect to the interest rate swap agreements, but SMUD may be required to post collateral under certain circumstances.

**Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments.** SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds, 2009 Series V (the “2009 Series V Bonds”) and Electric Revenue Bonds, 2010 Series W (the “2010 Series W Bonds”) were issued as “Build America Bonds” under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. At the time the 2009 Series V Bonds and 2010 Series W Bonds were issued, SMUD expected to receive an annual cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury equal to 35% of the interest payable on the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. However, as a result of the federal budget process, many payments from the federal government, including Build America Bonds subsidy payments, have been reduced. Absent the federal budget reductions, the aggregate annual cash subsidy payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds would be approximately $9.8 million. With the current federal budget reductions, SMUD has typically been receiving aggregate annual cash subsidy payments with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds of approximately $9.2 million. It is possible that future federal budget actions could further reduce, or eliminate entirely, the annual cash subsidy payments with respect to Build America Bonds, including the annual cash subsidy payments payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. SMUD cannot predict the likelihood of the further reduction or elimination of the Build America Bonds subsidy payments. A significant reduction or elimination of the cash subsidy.

(1) Does not include outstanding bonds issued by the Authorities for the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Does not include bonds issued by NCGA, NCEA or SMUD’s portion of bonds issued by TANC. Payments by SMUD which are used by the Authorities, NCGA, NCEA, and TANC to pay debt service on such bonds constitute either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution.  
(2) Debt service is not reduced by the amount of any subsidy that SMUD currently expects to receive in connection with the 2009 Series V Bonds and 2010 Series W Bonds.  
(3) Based on an assumed interest rate of 3% per annum following (i) the initial scheduled Mandatory Purchase Date of October 15, 2030 for SMUD’s Subordinated Electric Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2023 Series D and (ii) the initial scheduled Mandatory Purchase Date of October 15, 2025 for SMUD’s Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds, 2019 Series B.

# INSURANCE

SMUD maintains a comprehensive property/casualty insurance program designed to protect against catastrophic losses that would have an adverse effect on its financial position or operational capabilities. Insurance programs are continuously reviewed and modified when construction, operational exposures, or developments in the insurance industry so warrant. Long-term relationships with a variety of insurers minimize SMUD’s susceptibility to the effects of market cycles. SMUD budgets reserves to meet potential insurance deductibles and self-insured liability claims.

SMUD safeguards assets with all-risk property and boiler/machinery insurance with limits of $800 million per occurrence for physical damage and business interruption combined. Various coverage sublimits and deductibles apply to losses arising from certain perils, such as business interruption, earthquake, or flood, respectively. Liability insurance is in effect to defend and indemnify SMUD against third party claims, including general, automobile and sudden and accidental pollution claims with policy limits of $140 million, and wildfire coverage with policy limits of $275 million, all of which include a variety of self-insured retentions.

Nuclear property and liability insurance policies are maintained in accordance with the NRC’s requirements for decommissioned nuclear plants that maintain dry storage of spent fuel on-site. This includes $100 million in first party property damage and decontamination, $100 million for nuclear liability arising from accidents on-site, $200 million for supplier’s and transporter’s nuclear liability, and $300 million for nuclear worker liability. SMUD is exposed to possible retrospective assessments for nuclear property events occurring at other nuclear facilities in the United States capped at ten times SMUD’s annual nuclear property premium (currently the maximum retrospective assessment is approximately $1,000,000).

Other types of insurance include non-owned aircraft liability, workers’ compensation, crime, cyber security, fidelity, fiduciary liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, professional errors and omissions, transportation, and builder’s risk for major facilities under construction.

# LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

SMUD is a party to numerous actions arising out of the conduct of its business and affairs, some of which are discussed below. SMUD believes that any losses or adverse financial results it may suffer in these current actions, to the extent not covered by insurance, would not, in the aggregate, have an adverse material impact on SMUD, its business and affairs, or results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

## Environmental Litigation

SMUD was one of many potentially responsible parties that had been named in a number of actions relating to environmental claims and/or complaints. SMUD has resolved these environmental claims and/or complaints and entered into settlement agreements and/or consent orders. These settlement agreements and consent orders have statutory reopener provisions which allow regulatory agencies to seek additional funds for environmental remediation under certain limited circumstances. While SMUD believes it is unlikely that any of the prior settlements or consent orders will be reopened, the possibility exists. If any of the settlements or consent orders were to be reopened, SMUD believes that the outcome will not have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

## Proposition 26 Lawsuit

In October 2019, two SMUD customers jointly filed a complaint against SMUD (subsequently one of the customers removed themselves from the complaint), which stated that SMUD’s Board violated

<!-- Page 951 -->
![Proposition 26](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Proposition+26)

**Proposition 26** (see “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Proposition 26” for a description of Proposition 26) when on June 24, 2019, it adopted rate increases for 2020 and 2021. The plaintiff contended the rates did not reflect SMUD’s reasonable cost of service because they included a 9.2% scalar that SMUD applies to its TOD residential rate restructure adopted by SMUD’s Board in the 2017 rate process. SMUD viewed the lawsuit as having little merit and while SMUD anticipated the court would rule in SMUD’s favor on substantive grounds, the plaintiff in early 2024 agreed to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice due to their failure to diligently prosecute the case. On January 16, 2024, the court approved the dismissal.

On January 19, 2024, the same plaintiff, along with a second SMUD residential customer, jointly filed a new complaint challenging the September 21, 2023, SMUD Board adoption of 2024 and 2025 rate increases. The plaintiffs make a similar claim regarding the TOD scalar as the prior lawsuit. Given the little merit behind the lawsuit, SMUD believes the court will rule in its favor. However, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the case or, if to the extent SMUD ultimately is not successful in the litigation, what remedies against SMUD may be available. SMUD believes that if it is not successful in the litigation, and to the extent the outcome would have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, the Board would make appropriate rate modifications based on an evidentiary record consistent with guidance from a judicial decision in the case.

**Other Litigation Matters**

Currently, SMUD is party to various claims, legal actions and complaints relating to its operations, including, but not limited to, property damage, personal injury, contract disputes, and employment matters. SMUD believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

**FERC Administrative Proceedings**

SMUD is involved in a number of FERC administrative proceedings related to the operation of wholesale energy markets, regional transmission planning, gas transportation and NERC reliability standards. These proceedings generally fall into the following categories: (i) filings initiated by the CAISO (or other market participants) to adopt/modify the CAISO Tariff and/or establish market design and behavior rules; (ii) filings initiated by existing transmission owners (i.e., PG&E and the other IOUs) to pass-through costs to their existing wholesale transmission customers; (iii) filings initiated by FERC to market participants to establish market design and behavior rules or investigate market behavior by certain market participants; (iv) filings initiated by transmission owners under their transmission owner tariffs to establish a regional transmission planning process; (v) filings initiated by providers of firm gas transportation services under the Natural Gas Act; and (vi) filings initiated by NERC to develop reliability standards applicable to owners, users, and operators of the bulk electric system. In addition, SMUD is an active participant in other FERC administrative proceedings, including those related to reliability, variable resource integration and the changing resource mix, and transmission planning and cost allocation. SMUD believes that determinations of these FERC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

**CPUC Administrative Proceedings**

Periodically, PG&E seeks to update its gas transmission and storage (“GT&S”) revenue requirements and rate designs. These applications are litigated at the CPUC and affect SMUD through several tariff rates SMUD pays to move natural gas along PG&E’s backbone transmission lines. In the 2019 GT&S rate case (the “2019 GT&S Case”), the CPUC affirmed the application in GT&S rates of cost causation principles to prevent excessive and unreasonable costs being shifted to electric generator.

backbone customers like SMUD, either through proposed changes in PG&E’s natural gas storage strategy or through cost shifts within the electric generator customer class.

PG&E filed its 2023 General Rate Case (the “GRC”) in June 2021 which includes its gas transmission and storage revenue requirements. In September 2021, PG&E filed an application for approval of its Gas Cost Allocation and Rate Design Proposals (“CARD”). The CPUC issued a decision in the GRC in November 2023 authorizing PG&E’s revenue requirements for the four-year rate period of 2023-2026. SMUD is a party to the comprehensive all-party settlement agreement submitted to the CPUC for approval in June 2023 which, if approved, would resolve all open issues in the CARD proceeding. SMUD does not believe that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. SMUD will continue to actively participate in PG&E’s GRC and CARD proceedings to ensure that costs are fairly allocated to non-core customers, including electric generator backbone customers.

In the GRC, the CPUC directed PG&E to submit an application to revise its natural gas curtailment procedures “similar to the curtailment procedures of other large energy utilities”. SMUD will actively participate in this future proceeding.

Separately, SMUD continues to participate and monitor a proceeding at the CPUC concerning long-term gas system planning. At this point in these proceedings, SMUD does not anticipate that the resolution of such cases will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

SMUD monitors a number of other CPUC proceedings. These proceedings generally fall into three categories: (i) filings initiated by PG&E to adopt/modify its tariffs and/or rules; (ii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish market design and behavior rules or program rules affecting SMUD customers; and (iii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish electric and/or gas system safety design and maintenance rules. SMUD believes that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR

California Electric Market

In 1996, the State partially deregulated its electric energy market and the CAISO was established in 1998. Since the CAISO’s formation, the State has experienced episodes of higher and more volatile prices for natural gas and wholesale electricity. In reaction to such conditions, SMUD made significant changes to its business strategy to mitigate the impacts of the more volatile and unpredictable energy markets. Volatility in energy prices in the State are always a potential risk due to a variety of factors which affect both the supply and demand for electricity in the western United States. These factors include, but are not limited to, the implementation of the CAISO market design changes, insufficient generation resources, the increase in intermittent renewable energy resources, natural gas price volatility, fuel costs and availability, weather and natural disasters, transmission constraints and levels of hydroelectric generation within the region. While SMUD has taken a number of steps to mitigate its exposure to price volatility associated with these factors, this price volatility under extreme conditions may contribute to greater volatility in SMUD’s net revenues from the purchase and sale of electric energy and, therefore, could materially adversely affect the financial condition and liquidity of SMUD. For a discussion of SMUD’s current resource planning activities and risk management strategies, see “BUSINESS STRATEGY” above.

# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity continues to be a top priority for SMUD. Attacks or threats directed at critical electric or energy sector operations could damage or cause the shut-down of generation, transmission or distribution assets that are essential to SMUD’s ability to serve its customers, cause operational malfunctions and outages affecting SMUD’s electric system, and result in costly recovery and remediation efforts. The costs of security measures or of remedying breaches could be material.

SMUD participates in sharing and receiving information about cyber security threats in real-time through the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (“E-ISAC”), the central hub for such data to actively manage risk related to potential cyber intrusion. SMUD also participates in NERC’s development of mandatory, enforceable cyber security standards to address vulnerabilities in electric utility systems. SMUD also adopts voluntary measures suggested as best practices by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) in its national framework.

SMUD’s prudent response to this ever-changing threat requires constant monitoring and frequent updates to implement new regulatory requirements as they are developed. SMUD manages risk related to frequently changing regulatory requirements by participating in the development of standards at NERC and NIST and through active engagement in the cyber security policy dialogue in Congress.

# Physical Security

Physical security is a critical concern for electric utilities as they seek to protect their infrastructure from a range of threats. The electric utility infrastructure is complex and consists of multiple components, such as power plants, substations, transmission and distribution lines, and other facilities. SMUD employs a dedicated physical security team that is deployed 24/7 and allows SMUD to respond to emergent events in a safe, coordinated, efficient, and cohesive manner, protecting the lives of its employees, customers, community, properties and assets. SMUD has policies, processes and procedures in place that outline the access controls and restrictions for its properties. SMUD restricts access based on need as it determines, while adhering to applicable laws, regulations and standards such as NERC Reliability Standards and NRC regulations. SMUD also maintains a Utility Security Plan adopted by the Board representing SMUD’s compliance with the CPUC’s Safety and Enforcement Division six-step security plan process described in CPUC Decision 19-01-018.

During times of elevated, imminent threats, safety and/or security concerns, SMUD’s Security Operations team, under the direction of the Chief Financial Officer or delegate, reserves the right to deploy additional security measures, controls, and further restrict or limit access to its properties to increase its security posture.

SMUD operates a 24/7 security operations center which monitors and coordinates responses to situations reported by internal and external stakeholders, or which are detected by SMUD’s security technology. The technology includes access control, video surveillance, and various types of intrusion detection solutions. The security operations center is a central hub for initial contact for physical security calls from employees of suspicious events and initiates incident responses as needed.

# Federal Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings

## Energy Policy Act of 2005

On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct of 2005”) was signed into law. The law includes a number of energy-related provisions, including among other things limited FERC jurisdiction over interstate transmission assets of municipal utilities, cooperatives and federal utilities to order these entities to provide transmission services on rates and terms. 

A-63
<!-- Page 954 -->

**Federal Regulation of Transmission Access.** The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the “Energy Policy Act”) made fundamental changes in the federal regulation of the electric utility industry, particularly in the area of transmission access. The Energy Policy Act provided FERC with the authority to require a transmitting utility to provide transmission services at rates, charges, terms and conditions set by FERC. The purpose of these changes, in part, was to bring about increased competition in the electric utility industry. Under the Energy Policy Act, electric utilities owned by municipalities and other public agencies which own or operate electric power transmission facilities which are used for the sale of electric energy at wholesale are “transmitting utilities” subject to the requirements of the Energy Policy Act.

Since the Energy Policy Act, FERC has adopted a series of rules to implement competitive open access to transmission facilities and regional transmission planning. Order No. 888, issued in 1996, requires the provision of open access transmission services on a nondiscriminatory basis by all “jurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does not include municipal entities like SMUD) by requiring all such utilities to file OATTs. Order No. 888 also requires “nonjurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does include SMUD) that purchase transmission services from a jurisdictional utility under an open access tariff and that owns or controls transmission facilities to provide open access service to the jurisdictional utility under terms that are comparable to the service that the nonjurisdictional utility provides itself. Section 211A of the EPAct of 2005 authorizes, but does not require, FERC to direct transmission utilities to provide transmission services, including rates and terms and conditions, that are comparable to those under which the unregulated transmitting utility provides transmission services to itself that are not unduly discriminatory or preferential – often referred to as the reciprocity rule.

In Order 890, issued in 2007, FERC stated that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis and retain the current reciprocity provisions.

In 2011, FERC issued Order 1000, which among other things requires public utility (jurisdictional) transmission providers to participate in a regional transmission planning process that produces a regional transmission plan and that incorporates a regional and inter-regional cost allocation methodology. Similar to Order 890, FERC states that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis. However, in Order 1000, FERC appears to expand upon the current reciprocity provisions and states that it has the authority to allocate costs to beneficiaries of services provided by specific transmission facilities even in the absence of a contractual relationship between the owner of the transmission facilities and the identified beneficiary.

SMUD, individually, and through the Large Public Power Council (“LPPC”), appealed Order 1000, but in 2014 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected all of the arguments raised on appeal, upholding the entirety of Order 1000.

The jurisdictional members of WestConnect filed their proposed regional planning process and cost allocation methodology through a series of compliance filings at FERC. FERC accepted binding cost allocation for jurisdictional transmission providers of WestConnect and mandated that non-jurisdictional transmission providers (such as SMUD) identified as beneficiaries of a project have the ability to not accept the cost allocation. WestConnect’s Order 1000 planning process began with the 2016-2017 planning cycle. 

A-64
<!-- Page 955 -->
However, in response to FERC’s WestConnect orders on compliance, El Paso Electric Company (“El Paso”), a jurisdictional transmission provider, petitioned to the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. El Paso contends that FERC’s WestConnect orders violate Order 1000’s cost causation principle because WestConnect’s binding cost allocation applies only to the jurisdictional transmission providers and thus forces jurisdictional transmission providers to subsidize projects benefiting non-jurisdictional transmission providers that opt-out of projects. The non-jurisdictional transmission providers agreed on a settlement with the jurisdictional transmission providers to resolve the matters on appeal in the 5th Circuit, but FERC ultimately did not accept the settlement. On August 2, 2023, the court reversed FERC’s orders implementing Order No. 1000 for WestConnect concerning cost allocation of regional transmission projects to non-jurisdictional transmission providers. The court found that the WestConnect orders are incompatible with Order No. 1000’s application of the cost causation principle to address free ridership. There is uncertainty at this time on the future of WestConnect’s regional planning process. FERC has not yet acted on its own in light of the Fifth Circuit’s decision, and it is uncertain whether it will act while it is working on an updated transmission planning and cost allocation proposal that could change the Order 1000 process (as further discussed below regarding the April 21, 2022 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking). It is also uncertain if and/or the extent to which the jurisdictional transmission providers in WestConnect will file revisions to the regional transmission planning provisions in their OATTs. In the meantime, the WestConnect planning has continued under the existing framework and SMUD, along with the other non-jurisdictional transmission providers, continue to participate in the WestConnect process. SMUD’s longstanding objective is to comply with open access requirements necessary to achieve reciprocity, including through participation in a regional planning process while binding itself to mandatory cost allocation. Thus, SMUD has an interest in continuing to explore options for participation in a regional transmission planning process if the WestConnect rules are modified to permit SMUD to reasonably participate consistent with its business and jurisdictional interests.

SMUD is unable to predict at this time the full impact that Order 1000, or the 5th Circuit’s August decision, will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the WestConnect process generally. However, WestConnect has conducted multiple planning cycles under its Order 1000 planning process and has not identified any project eligible for cost allocation. SMUD will continue to take any action necessary, including withdrawing from a cost allocation determination or planning region, and engaging in FERC proceedings, to ensure that it is not required to pay for transmission costs in the absence of an agreement or service relationship.

On April 21, 2022, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Building for the Future Through Electric Regional Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation and Generator Interconnection (the “NOPR”). The NOPR seeks input on proposals that would impact the Order 1000 planning and cost allocation process. SMUD has been engaged in the proceeding, providing input and helping draft comments with trade organizations, including LPPC. FERC has not issued any subsequent order. SMUD will continue to monitor and be engaged in any developments at FERC that impact the Order 1000 process and its regional transmission planning participation.

NERC Reliability Standards. The EPAct of 2005 required FERC to certify an electric reliability organization (“ERO”) to develop mandatory and enforceable reliability standards, subject to FERC review and approval. On February 3, 2006, FERC issued Order 672, which certified NERC as the ERO. Many reliability standards have since been approved by FERC, including those aimed at protecting the bulk electric system from physical and cyber threats.

The ERO or the regional entities, such as WECC, may enforce the reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight or FERC may independently enforce reliability standards. Potential monetary sanctions include fines of up to $1,544,521 per violation per day. Order 693 provides ERO and regional entities with 

A-65

the discretion necessary to assess penalties for such violations, while also having discretion to calculate a penalty without collecting the penalty if circumstances warrant.

**Anti-Market Manipulation Rules.** EPAct of 2005 gave FERC the authority to issue rules to prevent market manipulation in jurisdictional wholesale power and gas markets, and in jurisdictional transmission and transportation services. These anti-market manipulation rules apply to non-jurisdictional entities such as SMUD. Further, EPAct of 2005 provided FERC civil penalty authority, which the Commission has stated that it will exercise carefully by assuring that its market manipulation rules are clear.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions.** Since 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions from different sources, including from the electric sector.

In 2014, EPA issued a proposed rule under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) called the Clean Power Plan (the “CPP”) that projected power sector emissions reductions of 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The proposed CPP would have established a rate-based emissions goal for each state, providing states the responsibility to develop a State Implementation Plan (“SIP”) describing how each will meet the goal assigned by EPA using the “Best System of Emissions Reduction” (“BSER”) established by EPA. The rule was finalized in October 2015.

In November 2015, 27 states and numerous corporations challenged the CPP in court, alleging that EPA had exceeded its authority under the CAA; however, before the issue could be decided by the court, the 2016 presidential election resulted in a change of administration. The new administration quickly moved for an abeyance (or stay) of the case for as long as the agency needed to review and withdraw the CPP. The U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP pending disposition in the D.C. Circuit and any subsequent review by the Supreme Court. In August 2018, EPA proceeded to withdraw the CPP and the D.C. Circuit ultimately dismissed the case on September 17, 2019. EPA proposed a different rule under the same provision of the CAA, known as the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, which would have established a BSER that only includes measures that can be undertaken at an individual power plant, rather than the broader suite of measures envisioned under the CPP. The ACE rule was challenged in court by environmental groups and states alleging that the revised rule inadequately responds to EPA’s responsibility to protect public health and welfare. SMUD joined in this litigation along with other challengers. The D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule on January 19, 2021, and remanded it to the EPA for review and revision, just days before a new presidential administration took office. Several states led by West Virginia and coal industry members appealed the decision.

In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in West Virginia v. EPA, striking down the CPP and foreclosing any future regulations of “significant political and economic significance” if Congress has not expressly authorized them. While the decision does not restrict EPA to only requiring measures “inside the fence line” at an individual power plant to control GHGs, it appears unlikely that the EPA will be able to require material reductions in GHGs to mitigate climate change through section 111(d) of the CAA.

Under the new presidential administration, in May 2023, the EPA issued a proposed rule under Section 111(d) of the CAA to reduce GHG emissions from existing and new power plants. The four-part proposed rule, **New Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Existing Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; and Repeal of the Affordable Clean Energy Rule**, would set both GHG emission standards for certain subcategories of new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants operating greater than 50% of the time and generating more than 300 MW per turbine. In the proposed rule, EPA determined the BSER is either deploying carbon capture and storage

technology to capture 90% of emissions or co-firing 96% hydrogen produced through a low-emission process (“low-GHG hydrogen”). If finalized, compliance is required by 2032. SMUD has filed comments as part of several trade groups and coalitions in response to the proposed rule. SMUD’s internal analysis shows the rule as proposed would not require changes at any of its currently-operating fossil-fueled power plants and therefore will not have a material impact on SMUD’s financial position, operations, or liquidity.

**Federal Communications Commission**

The 1978 Pole Attachment Act added section 224 to the Communications Act of 1934, authorizing the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) to regulate attachments by cable television systems or providers of telecommunications service to utility poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way. Under Section 224(a)(1), public power entities are exempt from FCC pole attachment regulations, as municipally-owned poles are already subject to local decision-making processes and governance. The municipal exemption from FCC pole attachment regulations was further codified through the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. However, over the past decade, this exemption has been continuously eroded.

Various actions by the FCC have limited the exemption in support of a “uniform policy for broadband access to privately-owned physical infrastructure.” Through four orders issued between 2017 and 2018, the FCC set strict time limits for the review of pole attachment applications and preempted state and local agreements on pole attachments. In 2020, in *City of Portland v. United States*, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the FCC’s Small Cell Order, which adopted new time limits for municipal utilities’ review of wireless infrastructure siting applications and preempted access for small cell installations. In November 2023, the FCC adopted its Fourth Report and Order, Declaratory Ruling, and Third Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which established new rules and the timeline for the approval process for pole attachment applications, among other things. SMUD will monitor this proceeding for any potential impact to SMUD.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new FCC rulemakings will impact the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system.

**Federal Clean Energy Legislation.** SMUD actively participates in discussion at the federal level regarding legislation that would meaningfully impact SMUD’s existing GHG reduction strategies or impose new requirements for electric generators, including a proposed federal clean energy standard. In the 117th Congress, a clean electricity performance program was considered but ultimately lacked support to pass. Instead, Congress extended and expanded clean energy tax credits and created new grant and rebate programs to incentivize clean energy investments in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While it is possible that a future Congress may revisit the concept of a clean energy standard or other GHG reduction regime, it is possible that the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will diminish the likelihood of a new regulatory framework being enacted in the near future.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new EPA rulemakings will be undertaken, and what the full impact of the reduction of fossil-based generation over time will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the electric utility industry generally.

**State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings**

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills provide for reduced GHG emission standards and greater investment in energy efficient and environmentally friendly generation alternatives through more stringent RPS. Additionally, ongoing regulatory proceedings address the implementation of these bills as well as water flow and quality.

![Greenhouse Gas Emissions Summary](https://example.com/image.png)

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**  
On September 27, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (“AB 32”). AB 32 requires the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) to adopt enforceable GHG emission limits and emission reduction measures in order to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In addition, AB 32 establishes a mandatory reporting program for all IOUs, local, publicly-owned electric utilities and other load-serving entities (electric utilities providing energy to end-use customers) (“LSEs”). The AB 32 reporting program allows CARB to adopt regulations using market-based compliance mechanisms such as a “cap-and-trade” system.

On December 16, 2010, CARB approved a resolution adopting cap-and-trade regulations for the State. The regulations became effective on January 1, 2012. As adopted, the cap-and-trade program covers sources accounting for 85% of the State’s GHG emissions, the largest program of its type in the United States. In November of 2012, CARB conducted its first allowance auction and auctions now occur on a quarterly schedule.

The cap-and-trade program introduced a hard emissions cap that declines over time on the combined electric utility and large industrial sectors, covering all sources emitting more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases (“CO2e”) per year, and was subsequently expanded to cover distributors of transportation, natural gas, and other fossil fuels. The cap-and-trade program requires covered entities to retire compliance instruments (allowances and carbon offsets) for each metric ton of CO2e they emit. CARB has allocated allowances to LSEs to mitigate the compliance cost burden on ratepayers. The value of allowances must be used to benefit ratepayers and achieve GHG emission purposes (not exceeding 8% of a regulated entity’s compliance obligation through 2020, 4% from 2021 through 2025, and 6% from 2026 through 2030). Offsets must be obtained from certified projects in sectors that are not regulated under the cap-and-trade program and are subject to other restrictions.

The State's cap-and-trade program was briefly linked to companion program in the Canadian province of Ontario during 2018 but was de-linked following a political change. In 2021, the Washington state legislature passed a cap-and-trade bill, which is expected to interact with the State’s markets. Future potential near-term links to the CARB cap-and-trade program also include the states of Oregon, which has adopted a cap-and-trade program, and New Mexico, which is considering the adoption of a cap-and-trade program.

On October 7, 2015, SB 350 was enacted, containing aggressive goals for reducing carbon emissions by 2030, including raising the proportion of renewable energy to 50%, reducing the use of petroleum fuel in cars and trucks by up to 50%, and doubling the energy efficiency of existing buildings. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” for additional information. In addition, SB 350 established requirements for larger POUs to adopt and file with the CEC Integrated Resource Plans (“IRPs”) by April 2019 that should planned procurement to achieve the 50% RPS and State GHG goals established by CARB. The CEC developed “guidelines” for these IRPs for POUs in 2017, updated them in 2018, and proposed additional updates in 2022. CARB established specific GHG target ranges for these IRPs in summer 2018, which were revised in 2023 following the adoption of CARB’s 2022 Scoping Plan. SMUD developed and adopted an IRP in 2018 through a comprehensive public process and filed the adopted IRP with the CEC in April 2019. SMUD adopted an updated IRP in June 2022 and filed the updated IRP with the CEC in September 2022, but the CEC has not yet completed its review of SMUD’s 2022 IRP. SMUD’s updated IRP plans for a greater than 92% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 relative to 1990 levels, which equals approximately A-68.

250,000 metric tons of GHG emissions in 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change.”

On April 29, 2015, the Governor of the State signed Executive Order B-30-15, establishing a goal for the State to reduce GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2016, the State Legislature passed Senate Bill 32 (“SB 32”), which codified then-Governor Brown’s goal of reducing the State’s GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2017, the State Legislature passed Assembly Bill 398 (“AB 398”), explicitly authorizing the continuation of the cap-and-trade program, with designated changes, through 2030. Subsequently, CARB adopted an initial set of regulatory changes extending the cap-and-trade program, including establishing utility sector allowance allocations through 2030. In 2018, CARB completed a rulemaking to implement the cap-and-trade program changes designated by AB 398. These changes include development of a hard price ceiling for the cap-and-trade program and two price-containment points below that ceiling, in an attempt to ensure stable prices in the program. CARB adopted final regulations on December 13, 2018.

In addition, any new projects constructed in the State, including power plants, that may cause a significant adverse impact on the environment must be analyzed under CEQA. Some State agencies have begun using CEQA in novel ways to require mitigation of “significant” GHG emissions caused, either directly or indirectly, by a project. Pursuant to Senate Bill 97 passed in 2007, CARB will assist the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research in setting thresholds of significance under CEQA of GHG impacts from new projects. This is an area of State law that is evolving and unsettled in the courts. However, there is a risk that any project proponent of an electric system infrastructure project might have to mitigate such potential impacts to a level of less than significant.

On December 3, 2012, the Superior Court of California ruled in Environmental Defense Fund v. San Diego Association of Governments (“SANDAG”), Case No. 2100-00101593, that sided with the State Attorney General and the other petitioners stating that SANDAG did not follow CEQA when it adopted a $257 billion regional transportation plan in 2011. The ruling expressly invalidated the certification of the Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) on the grounds that the EIR should have analyzed the plan’s consistency with the governor’s policy goal to reduce GHG emissions by 80% by 2050 as articulated in the 2005 Executive Order S-03-05. On November 24, 2014, the Fourth Appellate District upheld the trial court in a published decision, and SANDAG appealed to the State Supreme Court. On July 13, 2017, the Supreme Court reversed and held that SANDAG’s decision to not adopt the 2050 goal was not an abuse of discretion. Nevertheless, the Court articulated three clear principles for agencies to follow in their CEQA review of planning documents: 1) agencies must take seriously the significance of even small increases in GHG emissions; 2) they must consider science-based State policy guidance in their decision-making; and 3) they are required to use the best scientific information available to determine whether their planning decisions are consistent with the State’s goals. These principles will apply to SMUD in CEQA reviews of future projects.

On September 29, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law Senate Bill 1368 (“SB 1368”), the GHG Emissions Performance Standard (“EPS”). SB 1368 limits long-term investments in baseload generation by the State’s utilities to power plants that meet an EPS jointly established by the CEC and the CPUC. The agencies have set the EPS at 1,100 pounds CO2 per MWh, which is roughly half of the CO2 emissions rate of a conventional coal-fired power plant. CEC regulations to implement the law for POUs were approved by the Office of Administrative Law on October 16, 2007.

SMUD’s primary supply and demand-side resources need to meet customers’ electric usage patterns over the next 10 years. Currently there is a ban in the State that prohibits the development of nuclear power plants until there is a permanent storage solution for spent fuel rods. With the effective ban on new coal power imports under SB 1368, natural gas-fired, combined cycle power plants would appear

to be the primary viable option for fossil fuel-based baseload power plant development absent the implementation of new technologies in connection with other resource options. The reliance on a single fuel source will continue to put pressure on the natural gas market in the United States. SMUD has in place a natural gas procurement plan to mitigate natural gas volatility, see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply” above.

On September 16, 2022, the Governor of the State signed into law SB 1020, which creates interim climate targets under which eligible renewable energy resources and zero-carbon resources must supply 90% of all retail sales of electricity to California end-use customers by December 31, 2035, and 95% by December 31, 2040. The bill also requires each State agency to ensure that zero carbon resources and eligible renewable energy resources supply 100% of electricity procured on its behalf by December 31, 2035. SMUD provides electricity to a number of State agency buildings and will work with State agencies to comply with this requirement.

On October 7, 2023, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 1305, which requires an entity that purchases or uses voluntary carbon offsets and makes claims regarding the achievement of net zero, or other similar claims, to disclose on their website specified information. Many stakeholder groups are raising questions on if this includes RECs. Clean-up legislation could follow. It is not clear at this time whether RECs are included.

Reliability. On June 30, 2022, the Governor signed the 2022-23 budget, along with a number of trailer bills, which provide implementing details on the budget line items. Included in AB 205, the energy trailer bill, are a number of reliability programs.

1. CEC Distributed Electricity Backup Assets Program to increase the development of cleaner and more efficient distributed energy assets that would serve as on-call emergency supply or load reduction for the state’s electrical grid during extreme events. The CEC adopted program guidelines in October 2023 and issued the first solicitation in December 2023.

2. CEC Demand Side Grid Support Program to pay customers to reduce demand during stressed grid events. SMUD has actively engaged the CEC on the development and subsequent revision of program guidelines. The CEC is expected to revise the guidelines again for summer 2024.

3. DWR Strategic Reliability Reserve to secure resources for summer reliability or to preserve the option to extend the life of facilities that otherwise would retire, new temporary generators of more than five MW, new energy storage systems of at least 20 MW, generation facilities that use clean, zero-emission fuel technologies, or new zero-emission technologies that can be operational by December 31, 2026.

As a follow up to this legislation, the Governor signed into law AB 1373. The bill authorizes the CEC to annually assess a capacity payment on a POU within the CAISO balancing authority area during a month in which the POU fails to meet its minimum planning reserve margin. This does not include SMUD, who is within the BANC balancing authority area. SMUD is, however, required to submit to the CEC an assessment of whether it exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin and system resource adequacy requirements. This bill also allows the DWR, for certain types of long-development projects, to act as a central procurement entity. For POUs, participation in the DWR program would be optional.

Zero-Emission Fleet Mandates. CARB has adopted the Advanced Clean Fleets (“ACF”) regulation, requiring certain medium- and heavy-duty (“MHD”) vehicle fleets to transition to zero-emission vehicles through purchase requirements or fleet composition requirements, which took effect on November

A-70
<!-- Page 961 -->
1, 2023, and applies to all publicly owned MHD fleets, larger commercially owned MHD fleets, and drayage trucks. Under the ACF Rule, public fleets like SMUD have two compliance options. The first is a zero-emission vehicle (“ZEV”) purchase requirement, under which 50% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2024, and 100% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2027. The second is an optional ZEV milestone option, under which the composition of the MHD fleet would need to meet certain ZEV percentages starting in 2025, with the entire fleet transitioned no later than 2042. The individual milestones depend on the number and category of vehicles in the fleet. Public fleets may opt into the ZEV milestone option until January 1, 2030. In 2024, SMUD plans to comply with the purchase requirement option, meaning that 50% of the MHD vehicles purchased in 2024 will be ZEVs. SMUD plans to monitor ZEV market developments and currently expects to opt into the ZEV milestone option as more ZEVs become available. The ACF Rule also accelerates a manufacturer ZEV sales requirement to 100% of all MHD truck sales by the 2036 model year.

CARB proposed the Zero-Emission Forklift regulation in November 2023. The regulation would require forklift fleets to transition spark-ignited forklifts to zero-emission technology starting in 2026. The regulation would apply to SMUD, as a forklift operator. Since SMUD has a limited number of forklifts, this regulation is not expected to have a material effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operation.

Transportation and Building Electrification. In recent years, the State has identified transportation and building electrification as key strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, and is advancing policy to support or accelerate electrification. For example, in addition to the zero-emission fleet mandates and LCFS regulation discussed herein, CARB adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks regulations to require vehicle manufacturers to increase sales of zero-emission vehicles, respectively. The CEC’s Building Energy Efficiency Standards are also encouraging the use of electric heat pumps in new homes and certain non-residential buildings across the state. The draft 2025 Energy Standards, which are expected to be proposed by April 2024 and adopted by August 2024, would establish prescriptive heat pump requirements for both space and water heating in new homes, and may require existing homes to install a heat pump when replacing an air conditioner. The 2025 Energy Standards, if approved, would take effect on January 1, 2025. In addition, the State has also provided funding for programs to encourage clean transportation and building electrification.

Increases in transportation and building electrification will result in increased customer usage of electricity.

Renewables Portfolio Standard. Senate Bill 100 was passed by the Legislature and approved by Governor Brown on September 10, 2018. Among other requirements, the bill sets a 50% RPS target for 2026 and sets compliance period targets at 44% by December 31, 2024, 52% by December 31, 2027, and 60% by December 31, 2030. The bill also creates a statewide planning goal to meet all of the state’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045.

Sacramento-San Joaquin River Bay-Delta Processes. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is an expansive inland estuary, formed at the western edge of the California Central Valley by the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers (“Delta”). There are two substantial Delta planning processes with the potential to affect (1) energy available for SMUD’s purchase from the Central Valley Project (“CVP”) and (2) flows within the Upper American River watershed. These processes are called the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan (“Bay-Delta Plan”) and the Delta Conveyance Project.

The Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan is updated periodically by the State Water Resources Control Board (“SWRCB”), the last time being in 2006. The current Bay-Delta Plan update process is being implemented in four phases. The first phase considered southern Delta water quality, with a

A-71
<!-- Page 962 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+not+available)  
significant focus on San Joaquin River tributaries. Phase 2, which is initially being addressed by a document under development by SWRCB staff, will address Sacramento River tributaries and various flow related issues, including the critically important one of those tributaries’ contribution to Delta outflow. Phase 3 will concern changes to water rights needed to implement Phase 2. A substantial change in Delta outflow requirements could have a major impact on the timing of hydroelectric energy generation by the CVP. SMUD has a long-term agreement with WAPA to purchase some of this power (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration”). On July 18, 2018, the SWRCB released an updated Framework document signaling its staff’s intent to propose Delta outflow requirements of 45-65% unimpaired flows for the Sacramento River tributaries (which includes the American River, the upper portions of which are where the AQR sits), though the report will analyze requirements of 35-75%. If these criteria were implemented, they could cut CVP generation by 50 to 63%. Governor Newsom has urged the SWRCB, other agencies and affected parties to execute voluntary agreements (aka the “Healthy Rivers Agreements”) to address species’ needs and outflow requirements. Although the negotiations have been slow, it is expected they will eventually result in a reasonable compromise. However, in September 2023 the SWRCB released a Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document in Support of Potential Updates to the Bay-Delta Plan (the “Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document”) to justify the adoption of the unimpaired flow standard as set forth in the 2018 Framework document. Numerous public entities, including SMUD, filed comments stating that, among other things, the potential updates identified in the Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document, if adopted, would violate the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act and Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution, would not protect fish and wildlife, and would not reasonably protect all beneficial uses, including water supplies for millions of Californians and hydroelectric power generation that is essential to California’s resilient energy grid. Moreover, the comments filed also stated that the Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document has not complied with CEQA because, among other things, the analysis of the proposed information and hydroelectric power generation’s benefits, including generally electrical grid reliability, is not supported by substantial evidence and fails to satisfy informational requirements. In addition, the comments maintain that the Healthy Rivers Agreements are a superior approach to achieving the goal of maximizing both environmental and other beneficial uses. If the unimpaired flow standard is adopted and the Healthy Rivers Agreements do not come to fruition, SMUD plans to fully participate in all regulatory and legal proceedings to argue for consideration and minimization of impacts to hydropower generation. SMUD will assess the potential impacts of proposed modifications to the present outflow objectives on SMUD’s operations once, or if, the SWRCB makes available information with enough specificity for SMUD to conduct the relevant modeling.

In July 2022, the DWR released a Draft Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) to evaluate the potential impacts of carrying out the Delta Conveyance Project; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a separate Environmental Impact Statement to evaluate the effects of the project pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. The Delta Conveyance Project is expected to entail construction of two intakes on the Sacramento River that will carry water to a main tunnel to the California Aqueduct for delivery south of the Delta. The Delta Conveyance Project may pose the potential to exacerbate impacts to already imperiled aquatic species, and in turn could have indirectly prompted regulatory agencies to require third parties, such as SMUD, to compensate by making changes to their operations. The Bureau of Reclamation is not a party to the Delta Conveyance Project, which should eliminate the potential for CVP power to be used to supply Delta Conveyance Project pumps. SMUD will monitor the proceedings and participate as necessary to ensure any impacts to SMUD interests are minimized, including potentially filing a challenge to the water rights DWR would need to modify in order to carry out the project.

Proposition 26. Proposition 26 was approved by the electorate on November 2, 2010 and amends Article XIII A and Article XIII C of the State Constitution. Proposition 26 imposes a two-thirds voter approval requirement for the imposition of fees and charges by the State, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. It also imposes a majority voter approval requirement on local governments with  
A-72
<!-- Page 963 -->
![Image](https://example.com/image.png)

**A-73**

**respect to fees and charges for general purposes, and a two-thirds voter approval requirement with respect to fees and charges for special purposes, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. The initiative, according to its supporters, is intended to prevent the circumvention of tax limitations imposed by the voters pursuant to Proposition 13, approved in 1978, and other measures through the use of non-tax fees and charges. Proposition 26 expressly excludes from its scope a charge imposed for a specific local government service or product provided directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable cost to the local government of providing the service or product. Proposition 26 is not retroactive as applied to local governments. Although SMUD believes that the initiative was not intended to apply to fees for utility services such as those charged by SMUD and its fees and charges meet the criteria of the exclusion described above, it is possible that Proposition 26 could be interpreted to further limit fees and charges for electric utility services and/or require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes. SMUD is unable to predict at this time how Proposition 26 will be interpreted by the courts or what its ultimate impact will be. As of the date of this Official Statement, SMUD is unaware of any fees or charges relating to SMUD’s service that would have to be reduced or eliminated because of Proposition 26. However, certain of SMUD’s adopted rate increases have been challenged. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”**

**Initiative 1935.** A voter initiative entitled “The Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act” (“Initiative 1935”) has been determined to be eligible for the State’s November 2024 statewide general election and, unless withdrawn by its proponent prior to June 27, 2024, will be certified as qualified for the ballot in such election. Were it to be approved by a majority of voters in the election, Initiative 1935 would amend Article XIII C of the State Constitution to, among other things, provide that charges (or increases in charges) imposed or extended by a local government after January 1, 2022 for services or products provided directly to the payor (including, potentially, fees and charges for electric service or product) are “taxes” subject to voter approval unless the local government can provide convincing evidence that the charge is reasonable and does not exceed the “actual cost” of providing the service or product. Initiative 1935 defines “actual cost” as “(i) the minimum amount necessary to reimburse the government for the cost of providing the service or the product to the payor and (ii) where the amount charged is not used by the government for any purpose other than reimbursing that cost.” Initiative 1935 would also require that local governments impose fees and charges by ordinance (which may be subject to judicial review). If adopted, Initiative 1935 would be subject to judicial interpretation. SMUD is unable to predict whether and how Initiative 1935, if approved, would be interpreted or applied, but it is possible any such interpretation or application could further limit future fees and charges or further increase in fees and charges for electric utility services, require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes and/or otherwise adversely impact SMUD and its revenues. In response to an emergency petition filed by Governor Gavin Newsom, with support from the League of California Cities and others, the California Supreme Court has unanimously agreed to decide whether the initiative should appear on the November 2024 ballot or be disqualified. A ruling is expected before June 30, 2024, which is the deadline for placing items on the November 2024 ballot.**

**On November 2, 2023, Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 13 (“ACA 13”) was filed with the Secretary of State and will be on the ballot for the November 2024 statewide general election. If approved by voters, ACA 13 would require any initiative constitutional amendment appearing on the ballot on or after January 1, 2024, that would increase the voter approval requirement to adopt any State or local measure to be approved by the highest voter approval requirement that the initiative measure would impose. In other words, if ACA 13 is approved by voters, its express terms appear to require Initiative 1935 to pass with a 2/3 vote, since Initiative 1935 would extend a 2/3 voter requirement to additional State and local fees and charges. If adopted, ACA 13 and its effect on the adoption of Initiative 1935, if applicable, are likely to be subject to judicial interpretation. SMUD is not able to predict whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would be interpreted or applied or whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would affect the adoption, interpretation or application of Initiative 1935, if adopted.**

![Wildfire Legislation](https://example.com/image-url)

**Wildfire Legislation.** In response to catastrophic wildfires in California, legislation was adopted and signed into law requiring POUs (including SMUD), IOUs, and electrical cooperatives to construct, maintain and operate their electrical lines and equipment in a manner that will minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire posed by electrical lines and equipment. Senate Bill 247 (“SB 247”), signed by Governor Newsom on October 2, 2019, establishes notification, audit and reporting guidelines for electrical corporations relating to vegetation management requirements in the wildfire mitigation plan. SB 247 also specifies the qualifications for electrical line clearance tree trimmers performing work to comply with the vegetation management requirements in an electrical corporation’s wildfire mitigation plan and requires that qualified line clearance tree trimmers be paid no less than a specified prevailing wage rate. POUs are not required to adhere to SB 247, but the market impacts are projected to significantly increase SMUD’s annual vegetation management costs.

**Nonstock Security.** SMUD sponsored legislation in 2019, Assembly Bill 689, which was signed into law by Governor Newsom on September 5, 2019. This bill expressly allows SMUD the ability to operate a pilot project (effective January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2025), of up to three acquisitions, to hold nonstock security in a corporation or other private entity if acquired as part of a procurement of goods or services from that entity, provided that no separate funding is expended solely for the nonstock security. This will allow SMUD to realize the financial benefits of its investments, partnerships, and intellectual property.

On September 15, 2022, the Board authorized the CEO & GM to enter into a joint collaboration agreement with ESS Tech, Inc. (“ESS”). Under that agreement SMUD would procure from ESS in flow batteries for utility scale long-duration energy storage applications. The agreement contemplates a multi-year phased deployment of up to 200MW/2GWh of long duration energy storage by 2028. As part of this procurement, SMUD acquired nonstock security in ESS.

SMUD will be sponsoring legislation in 2024 to extend the authority granted by Assembly Bill 689 to future years.

**Future Regulation**

The electric industry is subject to continuing legislative and administrative reform. States and Federal entities routinely consider changes to the way in which they regulate the electric industry. Recently, both further deregulation and forms of additional regulation have been proposed for the industry, which has been highly regulated throughout its history. SMUD is unable to predict at this time the impact any such proposals will have on the operations and finances of SMUD or the electric utility industry generally.

**OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY**

**CAISO Market Initiatives**

The CAISO routinely conducts a number of initiatives and stakeholder processes that propose certain operational and market changes that impact SMUD. SMUD does and will continue to monitor the various initiatives proposed by the CAISO and participate in its stakeholder processes to ensure that its interests are protected.

SMUD participates in the CAISO market for only a small percentage of energy needs, however, it continues to benefit from its participation in the CAISO’s WEIM and is currently exploring further participation in the CAISO’s proposed Extended Day Ahead Market (“EDAM”) (both the WEIM and EDAM are described further below). Along with monitoring other key market initiatives at the CAISO which impact wholesale energy markets, SMUD will continue to actively participate in all processes related

A-74
<!-- Page 965 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

to EIM and EDAM, to ensure both participation models are beneficial to SMUD’s customers. Given its success in EIM and active engagement with the CAISO and CAISO leadership, SMUD has earned a key role in the stakeholder processes related to these important and evolving markets.

**Resource Adequacy Filing**

In September 2005, the State Legislature enacted and the Governor signed into law Assembly Bill 380 (“AB 380”), which requires the CPUC to establish resource adequacy requirements for all LSEs within the CPUC’s jurisdiction. SMUD is not an LSE subject to the CPUC’s jurisdiction. In 2005, the CPUC issued a decision requiring jurisdictional LSEs to demonstrate that they have acquired capacity sufficient to serve their forecast retail customer load plus a minimum 15% planning reserve margin. In June 2022, the CPUC issued a decision increasing the minimum planning reserve margin to 16% for 2023 and 17% for 2024. In June 2023, the CPUC kept the minimum planning reserve margin at 17% for 2024 and extended the 17% requirement for 2025.

AB 380 also required publicly owned utilities, including SMUD, to meet the most recent resource adequacy standard as adopted by the WECC. The WECC has yet to formally adopt a resource adequacy requirement. However, consistent with current WECC practices, SMUD utilizes a minimum 15% planning reserve margin when assessing the need for future resources. For summer 2023, SMUD attained a 17% planning reserve margin and will have at least a 17% planning reserve margin for summer 2024 as well.

In 2022, the State Legislature adopted Assembly Bill 209 (2022) (“AB 209”), which requires the CEC to develop recommendations about approaches to determining an appropriate planning reserve margin for local publicly owned utilities within the CAISO balancing authority area. The CEC has initiated a proceeding and plans to publish a report with a recommended methodology in summer 2024. The report will not directly impact SMUD since SMUD is not in the CAISO; nevertheless, SMUD is monitoring the proceeding. The State Legislature also passed Assembly Bill 1373 (2023) (“AB 1373”) that requires the CEC to submit a report to the Legislature that assesses whether each local publicly owned electric utility in California (both inside and outside the CAISO) exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin for 2023. The report must also assess whether local publicly owned utilities met the planning reserve margin for June through September 2023 established by the CPUC’s June 2022 decision (i.e., 16%). See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Reliability.”

While SMUD believes the CEC’s report will show SMUD met both its 15% planning reserve margin and the CPUC’s 16% planning reserve margin for 2023, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the report, or what the Legislature intends to do with the report. To the extent the CEC or Legislature imposes a higher POU planning reserve margin for future years that includes SMUD, the ultimate impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy/capacity, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers; however, such impacts could be material.

**Western Energy Imbalance Market and Extended Day Ahead Market**

Federal and state policymakers have long-promoted the development of organized markets in the west as a means (among other reasons) to better integrate intermittent renewable resources into the electric system, the first of which markets is the Western EIM, operated by the CAISO. The CAISO successfully launched the WEIM, a real time only imbalance market, on October 1, 2014, with PacifiCorp as the first participant. Since this time, the WEIM has grown significantly with the addition of 21 other Balancing

to sell to nongovernmental entities electricity from generation projects and transmission service from transmission line projects financed with tax exempt obligations; (i) effects of inflation on the operating and maintenance costs of an electric utility and its facilities; (j) changes from projected future load requirements; (k) increases in costs and uncertain availability of capital; (l) issues relating to supply chains and the uncertain availability or increased costs of necessary materials; (m) shifts in the availability and relative costs of different fuels (including the cost of natural gas); (n) sudden and dramatic increases in the price of energy purchased on the open market that may occur at times of high peak demand in an area of the country experiencing such high peak demand, such as has occurred in the State; (o) issues relating to risk management procedures and practices with respect to, among other things, the purchase and sale of natural gas, energy and transmission capacity; (p) other legislative changes, voter initiatives, referenda and statewide propositions; (q) effects of changes in the economy; (r) effects of possible manipulation of the electric markets; (s) natural disasters or other physical calamities, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, droughts, severe weather, wildfires and floods; (t) changes to the climate, including increasing volatility in rainfall in the Western United States and a reduction in the depth and duration of the Sierra snowpack; (u) issues relating to cyber-security; and (v) outbreaks of infectious diseases or the occurrence of pandemics. Any of these factors (as well as other factors) could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of any given electric utility, including SMUD’s electric utility, and likely will affect individual utilities in different ways.

SMUD is unable to predict what impact such factors will have on the business operations and financial condition of SMUD’s electric system, but the impact could be significant. SMUD has taken major steps to mitigate the impacts of many of the changes. This Official Statement includes a brief discussion of certain of these factors. This discussion does not purport to be comprehensive or definitive, and matters are subject to change subsequent to the date hereof. Extensive information on the electric utility industry is available from the legislative and regulatory sources and other sources in the public domain, and potential purchasers of any of SMUD’s Senior Bonds or Subordinated Bonds described in the forepart of this Official Statement should obtain and review such information.

## PROPOSED FORM OF OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL

[Closing Date]

Northern California Energy Authority  
Sacramento, California  

Northern California Energy Authority  
Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as bond counsel to the Northern California Energy Authority (the “Issuer”) in connection with issuance of $__________ aggregate principal amount of Northern California Energy Authority Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024 (the “Bonds”), issued pursuant to an amended and restated trust indenture, dated as of __________, 2024 (the “Trust Indenture”), between the Issuer and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association), as trustee (the “Trustee”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Trust Indenture.

In such connection, we have reviewed the Trust Indenture; the Commodity Purchase Agreement; the Commodity Supply Contract; the ISDA Master Agreement dated as of December 10, 2018, the Amended & Restated Schedule, dated as of __________, 2024, and the Amended and Restated Confirmation thereto, dated __________, 2024 (collectively, the “Issuer Commodity Swap”); each between the Issuer and Royal Bank of Canada (the “Commodity Swap Counterparty”); the ISDA Master Agreement dated as of December 10, 2018, the Amended & Restated Schedule, dated as of __________, 2024, the Amended & Restated Credit Support Annex, dated as of __________, 2024, and the Amended & Restated Confirmation thereto, dated __________, 2024 (collectively, the “Supplier Commodity Swap”); each between the Commodity Swap Counterparty; the Tax Certificate and the dated hereof (the “Tax Certificate”); between the Issuer and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”); opinions of counsel to the Issuer, the Trustee and SMUD; certificates of the Issuer, the Trustee, SMUD and others; and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after the date hereof. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to our attention after the date hereof. Accordingly, this letter speaks only as of its date and is not intended to, and may not be relied upon or otherwise used in connection with any such actions, events or matters. Our engagement with respect to the Bonds has concluded with their issuance, and we disclaim any obligation to update this letter. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures presented to us (whether as originals or as copies) and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than the Issuer. We have assumed, without undertaking to verify, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents and the legal conclusions contained in the opinions, referred to in the second paragraph hereof. Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in the Trust Indenture, the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract, the Issuer Commodity Swap, the Supplier Commodity Swap and the Tax Certificate, including (without limitation) covenants and agreements compliance with which is necessary to assure that future actions, omissions or events will not cause interest on the Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax.

purposes. We call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the Bonds, the Trust Indenture, the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract, the Issuer Commodity Swap, the Supplier Commodity Swap and the Tax Certificate and their enforceability may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against joint powers authorities and municipal utility districts in the State of California. We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any opinion with respect to the state or quality of title to or interest in any of the assets described in or as subject to the lien of the Trust Indenture or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description contained therein or, of the remedies available to enforce liens on, any such assets. Our services did not include financial or other non-legal advice. Finally, we undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Official Statement or other offering material relating to the Bonds and express no opinion with respect thereto.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the following opinions:

1. The Bonds constitute the valid and binding limited obligations of the Issuer.

2. The Trust Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by, and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of, the Issuer. The Trust Indenture creates the valid pledge which it purports to create of the revenues, moneys, securities and funds comprising the Trust Estate pledged under the Trust Indenture, subject only to the provisions of the Trust Indenture permitting the application thereof for the purposes and on the terms

3. Interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax. We observe that interest on the Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds.

Faithfully yours,

ORRICK, HERRINGTON & SUTCLIFFE LLP

# APPENDIX G

## BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM

The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), New York, New York, will act as securities depository for the Bonds. The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered bond certificate will be issued for each maturity of the Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC. If, however, the aggregate principal amount of any maturity of the Bonds exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each $500 million of principal amount and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of such maturity.

DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA-. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.

Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Bond (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.

**G-2**  

Representative of DTC. The deposit of Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership.  

DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.  

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to take certain steps to augment transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Bond documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request that copies of the notices be provided directly to them.  

Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within a maturity of the Bonds are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such maturity to be redeemed.  

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the issuer of securities as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).  

Redemption proceeds and payments of principal and interest on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from NCEA or the Trustee on the payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, NCEA or the Trustee, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds and principal and interest to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of NCEA or the Trustee, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.  

DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Bonds at any time by giving reasonable notice to NCEA or the Trustee. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered.
<!-- Page 975 -->
NCEA may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered to DTC.

The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that NCEA believes to be reliable, but NCEA takes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.

SECTION 2. OFFICIAL STATEMENT; COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 15c2-12.

(a) The Issuer hereby confirms that it has “deemed final” as of its date of the Preliminary Official Statement, dated ________, 2024, relating to the Bonds (the “Preliminary Official Statement”) for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 15c2-12 (“Rule 15c2-12”) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except for the omission of only such material as is permitted by such paragraph.

(b) Within seven business days after the execution of this Purchase Contract (but in any event not less than two business days prior to the date of Closing), the Issuer shall prepare and deliver to the Underwriter a final Official Statement of the Issuer relating to the Bonds executed by the Issuer as indicated thereon, such Official Statement to be in the substantially the same form as the Preliminary Official Statement with such changes as shall be necessary to complete such form and such other changes as may be approved by the Underwriter (such document, including the cover page, inside front cover and Appendices attached thereto, is referred to herein as the “Official Statement”). The Issuer shall, as soon as practicable, but not later than ________, 2024, deliver to the Underwriter as many printed, conformed copies of the Official Statement as the Underwriter shall advise the Issuer are necessary to permit the Underwriter to comply with the requirements of Rule 15c2-12 and the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the “MSRB”). In addition, the Issuer will provide, subject to customary disclaimers regarding the transmission of electronic copies, an electronic copy of the final Official Statement to the Underwriter in the currently required designated electronic format stated in MSRB Rule G-32 and the EMMA Dataport Manual (as defined below).

(c) Each party hereto agrees that it will notify the other parties hereto if, within the period from the date of this Purchase Contract to and including the date which is 25 days following the End of the Underwriting Period (defined below), such party discovers any pre-existing or subsequent fact or becomes aware of the occurrence of any event, in any such case, which might cause the Official Statement (as the same may have been supplemented or amended) to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriter, the preparation and publication of a supplement or amendment to the Official Statement is, as a result of such fact or event (or any other event which becomes known to the Issuer or the Underwriter during such period), necessary so that the Official Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and furnish a sufficient number of copies of such supplement or amendment to the Underwriter as is required for the Underwriter to comply with its obligations imposed by the SEC and the MSRB.

If the Issuer has been given notice pursuant to the preceding sentence that the “End of the Underwriting Period” will not occur on the Closing Date, the Underwriter agrees to notify the Issuer in writing of the day it does occur as soon as practicable following the “End of the Underwriting Period” for all purposes of Rule 15c2-12; provided, however, that if the Underwriter has not otherwise so notified the Issuer of the “End of the Underwriting Period” by the 180th day after the Closing Date, then the “End of the Underwriting Period” shall be deemed to occur on such 180th day after the Closing Date, unless otherwise agreed to by the Issuer.

(e) At any time prior to the End of the Underwriting Period, the Underwriter may from time to time request, and, if such request is made, the Issuer shall deliver to the Underwriter as soon as practicable thereafter, a certificate of the Issuer signed by an Authorized Officer in the form set forth as Exhibit E hereto, dated a date (and speaking as of such date) not earlier than the -3-

(f) In connection with any amendments or supplements to the Official Statement that are made pursuant to Section 2(c) hereof, the Underwriter may request and the Issuer hereby agrees that it will provide such additional certificates and opinions of counsel as the Underwriter shall reasonably deem necessary to evidence the accuracy and completeness of the Official Statement, as so amended or supplemented.

-15-
<!-- Page 994 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

interests that differ from those of the Issuer; (ii) the Underwriter is not acting as a municipal advisor, financial advisor, or fiduciary to the Issuer and has not assumed any advisory or fiduciary responsibility to the Issuer with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby and the discussions, undertakings and procedures leading thereto (irrespective of whether the Underwriter has provided other services or is currently providing other services to the Issuer on other matters); (iii) the only obligations the Underwriter has to the Issuer with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby expressly are set forth in this Purchase Contract, provided that nothing in this Purchase Contract shall be construed to limit the Underwriter’s obligation of fair dealing under MSRB Rule G-17; and (iv) the Issuer has consulted its own financial and/or municipal, legal, accounting, tax and other advisors, as applicable, to the extent it deems appropriate. If the Issuer would like a municipal advisor in this transaction that has legal fiduciary duties to the Issuer, then the Issuer is free to engage a municipal advisor to serve in that capacity.

SECTION 12. ESTABLISHMENT OF PRICE.

(a) The Underwriter agrees to assist the Issuer in establishing the issue price of the Bonds and shall execute and deliver to the Issuer at Closing an “issue price” or similar certificate, together with the supporting pricing wires or equivalent communications, in such form as may be appropriate or necessary, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriter, the Issuer and Bond Counsel, to accurately reflect, as applicable, the sales price or prices or the initial offering price or prices to the public of the Bonds.

(b) The Issuer will treat the first price at which 10% of each maturity of the Bonds (the “10% test”) is sold to the public as the issue price of that maturity (if different interest rates apply within a maturity, each separate CUSIP number within that maturity will be subject to the 10% test). At or promptly after the execution of this Purchase Contract, the Underwriter shall report to the Issuer the price or prices at which it has sold to the public each maturity of Bonds. If at that time the 10% test has not been satisfied as to any maturity of the Bonds, the Underwriter agrees to promptly report to the Issuer the prices at which it sells the unsold Bonds of that maturity to the public. That reporting obligation shall continue, whether or not the Closing Date has occurred, until the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity or until all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public.

(c) The Underwriter confirms that it has offered the Bonds to the public on or before the date of this Purchase Contract at the offering price or prices (the “initial offering price”), or at the corresponding yield or yields, set forth in Schedule I.

(d) The Underwriter confirms that there is no selling group agreement or retail distribution agreement relating to the initial sale of the Bonds.
<!-- Page 995 -->
(e) The Underwriter acknowledges that sales of any Bonds to any person that is a related party to the Underwriter shall not constitute sales to the public for purposes of this section. Further, for purposes of this section:

(ii) “underwriter” means (A) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract with the Issuer (or with the lead underwriter to form an underwriting syndicate) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public and (B) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract directly or indirectly with a person described in clause (A) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (including a member of a selling group or a party to a retail distribution agreement participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public),

(iii) a purchaser of any of the Bonds is a “related party” to the Underwriter if the Underwriter and the purchaser are subject, directly or indirectly, to (i) at least 50% common ownership of the voting power or the total value of their stock, if both entities are corporations (including direct ownership by one corporation of another), (ii) more than 50% common ownership of their capital interests or profits interests, if both entities are partnerships (including direct ownership by one partnership of another), or (iii) more than 50% common ownership of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation or the capital interests or profit interests of the partnership, as applicable, if one entity is a corporation and the other entity is a partnership (including direct ownership of the applicable stock or interests by one entity of the other), and

The Bonds are being issued pursuant to an amended and restated trust indenture, dated as of [____] 1, 2024 (the “Trust Indenture”), between the Issuer and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Trust Indenture or, if not defined in the Trust Indenture, in the Purchase Contract.

We have delivered our final legal opinion (the “Bond Opinion”) as bond counsel to the Issuer concerning the validity of the Bonds and certain other matters, dated the date hereof and addressed to the Issuer. You may rely on such opinion as though the same were addressed to you.

In connection with our role as bond counsel to the Issuer, we have reviewed the Purchase Contract; the Trust Indenture; the Commodity Purchase Agreement; the Commodity Supply Contract; the Tax Certificate and Agreement, dated the date hereof (the “Tax Certificate”), between the Issuer and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”); certain portions of the preliminary official statement of the Issuer, dated ____, 2024, with respect to the Bonds (the “Preliminary Official Statement”) and the official statement of the Issuer, dated [Pricing Date], 2024, with respect to the Bonds (the “Official Statement”); opinions of counsel to the Issuer, the Trustee and SMUD; certificates of the Issuer, the Trustee, SMUD and others; and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to provide the opinions or conclusions set forth herein.

The opinions and conclusions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions or conclusions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after the date hereof. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to our attention after the date hereof. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures.

**FORM OF OPINION OF GENERAL COUNSEL TO THE ISSUER**

[Closing Date], 2024

To the Addressees on  
Schedule I attached hereto

I have acted as general counsel to Northern California Energy Authority (the “Issuer”) in connection with its issuance of $000,000,000 Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024 (the “Bonds”). This opinion is rendered pursuant to Section 8(e)(12) of the Bond Purchase Contract, dated [Pricing Date], 2024 (the “Bond Purchase Contract”), by and between Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (the “Underwriter”) and the Issuer. Capitalized terms used and not defined in this opinion shall have the same meanings assigned to them in the Bond Purchase Contract.

In rendering this opinion, I have examined originals or copies satisfactory to me of such records and other documents as I have deemed necessary and relevant as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In my examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, and the conformity of all original documents submitted to me as copies.

In giving the opinions expressed below I do not purport to be expert in or generally familiar with or qualified to express legal opinions based on the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of California (the “State”).

As to factual matters, I have relied solely upon the documents described herein, the representations and warranties of the Issuer contained in the Issuer Documents, the Preliminary Official Statement, the Official Statement, the JPA Agreement of the Issuer and various certificates and other documents furnished to me by Issuer’s officers and its Commission. In basing the opinions set forth in this letter on “my knowledge,” the words “my knowledge” signify that, in the course of my representation of the Issuer in connection with the issuance of the Bonds, no facts have come to my attention that would give me actual knowledge or actual notice that any such opinions or other matters are not accurate. Except as otherwise stated in this opinion, I have undertaken no investigation or verification of such matters.

Based upon the foregoing examination and review, I am of the opinion that:

1. The Issuer is a joint powers authority and public entity of the State of California, organized and existing pursuant to the provisions of the Joint Exercise of Powers Act, constituting Chapter 5 of Division 7 of Title 1 (commencing with Section 6500) of the California Government Code, as amended and supplemented (the
<!-- Page 1004 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image) 

“Act”), and a joint powers agreement, dated November 8, 2018 (the “JPA Agreement”), entered into between the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority, and has full legal right, power and authority under the Act and the JPA Agreement to (a) adopt the bond resolution adopted by it on __________, 2024 (the “Bond Resolution”), (b) execute and deliver the Official Statement, (c) enter into, execute and deliver the Issuer Documents, (d) sell, issue and deliver the Bonds to the Underwriter, and (e) carry out and consummate the transactions contemplated by the Issuer Documents and the Official Statement, and the Issuer has complied, and will at the Closing be in compliance in all respects, with the terms of the Act, the JPA Agreement and the Issuer Documents as they pertain to such transactions.

2. By all necessary official action, the Issuer has duly authorized all necessary action to be taken by it for (a) the adoption of the Bond Resolution, (b) the issuance and sale of the Bonds, (c) the approval, execution and delivery of, and the performance by the Issuer of the obligations on its part, contained in the Bonds and the Issuer Documents, and (d) the consummation by it of all other transactions contemplated by the Official Statement and the Issuer Documents.

3. The Bond Resolution was duly and validly adopted by the Issuer and all other proceedings pertinent to the validity and enforceability of the Bonds have been duly and validly adopted or undertaken in compliance with all applicable procedural requirements of the Issuer and in compliance with the Constitution and laws of the State, including the Act and the JPA Agreement, and the Bond Resolution is in full force and effect and has not been amended.

4. The Issuer Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer, and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their respective terms, except to the extent limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws and equitable principles of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights and to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against public entities in the State; and the Bonds, when issued, delivered and paid for, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and are enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other similar laws and principles of equity relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights and to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against public entities in the State; and upon the issuance, authentication and delivery of the Bonds as aforesaid, the Indenture will provide, for the benefit of the holders, from time to time of the Bonds and the Commodity Swap Counterparty the legally valid and binding pledge of and lien it purports to create as set forth therein.

5. The distribution of the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement has been duly authorized by the Issuer.

B-2
<!-- Page 1005 -->
6. All authorizations, approvals, licenses, permits, consents and orders of any governmental authority, legislative body, board, agency or commission having jurisdiction of the matter which are required for the due authorization of, which would constitute a condition precedent to, or the absence of which would materially adversely affect the due performance by the Issuer of its obligations under the Issuer Documents and the Bonds have been obtained.

7. To my knowledge as general counsel of the Issuer since its inception, there is no legislation, action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, at law or in equity, before or by any court, government agency, public board or body, pending or, to my knowledge, threatened against the Issuer, affecting the existence of the Issuer or the titles of its officers to their respective offices, or affecting or seeking to prohibit, restrain or enjoin the sale, issuance or delivery of the Bonds or the collection of the Revenues (as defined in the Indenture) pursuant to the Bond Resolution or the Indenture or in any way contesting or affecting the validity or enforceability of the Bonds or the Issuer Documents, or contesting the exclusion from gross income of interest on the Bonds for federal income tax purposes or contesting in any way the completeness or accuracy of the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement or any supplement or amendment thereto, or contesting the powers of the Issuer or any authority for the issuance of the Bonds, the adoption of the Bond Resolution or the execution and delivery of the Issuer Documents, nor, to my knowledge, is there any basis therefor, wherein an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding would materially adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Issuer Documents.

8. The execution and delivery of the Issuer Documents and compliance by the Issuer with the provisions thereof, under the circumstances contemplated herein and therein, will not conflict with or constitute on the part of the Issuer a material breach of or a default under any agreement or instrument to which the Issuer is a party, or violate any existing law, administrative regulation, court order, or consent decree to which the Issuer is subject.

9. To my knowledge, the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement under the captions “NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY,” “CONTINUING DISCLOSURE” and “LITIGATION” are true and accurate in all material respects.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, the foregoing opinion is expressly made subject to the following exceptions, qualifications, and assumptions:

(i) I express no opinion with respect to the validity or enforceability of any provisions of the Issuer Documents or any other documents concerning any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, or severability provisions contained therein.

B-3
<!-- Page 1006 -->
(ii) I express no opinion as to the enforceability of provisions waiving, directly or indirectly, expressly or impliedly, defenses to obligations or rights granted by law, where such waivers are prohibited by law or are against public policy.

(iii) I except from my opinion any provisions contained in any document which purport to prevent any party from raising an affirmative defense thereto, such as estoppel, illegality, etc., if such affirmative defense arises or is asserted to have arisen out of any action by any party which has not been brought to my attention, or which purports to prevent any party from raising a claim of fraud.

(iv) I except from my opinion any provisions contained in any of the documents which could be construed as waiving service of process or any applicable statute of limitations defense or which establish any rights to specific performance.

(v) My opinion as to enforceability is limited by standards of good faith, fair dealing, materiality, and reasonableness that may be applied by a court to the exercise of certain rights and remedies; limitations based on statutes or on public policy limiting a person’s right to waive the benefit of statutory provisions or of a common law right; and limitations releasing a party from or indemnifying a party against liability for its own wrongful or negligent act when such release or indemnification is contrary to public policy.

(vi) My opinion is limited to the matters stated herein and no opinion may be inferred or implied beyond the matters expressly stated herein. The opinions expressed in this letter are given solely for your use and benefit in connection with the transactions referred to herein and no other person may use or rely on this opinion letter, nor may it be used, relied upon or circulated or quoted in relation to any other transaction which is not related to transactions referred to herein, without my prior express written consent. This opinion is provided to you as a legal opinion only and not as a warranty or guarantee with respect to the matter described herein or in the documents referred to herein.

(vii) The scope of this opinion is limited to those issues and parties specifically considered herein and no further or more expansive opinion is implied or should be inferred from any opinion expressed herein. On such basis, any variation or difference in the facts upon which this opinion is based might affect my conclusions in an adverse manner and make them inaccurate.

2) **2024 Shine Awards.** It was great to join the Board before today’s meeting to honor the recipients of our 2024 Shine Awards. Since we began our Shine awards seven years ago, we have supported 145 nonprofit organizations for a total

day of the program, and thank you to Director Tamayo and Vice President Fishman were in attendance for the closing award ceremony. This is one of those unique programs that goes out into the community and educates them to make them aware of the great opportunities that IBEW and SMUD have on the jobs that pay extremely well. The Lineman Apprenticeship program starts pay at $45/hr, and when they graduate in five years, it is almost $80/hr. And, it is not just a job, it is a career that they can go to any city, after they become certified by IBEW, they can go to any city in the United States and get a job as a lineperson. So, this is something that we are very, very proud of. But, the thing that I am especially proud of is the excitement. I was there at the graduation, and the excitement those cohorts – one of them said, “I could see myself teaching here 10 years from now.” Two of the participants had their mom there, and she said, “I am going to make sure my son studies because now he knows how to climb, but he has got to pass math and written tests. So, I am going to make sure that my son studies and is well prepared for the test.” It was great to see the excitement and dedication. One of the female cohorts was still lifting crossarms, even after the program was over because she wanted to make sure she could actually hoist that crossarm 40 feet up in the air, and it is really gratifying to see the excitement of the cohorts but also I think Vice President spoke of the camaraderie that they were building with each other within just four weeks of working and getting training on the weekends. That is very remarkable. I was talking to Lou earlier, so hopefully this is a program that will not just happen in Sacramento, but it will be something that is replicated in the state and hopefully nationwide and hopefully this may also be just the first of its type for apprenticeship linemen, but we can
<!-- Page 1015 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/1265x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

also look at substations, working at network, and all of the wonderful careers you can have at IBEW and hopefully this is just the beginning of many, many programs to come to introduce all of those wonderful careers IBEW has in the electrical industry for all of the under resourced communities that traditionally would not have access or have even known about those jobs.

4) Awards. SMUD was honored with several awards this past month. We received a Silver Outage Operations Award from Chartwell for our innovative Storm Response Team initiative. As you know, after the storm last year, SMUD did a tremendous amount of work to improve how we manage outages, how we assess outages, to supply chain, to how we actually make sure the crews are here before the storm actually starts to making sure we have ample crews to respond to the forecast of what the storm damage is going to look like in the Sacramento region. We worked really hard last year not only in improving the way we respond but the way we communicate with the customers. You saw now on the SMUD website, there are multiple stages. You can report the outage, then we said we know about the outage, we are sending a crew to assess, a crew is on the way, and then now you are being repaired. So, we hard loud and clear from the Board and from our customers that when you have major storms like that, you really need to make sure you step it up on your communications with the customer, not just operations, but every step of the way to making sure that our customers are informed. We were also recently awarded Climate Registered™ Platinum status by The Climate Registry for our third-party verified greenhouse gas emissions reporting. The global environmental nonprofit CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) announced that we
<!-- Page 1016 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/1265x768.png?text=Document+Image)

were once again recognized for leadership with an A- score in its 2023 awards. CDP’s scoring process is recognized as the highest standard for corporate environmental transparency. Within our sector of thermal power generation, SMUD is among only 36% of companies that reached the leadership level. What huge accomplishments for SMUD. Congratulations to all! And, finally, on the topic of awards, I was humbled and honored to be recognized as a member of the Power 100 List by the Sacramento Business Journal this month in the local economic development category. Thank you to the Board for your constant support – of me, of staff and of our 2030 Clean Energy Vision.

5) **Board Video.** Tonight’s video is about “I am SMUD” – our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB) initiative to honor, educate, empower and encourage employees to share their own lived experiences with each other and connect with our work at SMUD.

6) **Utility Workers Appreciation Day.** I wanted to close by noting that I was honored to be invited to celebrate the California Utility Workers Appreciation Day, and SMUD was supportive of Assembly Bill 153 to mark March 14 every year to be California Utility Workers Appreciation Day. It was a great event. There were 300 people there, so IBEW 1245 and IBEW 1247 were there, and SMUD’s bucket truck was definitely a hit. In fact, there was such a long line, I decided not to get on the bucket truck. There was such excitement to see people learning about the trade IBEW has, and there were kids walking by – there were a lot of interactions. So, hopefully, next year – we are in talks with IBEW to work together again with them on that to make sure this will be a bigger event so middle schools, high schools, and different community organizations will come.
<!-- Page 1017 -->
```
celebrate and learn about the different careers IBEW have. Multiple state legislators there thanked the utility workers because they are the heroes; they are the first to respond and get out there, and we want to make sure that everyone recognizes the work they do.

President Herber requested the Summary of Board Direction, but there were no items.

No further business appearing, President Herber adjourned the meeting at 6:59 p.m. Approved:

- 2003 IRS Regulations allow for tax-exempt debt to be issued for the prepayment of natural gas/electricity to serve load
- Commodity supply agreement where buyer commits to purchase the commodity over a term, receiving a discount to the market price
- Cost of funding is lower than supplier would otherwise receive borrowing from taxable market or from using internal funding at their cost of capital
- Bond investor risk is tied to supplier and corporate guarantor (not SMUD) to make debt service payments and redeem bonds if termination events occur or bankruptcy

# Commodity Prepay Summary

- In 2018 Bonds were issued the Northern California Energy Authority (NCEA), to prepay for a 30-year supply of commodities  
  ➤ $0.48/dekatherm discount = $3 million annual commodity savings from 2019-2023

- The 2018 prepay bonds require repricing by July 2024  
  ➤ NCEA plans to issue up to $800 million of similar bonds this spring for a 6-year term that optimizes the savings that SMUD receives

- Current pricing indicates SMUD will save $3+ million annually on commodity costs from a $0.50-0.55/dekatherm discount

# Prepay Flexibility

**Flexibility to support SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan**

- Allows for a switch to renewables or biogas to align with resource plans or adapt to new technologies or regulatory changes
- Natural Gas is currently needed to support reliability and new technologies such as Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS)
- Reduces operating costs to help SMUD reach zero carbon by 2030
- Contractual provisions protect SMUD savings

**Board Policy:** Board-Staff Linkage BL-10, Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Real and Personal Property (Number & Title)  
**Benefits:** Service reliability and serve future load in the area by 2026.  
**Cost/Budgeted:** $1,910,965.00  

**Alternatives:** Four project alternatives were explored: 1) No project; 2) Rebuild existing Elverta Substation. The Substation would be non-operational for an extended amount of time; 3) North side of Elverta-Site would require extensive relocation of transmission line and renegotiations of Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) agreements that would jeopardize the construction schedule and would be at the discretion of the United States; and 4) South side of the existing Elverta Substation-WAPA is holding that land for their future use.

FROM: Kathy Ketchum / Lisa Limcaco  
DATE: March 29, 2024  
ACC 24-009  

**SUBJECT: FEBRUARY 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OPERATIONS DATA**

We are attaching the financial and operating reports for the two months of 2024. They include sales and generation statistics and other selected data.

The change in net position is an increase of $47.3 million compared to a budgeted decrease of $31.3 million, resulting in a favorable variance of $78.6 million.

We prepared these statements on the accrual basis of accounting, and they conform to generally accepted accounting principles. The bases for the budget amounts are:

1) Budgeted electric revenues are based on the Forecast of Revenues by the Pricing Department, adjusted for unbilled revenues; and

2) Budgeted operating expenses reflect the 2024 Budget approved by the Board of Directors on December 14, 2023.

**Net Position**
- The change in net position is an increase of $47.3 million compared to a budgeted decrease of $31.3 million, resulting in a favorable variance of $78.6 million.

**Revenues**
- Revenues from sales to customers were $227.4 million, which was $3.1 million lower than planned. The decrease is primarily due to:
  - Lower residential customer revenue of $5.5 million primarily due to lower customer usage.
  - Higher commercial sales of $1.7 million primarily due to higher customer usage.
  - Lower provision for uncollectible accounts of $0.5 million.
- Revenues under the California Global Warming Solutions Act (Assembly Bill [AB] – 32) were $10.4 million. This is due to carbon allowances sold through the state sanctioned quarterly auctions.
- Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) revenues were $2.1 million due to LCFS credit sales.
- Other electric revenues were higher due to higher transmission revenue, interconnection fees and Sacramento Power Academy revenue.
- Non-cash revenues transferred to the rate stabilization fund were $12.6 million, of which $10.4 million was for AB-32 and $2.1 million was for LCFS. AB-32 and LCFS funds are deferred until SMUD has qualified program expenses (projects that reduce carbon emissions or electric vehicle programs) to recognize revenue.
- Non-cash revenues transferred from the rate stabilization fund were $11.1 million, which is $8.8 million higher than plan. The increase is primarily due to $9.1 million of revenue recognized for AB-32 and $0.6 million of revenue recognized for LCFS.

**Commodities, Purchased Power, and Production**
- SMUD’s generation was lower by 149 GWh (10.7 percent); JPA and other generation was lower by 189 GWh (14.9 percent); and Hydro generation was higher by 40 GWh (32.3 percent).
- Purchased power expense of $53.9 million, less surplus power sales of $29.9 million, was $24.0 million, which was $1.6 million higher than planned. Due to favorable rates, year to date cost of purchased power is lower, whereas the quantity of purchased power is higher. In addition, lower market sales at lower prices are driving net purchased power higher.
- Production operations cost of $82.5 million, less surplus gas sales of $18.3 million, was $64.2 million, which was $14.5 million lower than planned.
  - Fuel costs of $61.6 million less surplus gas sales of $18.3 million, was $43.3 million, which was $12.8 million lower than planned. Thermal generation has decreased due to an unplanned outage at the Carson plant and it was more economic to replace with hydro generation and market purchases.
- The “power margin”, or sales to customers less cost of purchased power, production operations costs and gas hedges included in investment revenues was $140.8 million, which was $11.4 million higher than planned. The power margin as a percentage of sales to customers was 61.9 percent, which was 5.8 percent higher than planned. This is primarily due to lower production costs due to lower fuel costs offset by lower sales to customers.

**Other Operating Expenses**
- All other operating expenses were $162.8 million, which was $1.2 million higher than planned.
  - Transmission and distribution operations expenses were down $2.2 million primarily due to lower transmission fees as a result of using more hydro generation than plan.
  - Customer service and information expenses were down $1.8 million due to lower participation in My Energy Optimizer Partner and Peak Conserve programs, Program Managers’ charging less time than planned, and Shade Tree program moving out of Advanced Energy Solutions Portfolio.
  - Administrative & General expenses were down $2.3 million primarily due to a slower start to projects such as Agile product teams, SAP S4HANA, offset by higher administrative costs related to the February storm.
<!-- Page 1048 -->
- Public Good expenses were $2.6 million higher than planned primarily due to increased HVAC and rebate volume in the Advanced Homes Solutions program and Multi-Family Exist program. Also, increased building electrification programs and support.
- Production maintenance expenses were lower than planned due to shifting from planned maintenance to unplanned major repair at the Carson plant.
- Transmission and distribution maintenance expenses were $5.6 million higher than planned primarily due to higher costs related to the February storm response.
- Non-cash depreciation and amortization is higher by $2.1 million primarily due to higher amortization of software subscription assets.

Non-operating Revenues and Expenses
- Other revenue, net, was $58.3 million higher than planned primarily due to a business interruption insurance recovery payment of $51.4 million related to the Cosumnes Power Plant and a settlement payment of $5.8 million related to the Rancho Seco annual spent fuel settlement, and higher interest income.
