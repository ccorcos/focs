# Retiree & Reason for Exception Request

**Joel Ledesma**  
- Currently Director, Power Generation.  
- Plans to retire from SMUD on May 3, 2024.  
- As the department director, Joel is the most knowledgeable about SMUD’s Power Generation systems and protocols.  
- No other employee would be able to advise SMUD leaders and the Board to the degree needed before the expiration of the 180-day waiting period.  
- Ensures continuity of Power Generation through knowledge capture and consultation services for ongoing implementation of SMUD's Zero Carbon Plan.  

Joel’s availability as an annuitant to provide expert guidance and understanding of the Power Generation function within the Zero Carbon Solutions area is imperative to SMUD operations.
