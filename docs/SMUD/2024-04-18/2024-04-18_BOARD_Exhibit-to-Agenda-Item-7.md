![February 2024 Financial Highlights](https://example.com/image.png)

**February 2024 Financial Highlights**

- **Customer Revenue**  
  $227 Million  
  $3M or 1.4% lower customer revenues than budgeted (unfavorable)  
  • Customer revenue is below target primarily due to lower customer usage from our residential customers  

- **Commodity**  
  $92 Million  
  $16M or 14.5% lower commodity expenditures than budgeted (favorable)  
  • Production costs were under target due to lower fuels costs from the reduction in thermal generation and an increase in hydro generation.  

- **Other Operating Expenses**  
  $159 Million  
  $4M or 2.6% higher expenditures than budgeted (unfavorable)  
  • Public good expenses $2.6M higher due to higher than planned rebate volume in Advanced Home Solutions and building electrification programs.  
  • Transmission and distribution expenses higher due to costs related to storm response  

- **Other Non-Operating Revenues**  
  $68 Million  
  $58M or 620.1% higher than budgeted (favorable)  
  • Primarily due to insurance recovery payment on Cosumnes power plant business interruption insurance claim, Rancho Seco settlement payment and interest income  

**Net Position YTD**  
$47 Million  
• Favorable compared to budget  

*There are $3M other net revenues not included in the highlights above*
