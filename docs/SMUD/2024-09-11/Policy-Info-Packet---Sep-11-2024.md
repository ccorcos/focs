# Board Monitoring Report 2023
## SD-7 Environmental Leadership

1. **Background**

   Environmental leadership is a core value of SMUD. In achieving this directive, SMUD will:
   a. Conduct its business affairs and operations in a sustainable manner by continuously improving pollution prevention, minimizing environmental impacts, including Tribal and other cultural impacts, conserving resources, and promoting equity within SMUD’s diverse communities.
   b. Provide leadership and innovation to improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
   c. Promote the efficient use of energy by our customers.
   d. Advance the electrification of vehicles, buildings, and equipment.
   e. Attract and build partnerships with customers, communities, policy makers, the private sector, and other stakeholders.

2. **Executive Summary**

   SMUD’s focus on environmental leadership is evident in our Enterprise Strategy Pillar II, 2030 Clean Energy Vision and Zero Carbon Plan. It includes transparent reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, natural resource stewardship and our concerted efforts to make all of our communities more sustainable. This report highlights some of the accomplishments SMUD achieved in 2023 to showcase our commitment to environmental leadership.

   SMUD is compliance with the five tenets of SD-7 and successes include making CDP’s (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) “A-List” for tackling climate change. Our efforts are highlighted in the following Appendices: Appendix A (2015-2023 SMUD GHG Emissions Trends), Appendix B (Sustainable Communities Deliverables and Accomplishments To-Date), and Appendix C (List of Acronyms).

3. **Additional Supporting Information**

   **CDP 2030 Clean Energy Vision and Zero Carbon Plan**  
   For decades, SMUD has been a leader in clean energy and carbon reduction. SMUD’s goal to eliminate carbon emissions from our power supply is more ambitious than the already aggressive state mandates and is ahead of virtually all other utilities in the United States. Our 2030 Zero Carbon Plan is a flexible road map to achieve our zero carbon goal while ensuring all customers and communities we serve reap the benefits of decarbonization. Zero carbon emissions bring benefits not only globally, but also locally with reduced GHG emissions, improved local air quality, job creation opportunities, and leadership as we move away from the use of fossil fuels.

   **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions**  
   SMUD is a leader in addressing global climate change and is an active member of The Climate Registry (TCR). SMUD reports its third-party verified GHG emissions to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), TCR and CDP. We also report sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) emissions and GHG emissions from thermal power plants to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

   For 2023, GHG emissions were approximately 1.58 million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent.
<!-- Page 9 -->
![Board Monitoring Report – SD-7, Environmental Leadership](https://example.com/image-url)

**CO2e**. This is a decrease of 503 thousand metric tons from 2022 emissions; a trend going back to 2015 (which was an especially severe drought year) can be found in Appendix A. Fluctuations in total emissions year-to-year are primarily attributable to hydroelectricity production, availability of ACS (Asset Controlling Supplier) low-carbon power and natural gas contract rates. In 2023, we were able to rely on electricity generation from Rancho Seco Solar II and the Geyser geothermal facility which reduced emissions by 400 thousand metric tons. As we bring on new zero-carbon generation projects and continue to purchase greater quantities of zero and lower emissions-intensive power, we expect emissions to decrease. A breakdown of emissions by thermal power plant and power purchases, with comparisons between 2022 and 2023 can be found in Appendix A.

In 2023, we started sharing our quarterly generation and estimated GHG emissions from the gas plants we own, and the power purchased for the Calpine Sutter gas plant, at smud.org. The planned and actual GHG emissions from our fossil fuel generation reflect total emissions to serve SMUD customer energy needs and market sales to support California and other neighboring states. GHG emissions are estimated using 2022 emissions factors, which is the most recent year that the California Air Resources Board (CARB) verified data is available for.

**TCR Climate Registered™ Platinum Status**  
For the fifth year in a row, SMUD was awarded Climate Registered™ Platinum status by TCR, a non-profit organization which designs and operates voluntary and compliance GHG reporting programs. To date, SMUD has submitted over 13 years of verified inventories to TCR. Climate Registered™ Platinum level recognition is the second highest tier that can be achieved which SMUD earned by publicly reporting its third-party verified GHG emissions inventory for its operations in 2022, and by setting and disclosing its ambitious GHG reduction goals. GHG inventory data enables us to track the effectiveness of our climate initiatives and GHG reductions over time.

**CDP**  
SMUD was recognized for our leadership in corporate sustainability by global environmental non-profit CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project), attaining leadership level for 4 straight years and securing an A- on our 2023 disclosure. In our 6th year of disclosing with CDP our score is higher than both the North American regional average of C and the thermal power generation sector average of B. Within our sector (thermal power generation), we’re among the 36% of companies that reached the leadership level (A or A-). SMUD was recognized for our work related to climate impacts, risks and opportunities, and actions to cut carbon emissions, mitigate risks and develop a low-carbon economy. CDP’s annual environmental disclosure and scoring process is widely recognized as the gold standard of corporate environmental transparency.

**Fleet Emissions Reduction and Equipment Electrification**  
Internally, SMUD has been replacing gas/diesel-powered equipment with equivalent electric/battery powered tools where they are available from the market, such as chain saws, trimmers, blowers, and generators. As of 2023, 53% of the equipment is now battery powered. Our goal is to convert 100% of the equipment to battery powered by the end of 2024.

Similarly to tools, SMUD is also focused on reducing emissions generated by our fleet. This is being accomplished through alternative fuel usage, idle reduction and vehicle electrification where the technology is available. Since 2016, SMUD has measured:

1. The 2023 GHG emissions value represents emissions associated with delivering power to SMUD customers and does not include emissions associated with the net wholesales into the market. The 2023 emissions from wholesale power are approximately 0.7932 million metric tons of CO2. 

**GM 24-135**

- GHG Emissions Reduction through Vehicle Electrification, increasing from 1.0 MTCO2e in 2016 to a reduction of 37.5 MTCO2e in 2023.
- Electric vehicle miles driven have increased from 2,462 on 2016 to 135,551 in 2023.
- Total emissions generated from combustion of fossil fuels by the Fleet have also been reduced from 5,553 MTCO2e in 2016 to 4,803 MTCO2e in 2023. Fuel Economy has increased from 7.48MPG in 2016 to 8.82MPG in 2023.

**Sustainable Communities**  
SMUD’s Sustainable Communities program focuses on healthy neighborhood environments, improving education, creating jobs, improving access to transportation and more. We’re committed to improving environmental equity and economic vitality in every community we serve. Special attention is being given to historically under-resourced neighborhoods. Since 2018, SMUD has invested more than $35 million in our Sustainable Communities community-based partnerships and programs, supporting an inclusive and equitable clean energy future. In 2023, Sustainable Communities invested more than $4.4 million into clean energy solutions supporting our customers and communities.

By aligning our Sustainable Communities efforts with the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan, we’re ensuring that all communities in Sacramento share in the benefits of the clean energy transition, including health benefits from improved air quality, new jobs, and resilience to climate change.

In 2019, we created the Sustainable Communities Resource Priorities Map, which analyzes current data to identify the local areas most likely to be under-resourced or in distress due to lack of community development, income, housing, employment opportunities, transportation, medical treatment, nutrition, and clean environment. This map allows SMUD to analyze how various resources and projects can be enhanced to improve equity, incorporating what community members themselves feel is needed to achieve a more equitable energy future. In 2023, the map was updated with new real-time data and metrics to identify neighborhood carbon emissions and tree canopy cover. This 3rd iteration of the map will help inform resource allocation, reduce growing economic disparity in Sacramento County and ensure the benefits of our 2030 Zero Carbon Plan are equitably shared among all communities.

To answer the call for a just and equitable clean energy transition, we developed our Community Impact Plan (CIP) in 2022, magnifying the commitment to make meaningful investments in under-resourced communities to ensure their participation in a clean energy future. Since the launch of our Community Impact Plan, we’ve diversified clean energy programs to make them accessible to more residential customers, created equitable pathways to living wage zero carbon jobs through regional workforce outreach, education and training and focused on investing in the small business community through meaningful and impactful partnerships.

One example partnership is with Soil Born Farms. It is a non-profit farm and education center which empowers youth and adults to participate and promote urban agriculture, sustainable food systems and healthy food education. Through our Shine Awards program, SMUD funded the purchase of an electric tractor which is used to harvest lettuce to feed our region’s children, thanks to the Farm’s partnership with Sacramento City Unified School District Central Kitchen.

**Sacramento Tree Foundation (STF) Sacramento Shade Program**  
In 2023, the STF distributed 11,937 trees as part of its Sacramento Shade program, an increase of 25%. A total of 3,872 trees were planted in Disadvantaged Communities (an 18% increase). The total carbon (stored in biomass and avoided) for these trees is estimated at 49,766.55 metric tons. To better understand issues related to tree planting and care, STF community liaisons actively engage residents to help resolve tree planting impediments.

![Right-of-Way Stewardship Council](https://example.com/image.png)

Right-of-Way Stewardship Council  
The Right-of-Way Stewardship Council (ROWSC), an accreditation program that establishes standards for responsible environmentally sustainable right-of-way vegetation management, re-accredited SMUD with a “Right-of-Way Steward Award” for our sustainable Integrated Vegetation Management on our electric transmission right-of-way systems.

The ROWSC Accreditation program evaluates environmental stewardship standards of excellence for utility vegetation management along rights-of-way (ROW). The goal of the program is to promote and recognize vegetation management industry best practices that maintain and protect grid reliability, safety and provide ecological and natural resource, species and habitat benefits.

**COP 28**  
SMUD Board President Heidi Sanborn and Board Member Brandon Rose joined CEO & General Manager Paul Lau and Chief Legal Officer Laura Lewis in attending COP28 the United Nations Climate Change Conference. It’s the highest decision-making process on climate issues that convenes over 70,000 delegates, including heads of state and world leaders, to build consensus and facilitate progress on climate action among parties, delegates and thousands of non-governmental organizations, companies, youth groups and other stakeholders.

SMUD representatives coordinated with the Sacramento Air Quality Management District and the Climate Registry to attend COP28 as part of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy’s (BCSE) U.S. delegation alongside 35+ other US organizations. During COP28 SMUD joined the Utilities for Net Zero Alliance, which is a global alliance organized by the International Renewable Energy Agency.

**2023 Green Bonds**  
SMUD was recognized by the Climate Bonds Initiative as the first US Issuer of a Certified Bond under the Climate Bond Standard v4 in the Electrical Grids and Storage Sector. Having this designation allows us to target investors that place a premium on Green/Climate Certified bonds and may lower borrowing costs by increasing demand in the marketing of the bonds. Thanks to the work of the Treasury team, we had a very successful offering of our first-ever Climate Certified Green Bonds. In fact, investor demand for our bonds was so strong, it resulted in orders for 4x the amount of bonds we had to sell.

**Power-in-Pollinators Initiative / Biodiversity & Habitat Working Group**  
SMUD is an active member of and co-chaired the Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI) Power-in-Pollinators initiative, which exists to promote and expand pollinator conservation among energy utilities. The partnership shares the latest scientific findings, case studies and tools to assist with the integration of pollinator-friendly practices into utility vegetation, facilities, and land management. SMUD’s efforts to support pollinator habitat span multiple departments including Environmental Services, Power Generation, Vegetation Management, Facilities, Real Estate, Customer & Grid Strategy, Marketing & Communications, Legal, Sustainable Communities and Advanced Energy Solutions which collaborate on both research and operational practices. Past ongoing projects include Sacramento Shade which offers free flowering trees to customers, native plant giveaways at community events, a multi-year ecosystem research project at our Rancho Seco Solar facility, a collaborative transmission right-of-way research project and a Monarch Habitat Assessment for our service territory. Projects undertaken in 2023 include:

- Completed Phase 1 installation of a native plant pollinator garden at SMUD’s Orangevale substation, in coordination with the Cripple Creek trail project;
<!-- Page 12 -->
- Supported installation of SolaBee hives at 4 SMUD locations. The Biodiversity & Habitat Conservation Working Group toured and learned about Sacramento State’s hive operations.
- Created a “Meet the Beekeepers” profile of SMUD employees and one Director which was shared internally and posted publicly at www.smud.org/pollinators.
- Collaborated with the CNPS Sacramento Chapter on 2023 Earth Day native plant giveaway and the use of donated plants at the Orangevale Substation pollinator garden.
- Collaborated with SMUD Tradeshow, Environmental Services and Sustainable Communities teams to purchase 10,000 Central Valley Native Seed packets to give away at SMUD’s 2024 events.
- Began a collaborative project with Eldorado Community Services District for a bike park and pollinator garden within our easement.

**Resource Conservation**  
Our Solano 4 Wind Project consisted of removing 23 old wind turbines from Solano 1 and constructing 19 brand-new, bigger, and more efficient turbines. In an effort to make a greener and cleaner plant, SMUD avoided using landfills for the old turbine blades and kept the metal towers out of scrap yards and waste areas by rehoming them. Most were re-installed at other sites, and some were used for spare parts to fix existing units. Now with new owners at various locations, the old turbines have continued their operational life and are back to providing carbon-free energy. This was a big win for SMUD, our environment, and our planet. All told, that’s more than 3.7 million pounds of material (from the 23 old turbines) that we were able to rehome and keep out of local landfills.

SMUD’s waste diversion rate was 38% in 2023, which is lower than our goal of 75%. However, our total waste amount generated in 2023 was 8,333 tons compared to 12,454 tons in 2022 and our 2023 amount included two new waste streams that had not previously been tracked - wood pole and wet spoils waste. The main driver for the lower 2023 rate was fewer construction and demolition projects, of which 65% of the nonhazardous debris has to be recycled or salvaged for reuse. Additionally, Sacramento experienced unprecedented storms during the winter of 2023, resulting in damage to 450 utility poles. Utility poles cannot be recycled, which added to the overall waste stream.

**Challenges**  
In 2023, challenges associated with meeting the SD-7 goals were related to Zero Carbon Plan projects. As we continue to look for opportunities to build solar projects in Sacramento County and retrofit our existing infrastructure to accommodate the increased load associated with building electrification, electric vehicles, and new development in the downtown Sacramento area, we are encountering new constraints that require increased funding as we try to navigate towards mitigation solutions.

**Recommendation**  
It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD-7, Environmental Leadership.

# Board Monitoring Report 2023
## SD-9, Resource Planning

### 1. Background
It is a core value of SMUD to provide its customers and community with a sustainable power supply using an integrated resource planning process.

A sustainable power supply is one that reduces SMUD's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to serve retail customer load to zero by 2030. Zero GHG emissions will be achieved through investments in energy efficiency, clean distributed energy resources, renewables portfolio standard (RPS) eligible renewables, energy storage, large hydroelectric generation, clean and emissions free fuels, and new technologies and business models. Additionally, SMUD will continue pursuing GHG savings through vehicle, building and equipment electrification.

SMUD shall assure reliability of the system, minimize environmental impacts on land, habitat, water and air quality, including Tribal and other cultural impacts, and maintain competitive rates relative to other California electricity providers.

To guide SMUD in its resource evaluation and investment, the Board sets the following energy supply goal:

| Year            | Greenhouse Gas Emissions (metric tons) |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| 2020            | 2,318,000                              |
| 2030 - beyond   | 0                                      |

In keeping with this policy, SMUD shall also achieve the following:

1. Pursue energy efficiency and electrification to reduce carbon emissions by 365,000 metric tons from buildings and 1,000,000 metric tons from transportation in 2030 (the equivalent of 112,000 single family homes and 288,000 passenger vehicles electrified).
2. Procure renewable resources to meet or exceed the state’s mandate of 33% of SMUD’s retail sales by 2022, 44% by 2024, 52% by 2027, and 60% of its retail sales by 2030 and thereafter, excluding additional renewable energy acquired for certain customer programs.
3. In meeting GHG reduction goals, SMUD shall:
   - i) Emphasize local and regional benefits.
   - ii) Improve equity for under-served communities.
4. Explore, develop, and demonstrate emerging GHG-free technologies and business models.
5. Promote cost effective, clean distributed generation through SMUD programs.

### 2. Executive Summary
As this report demonstrates, SMUD was in compliance with and continued to work towards the key Strategic Direction 9 (SD-9) goals in 2023. Our GHG emissions to meet customer electricity needs were approximately 1,579 thousand metric tons (MT) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) in 2023. Normalized GHG emissions, which represent what our emissions would have been if customer load, hydro, and wind generation were as expected, were 1,805 thousand MT CO₂e. We continued to make progress on our 2030 zero carbon goal through new renewable energy contracts, exploring new emerging clean technologies, compliance with the Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS), and gains in clean energy customer programs, with focuses on our under-served communities.

3. Additional Supporting Information  
SD-9 sets various sustainable power supply goals for our integrated resource plan (IRP) as well as for our customer programs. Our IRP process informs long-term strategic development of programs and generation resources and balances reliability, sustainability, environmental, and customer benefits while achieving SD-9 goals. In 2021, the Board adopted the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan (ZCP) as our IRP and revised our SD-9 targets in line with the plan (for a detailed history of SD-9, see Appendix A). The ZCP is our roadmap to eliminating GHG emissions from our electricity supply by 2030. Our progress related to SD-9 goals and implementation of our ZCP is detailed below and in Appendix C.

A. Greenhouse Gas Emissions  
GHG emissions associated with meeting customer electricity needs were 1,579 thousand MT CO₂e, a 24% decrease relative to 2022 (Table 1). Our main sources of GHG emissions were from our thermal power plants. The primary drivers for the GHG emission reductions in 2023 were increased generation from the UARP hydro fleet due to increased rain and snow in the western United States, new delivery of geothermal energy, and targeted purchases of high-quality renewable energy credits equivalent to approximately 4.5% of retail sales. Normalized GHG emissions were 1,805 thousand MT CO₂e, a 5% increase relative to 2022. See Appendix B for more detail on SMUD’s normalized emissions and how they are calculated.

Table 1: SD-9 GHG Emissions & Near-term Targets  

| Source | Net Power (GWh) | GHG Emissions (Thousand MT CO₂e)¹ |
|--------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Net Generation and Specified Power Purchases | 13,749 | 2,354 |
| Net Wholesale Transactions (un-specified purchases less sales) | -3,313 | -775 |
| GHG Emissions to meet customer load (non-normalized) | 10,436 | 1,579 |
| SMUD Electric Sales, SMUD Usage and System Losses | +83 | |
| Normalization Adjustment for Expected Load | +170 | |
| Normalization Adjustment for Expected Hydro | -27 | |
| Normalized Emissions (estimate) | 1,805 | 0 |

B. Energy Efficiency and Electrification  
SMUD’s energy efficiency and building electrification goals are supported by building electrification rebates and retailer incentives for residential and commercial customers for new construction and retrofit programs. SMUD’s vehicle electrification portfolio includes residential EV charger incentives, dealership incentives, residential outreach, commercial charger incentives, and commercial vehicle incentives. Table 2 shows the progress made by these programs in 2023.

¹ Based on SMUD’s internal accounting and represents the best estimate available. The thermal power plant emissions, SMUD’s largest source of emissions, have been independently verified. Biogenic emissions are excluded as they are part of the natural carbon cycle. Detail on SMUD’s thermal power plant GHG emissions are provided in SD-7.

Vehicle Electrification | 13,837 EVs registered⁵ | 46,233 EVs registered | 147,945 MT CO₂e⁶

C. **Renewable Resources**  
We continue to expand our portfolio of renewable resources to meet state RPS requirements and the needs of the ZCP. Updates on these efforts are provided below.

**California Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)**  
Although our goals are more ambitious than already aggressive state mandates, we continue to implement a renewable energy strategy that fulfills state RPS requirements. Using existing and new RPS eligible renewable generation, we are on-path to achieving our RPS compliance obligation for the 2021 – 2024 compliance period and the next RPS statutory requirement of 44% RPS in 2024. See Appendix B for a detailed discussion of the compliance period obligation.

**Proven Clean Technologies and Zero Emission Resource Development**  
To meet our ZCP 2030 goal, we continue to pursue proven clean technologies, such as wind, geothermal, solar, and energy storage. In 2023, we added 100 MW of geothermal to our portfolio, resulting in an annual portfolio emission reduction of 193 thousand MT CO₂e. Since the adoption of the ZCP in 2021, we have added proven clean technology projects totaling 200 MW of generation and 4 MW of storage. An additional 958 MW of generation and 351 MW of storage are in various stages of planning or development with online dates prior to 2030. Beyond the projects identified in this report, we are regularly reviewing and pursuing new project opportunities. More details are provided in Appendix C.

**Voluntary Renewable Energy Programs**  
We continue to expand our customers’ voluntary renewable program choices and align the programs to our ZCP. In 2023, we delivered a total of 823 GWh (8.1% of retail sales) to customers participating in either Greenergy or SolarShares. Our Greenergy program delivered 501 GWh, which served more than 63 thousand residential and commercial accounts. The SolarShares program for both residential and commercial accounts delivered 322 GWh. Most notably, our residential Neighborhood SolarShares program continued to grow and served 859 participants, a 76% increase from 2022. In addition, Residential SolarShares launched a program specifically for low- and moderate-income customers in December 2023.

D. Emerging GHG-free technologies and business models  
To fully decarbonize our energy supply by 2030 as part of our ZCP, we need to explore, develop, and demonstrate new and emerging clean technologies. Highlights of work completed in this area in 2023 are listed below with additional achievements provided in Appendix C:  

- **Carbon Capture & Storage.** Supported Calpine in pursuing and winning a $270 million grant under the DOE’s Carbon Capture Demonstration Projects Program for the 550 MW Sutter Energy Center in Yuba City. SMUD would buy power from the Sutter Energy Center Carbon Capture project, which would reduce our GHG emissions by over 1 million MT CO₂e annually.  
- **Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES).** Completed construction and commissioning of the first 0.5 MW of 4 MW of planned LDES iron flow battery at the Sacramento Power Academy adjacent to the Hedge Substation.  
- **Connected Clean Power Cities.** Kicked off planning and execution for the multi-year DOE grant-funded Connected Clean Power Cities project to deploy advanced meters, distributed energy resource management system (DERMS) functionality, outage management systems, load control technology, and a Tribal case study.  
- **DER Load Flexibility.** Designed, developed, and began testing phased enhancements to DERMS to integrate DER load flexibility programs with distribution and bulk system operations.  
- **Commercial Demand Side Grid Support.** Launched a program option for commercial customers to participate in CEC’s Demand Side Grid Support program.  
- **Hydrogen Hubs Grant.** Pursued the DOE Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs grant application in collaboration with the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES), resulting in a $1.2 billion award to help advance the California Hydrogen ecosystem. SMUD-proposed projects were placed in Tier 2 as backup to Tier 1 and have not received funding yet.  

E. Local and Regional Benefits and Under-resourced Communities  
Implementation of our ZCP delivered wide-reaching benefits to our community, including expanded workforce development, while focusing on equity in our communities.  

**Community Impact Plan**  
In 2023, we continued to implement the Community Impact Plan, a stakeholder-informed strategy adopted in 2022, which underlines our commitment to making meaningful investments in under-resourced communities to ensure their participation in a clean energy future. Our 2023 Community Impact Plan accomplishments included:  
- **Residential Neighborhood Electrification.** We installed 187 energy efficiency and electrification measures for 61 income-qualified customers in the North Highlands and Strawberry Manor neighborhoods, as part of our Residential Neighborhood Electrification program.  
- **Business District Electrification.** We launched our Business District Electrification program, which includes information and education on SMUD programs, the ZCP, and no-cost energy assessments and customized “energy bundle” recommendations for interested under-resourced commercial customers in prioritized neighborhoods. The recommendations include a combination of lighting, energy efficiency, building electrification and/or EV charging, and can result in 100% funding of approved energy bundle recommendations.

**F. Distributed Generation and Storage**  
SD-9 requires that SMUD develop programs to promote cost effective, clean distributed generation. The following describes progress on these programs in 2023.

**Flexible Demand Programs**  
Our flexible demand programs seek to optimize operation of our customer-partner's equipment and distributed energy resources in a way that balances customer-partner and grid needs by compensating customers for the grid benefits they provide. The following selection of programs have made notable contributions to our load flexibility goals in 2023:  
- **My Energy Optimizer Partner+** program for battery storage (a residential virtual power plant program) launched in August 2023 and enrolled 80 customer batteries resulting in 0.4 MW of load reduction capability.  
- **My Energy Optimizer Partner** program for smart thermostats enrolled over 23,802 devices installed in the homes of 19,510 customers, including 791 on the Critical Peak Pricing rate, with total potential load reduction capacity of 18.6 MW.  
- **Peak Conserve** program for AC load control switches launched in 2023. In the first year, 1,338 devices were installed totaling 1.3 MW of potential load shed capacity.  
- **PowerDirect®**, an automated demand response (ADR) program for commercial customers, achieved a load shed potential of 21.2 MW by the end of 2023.  
- **Time-of-Day rates**, which give the majority of our customers more time on the lower priced non-summer seasonal rate, reduced our annual residential peak load by 131.7 MW, or 7.4%.

**Customer-side Solar and Storage**  
Customer-sited distributed generation and storage continued to expand in 2023. Residential and commercial customers installed 34.8 MW (5,591 systems) of solar PV and 3.1 MW (428 systems) of storage. For more detailed information, see Appendix C.

**4. Challenges**  
Challenges to meeting SD-9 goals in 2023 included ongoing project delays and increased competition for renewable resources. Low-carbon power continued to be scarce and expensive in California and the western United States. Our increased hydro production, growth in renewables, and short-term REC purchases offset these challenges.

**5. Recommendation**  
It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD-9.

**6. Appendices**  
7 Not a comprehensive list of SMUD’s load flexibility programs. Only programs that grew in 2023 are listed here.  
8 Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) is an optional time-based rate. This rate is in addition to the Time-of-Day Rate (5-8 p.m.) and gives customers a discount throughout non-Peak-Event hours in exchange for higher prices during Peak Events.

# Appendix A – SD-9 History
SD-9 was established by our Board in 2004 and provides direction for our ongoing environmental leadership and our IRP process, while balancing financial and customer rate impacts, reliability requirements, and equity. Our strategic directions have evolved as markets, policies, and laws have changed. In December 2008, the Board added sustainable power supply as the overall objective of the IRP process and set a GHG emissions target. In 2018 the Board updated our GHG reduction goals to include a 2040 Net Zero GHG goal. In 2020, our Board adopted a Climate Emergency Resolution that calls on the Board to work towards carbon neutrality by 2030. Also in 2020, the Board adopted carbon-based targets for energy efficiency and building electrification. Board adopted Resolution No. 21-04-04 which updated the SD-9 to align with our ZCP goal of zero GHG emissions in our energy supply by 2030 and included specific goals for GHG reductions from electrification. In our path to zero carbon by 2030, we are focusing on procuring new zero carbon and renewable energy resources, expanding customer programs for energy efficiency and building and transportation electrification, developing new customer programs, investigating emerging zero carbon technologies, and continuing our work to improve equity for our under-resourced communities and enhance the health of our ecosystems. Under SD-9, our goal is more aggressive than California’s planned trajectory, which requires that utilities meet electric demand with at least 60% eligible renewable resources by 2030 and to achieve economywide carbon neutrality by 2045.

# Appendix B – Methodology

## Normalized GHG Emissions
SMUD’s normalized emissions are calculated using a GHG accounting framework that adjusts our carbon emissions to account for the load, hydro generation, and wind generation that is not attributable to SMUD’s actions. At the beginning of the year, a best-estimate forecast is established for load, hydro, and wind generation based upon expected weather and anticipated customer growth. Extreme weather can increase or decrease actual emissions and require a normalization adjustment. For example, extreme drought can decrease hydro generation, increasing the need for generation from renewable resources, and requiring an equivalent reduction to normalized emissions. Normalized emissions therefore more accurately represent what our emissions would have been if there were no unforeseeable external factors. Normalization adjustments to actual GHG emissions in 2023 include:
- An increase to account for lower-than-expected customer load.
- An increase to account for higher-than-expected hydro production.
- A decrease to account for lower-than-expected wind production.

## Renewables Portfolio Standard Compliance Period Obligations
State law requires that SMUD procure renewable generation for at least 60% of retail sales by 2030 as well as achieve interim targets over several compliance periods. The State determines compliance with RPS obligations by compliance period rather than individual year in acknowledgment of the “lumpiness” of new resource additions and to provide some flexibility to utilities. In 2023, renewable generation increased relative to 2022. This was largely due to energy deliveries from the Geysers geothermal project, a full year of operation from the Drew solar project, and purchases of short-term renewable contracts totaling over 1,400 GWhs of renewable.

### Vehicle Electrification

Our goal is to have our vehicle electrification programs reduce transportation GHG emissions by 1,000,000 MT CO₂e in 2030, the equivalent of electrifying 288,000 vehicles (see Table 2 for progress). In 2023, we expanded our residential and commercial transportation electrification programs to accommodate the adoption of electric vehicles (EV) throughout our service territory, with particular attention to under-resourced communities.

The residential Drive Electric program continued to promote the adoption of plug-in EVs through a variety of program offerings, including the residential EV discount rate, SMUD Charge@Home rebates, participation in Ride & Drive educational events, and our engagement and training of local auto dealers. Below are some metrics related to the residential Drive Electric program:

---

GM 24-125  
Board Monitoring Report – SD-9, Resource Planning  
Page 7 of 12
<!-- Page 31 -->
- **EV Rate Credit.** In 2023, approximately 56% of residential EV households, equivalent to 23,329 customers, participated in the EV rate credit (midnight to 6 AM EV charging discount).  
- **Ride & Drive.** Seven EV Ride & Drive events, including two in under-resourced communities, were held throughout our territory and we hosted over 3,100 in-car experiences.  
- **Charge@Home.** We provided residential customers with incentives for 5,045 EV chargers, installations/circuits, and/or circuit sharing devices through the Charge@Home program.  
- **PlugStar Certified Dealers.** We continued to fund local dealer certification as PlugStar certified dealers. Twenty-four dealers are participating in the program, and 146 dealer staff were trained. We additionally completed our fourth EV auto dealership competition to encourage and incentivize EV sales and reward dealerships and their staff for increased EV promotion.  
- **EV Advisor.** We began transitioning from the Plug In America EV Support Program to our own EV Advisor program and provided over 2,000 customers expert one-on-one EV advice and support between August and December. The Plug In America and SMUD EV advice programs together provided this support through over 3,000 SMUD customer inquiries.  
- **Clean Cars for All.** We continued integral support of the Clean Cars for All program in conjunction with SMAQMD. This program provides up to $9,500 toward a new or used PHEV for income-qualified residents living in areas impacted by higher levels of pollution (disadvantaged communities). We installed 11 EV chargers for income-qualified residents through Clean Cars for All in 2023.  
- **Income-Qualified Installations.** We installed 384 EV circuits and 134 EV supply equipment (EVSE) for income-qualified customers to prepare homes for the addition of an EV and a charger.  

**Commercial Installations.** Total commercial EV Program incentives in 2023 included the installation of 368 level II EV chargers, including 33 DC fast chargers.  
**eFuel Services.** Commercial customer offerings were expanded with eFuel Services, which included an eFuel Advisor service. eFuel Advisor helps commercial fleet customers build a fleet electrification plan, including site analysis, charger recommendations, and cost estimates.  
**FAST Grant.** In partnership with Sacramento International Airport (SMF), Sacramento Valley Station, California State University Sacramento, ChargerHelp, and AECOM, we won a FAST (Fast and Available Charging for All Californians) grant from the CEC to deploy DC fast chargers at three strategic locations in Sacramento, enabling increased access to EV charging for ride-share drivers, food delivery drivers, rental car fleets, shared mobility services, and residents. The project will replace aging and obsolete first-generation Level 3 chargers with efficient and reliable DC fast chargers at SMF.

Looking forward, we continue to explore multiple options to procure or develop additional renewable and zero carbon resources, including local solar and storage. Potential projects are thoroughly screened based on cost, project online date, environmental and cultural impacts, and feasibility, to ensure projects meet our specific requirements. We continue to uncover and pursue new project opportunities in support of our 2030 zero carbon goal.

**Emerging GHG Free Technologies and Business Models**

In 2023, we continued to fund research and development efforts as well as pursue grants for clean energy and GHG reduction projects in 2023 and beyond as part of our ZCP. Below are additional projects that we explored in 2023. More information on our research and development work can be found in the 2023 SD-10 Report.

<!-- Page 33 -->
- **Low-carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) Electricity Pathways.** For Van Warmerdam, New Hope and Van Steyn Dairy Digesters, carbon intensities and annual reports were submitted to CARB. The dairy digesters produce low-carbon electricity. To certify that these resources are low-carbon, we track each digester’s carbon intensity and submit this data to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) LCFS program on an annual basis.

- **Hydrogen Blend Collaborative Research.** Continued monitoring and participation with the DOE HyBlend and CEC Targeted Hydrogen Blending grants, aspiring to address the barriers on pipeline blending materials compatibility and degradation related to hydrogen blending into the natural gas pipeline. Resulting data from this project will be used for techno-economic analysis to quantify costs and opportunities of H2 production and blending with natural gas.

- **Thermochemical Conversion of Biomass to Hydrogen.** This project received a $500k award from the Department of Conservation Forest Biomass to Carbon-Negative Biofuels Pilot Program in December 2022 for a PreFEED study, for which work continued in 2023. The project concept is to use waste biomass from clearing the UARP transmission corridor for thermochemical conversion to hydrogen. The duration of this grant execution was extended to the end of September 2024.

- **BestFit Innovative Charging Solutions.** We worked with Ford Pro (who acquired Electriphi, the project lead applicant), in collaboration with other key partners to demonstrate a cost-efficient and grid-friendly pathway for fleet electrification across diverse vehicle types. This project will accelerate vehicle-to-grid, offsetting what would otherwise be a cost to SMUD.

- **Multifamily EV Charging Community.** In December 2023, we were awarded a second grant in the CEC’s Reliable, Equitable, and Accessible Charging for Multi-family Housing grant (GFO-22-614). Through our proven Multifamily program, we proposed to deploy at least 400 private charging ports at multifamily properties and public charging at MF-accredited community partner locations in Sacramento. At least 90% of these will serve CalEnviroScreen 4.0 (CES4) priority populations and income-qualified residents.

- **Agrivoltaics Research.** Continued planning for Agrivoltaics research at SMUD’s proposed Country Acres solar facility with partner UC Davis. Project was presented to the Placer County Agricultural Commission for discussion and feedback. Specific requirements were developed and integrated into the overall project design and the site’s Sustainable Communities plan. Began work on an operational Memorandum of Understanding to guide project implementation. This effort will examine the costs and benefits of the integration of crops and solar electricity production.

**Sustainable Communities & Income-Qualified Programs**

Implementation of our ZCP will deliver wide-reaching benefits to our community while focusing on equity and strengthening our communities. Our Community Impact Plan is a three-year plan to increase energy equity outcomes on our road to zero carbon. These community-driven outcomes are focused on three areas: affordability, equitable access, and community engagement and education. Programs include capacity building for nonprofit organizations, neighborhood and business district electrification for residential and commercial customers, and regional workforce development programs.

- **Building Electrification and Energy Efficiency.** We continued expansion of our existing efforts to provide no-cost energy retrofit installations to income-qualified residential customers for both gas-to-electric conversions and electric-to-electric upgrades. Building Electrification and Energy Efficiency measures related to income-qualified customers are reported previously in Table 4.

- **Transportation Electrification.** SMUD EV programs provided low cost or free EV charging infrastructure for income-qualified customers and expertise on home charging solutions. EV
<!-- Page 34 -->
- **Load Flexibility.** Our portfolio of load flexibility programs support the 2030 zero carbon goal, yet they can sometimes require costly technologies, such as a smart thermostat, EV, or battery storage system to participate. We continued to explore ways in which our load flexibility programs can be more inclusive despite this barrier. In 2023 we installed 36 solar systems, 4 of which included battery storage, so customers could participate in our virtual power plant program. Additionally, our Peak Conserve program offers free installation of AC load control devices to ensure all customers can take part in the clean energy journey.
  
- **Shine Awards.** The Shine Awards program invests in local nonprofit partners that execute inclusive and equitable projects through collaborations and partnerships supporting our historically under-resourced communities. In 2022, 113 organizations submitted applications with compelling and competitive projects to improve access to workforce development trainings, STEM education, electrification and environmental education and stewardship. From the 113 submitted applications, 22 projects totaling $513,663 were awarded in 2023. Projects included energy-efficiency and electrification measures and indoor/outdoor LED lighting resulting in reduced energy bills for these non-profits.

- **Workforce Development.** Our 2023 Regional Workforce Development Career Pathways programs recruited and trained individuals from Sustainable Communities target neighborhoods to work in areas directly impacting our region's ability to meet our 2030 zero carbon goals. Our 2023 training partners included Grid Alternatives, Northern California Construction Training Inc. (NCCT), and Cosumnes River College, whose programs trained our community in skills related to solar, battery, EV, and electrification technologies and supported participants with connected mentoring and employment opportunities, resume writing help, and career coaching. Key work in 2023 involved:
  - Worked to ensure that large-scale infrastructure projects have demonstrable community benefits, and wrote those benefits into several major grant efforts, creating equitable pathways to the employment opportunities.
  - Launched a new Electrician Trainee program with NCCT, which trained 72 people and placed 24 people in jobs leading to careers as electricians. The focus of the program is helping to put more diverse apprentices in the IBEW pipeline.
  - Partnered with Cosumnes River College to offer a new Construction Electrification course that provides enrollees with a stipend to complete 36 hours of lecture and 54 hours of hands-on learning. The focus of the course is on understanding the importance of building electrification and how to install heat pumps, EV chargers, and other supporting electrical infrastructure. Upon graduation, students earn industry relevant certifications along with 3 course units that can be applied to a Construction Pre-Apprenticeship or Construction Management Credential. Fourteen individuals completed the inaugural class in 2023.
  - Through our ongoing partnership with Grid Alternatives, 50 people received solar and electrification training, with 33 participants being placed into jobs.

- **Sustainable Communities Resource Priorities Map.** To deploy comprehensive resources for our communities most in need, we continued to align our region’s investments toward the goal of creating and supporting healthy, vibrant, and economically sustainable neighborhoods. Our Sustainable Communities Resource Priorities Map was updated in 2023 with real-time data and metrics to identify neighborhood carbon emissions and tree canopy cover. This 3rd iteration of the map will help inform resource allocation, reduce growing economic disparity in Sacramento County, and ensure the benefits of our ZCP are shared equitably among all communities.

**Policy No.:** BL-13  
**Title:** Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Grants  

SMUD’s participation in state and federal grants as a prime-recipient or sub-recipient provides a unique opportunity for SMUD to leverage state and federal funds to advance SMUD’s policies, conduct research and development projects, and provide benefits to the Sacramento community. SMUD’s grant participation shall further SMUD’s strategic directives, provide benefits to SMUD’s customers and the community, and shall be consistent with the following principles.

a) **Competitive Advantage:** Because grants are typically competitively awarded, SMUD will select its grant partners or participate on a grant team where the partners provide a competitive advantage in the grant selection process. Time permitting and where practical, SMUD will select qualified grant partners through a formal or informal request for qualifications.

b) **Viable Grant Partners:** SMUD shall only contract with reputable and financially viable grant partners.

c) **Local Grant Partners:** All other things being equal, in selecting grant partners SMUD will generally prefer governmental entities, not-for-profit organizations, and businesses located in the Sacramento region.

d) **Delegation of Authority to the CEO:** The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager (CEO) is delegated authority to select and enter into contracts with grant partners and file grant applications where SMUD’s commitment of financial and in-kind resources is consistent with delegations under other Board-Staff Linkage policies, or is otherwise brought to the Board for approval as a budgeted project.

e) **Reporting:** The CEO shall provide advance notice to the Board of grant commitments that create material financial, reputational, or operational risk.
