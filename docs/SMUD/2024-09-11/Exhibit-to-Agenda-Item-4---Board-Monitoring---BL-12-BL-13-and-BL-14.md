SMUD’s grant participation shall further SMUD’s strategic directives, provide benefits to SMUD’s customers and the community, and shall be consistent with the following principles.

a) **Competitive Advantage:** Because grants are typically competitively awarded, SMUD will select its grant partners or participate on a grant team where the partners provide a competitive advantage in the grant selection process. Time permitting and where practical, SMUD will select qualified grant partners through a formal or informal request for qualifications.

b) **Viable Grant Partners:** SMUD shall only contract with reputable and financially viable grant partners.
