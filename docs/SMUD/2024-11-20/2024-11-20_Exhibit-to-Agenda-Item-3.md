a) **Information CyberSecurity**: SMUD will protect customer, employee and third-party information, and SMUD information technology systems are protected from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

- Be more inclusive of Cybersecurity and Information Management & Compliance functions
- Change “Information Security” to “Cybersecurity” to more accurately describe the scope of responsibilities of the Cybersecurity department
- Removed “information” to allow broader coverage of the technology term, as both IT (Information Technology) and OT (Operational Technology) are to be protected.

c) **Customer Privacy:** SMUD will annually notify customers about the collection, use and dissemination of sensitive and confidential customer information. Except as provided by law or for a business purpose, SMUD will not disseminate sensitive and confidential customer information to a third party for non-SMUD business purposes unless the customer first consents to the release of the information. Where sensitive and confidential information is disseminated for a business purpose, SMUD will ensure: (i) the third party has robust information practices to protect the sensitive and confidential customer or employee information, and (ii) use of the information by the third party is limited to SMUD’s business purpose. SMUD will maintain a process that identifies the business purposes for which SMUD will collect, use and disseminate sensitive and confidential customer and employee information.

- Removal of “Customer” to allow language to more broadly cover employee privacy in addition to customer privacy
- Addition of “and/or employee” where applicable

d) **RecordsInformation Management**: SMUD will maintain the efficient and systematic control of the creation, capture, identification, receipt, maintenance, use, disposition, and destruction of SMUD recordsinformation, in accordance with legal requirements and Board policies.

- Change “Records” to “Information” to more accurately reflect that this function area encompasses not only records but all SMUD Information. This will help prevent any confusion around maintaining the older “records” language.
