# Hatchet Ridge and SunZia Wind Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) Background

- The California Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) mandates and 2030 Zero Carbon goals continues to drive the need for more carbon-free resources.

- In early 2023, SMUD received a competitive offer for the offtake from two wind projects from Pattern Energy, LLC, a leading national independent power producer.

- The offer stipulated that the two PPAs must be approved as a package deal.

- Staff conducted an evaluation of the market and determined these projects provided superior value and solutions compared to available alternatives for meeting RPS mandates and 2030 Zero Carbon goals.
